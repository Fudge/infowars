[00:39.440 --> 00:46.880]  july 14th tuesday edition of the worldwide broadcast as we attempt to alert our fellow
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.000]  humans across the planet to the fact that a scientific dictatorship in the last hundred
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.800]  years has been financed by the world's elite based in europe england and the united states
[00:57.800 --> 01:05.000]  predominantly and that they are carrying out planetary eugenics chemical biological
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.920]  and radiological attacks against all of us on record and that they are now intensifying
[01:13.920 --> 01:20.080]  their programs of soft kill beta testing their operations all the evidence is clear
[01:20.080 --> 01:27.720]  there preparing in the near future for a massive jump point from just soft killing 30 million
[01:27.720 --> 01:33.240]  people in africa a few million in the rest of the world with hiv and other engineered
[01:33.240 --> 01:45.520]  bio weapons to more advanced more degenerative systems that have a faster kill rate now i'm
[01:45.520 --> 01:49.280]  not going to just open the start of the show up of this today though i'm going to cover
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.040]  it in the second hour because i reviewed some of the last few days radio i've done sunday
[01:55.040 --> 01:59.720]  and monday and there's a lot of key points and background i didn't cover and i want to
[01:59.720 --> 02:08.760]  just coldly coldly and matter of factly cover some of the information that we haven't gone
[02:08.760 --> 02:18.640]  over in the second hour today and so in the second hour today i'm going to go over all
[02:18.640 --> 02:33.880]  that information we also have michael shedlock to talk about some of the different organizations
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.040]  and companies and brokerage firms including himself and his organization that track the
[02:39.040 --> 02:46.920]  real unemployment rates the real inflation rates so the global economic analysis head
[02:46.920 --> 02:52.120]  will be joining us coming up in the third hour today and then larry pratt is popping
[02:52.120 --> 02:59.960]  in to give us the latest attacks on the second amendment and judge so to my oars activities
[02:59.960 --> 03:07.680]  you know i watched some of her hearing after today and it was soft more to say the least
[03:07.680 --> 03:14.760]  pure emotion it was all about how all the greatness she'd had as a woman and as a hispanic and
[03:14.760 --> 03:21.240]  about her mommy and her daddy and if you don't like her you're a racist see if i don't want
[03:21.240 --> 03:27.400]  to turn my guns in i'm a racist i don't like hispanics and if i don't want to have a federal
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.600]  government control all hiring and firing and if i think somebody who's hispanic that gets
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.720]  a higher test score than a black person but i think the hispanic person should get the
[03:37.720 --> 03:43.440]  job i'm a racist and if i think a white person that gets a higher test score than hispanic
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.960]  should get the job i'm a racist if i think a white cop gets a better test score than
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.960]  hispanic cop and that he gets passed over promotion and hispanic gets the promotion
[03:52.960 --> 04:02.320]  i'm a racist if i think that's discriminatory if a black man gets a better score than a
[04:02.320 --> 04:10.320]  black woman well if i think the black man should get the job instead of the black woman
[04:10.320 --> 04:16.200]  who made a lower score i'm a racist it's all part of race politics playing us off against
[04:16.200 --> 04:21.840]  each other so we'll talk about the supreme court head who wrote a book in fact i have
[04:21.840 --> 04:25.880]  a copy of it i had it around here somewhere last night i gotta go run around the office
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.040]  and find it i was reading it and don't know where i left it i looked for it for a few
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.600]  minutes before i went on air but i have the quotes where she believes in total gun ban
[04:33.600 --> 04:36.960]  she believes you have no right to keep their arms boy that sounds like a good supreme court
[04:36.960 --> 04:43.160]  justice but see if i don't turn my guns in i am racist this is the soviet style mind

[08:31.720 --> 08:40.840]  war I am Alex Jones this is your wartime broadcast transmission to everybody in occupied territories
[08:40.840 --> 08:47.720]  around the planet under occupied new world order control humanity is waking up humanity
[08:47.720 --> 08:53.240]  is beginning to realize the technocracy that is being built around us the electronic technological
[08:53.240 --> 09:00.240]  enslavement system control grid there is hope we can break the spell of mind control that
[09:00.240 --> 09:06.320]  is over the population the globalist do not have total control over the planet yet they
[09:06.320 --> 09:12.920]  are trying to perfect their tracking and tracing and surveillance and oppression system they
[09:12.920 --> 09:19.640]  are moving very very quickly because they know we are becoming wise to them but as their
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.640]  grid expands as it locks down more and more it will be harder and harder to break free
[09:25.640 --> 09:34.120]  so we should not take for granted the fact that we are on air that we still have youtube
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.160]  that we still have google well they actually shut down google video where you can upload
[09:38.160 --> 09:43.480]  that we still have some internet freedom that we can still have our websites that the governments
[09:43.480 --> 09:48.960]  openly announcing worldwide the planetary government is openly announcing plans to shut
[09:48.960 --> 09:55.120]  down and curtail and restrict and tax and trace the internet we don't have long we've
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.200]  got to fight on multi fronts to keep the internet free and open while understanding the enemies
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.800]  already shutting it down and using it every day that we can to get the word out to the
[10:05.800 --> 10:14.160]  people look they have a bunch of mandatory flu vaccine news all over the newspapers and
[10:14.160 --> 10:18.680]  tv how they are going to forcibly inject the population it's on good morning america it's
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.160]  on fox it's on cnn they are talking about force inoculations for the entire british
[10:23.160 --> 10:31.320]  population entire u.s. population a federally mandated triple shot produced by baxter pharmaceutical
[10:31.320 --> 10:38.480]  who was caught mixing the weaponized bird flu with vaccine in europe there was in vaccine
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.400]  trials but london telegraph and french news agency will not report what vaccine company
[10:44.400 --> 10:49.520]  it was that did the bird flu trials and killed a bunch of people they just say folks died
[10:49.520 --> 10:57.400]  it's all tying into eugenics and i want to break down what i see happening in the next
[10:57.400 --> 11:04.360]  hour so a very important next hour we're going to go to the economy in the third hour and
[11:04.360 --> 11:16.280]  then the second amendment your phone calls and sonia sotomayor
[11:16.280 --> 11:19.320]  and all the other things that are happening in our economy in our society that is coming
[11:19.320 --> 11:24.320]  up but i keep promising myself and i'm going to do a little bit better job by actually
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.880]  getting to your calls and so i'm going to open the transmission up right now with your
[11:29.880 --> 11:35.480]  phone calls let's go to them now on this fourteenth day of july two thousand and nine jeff in texas
[11:35.480 --> 11:42.320]  is first out of the gate jeff hi i want to address this eugenics based school of thought
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.920]  that there's not enough food on the earth to feed our huge population and give an example
[11:47.920 --> 11:53.320]  of how that's false i was doing some research recently on laurence of arabia and how he
[11:53.320 --> 11:59.440]  led the band of better ones across the nephood desert to attack the turkish controlled gulf
[11:59.440 --> 12:06.920]  of akhaba in jordan and while i was researching it i was tracing their steps over google earth
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.720]  and as i panned out looking at the whole saudi arabian subcontinent i was making out these
[12:11.720 --> 12:18.240]  strange patterns and there were huge clusters of these little dots and as i zoomed in at
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.800]  first they looked like black circles and i thought are these like pools of oil so i
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.200]  zoomed in a little closer and there's thousands of these things and they're actually green
[12:28.200 --> 12:33.920]  circles and if you get in closer and closer you'll see that they're green fields fed
[12:33.920 --> 12:41.440]  by these circular radial sprinklers and what they're doing is they have desalination facilities
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.560]  and they're greening israel they're greening jordan they're greening saudi arabia humans
[12:46.560 --> 12:52.680]  actually in many cases in history green areas and develop areas but the globalists know
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.280]  that the earth is doing just fine that's why they're recklessly engaging across species
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.160]  genetic engineering that i believe is an actual threat and a lot of top scientists and geneticists
[13:02.160 --> 13:08.640]  and engineers and genetic engineers have documented that's why they're so reckless it's all about
[13:08.640 --> 13:16.360]  training the public to turn off the survival instinct and what the establishment does with
[13:16.360 --> 13:22.680]  psychological warfare is they take our individual survival instinct and there's only one thing
[13:22.680 --> 13:29.400]  that trumps our individual survival instinct and that is the tribal survival instinct where
[13:29.400 --> 13:35.880]  a warrior or a woman have cornered in that case as well will actually fight to the death
[13:35.880 --> 13:45.640]  willingly and go through great levels of pain and dismemberment before succumbing when they
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.960]  activate the tribal survival mechanisms sectors of the brain the enemy is going in and activating
[13:51.960 --> 13:56.680]  tribal survival mechanisms saying the earth will die humanity will die if we don't have
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.760]  carbon taxes and green police and micromanage every faster than your life that's why they've
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.800]  got history channel and discovery channel and cnn and fox and abc news piece is saying
[14:05.800 --> 14:11.360]  the earth is dying we will all soon die the houston will soon be swallowed by the gulf
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.800]  of mexico we've got to build an emergency dome over houston they put this on the news
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.720]  every week in houston we're all dead global warming is going to release bio weapons it's
[14:20.720 --> 14:24.200]  going to kill everyone so when they really do release the bio weapons folks will think
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.720]  oh we brought on ourselves it's a plague it's god when really it's the elites playing god
[14:29.720 --> 14:34.680]  and they've taken our survival mechanism and turned it in against itself but but i'm sorry
[14:34.680 --> 14:39.520]  we were talking about greening of the earth so i did a little checking on it and it turns
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.720]  out saudi arabia is becoming a net exporter of wheat and barley and not only are they
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.360]  getting their water from uh... the sound is it's the station plan well it's from deep
[14:49.360 --> 14:54.600]  water wells and we're going to work for a little a and they're getting it from moisture
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.360]  evaporators i'm sorry go ahead and we've got import pairs from chile here in texas give
[14:59.360 --> 15:06.440]  me a break was all done by design well said sir i appreciate your call very well said
[15:06.440 --> 15:12.200]  the globalist brag i mean this is public policy that they they pay companies office
[15:12.200 --> 15:20.560]  source they put regulations fines and fees on farmers and ranchers and they set up cartels
[15:20.560 --> 15:30.440]  in the distribution of farm products to where it's economically impossible to have sustainable
[15:30.440 --> 15:39.280]  agriculture in the united states further domestication it's all about shutting you down there's
[15:39.280 --> 15:46.120]  a word for it is the most uh... total form of war it is the oldest form of war it is
[15:46.120 --> 15:59.840]  called see you are under siege siege government is a siege engine to destroy all independence

[17:41.400 --> 17:47.440]  years now i have to confess i woke up to behold the pill horse written by mr bill cooper
[17:47.440 --> 17:55.320]  was eye-opening and as i was backpacking through australia new zealand around that part i met
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.040]  so many people from around the world the international community that is even more
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.440]  awake than a common man here on the street i've made it my personal goal to come back
[18:03.440 --> 18:10.720]  here and inform all these good-hearted well-intentioned rednecks out here you are a missionary all
[18:10.720 --> 18:18.320]  of us are special forces operatives fighting for free humanity under emergency species
[18:18.320 --> 18:24.000]  survival and you've all got to activate immediately in your area and begin deprogramming operations
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.840]  it is life and death situation go ahead yes sir i agree and i've also been unofficially
[18:30.840 --> 18:36.520]  involved with houston truth dot org here in the greater houston area and given the
[18:36.520 --> 18:42.360]  population here the illusion is still alive and well in the houston area as people feel
[18:42.360 --> 18:47.040]  like that everything's still okay they still have a job they're still turning a false profit
[18:47.040 --> 18:52.320]  and nascar still on oh yeah of course you know gotta worry about the restrictor plate
[18:52.320 --> 18:56.800]  instead of learning who is really restricting us and who is it eventually going to keep
[18:56.800 --> 19:02.080]  the food off our plate if we don't wake them up to codex alimentarius how that is snowballing
[19:02.080 --> 19:08.240]  on us animal id premises id yes sir it's scary and when you talk to folks about it they look
[19:08.240 --> 19:14.880]  at you like you have completely been mind-white and that's why that's why the best weapon
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.160]  is in game and terror storm and obama deception just give them a film and say hey baba tell

[24:13.720 --> 24:22.160]  to set up let me give you a little headline of what ties into it this is from fox news
[24:22.160 --> 24:30.320]  today upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies see their food source is going
[24:30.320 --> 24:38.600]  to be us movies like terminator folks the term skynet that's what the eugenics is called
[24:38.600 --> 24:45.920]  for fifty years ago fact more than that if you watch the film made in the thirties out
[24:45.920 --> 24:57.320]  of ht wells book things to come the united nations forces come in and biologically use
[24:57.320 --> 25:05.040]  weapons to kill you and they have their robot forces that mop you up and they many of the
[25:05.040 --> 25:10.480]  actual documents talk about how they're going to feed their robots with our dead bodies
[25:10.480 --> 25:19.840]  oh now it's the pentagon's plan oh oh see you cannot imagine the fathomless evil imagine
[25:19.840 --> 25:25.360]  of those turn in those terminator movies have had the robots feeding themselves with little
[25:25.360 --> 25:33.800]  biological engines off of our dead flesh so they keep going and going till we're all dead
[25:33.800 --> 25:38.520]  the entire military is converting over to robots to drones and then the globalist don't
[25:38.520 --> 25:44.440]  need you anymore military they can just launch their operation they have robots that work
[25:44.440 --> 25:50.680]  on the robots and the big mech factories i know that sounds like two thousand and nine
[25:50.680 --> 25:56.240]  oh it is two thousand nine we're in buck rogers but see we're in this frozen level of technological
[25:56.240 --> 26:02.840]  development all the elite are in the more advanced technological system that suppress
[26:02.840 --> 26:08.280]  from the public via national security going back to wc and we're going to go to andrew

[26:36.520 --> 26:41.280]  houston and they say let's go carry out violence and you just gotta photograph them and put
[26:41.280 --> 26:45.160]  their face on the web the way to handle these operatives is to photograph and pull a camera
[26:45.160 --> 26:49.280]  out say i know you're fed and they'll freak out and run off but you gotta watch them
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.080]  they'll plant drugs on you anything these are immoral anti-american criminals they're
[26:54.080 --> 27:00.600]  equivalent of nazis or soviet agents under Stalin they are complete enemies right well

[27:19.320 --> 27:23.440]  take a photo of them walk out of their car and post it on the web and say this person's
[27:23.440 --> 27:29.600]  a cop and they'll always be a cop or special forces they've been busy pulling iraqi's
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.520]  little kid's teeth out in front of their mommas and raping them with battery acid that's in
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.040]  the army's own report and now they're back here to kill the country we're gonna have
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.360]  to deal with them period all right let's go ahead and take another call here andrew
[27:42.360 --> 27:48.200]  in new york you're on the air go ahead alex i think i know what i like best about you
[27:48.200 --> 27:55.560]  what's that you get people to think for themselves anyway um in relation to the recent decision
[27:55.560 --> 28:00.360]  especially with the supreme court determining that a person does not have the constitutional
[28:00.360 --> 28:06.560]  right to dna testing to prove their innocence as i recall there was about thirty two thousand
[28:06.560 --> 28:13.920]  five hundred at last count from the doj is to prisoners who are asking for the dna testing
[28:13.920 --> 28:21.480]  well yeah they found that a third of people tested on death row or innocent and the government
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.360]  likes to send innocent people to prison it's all part of the fun and i know it's just a
[28:26.360 --> 28:32.400]  completely corrupt bankrupt system run by criminals that since for about three or four
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.400]  years now the doj has had about seven million dollars budgeted specifically for testing
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.920]  those prisoners they won't spend a ton of it not what not one second just on it on
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.520]  a quick side note just for all the listeners out there one of my little hobbies is to stand
[28:50.520 --> 28:57.840]  outside of the state-run prison facility during shift change with a drug dog well you could
[28:57.840 --> 29:01.600]  see how clearly a lot of the guards about thirty percent of them will run off to their
[29:01.600 --> 29:05.400]  vehicle and there'll be a lockdown at the prison because so many guards called in that
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.960]  kind of thing and in the rest of the guards they hate these guys because they know that
[29:10.960 --> 29:17.280]  they're causing a lot of the issues inside the prison because simply like this something
[29:17.280 --> 29:22.320]  will cost you four dollars worth of tobacco they're in prison for hundred dollars you
[29:22.320 --> 29:27.840]  know same thing with all the other things it's a way to doubly enslave these people
[29:27.840 --> 29:31.080]  it's not so much that you're even putting them there but then you're putting them there
[29:31.080 --> 29:36.080]  and then giving the very thing no no we've confirmed in austin the parole officers tell
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.920]  all these homeless people you bring me money you're going back to prison and so that's
[29:40.920 --> 29:44.520]  why they're so aggressively panhandling of course everything goes to the government
[29:44.520 --> 29:51.360]  even the zombie homeless people are there to bring the government the money we're on
[29:51.360 --> 30:01.240]  the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones

[34:11.120 --> 34:17.440]  put drugs and chemicals in the food water in the air to sterilize you eugenics euthanized
[34:17.440 --> 34:24.520]  the old it's all happening but in line of that I thought I'd go over their plan for
[34:24.520 --> 34:28.720]  force flu shots in the fall now I'm not saying they're going to get away with this but they're
[34:28.720 --> 34:32.040]  announcing it's going to be forced and announcing they're going to try to do it in England in
[34:32.040 --> 34:37.320]  the United States three shots it's a new special shot they really care about you want you to
[34:37.320 --> 34:41.600]  take it they also want to sterilize you and publicly say so but so let's just trust them
[34:41.600 --> 34:45.400]  and take it so that is a coming up the next hour and I'm going to continue with your phone
[34:45.400 --> 34:56.320]  calls with a Russell Alexander Steve John and others that are patiently holding the next
[34:56.320 --> 35:02.320]  five six minutes like him to pop in once a month or so Marty shactor owner of Calvin pure
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.600]  subcompany out in beautiful Oakland California they've been organic since before organic
[35:07.600 --> 35:15.360]  was even cool 1947 you can do the math that's 62 years or so started it with his father
[35:15.360 --> 35:19.880]  when he got back from World War two he was in the chemical core and notice that the
[35:19.880 --> 35:26.040]  soaps were no longer available on store shelves made of vegetable and fruit essences it was
[35:26.040 --> 35:34.400]  all suddenly chemical distillates from chemical plants from oil refineries and so they started
[35:34.400 --> 35:39.200]  Calvin pure soap and now 60 plus years later you're actually able to buy it from them for
[35:39.200 --> 35:42.960]  the first time ever to Genesis listeners and they've been advertising here for five years
[35:42.960 --> 35:49.520]  before that it was only two hotels and hospitals and two big institutions because they wanted
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.160]  good soap the folks running things know what real soap is they're the ones that give you
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.160]  chemical weapons is your soap all part of a big joke for them and so I wanted to bring
[35:58.160 --> 36:02.880]  Marty up to tell you a little bit about his refined products and the tote bag the sampler
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.480]  tote bag and you know when I clean under my arms with Calvin bar soap I wash my hair
[36:07.480 --> 36:16.280]  with Calvin shampoo today not even because they're a sponsor because it's the best soap
[36:16.280 --> 36:22.000]  out there I've tried it all it's the best and that's what we use in my house what we
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.160]  wash our clothes with Marty good to have you here with us thank you Alex I love your endorsement
[36:28.160 --> 36:34.120]  that was beautiful well I only push and promote what I believe in God guts and guns and Calvin
[36:34.120 --> 36:40.760]  pure soap that's wonderful I appreciate talking to you and your listeners it's always a joy
[36:40.760 --> 36:47.040]  every month to do that Marty tell us about the tote bag and why people should get a
[36:47.040 --> 36:52.080]  sampler of it well you know there's such a big difference between the detergents that
[36:52.080 --> 36:58.600]  are sold in the supermarket and the soap that we make the old-fashioned soap which doesn't
[36:58.600 --> 37:05.160]  create lint and all the skin problems and all the toxicity the products on the shelf
[37:05.160 --> 37:12.400]  are junk science they're synthetic they're chemicals they don't do the job they're supposed
[37:12.400 --> 37:18.360]  to they deteriorate the clothing they rest out the washing machine we don't do that
[37:18.360 --> 37:25.240]  we're old-fashioned we make soap from the 18th 19th and early 20th century when soap
[37:25.240 --> 37:33.880]  was the most common item sold in the marketplace like like a white king like ivory soap like

[42:06.240 --> 42:10.960]  I went to question dot com I heard about that he could sign a book and I started looking
[42:10.960 --> 42:16.920]  at it it's just like crazy they share charts and everything I've been looking over that
[42:16.920 --> 42:23.440]  book ever since I heard about it the charts and just the whole plan they got in that book
[42:23.440 --> 42:33.040]  is just crazy and this is a proposal government funded policy report written by Bush's one
[42:33.040 --> 42:41.520]  of Bush's top science advisors and co-author by John P. Holdren so it's just like you've
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.880]  got John Kerry and George W. Bush both being related being cousins and being from the same
[42:46.880 --> 42:54.360]  secret fraternity that only has 10 members a year 150 living members or thereabouts and
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.320]  then they magically run against each other in 2002 you've got the two people that co-author
[42:59.320 --> 43:06.080]  a government policy book that's what this is written for as a proposal for policy this
[43:06.080 --> 43:13.920]  is the guy who was the head of Harvard and he writes it with with Bush's science advisor
[43:13.920 --> 43:20.640]  I mean they mean business and what's incredible is newshounds one of the kind of establishment
[43:20.640 --> 43:27.760]  liberal websites came out and basically said that we were making this up and it was right
[43:27.760 --> 43:34.480]  wing propaganda when we just posted the scans and pages and footnotes of his book and we
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.120]  have thousands of other pieces of data and he says global government CPS to take everyone's
[43:39.120 --> 43:46.680]  children for sterilization just poisoning the water food the air he's the same guy on
[43:46.680 --> 43:52.560]  the Associated Press calling for spring aluminum dioxide on us which admittedly gives you Alzheimer's
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.800]  and all sorts of neurodegenerative diseases that's on AP and Reuters and they send me
[43:57.800 --> 44:04.200]  emails and they comment in our story saying we're lying scum and a major website says
[44:04.200 --> 44:10.880]  we are liars and it doesn't exist I mean and I was looking at videos of myself on YouTube
[44:10.880 --> 44:15.160]  just scanning through them real fast reading the comments and they're going Alex Jones
[44:15.160 --> 44:21.880]  is insane this is all lies so it doesn't matter if you go to amazon.com and buy the guys book
[44:21.880 --> 44:27.280]  doesn't matter if we've got it doesn't matter if we post scans of it it doesn't exist just
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.520]  like Al Gore and calling for world government just like they said three years ago the carbon
[44:31.520 --> 44:40.240]  to I had Rothschild on heir to the Rothschild fortune David Rothschild on son of Lord Rothschild
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.680]  and I said your carbon tax is a tax and he said no there's no tax you're a liar and laughed
[44:45.680 --> 44:50.440]  at me and then now they've passed the tax I mean I'm getting emails saying it's not
[44:50.440 --> 44:57.760]  a tax do you understand the willful ignorance simpson yeah I understand it all and he saw
[44:57.760 --> 45:03.880]  all the quotes they have in that book that's all that's in that book is like every other
[45:03.880 --> 45:09.600]  page they just have massive quotes upon quotes and like the end of each page have you saw
[45:09.600 --> 45:15.360]  that I'm gonna be honest with you I became aware of this last Friday I spent several

[47:31.000 --> 47:38.000]  to be the first black president of a major nation right would you tell your people to
[47:38.000 --> 47:44.760]  get on your knees and be rate like a pedophile and be a homosexual and another thing would
[47:44.760 --> 47:51.440]  you tell your people to give them hope would you tell them well kill your children by committing

[48:53.360 --> 48:58.560]  sir yes I wanted to talk to you about the H1N1 virus a lot of people have the misconception
[48:58.560 --> 49:07.280]  of thinking that it's an actual biological earthly virus but what they don't know and
[49:07.280 --> 49:12.600]  they the history books don't say is back in the day there was no such virus that would
[49:12.600 --> 49:17.880]  kill like millions of people all in one shot and then they're giving out three vaccines
[49:17.880 --> 49:23.640]  for that one virus trust them the government has a history of killing troops in blacks
[49:23.640 --> 49:29.360]  in Native Americans and foster children in chemical biological radiological test I think
[49:29.360 --> 49:33.680]  it's totally normal to just trust them and take all the injections I think exactly it's
[49:33.680 --> 49:37.480]  like the mother oh my god are you a racist you're against killing black babies that's
[49:37.480 --> 49:44.600]  racist not even in Canada in Canada you know what's funny is a lot of people are liberal
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.400]  in Canada oh it's in the news they take the Native Americans in Canada and still kill
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.880]  them and if you're going to murdering them you're racist oh you don't want to murder
[49:51.880 --> 50:00.800]  the natives oh my god you're racist the worst part is the the whole team is they they shoot

[50:19.800 --> 50:25.600]  it's so liberal oh it's for the earth and the worst part is you got a mother saying
[50:25.600 --> 50:30.160]  oh my little child just took the three vaccines and he's all right and then you got a little
[50:30.160 --> 50:36.320]  kid a random kid coming on with a big smile on his face thing I feel fine you know I love

[56:57.720 --> 57:01.160]  world order doing something to me when I walk out in a parking lot later down I'm not worried
[57:01.160 --> 57:05.360]  because you know what nothing you can do to me even begins to compare to what you've
[57:05.360 --> 57:10.840]  already done to my psyche knowing I'm in a freak show run by psychopathic killers and
[57:10.840 --> 57:16.200]  I can't even wake up the general public because they're completely brain dead in a coma under
[57:16.200 --> 57:28.160]  mind control from chemicals and television so I got my head screwed on straight folks I'm red blooded
[57:28.160 --> 57:36.720]  I'm red blooded when I see a bunch of pencil neck pointed head know-it-all sicko Nazi control
[57:36.720 --> 57:42.320]  freaks masquerading with their beards and long hair like a bunch of scumbag hippies
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.960]  funded by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the Queen of England and Prince Philip
[57:46.960 --> 57:51.240]  who every time they open their mouths talking about how they want to kill us I get angry
[57:51.240 --> 57:57.320]  and I'm sick of it and I'm telling the military and police and all of you that serve this

[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:25.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones heads up
[1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:34.480]  heads up prison planet dot tv members t minus seven and a half minutes we're gonna start
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:44.400]  simulcasting at prisonplanet dot tv the radio show will then morph into a tv show for prison
[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:47.960]  planet dot tv members on the thing all the prison planet dot tv members continuing with
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:54.600]  open phones today coming up the next segment breakdown some basics on eugenics and vampiric
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:01:04.000]  robots yes you heard me right vampiric robots vampire robots look truth stranger than fiction
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  it's ap it's Reuters it's fox news they gotta fund themselves on your dead bodies that's
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.840]  how they that's how they feed zombie robots i can't handle it god these people were fighting
[1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:21.520]  are so psychopathic so evil they invent new evils every day i mean i would never have
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:26.600]  thought of that they fund themselves on our dead bodies but actually that is the matrix
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:32.360]  and the army report from 68 declassified in january of 2000 which they then admitted that
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:37.360]  the wachowski brothers had seen parts of before it was declassified they i guess the army did
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:43.600]  say we would be batteries in hive tanks and since perception is reality we would all
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:49.040]  be hooked into these group hive tanks and then our own body heat would run the computers
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:56.320]  that would give us rapture like happiness philip k dick you know got raided and had a safe blown
[1:01:56.320 --> 1:02:01.200]  open by the feds because when he wrote about all that the feds flipped out in the 70s and
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.480]  thought he'd been given classified info i've talked to folks very close to the dick estate
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:09.660]  i'll just leave it at that i have a video clip tommy pilotta was telling me about that
[1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:17.040]  a few years ago about talking to dick's daughters and about some of the feds and things and
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:20.440]  why they raided him but but but now we know why because so much of what dick's books
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:26.440]  were about he had just envisioned i'm almost psychically many believe and then that's actually
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:31.760]  what their program was but regardless the government plans to put us all in tanks that's
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.080]  full spectrum dominance you see those tanks and matrix that's a pentagon full spectrum
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.400]  dominance plan because no one can resist them worldwide if we're all in tanks including
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:45.240]  the military hey i know you feel like you just fell into the twilight zone i'm only covering
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:48.280]  what they're saying they're gonna do i mean i'm not even saying they'll get away with
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:52.400]  it these people are nuts i mean when i read fox news headline robots to feed off human
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:58.480]  flesh attack killer robots uh i guess i hadn't seen that government documents before i was
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:02.000]  thinking that's something entirely new i guess it's not it's just instead of keeping you
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:07.440]  in a tank and your body heat feeding them uh they're just gonna kill you and then feed
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:15.640]  on your flesh and it's got a little bio converter that does that you gotta admit that's a very
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:22.280]  liberal thing that's uh it's like david rosschild has a boat boat he sails around the world
[1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:30.040]  on that that's powered by human waste and he's very proud on on tv as he uh gets up
[1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:34.200]  on the toilet and rags how he's doing it see it's all about how we're gonna eat ourselves
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:38.520]  soylent green is made out of people but they're gonna artificially shut off the resources
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:49.840]  to where we're basically forced into that type situation shutting down the resources
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:57.440]  so we will uh take your calls on these subjects and a lot more coming up in fact you know i
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:02.120]  just had this idea to get back into eugenics and there's so many facets you guys print
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:08.560]  me the story that paul wrote about obama's uh science are wants to plan to sterilize
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.720]  people through the water already happening i think that's kind of an important article
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.840]  you know major universities are finding that there's higher levels of hormones in the water
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:24.080]  than even should be from runoff water coming out of aquifers in major cities that isn't
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:33.680]  involved in runoff as it added it's for your own good to save the earth you like living
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:41.800]  in a petri dish you like the egghead chicken necks running everything you like the little
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:47.520]  power trips they're on so this is the revenge of the nerds you think the nerds of the nerds

[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:34.280]  of the western world 100 years ago or 70 years ago or even 50 years ago it is hyper dominant
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:46.800]  today so on a show folks this article right here by paul joseph watson and if you go read
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:55.000]  the story at prisonplanet dot com it is the most detailed out there since we began covering
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.960]  this over the weekend world net daily and even some mainstream newspapers have picked
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:07.920]  up on the story fox news has covered it so have some other national cable tv news networks
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:15.200]  obama's science advisor called for planetary regime to enforce the tablitarian population
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:24.440]  control measures and this is john holdren the science czar over roughly 90% of technological
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:29.080]  and scientific development in the united states and that's really an old number with the feds
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:36.120]  taking over chrysler and gm it's even more but right at 90% of technological research
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:43.080]  at universities and private institutions is federally funded taxpayer money and he wrote
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:48.600]  a policy book he's also been the head of technology for harvard and other institutions he also
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:53.600]  was high level at mit at the time of writing the book and he wrote it with one of george
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:11:01.720]  bush's top science advisors and the book is up on prisonplanet dot com we have much of
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:09.400]  its scanned in and the book is eco science population resources and environment paul
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:17.600]  are earlick one of george bush's top advisors co-wrote it with his wife and h earlick and
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:30.480]  with obama's chief science advisor john p holdren now every claim we make in this detailed
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  18 page article is documented by scans of the pages that are up on the site and every
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:48.080]  claim we make every quote we read we have his actual book now that said i'm all about
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:54.440]  shattering the left right paradigm i'm all about getting past the fact that big offshore
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:12:01.400]  banks control both parties so getting past liberal and conservative debates and realizing
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:07.760]  that both parties are bought and paid for by offshore interest now and perhaps you should
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.320]  link to this story paul watson's got it up on prisonplanet dot com he wrote a story about
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:19.640]  supposed left wing website newshounds attacked us said it was all a right wing made up figment
[1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:23.840]  of our imagination that we have no proof and then linked to prisonplanet dot com and called
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:32.920]  us black helicopter cooks now this is an example of mind control do the folks over at these
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:37.400]  liberal sites not just newshounds that are attacking us do they really believe what they're
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:45.400]  saying i mean we scan the book we have the book we're nonpartisan we're known for being
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:50.520]  nonpartisan i cut my teeth going after clinton as a globalist that for george w bush and
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:57.160]  after barack h obama these guys are just puppets we spend all day every day explaining they're
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:04.160]  just frontman who read off teleprompters and we explain how you've always got to make it
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:07.360]  left wing or right wing the right wing when they're out of power gets to blame the whole
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:11.800]  system on the left on the left side of power they blame on the right wing when both parties
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:19.280]  are two wings on the same bird of prey known as the globalist the scientific dictatorship
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:34.840]  so there's this issue of denial now john p holdren is obama's appointee but congress
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:44.720]  and george w bush in the last eight years had his co-author as one of their chief advisors
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:49.600]  and we said that in the article we've said that in our other articles we wrote another
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:55.520]  article yesterday with his own quotes and this is a policy report to academia and government
[1:13:55.520 --> 1:14:02.560]  a textbook a plan a program that we see mirrored in united nations biological diversity assessment
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:13.200]  passes you in law 1996 state of part memorandum 200 cia memorandum 200 declassified 92 made
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:19.640]  us official policy of the executive in 1973 i just sourced it for you saying they use
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:26.400]  war famine sterilization all of this to reduce world's population i mean whether you're
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:33.320]  for this or against it you should know this is going on i mean i keep going back to this
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:38.600]  article their scores of these and i played you the abc news club a few days ago where
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:44.040]  they said oh the world's elite warren buffett and ted turner and bill gates and they've
[1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:50.640]  given over 130 something billion they all met in secret and they discussed how they
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:55.280]  want to help the poor and then the group actually rockefeller university that ran the meeting

[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:50.600]  this doesn't exist doesn't stop it from being real perception is not reality you can be
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:55.480]  wearing a virtual reality helmet that shows that you're walking on clouds and that there's
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:17:00.920]  bluebirds flying past you and angels playing harps but if you walk off a 500 foot cliff
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:06.000]  and fall onto spikes below you're going to die you can be wearing the virtual reality
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:13.280]  headset and that's what this mainstream media and all this culture is is a false projection
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:20.440]  of what reality is that sedan has wmd's and that 19 hijackers from a cave made norad stand
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:26.760]  down and carried out 911 and magic passports in shanksville pennsylvania and in new york
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:37.160]  fell from the sky unburned and were found that's false reality that mercury is good

[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:01.640]  in fact i might even get to them later i want to i i i do want to play a short clip though
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:08.280]  of msnbc with bayer pharmaceutical knowingly shipping out over a million injections of factor
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:12.840]  eight blood drug knowing all of the shots at hiv and hepatitis and then would kill everybody
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:17.320]  that took it and their own documents came out in court cases that they knew it and did it
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:22.280]  not because they wanted money it was because they wanted to kill hemophiliacs bayer is a
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:31.400]  nazi company so is ig farman i assure you world war two existed i assure you hitler existed
[1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:36.520]  i assure newshounds that this isn't a joke you know people always make fun of the germans
[1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:41.960]  who didn't believe that hitler had death camps and that's why the generals made the germans
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:45.560]  pilot the dead bodies themselves and burn them the local towns folks who were in denial
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:53.240]  i i i believe that they didn't think it was going on i mean cps here in austin
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:57.400]  kidnaps hundreds of children every week and takes them to facilities where they admittedly
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:01.560]  rape them and they're five to seven times were likely to be abused and it comes out in the news
[1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:05.240]  all over the country pedophiles run these facilities and no one gets in trouble and and
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:11.560]  the general public's in denial about that i mean you've got rape camps i mean half the
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:15.800]  prisons around austin have been shut down and new companies have gotten the contracts because they
[1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:19.240]  they they film porno movies raping the kids and women at them
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:26.280]  they'll be a blurb in the newspaper about it i mean we're living in the middle of a nightmare
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:32.200]  but it's been incrementally kind of a background noise of tyranny and death and genocide and
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:39.400]  soft kill weapons slowly being turned up to now it's at a just a huge bellowing cacophony

[1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:57.640]  books written by people like holgren eco science population resources and environment if i was an
[1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:05.640]  animal written by his royal highness the duke of edinburgh books written by jacuzzo books written by
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:11.320]  ted turner statements by ted turner saying kill 80 percent of the useless feeders statements by

[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:34.120]  bible and that he hails the united states his true source of uh encouragement we get all the credit
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:39.720]  and i just want to tell newshounds and others attacking me hitler existed even if you say you
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:46.920]  didn't what hitler did existed and giggling yuppie smirking about this doesn't change it
[1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:55.560]  okay there's just a few of the sources uh paul watson's 18 page report also the other report
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:27:00.440]  obama science our plan to sterilize population through water supply already happening we'll
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:08.920]  put that up on screen for you as well here at prison planet dot tv here are some of the
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:15.320]  notes i wrote before i went on air just just areas i want to discuss dealing with this history the
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:21.880]  flu the force flu shots how that ties into that how we're under a micro scope how we're basically
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:27.000]  lab rats in this controlled engineered society under the globalist control how it's a scientific
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:34.200]  dictatorship some of the top global planners that have been openly talking about killing
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:39.000]  the majority of us that have gotten attention how this is so horrible people have trouble
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.200]  facing it and dealing with it and the mindset of the elites and how in their own internal
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:50.040]  documents this is nothing to do with the environment the earth they want a manageable
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:54.600]  group of people to deal with and it's all part of being the priest of power deciding who lives and
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:59.320]  who dies and exterminating the majority of the world population including the most intelligent
[1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:04.760]  unless you're part of the elite families you are dead you are to be hunted down and killed
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:11.400]  so we will go through all this in the long segment coming up
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:20.040]  up but i do want to direct everybody to the quotes of john p holdren in his government
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:26.600]  textbook forcibly and unknowingly sterilizing the entire population batting infertility drugs
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:32.840]  legalizing compulsory abortions i forced abortions carried out against the will of the
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:38.120]  pregnant women as is commonplace in communist china which is funded by the u s to do this
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:44.840]  where women who have already had one child and refused to abort the second or kidnapped off
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:50.040]  the street by the authorities before a procedure is carried out to forcibly abort the baby babies
[1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:54.760]  are then many times actually kept alive and sold for medical experiments then killed people worry
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:29:01.000]  about them killing monkeys and apes hell they're got babies baby remember hitler also thanks in
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:06.040]  his speeches and books in mind comp the united states for the concentration camp plan adopted
[1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:10.840]  from the british of putting people in camps and starving into death and using bio weapon attacks
[1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:15.880]  holdren's also part of the pug wash society set up by nobel prize winning eugenicist
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:23.240]  barter and russell where he says we can't nuke countries when they hit us with bio weapons
[1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:27.000]  because the bio attacks will actually be good to reduce our numbers because they're planning to
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.720]  release bio weapons claim a third world country did it and they don't want to have a nuclear war
[1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:35.400]  that might actually hurt the elite so they're getting you ready for your death
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:40.120]  and dr peonka i have him here in the quotes when he got questioned about wanting to kill 90% of us
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:48.120]  with airborne Ebola in 1996 he said well yes and me and my family are ready to die too we're ready

[1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:16.520]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:20.920]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:25.720]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially
[1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:29.960]  with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm
[1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:34.120]  season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:39.000]  outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:43.560]  mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science
[1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:50.120]  a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:19.160]  we're here live all right let me continue getting through the news eugenics and i'm gonna get into
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:23.800]  more of the scientific angles of it and there are larger plans here in a moment but eugenics
[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:30.760]  is also about propagandizing the public to hate themselves to think that the development is bad
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:36.840]  private property is bad under eugenics the family is bad because you owe allegiance to your family
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:42.440]  you'll stand up for your family not to the state and we posted scores of textbook links
[1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:46.840]  and articles where they say the family's a disease the family's got to be eradicated
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:50.920]  all families are mentally ill and you look at the communist chinese model where they're
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:56.360]  basically eradicating the family here's just the last few days without even looking where
[1:33:56.360 --> 1:34:03.240]  they're demonizing the family does having children make you unhappy this is out of the new york times
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:11.800]  and it says children are basically bad when you read the article it quotes the journal of
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:18.280]  british psychological association saying the family is basically not good and is terrible
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:21.880]  now i randomly just picked up an Atlantic monthly last weekend
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:27.160]  half the magazine is global warming tax propaganda and world government tax propaganda we covered
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:35.160]  that a few days ago but on page 116 let's call the whole thing off this author is ending her
[1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:42.600]  marriage it isn't isn't it time you did the same and it says marriage is bad and sucks and
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:50.040]  family's bad i mean these people are sick so they've always wanted to tear down family
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:56.040]  they want to get you cornered by yourself so when they euthanize your butt nobody's there to
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:02.280]  stand up for you okay and then look half the pages here's an oil company supporting global
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:07.880]  greenhouse taxes dutch royal shell and i mean it's literally half the magazine it is just
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:13.480]  unspeakable propaganda and then they've got an article in here about how they want to chemtrail
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:26.680]  the public and who is proposing that obama's climate czar is taking his orders from mr
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:32.200]  holdren john p holdren the guy calling for the eugenics and by the way people say oh well he wrote
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:36.520]  that textbook a long time ago calling for exterminating the majority of the population sterilizing
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:42.760]  everybody he wrote that a long time ago here he is in a mainstream news interview with displaying
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:50.600]  the book in his office proudly eco science on the wall right there there's the book
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:58.120]  it's just so sick and again here's the wall street journal saying terraform things
[1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:08.120]  and who's the guy that says this him holdren holdren is now saying oh we're going to spray
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.200]  aluminum dioxide on you manipulate the weather to save the earth and then all these scientists
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:15.880]  go wait a minute that causes brain damage and then by the way they're already been doing this program
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:24.840]  for decades and then same article in here it's just everywhere we are swimming in it don't have
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:31.000]  kids don't have a family family's bad go out and party take drugs have a good time now
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:41.240]  look at this article this is how to fox news what does this have to do with eugenics
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:47.560]  i'm going to explain it all to you in a moment it is the key upcoming military robot could feed on
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:54.840]  dead bodies shouldn't the headline be vampire robot to to power itself on human flesh
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:06.520]  intergenetically autonomous tactical robot or the eater what a nice name the eater
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:12.200]  can make a nice horror movie called eaters with the robots that you'll feed off human flesh
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:20.280]  that's fox news it's also in the associated press what does that have to do with this little
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:29.080]  article out of the bbc foot and mouth vile went missing oh that's a photo of thousands of dead
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:38.680]  cows burning in apocalyptic fashion with their legs sticking up in the flames smoking what does
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:48.040]  that have to do with the headlines today about how they're preparing for forced inoculations
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:51.720]  of the american people and the british people and this doesn't mean they'll get away with it but
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:58.440]  they're on abc news foxing and we played the clubs saying force compulsory injections are coming
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:08.360]  let's all this tie together with eugenics well i was reading to you holdren obama science advisor
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:12.120]  called for planetary regime to enforce totalitarian population control measures
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:16.920]  babies who are born out of wedlock or teenage mothers to be forcibly taken away from their
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:21.480]  mother by the government and put it up for adoption another purport purported measure
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:24.920]  would force single mothers to demonstrate to the government that they can care for their
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:29.560]  child effectively introducing licensing to have children a calls for licensing of children
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:33.720]  actually in here and they talk about hunting down of course they're already hunting down christian
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:39.160]  families and grabbing their their kids at home school implement a system of involuntary birth
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:43.640]  control where both men and women would be mandated to have an infertility device implanted in their
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:49.000]  body permanently sterilizing people with the authorities deemed who have been to have too
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.920]  many children formally passing a law that criminalizes having more than two children similar to the
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:58.920]  one-child policy in communist china they already demonize on the news families that have more than
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:05.240]  one kid in fact i have the newscast on fox news saying having one more than one kid's bad for
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:11.640]  the earth shouldn't do it in fact google for folks on screen right now having more than one child
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:20.440]  bad for earth or babies have bad carbon footprint or tax children for carbon footprint this is a
[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:26.920]  tax on human activity on the two and a half pounds of co2 you put off a day that plants breathe
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:32.120]  see they're not putting a tax on cross species genetic engineering that's very dangerous to the
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:36.280]  environment they're not putting taxes on toxic waste being dumped in the ocean they're not putting
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:42.440]  no no this is a tax on what you exhale brother and their own government documents call it a
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:48.120]  tax on breathing to end the industrial system there'll only be technology in government
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:55.160]  technological reservations of highly advanced technology we won't even have access to including
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:40:01.160]  life extension there's the times of london having large families is an eco crime here let's show
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:13.480]  people another one great job guys print print this one environment chief uh british environment
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:20.120]  chief says reduce british population to 30 million he wants it forcibly cut in half and that means
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:25.800]  euthanasia sterilization and the they've done university studies watson wrote about it obama
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:30.680]  science advisor plan to sterilize population the water supply already happening they're already
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:36.600]  adding it to the water well water that cities pump out magically ends up with these chemicals in it
[1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:40.440]  they're adding this is confirmed it's happening right here in austin as well
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:50.840]  well now i have the same headline out of canada the same headline out of australia and the
[1:40:50.840 --> 1:40:56.120]  same headline out of the us environment chief says we have to cut the us population by half
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:00.520]  environment minister in australia says we got to cut australian population in half new zealand
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:05.160]  environment ministers say they've got to cut the population in half the same week every
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:12.600]  environment minister from caro egypt to england to scotland to ireland to canada and the us
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:18.200]  every major nation under imf world bank control came out with the headline uc
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:24.200]  uk population must fall to 30 million says environment chief one of gordon brown's
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:28.520]  leading green advisors is to warn britain must drastically reduce his population see
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:35.720]  to build a sustainable society from 60 million to 30 million
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:41.960]  now already with the government programming the british population is dropping by near half
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:53.080]  the indiginas britains have a 1.1 population replacement rate england overall has a 1.4
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:59.400]  for every mommy and daddy they have 1.4 kids and that's counting the hundreds of thousands
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:05.640]  of legal and illegal aliens brought in yearly that are now counted as domestic births england
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:11.080]  is now approaching total collapse you know what happens when you only start having one child for
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:15.960]  every parent within a generation your population is cut in half and then it's almost impossible to
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:23.640]  start breeding back to the last levels the eugenicists nazis are actually targeting anglo sacksons
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:30.520]  and germanic tribes and also jews they always pay to kill jews for some reason the u.s paid israel
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:37.560]  to radiate 110 000 sephardic jews the brown jews so you have to understand this eugenic society is
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:43.960]  jews involved nazis involved the chinese publicly signed treaties to carry out the
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:51.480]  one child policy under state apartment random 200 to get the imf world bank money india signed deals
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:43:00.680]  oh you don't believe me just google this for them then uh do peru or india signed deal with imf world
[1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:08.280]  bank to reduce population or india signed deal to reduce population and you can read the headlines
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:12.120]  going back 30 years and they just grab women off the street and say we're sterilizing you
[1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:19.240]  yeah we gotta get that cash and the politicians get to keep some of that cash themselves for hard
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:24.680]  cash for nothing but paper printed up by the new world order out of nothing
[1:43:25.960 --> 1:43:32.600]  these people will sell their own soul oh but again we shouldn't be talking about all this here
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:40.600]  we should be talking about michael jackson how that's important see folks
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.520]  their propaganda is everywhere their eugenics propaganda they're now selling us and they're
[1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:52.520]  already putting it in your water and your food and your vaccines and for all of you out there
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:58.440]  that serve this system and believe in this system and like this system
[1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:03.000]  for all of you out there who are into this
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:10.440]  you are being attacked as well that's the most important point i could make now
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:19.800]  let me continue to go over this the history and i'm just gonna be brief about this there it is
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:24.440]  forced sterilization in peru committee on women population and environment
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:30.360]  that's a non-governmental union organization right there telling you about it
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:38.280]  yeah you can pull the name of any country nigeria brazil the united states pull up forced
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:43.640]  sterilization of women in the united states it's still going on by the way they drug these women
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:48.120]  up out of their minds they do thousands of them a month still and then they say oh sign a form we
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:52.600]  can sterilize you then we'll let you go then they tie our tubes and throw her back out on the street
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:57.720]  and again they've got their excuses oh this is white trash or you know this is a poor black lady
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:02.840]  they deserve it it's the precedent it sets folks and they're doing it to you so get yourself a
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:07.720]  big glass of tap water and just i love being self-medicated and all the other health problems it
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:17.480]  gives you and this is the stuff we know they're doing so the history of this is 150 years ago
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:23.560]  sir galtin and others in england developed this plan of eugenics by the turn of the last century
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:28.680]  109 years ago it was adopted the rockefeller family the rothschild family and the saxcoburg
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:33.400]  gothis the elites had always believed in breeding and genetics and that and that their bloodlines
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:38.200]  were best even before they had the term genetics you know kings and queens intermarrying interbreeding
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:44.440]  believing they had the royal bloodline i sure you kings and queens exist now that's the history
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:49.080]  of it they then love the scientists that told them you're the elites you're the god race you're the
[1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:54.600]  best these are all inferior we've got a column many other societies had done that the israelites had
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:59.800]  called their enemies when they came into israel the babelonians would call their enemies uh when
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:05.080]  they finally beat hanibal the romans they called and killed whole cities uh julius cesar in the
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:11.400]  battle for gall talks about wiping out whole groups very old ancient human instinct total war
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:17.640]  to kill all your enemies and so they cold bloodedly decided we will create an environmental movement
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:21.960]  110 years ago set up by john d rockefeller he coined the term environmental movement and
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:27.080]  conservation nothing to do with it was all about stealing land and property they then set up eugenics
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:31.960]  by 1910 they were already killing babies out of the womb the doctor would come and kill the
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:37.960]  baby the poor person's baby by the 1920s we made less than a b plus uh you were taken and sterilized
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:43.400]  hundreds of thousands a year that's all mainstream news i have the news reels announcing how good it
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:48.520]  is the government paid for news reels are in my film saying how great it is in game that this is
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:54.280]  us government before the movies and before they had tv they would show newscast before the movies
[1:46:54.280 --> 1:47:00.600]  it's in here how they're killing you and then hitler went a little too quick and it kind of
[1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:06.680]  freaked people out when they saw the piles of dead bodies and so julian hoxley and uh bertrand
[1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:13.160]  russell and the and the king of england and others all met and said we've got to figure out a way
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:17.880]  to sell people on doing this where they like it and they said well mr rockefeller has the plan
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:22.680]  of environmentalism we'll teach them humans are bad teach them we're overpopulated teach them we're
[1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:29.240]  all going to die if we don't do this now they have all the dramas and tv shows and dystopic
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:35.480]  science fiction movies where they tell you this and so they take your survival instinct and turn
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:40.600]  it against itself and say we've got to get rid of humans or we're all going to die and they have
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:47.400]  these situational ethics games uh like survivor on tv but that's a bigger model of lifeboat or
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:53.560]  spaceship it's a game that public schools nationwide teach in the uh fifth sixth and seventh grade i
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:58.280]  was indoctrinated in government programming myself and they say there's a lifeboat it's a federal
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:03.000]  grant and there's only enough food for five people but there's 10 and so we're going to have to vote
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  on who dies so they don't teach you to get outside the box figure out how to survive put up a plastic
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:15.880]  sale to collect rainwater uh or you know things like that they just teach you somebody's going to
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:21.880]  have to die so it teaches you to think through solutions by killing fellow humans and then in
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:28.200]  the game they go we need a social worker we need a doctor we need a bureaucrat but uh they're taught
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:36.440]  that the artist dies and the antisocial person dies and uh and and then sometime in the class
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:41.080]  they teach us at university as well someone resists being killed and then they have someone who plays
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:46.040]  the part of a policeman who kills you so your children are being simulated to murder you
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:50.360]  and we're being simulated to take our old people and get rid of them it's all murder death kill
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:56.680]  basic programming hope you enjoy it they now have more hardcore soviet reeducation camp
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:49:00.760]  where every major public school in the country i've seen in elementary school normally fourth
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:05.080]  grade third to fourth grade they run in with police and in camo saying i'm home schoolers
[1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:10.120]  for the second amendment here to kill you that's ap don't believe me and they scream we're home
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:14.440]  schoolers when we're going to murder you and then the parents always freak out because they're not
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:18.920]  told the kids aren't told it's real they defecate on themselves go into catatonic states are brain
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:24.200]  damaged and mentally ill for decades afterwards in many cases and the federal grant is to create

[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  mentally ill so that's a hardcore soviet reeducation camp similar to uh type programming that the uh
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:40.520]  that the uh north koreans would engage in yet it's all just incredibly hardcore
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:46.440]  and remember times of london billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation now

[1:54:03.880 --> 1:54:24.120]  life has always been cheap there's lots of human beings there's lots of slaves
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:31.320]  but now life isn't just cheap it's seen as a negative the elite don't want us there's too
[1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:36.600]  many of us we're gobbling up environment and things they want because they're control freaks
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:40.440]  they want us to get out of the way they want us to die
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:50.200]  and i say to the elite how about if you think things are over popular how about you get rid
[1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:54.760]  of yourselves first how about you go first how about you lead by example but most of them
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:54:59.640]  say oh no we have to be guardians of this we have to help get rid of the humans
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:04.600]  that are parasites many of them say we're just parasites period and all of us do need to be killed
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:08.520]  and dr eric pionka at ut who said kill 90 percent of us and get standing ovations
[1:55:09.960 --> 1:55:13.480]  showing the majority of scientists at these events that the news is covered supporting
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:18.920]  he was in the news saying yeah i know my family's gonna have to die and gonna have to go as well
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:23.080]  and i'm sad about it but it's for the earth when the time comes
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:30.040]  and then he's on the official university of texas website dressed up in a druid outfit
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:38.440]  talking about lucifer you cannot make this stuff up google dr eric pionka lucifer and you'll
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:42.440]  be on the ut website with him in a druid outfit when he's not talking about he wants to kill
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:48.600]  everybody he's talking about lucifer now here's fox news upcoming military robot
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:54.600]  could feed on human dead bodies now this is what bill joy owner of sun micro systems billionaire
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:56:03.800]  said in 1999 or was it the 2000 april issue of wired magazine why the future doesn't need us
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.760]  was the article and he said the elite said there's too many of us they don't need us anymore for
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:14.920]  factories or agriculture they have robotics soon robotic lines will be repairing robotic
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:20.200]  manufacturing lines the military will convert this to stealth aircraft that are remote controlled
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:25.720]  and that are ai controlled and there'll be factories that service the aircraft that are
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:30.440]  going to be robotic and there'll be very limited groups of humans that are needed and the military
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:34.760]  is going to convert to robots and i've talked to troops 10 years ago they have super advanced
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:40.520]  robots not just the swords they've already used to kill people in iraq well here's fox news
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:46.600]  upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies see the eugenicists are very macabre very very sick
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:54.360]  people and army reports in 68 said they would use humans to fuel their robotic system i'm not the
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:58.520]  one saying this i know it's crazy i'm not the crazy one i'm just reporting fox news here
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:04.120]  and it says robotic technology inks i want this i want that group on tell the producer
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:12.360]  energetically autonomous technical robot called the eater can fight ingest and extract energy
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:17.640]  from biomass the environment and other organically based energy sources as well as use conventional
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:24.040]  and alternative fuels such as gasoline heavy fuel kerosene diesel propane coal cooking oil
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:30.280]  solar when sustainable reads the company's website see they the elite want hunter killers and they've
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:37.000]  said this they're just gonna turn loose and so when you see a movie like terminator i read
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:43.640]  government documents from the 50s calling their robot drone system skynet i was in a private
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:47.720]  meeting with dr bob bowman lieutenant colonel bob bowman who was the former head of star wars
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.280]  and he talked about the robotic fleet with me but said i can only talk about what had been
[1:57:52.280 --> 1:57:58.360]  declassified and what nsa and others and other people involved with star wars had accidentally
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:04.120]  in speeches on c span let's slip up but that there yeah there's an entire robotic drone fleet in orbit
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:13.880]  that's got a du meteor guns basically a meteor well weapons to decapitate the leadership
[1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:21.560]  the point is everything's going to a robotic fleet that that's then robotically controlled
[1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:27.080]  not human piloted and that is robotically serviced and folks they're about 10 years away from this
[1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:31.320]  and that way they can launch terror attacks blaming on others and the military refuses to
[1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:37.240]  have the drone aircraft takeoff with the nerve gas to kill every major city the elite can just
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:47.880]  order this and sit back and watch it happen thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:29.000]  i didn't finish my breakdown on eugenics i wanted to get into the forced flu vaccinations
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:32.360]  that the british and u.s governments are saying they're gonna force from the public
[2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:36.840]  in the fall i'm not saying they'll be successful later the newer times will say jones and they
[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:41.640]  were gonna forcibly inject us no i'm quoting abc news fox news you've all seen it where
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:47.960]  they're saying they're gonna make us take it over my dead body but uh that ties into the eugenics
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:52.280]  i want to get more into that get into the planetary government they want to set up to
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:57.640]  carry out these eugenics kind of part two of what i covered in the last hour coming up in 30 minutes
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:02.520]  when our next guest leaves us so i'd ask the folks at the alex jones channel on youtube and others
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:06.200]  to be sure and get the report coming up in 30 minutes and combine it with the last hour
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:10.360]  because i wanted to all be congruent where i left off with the hunter killer robots
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:15.800]  being reported in fox news that that kill you and eat you to fuel themselves to go on to kill
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:21.160]  the next group and this is the perfect environmental eugenicist killing system which of course we've
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:26.040]  broken down they would use against us now it's mainstream news no longer classified as crazy
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:32.520]  as it sounds truth is stranger than fiction uh but of the next 30 minutes uh michael shedlock
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:41.000]  michael shedlock dot com and uh we appreciate him coming on with us uh he's with sit cup pacific
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:46.680]  capital management i've seen him on international television cnn bloomberg you name it really breaking
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:52.360]  down a lot of facts i've had a lot of the economists the economic experts we've had on have sourced
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:57.400]  some of his research so to kind of break down are we in a depression are we in a recession
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:04.520]  is it inflation is it uh depression on main street is it hyper stag inflation you know some things
[2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:09.000]  are going down in price other things are spiking the government's cooking cpi they're cooking
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:17.720]  uh unemployment they're cooking inflation he's an expert on that and uh he joins us uh now for
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:22.200]  the next 30 minutes michael i appreciate you coming on to break down the economy with us oh
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:27.800]  sure it's a pleasure to be on the show and the amount of misinformation coming out from wall
[2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:33.720]  street from the fed from the obama administration from the bush administration prior to that is
[2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:40.600]  absolutely just staggering uh it's important to realize that the fed's first mission is always to
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:48.040]  do delay confuse hope and attempt to buy time while they're uh engaging in wishful thinking along
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:55.160]  the way and today for the first time bernack he's come out he's willing to admit after all this may
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:02.200]  be a jobless recovery that's what he said now if he's willing to say that you know that things are
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:07.720]  at least that bad so i don't think we're going to have a jobless recovery i think we're going to
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:14.200]  have a job loss recovery and uh it it looks really grim when you look at this and the
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:22.120]  administration is doing exactly the wrong things they're raising taxes on uh across the board that's
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:29.240]  going to affect small businesses who aren't going to want to hire and we're here we are a wash in
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:38.200]  the over capacity so this whole idea that uh we can throw money at problems and create jobs is
[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:45.880]  simply fallacious taxing consumers taking money out of their pockets to rebuild roads now i'm all
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:51.560]  in favor of repairing potholes that need to be fixed but in my area there's signs up all over
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:58.520]  the place all these roads the construction uh project of on account of the stimulus they're
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:03.480]  fixing roads that don't need to be fixed that's supposed to do some good i don't think so i saw
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:08.280]  a news report roll over the country they're putting in weird federally mandated curves
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:15.640]  that don't even have sidewalks i wouldn't be surprised all and they want to retool they want
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:23.320]  to go in and fix schools make them more energy efficient i'm sorry that doesn't buy back anything
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:29.800]  obama's energy plan is actually going to cost jobs because they're talking about mandates
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:36.920]  uh things have to be such and such energy efficient that's going to drive away michael
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:41.640]  michael shedlock stay there sir i want to come back and break all this down also report here

[2:11:30.280 --> 2:11:35.640]  with sitka pacific capital management the federal reserve starting to run scared people have found
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:39.720]  out they're private they're above the law that they've given hundreds of billions of dollars to
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:47.400]  their buddies that's a revolving door and finally there's almost 260 sponsors to audit it the
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:52.760]  senate has blocked the audit but that only makes people want the audit that much more what's really
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:58.120]  happening with the economy how are they cooking the books and as you said the fed said two days
[2:11:58.120 --> 2:12:04.120]  ago it's a jobless recovery that's like 1984 that means the elite are recovering and consolidating
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:10.200]  all wealth and power but that under a new booming economy we all i guess go into bankruptcy and live
[2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:16.680]  under bridges go ahead sir oh my gosh i i think that kind of sums it up a little bit here uh actually
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:23.160]  mentioned so many things but the important thing here is the jobless recovery and uh also what's
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:30.520]  going to happen with housing the uh it's interesting let's do a flashback talk October 27 2005
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:37.080]  ben Bernanke appeared before congress and he said that there's no housing bubble to go bust
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:42.360]  this shows you you know just how far off base he was well it shows you their liars they engineered
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:47.480]  the whole thing we infiltrated boulderberg they were planning all this in 2006 but go ahead he said
[2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:55.160]  the housing increases largely reflect strong economic fundamentals such as the strong growth
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:13:02.280]  in jobs incomes and the number of new households that's so preposterous it's just unbelievable
[2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:11.400]  meanwhile in summer of 2005 on my blog i i declared the uh peak of the housing bubble i i i nailed it
[2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:18.120]  and one of the reasons was right at the time time magazine came out the cover of time magazine
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:25.240]  was housing were why were gaga over realistic i looked at that so my god time magazine is gaga
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:30.920]  over real estate sentiment doesn't get any more extreme than this this has to be the peak indeed
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:37.400]  that was and magazine covers like that often serve as contrarian indicators by the way you can find
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:45.960]  my blog uh global economic analysis dot blogspot.com i write on housing the economy jobs every day
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:52.600]  that's a mouthful to remember so just do a google search for mish m i s h do a google search for
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:57.880]  mish it'll land you right on my blog talk about these topics every day but let's continue with
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:06.200]  housing a little bit here in uh february 12 2008 Bernanke said that housing would recover by the
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:13.400]  end of the year what's happened housing prices went on their their biggest most massive decline ever
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:22.200]  by case schiller housing index that's a real index so the question is is Bernanke just talking
[2:14:22.200 --> 2:14:28.840]  does he really believe what he's saying is he lying or is he a dance or is it a combination
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:35.960]  of both uh those are the questions that i keep asking myself and i don't think housing is bottomed
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:40.920]  if if you look at these charts if you look at what's happening in jobs if you look at things
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:48.840]  that are happening with um subprime loans and all these liar loans and something called both
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:56.840]  aim mortgages i don't think the housing bottoms until 2012 and here Bernanke thought that was
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:02.360]  going to bottom in 2008 of course two years before that he didn't think there was a housing bubble at
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:10.520]  all this these are the people that are running the fed and of course ron paul wants to audit the fed
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:17.960]  the fed's taken trillions of dollars worth of assets on its balance sheets ron paul wants to
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:24.520]  audit the fed say what are these assets on the balance sheet really worth how much are taxpayers
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  footing the bill for all these mistakes the fed's making it got blocked in the senate on a procedural
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:36.680]  move and of course in the house even though 260 a majority of the representatives want this
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:43.960]  bill to pass in the house representative barney frank is stalling the legislation it is not even
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:54.680]  come up uh for review yet that's what's going on now this jobless recovery now they want another
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:15:59.560]  banker bailout they already got unlimited funds basically they can just always keep
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:05.960]  reissuing the 700 billion is the way they describe it 700 billion yes yes 700 billion
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:17.000]  and they can just keep issuing that in perpetuity and so at the same time this new power they want
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:26.360]  is more power for the federal reserve over wider sectors of the economy and so uh the more bad
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:31.960]  things they do to the economy the more power they get to fix the problems they cause to begin with
[2:16:31.960 --> 2:16:38.280]  oh absolutely i've written about that on many occasions i called for that to happen
[2:16:38.280 --> 2:16:46.600]  it uh it concentrates power in the hands of people who have proven they don't know what they're
[2:16:46.600 --> 2:16:52.520]  doing the fed doesn't know where interest rates should be anymore than they know should know
[2:16:52.520 --> 2:16:57.560]  what the price of orange juice would be imagine what would happen if the fed came out tomorrow
[2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:03.240]  and and said um i'm going we're going to set the price of orange juice add a bucket of your
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:09.000]  gallon people would look at them and be appalled they would be scared to death over that yet
[2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:17.240]  yet somehow we allow the fed to come out and determine what the price of interest should be
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:23.080]  what mortgage rate should be and they want to power into other things to regulate more banks
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:34.760]  and financial institutions the green span created this housing bubble on purpose back in 2002 2003
[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:43.080]  at the time banking his banking buddies were um and hawk to they made poor loans to dot com
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:48.280]  companies that weren't being paid back the banks made poor loans to latin america the places like
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:57.560]  argentina who was defaulting on loans so in an effort to bail out the the banks at the time from
[2:17:57.560 --> 2:18:04.040]  that from the dot com bus and the bad loans to argentina they created a housing bubble i believe
[2:18:04.040 --> 2:18:11.400]  on purpose to reflate the economy except that it got out of hand the the bubble got worse than they
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:17.560]  even imagined green span retired dumped a problem on bernacky bernacky never saw what was coming
[2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:25.240]  or he certainly didn't do anything about it if he did and you know here we are today in exactly
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:32.760]  the same situation and the fed's trying to get banks to lend and geithner who's the worst treasury
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:38.520]  secretary ever i i thought paulson was bad and we've got someone here who's now worse
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:45.160]  uh trying to get banks to lend is exactly the wrong thing to do well mr shedlock
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:52.040]  yes i went to bill de berg in 2006 it's on record my film in game blueprint for global
[2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:56.920]  enslavement i mean it's not i'm on air making this prediction now and this isn't a prediction
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:02.920]  this is a revelation this is information where the world elite were in their bragging that they
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:10.200]  had pumped up the housing market and that they were going to then pump the stock market back up
[2:19:10.200 --> 2:19:15.720]  suck everybody in and then implode it by design to then create a worldwide depression where they're
[2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:20.680]  the only lender and so that everybody basically goes bankrupt to them and to hawk that they would
[2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:26.120]  then set up a bank of the world we would pay our carbon taxes to i laid that out in a film that's
[2:19:26.120 --> 2:19:33.560]  been out for over two years and now it's all come true so my only issue is i'm not tooting my horn uh
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:40.920]  this is what they're doing to us this is completely premeditated and so they're crazy like a fox uh

[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:27.800]  all right michael shedlock joins us investment advisor researcher writer
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:33.640]  where do you see the economy going i mean i guess just everything will be paid to the bankers will
[2:24:33.640 --> 2:24:39.080]  be putting tens of trillions of dollars more debt will they all be issued golden thrones and crowns
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:43.160]  i mean is there no end of the corruption i mean they're looting us 10 times worse than any
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:47.480]  third world nation i've ever seen looted i guess because we were seen as too big to fall
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:54.120]  all so they can just even steal the gold fillings out of our teeth and we'll thank them and report
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:59.000]  our neighbors if they criticize the federal reserve and the army will go out and spy on them as the
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:04.200]  news uh mainstream news is admitted that the in fact people won't believe that guys google army
[2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:10.440]  spying on in the fed protest it was in uh the boltamore sun go ahead sir okay uh what we have to
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:16.600]  realize is this is not just happening in the united states worldwide stealing absolutely it's it's
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:24.040]  going on in the uk it's going on in the eu it's going on practically everywhere i can find new
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:30.120]  zealand would be one exception uh uh unbelievably enough but but in china they're doing the same
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:36.680]  thing they're all attempting to throw money at this problem it's attempting to stimulate consumers
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:41.400]  how do you stimulate consumers that don't have a job that's really what it boils down to that's
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:46.360]  the reason why all these stimulus plans can't work but if you but if you notice what they did
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:52.760]  they they bailed out the banks for the for the amount of money that was spent i'm not proposing
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:57.480]  that they do this i'm just i'm just merely making an analogy but it's the amount of money that they
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:02.360]  that they've spent bailing out the banks they could have paid off every mortgage in the in the
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:07.560]  entire united states well yeah bloomberg reported three months ago that they already spent 9.4 trillion
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:13.080]  that would have paid off all the mortgages now that they're 14.8 and growing uh i guess all
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:18.440]  our mortgages are paid off and a lot of money in the bank but instead we get swat teams cracking our
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:25.960]  skulls exactly and and there's a reason for this and and everyone's looking at this and saying oh my
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:31.400]  god hyperinflation is coming look at all this money that's spent no they've they've bailed out the
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:38.680]  banks bernack he doesn't want hyperinflation nor is he i'm not even positive that he you know
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:46.920]  wants massively rising inflation here the uh banks want to be paid back in dollars that are still
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:53.160]  worth at least something okay so yeah look what the chinese are doing buying gold silver copper
[2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:58.120]  and and and other commodities and ten-year contracts uh i mean the whole world's moving
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:03.960]  away from the dollar now and we've got it g20 summits they're holding up new global currencies
[2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:08.920]  do you think they're going to kill the dollar down the road or just make it part of a larger
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:14.280]  uh group of currencies it's it's really hard to say exactly how the currency issue plays out
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:22.040]  the um uh as as long as now i'm not only like to see an order to the fed i'd like to see an
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:29.240]  order to the golden port not how much is really there but uh uh it's actually to the benefit
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:35.160]  of any countries that are holding a huge stockpile of gold to actually have the price go up as high
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:40.760]  as as much as possible so you know i don't buy some of these things that the government's you
[2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:45.640]  know you know trying to suppress the price of gold some of these other things of course of course
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:51.000]  you know it's it's in their best interest for for gold to rise of course since when do governments
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:56.920]  act in anyone's best interest so all of this stuff is rather confusing it can play out in a in a
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:28:03.160]  currency collapse next year this thing can drag on for 10 years out we just don't know how this is
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:10.680]  going to play out what we do know is the fed by doing what it's doing is aggravating the problems
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:17.880]  it's it's keeping consumers in debt this is oh bankers just hate that though the makers just
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:24.920]  hate that they're making debt flows out of people and uh uh so they're bailing out banks
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:31.880]  meanwhile the consumers still owe all this debt to banks how is it with no jobs houses are are
[2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:39.480]  going to be increasing for closures the bottom is still not in this recovery is going to be
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:47.240]  extremely weak that we know how long it all takes for this global economy to just completely
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:54.200]  collapse in some kind of of credit dollar currency crisis somewhere that we just don't know but we

[2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:36.840]  to be faded to telling only lies we've got to my dream say on his empty
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:42.520]  larry pratt joining us for a little while about 15 minutes the next hour then we'll have open
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:51.320]  phones but i want to talk about the supreme court nominee i've got the passages from her book
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:57.320]  she wrote a book calling for basically completely banning the second amendment she does not believe
[2:33:57.320 --> 2:34:02.280]  in a right an individual right that's why the supreme courts overturn almost every one of her
[2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:11.080]  rulings well we're in a lot of trouble folks that's why they're putting her on there you know they
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:17.800]  need somebody to ban guns she'll do it so i want to talk about that in the next hour as well and
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:24.600]  take your phone calls but i wanted to get ted up for like five minutes because golden silver
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:34.840]  have gone up massively in the last few years and then anytime they do a pullback
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:41.320]  ted buys and then he sells even when golden silver goes up at the old price that's how
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:46.120]  he's really made a big niche for himself in the precious metals market and has been doing this
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:51.240]  for 30 years he's also the owner of the gcm radio network but i tell you i buy golden silver a few
[2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:56.360]  times a year and i've shopped around and the deals you're getting offered today are the deals i take
[2:34:57.560 --> 2:35:03.960]  these are the best deals out there that i found and ted has just amazing deals on golden silver
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:09.560]  so to briefly tell you about that is ted anderson ted what do you think about the federal reserve
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:14.840]  to get more power instead of being audited the senate's block that but at least we're educating
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:20.920]  folks there to get even more power and now they're saying jobless recovery a new orwellian term
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:29.560]  i guess that's like being half dead but i guess it's a recovery now if you live under a bridge
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:35.400]  somewhere and they're just totally raping the economy grabbing everything that it's that's
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:40.840]  even nailed down passing the climate change taxes openly saying we're going to have home
[2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:47.080]  inspections with federal officers and that there's no judge jury or due process they can just take
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:51.960]  your property if you want i think it's time for folks to get into golden silver and ted
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:56.840]  gold's up quite a bit today but again you've got it at last week's prices for a limited time ted
[2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:01.640]  yeah i sure do that's why uh why we talked about a little bit earlier because the prices have gone
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:06.760]  up and i still can do it do the coins that i offered on friday for the same price even
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:14.520]  though gold is no longer at the 913 level it's 924 silver is no longer in the 11 dollar level
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:21.000]  it's now edged up into the 13 dollar level so it it uh it is a better time to buy and plus also
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:25.720]  you know i mean if you can buy it low and take advantage of this with the federal reserve system
[2:36:25.720 --> 2:36:32.760]  getting more power i mean we've already had such a loss of our liberties our property rights our
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:40.040]  ability to have money that actually means something i mean the dollars lost you know 90 98 percent of
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:45.400]  its purchasing power since 1913 what do you think is going to happen if we give them more power
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:51.480]  they're just going to destroy it faster and and at a more aggressive rate and that isn't a direct
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:57.000]  assault to everybody who lives in the united states who works and gets paid in the united states
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:02.200]  currency you know and if you've saved all your lives if you have 401k plans i mean just think
[2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:08.120]  about it this is the very institution that orchestrated the bubble in the real estate market
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:15.480]  and also the burst you know that they created the uh roaring 20s and then by design created the
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:20.600]  depression of the 1930s right afterwards i mean these people don't need more power these people
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:25.800]  need to be thrown right out and and you know i don't know why congress doesn't do something
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:31.240]  about this i mean obviously we have more senators right now and congressmen that want to see the
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:37.320]  fed audited uh but the big brother out there though the guy with the the ability to print money and
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:43.000]  and pay off these uh these politicians have obviously have more power than the grassroots
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:50.280]  people i i just must say that we have to put on even more pressure and uh and and force the uh
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:55.320]  federal reserve system out of this country and that's my thought but in the meantime if they're
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:38:00.520]  not going to get us on a gold standard and give us honest money i think you should do it for yourself
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:05.800]  and that's why i'm in this business if people get gold and silver i elix you've been picking up
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:11.480]  gold and silver for me for 13 14 years you've watched the stuff go up three four hundred percent
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:16.440]  silver is even more than that what do you think is going to happen as time goes on and they play
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:21.960]  these shenanigans out obviously gold and silver is going to look very good today when you look back
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:27.960]  10 years from now and so that's that's all i can say it's one of the one of the uh investments that
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:34.360]  you can put your money into that's held value not just for the last 10 20 years it's held value for
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:40.200]  the last 6000 years in every country that's to face its currency by uh by the printing press
[2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:46.280]  and creating a fiat system with a central bank has watched their entire government system fail
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:50.360]  and that's what's going on here in the united states and i think it's a crying shame well
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:57.480]  ted this is a great way for people to get self-sufficient to become uh well not dependent
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:03.960]  on the system to become standalone self-sufficient and i believe in gold and silver tell folks about
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:09.240]  today's special offer well here's what we have we have the Lakota coin at 817 now everybody
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:15.160]  knows silver's up from last friday we also have the british sovereign sitting at 266 and we have
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:21.320]  the francs currently right now at 216 both of those coins are in a in a fabulous buying range
[2:39:21.320 --> 2:39:27.240]  for gold and silver and and the Lakota coin at 817 everybody just loves that coin i mean it's just
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:31.640]  such a beautiful piece but the main thing is is that you're getting silver in your hand
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:37.080]  and you're protecting yourself from what they're doing and if you know i i said this last friday
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:42.440]  and i mean it anybody with a half a brain who's watching these political figureheads you know
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:47.080]  they're in their speeches and what they're doing the solutions are coming up with to solve our
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:51.880]  economic problems right now you can figure out that we're heading toward disaster because what
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:56.280]  they're doing is they're accelerating the process they're they're they're putting their foot on the
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:01.480]  gas pedal rather than putting the brake on trying to intend we can't just capitulate to these people
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:06.360]  we have to try to get self-sufficient we have to arm ourselves with the truth and knowledge
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:11.080]  fight the federal reserve expose that they're the enemy they're the offshore banks they're the
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:16.040]  occupiers of america we have to the same time have the second amendment to defend ourselves and
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:20.600]  our families we need to have gardens we need to have storeable food we need to have gold and silver
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:25.000]  we need to have the training and the willingness to defend ourselves because the real insurance
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:32.680]  policy for america is that we be self-sufficient and independent and rugged individualism and not
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:39.000]  under their control everything they do is about domesticating us and taking control of our lives

[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:54.920]  there you know i'm going to be honest with listeners uh here i've talked about eugenics
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:41:59.880]  sunday i talked about eugenics
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:14.680]  monday i talked about eugenics for a whole hour last hour and i'm busy making a film writing a book
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:26.200]  doing hr stuff around the office dealing with the 7 000 plus square feet we just got right next to
[2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:32.280]  this office doubling in size thanks to your support so we can rebuild an official tv studio and really
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:38.520]  get a lot done and i'm not complaining it's just that last hour i kind of ranted and raved
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:44.440]  and covered a lot it was very important radio but it's like this is such a big subject
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:50.600]  i can't even do justice to it and then while i'm talking about it i keep thinking of evidence
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:54.920]  and i go oh pull up where the uk minister says they want to reduce the british population
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:59.000]  immediately by half and then pull up this government document where they say they're
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:04.040]  going to put poison in your water to sterilize you and and i just start thinking about the level
[2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:09.640]  i mean i could write 50 books about this and i think about how last hour i just didn't do
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:15.720]  a good enough job and then now i'm exhausted two hours and 43 minutes in and i got larry pratt
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:24.520]  coming up and i got loaded phone lines and they're talking about forced flu vaccination and i know
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:31.000]  what this is all about i tell you what i'm gonna do at 20 after next hour i'm going to do the
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:40.920]  balance of the show on eugenics and do another pass on it another strafe of the subject really
[2:43:40.920 --> 2:43:45.640]  trying to hammer it and give you the big picture because i've got all these pages and notes and
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:49.800]  all these documents and it literally makes my head hurt because this is the big issue
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:56.360]  this is what affects us all this is what's coming down on every man woman and child
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:02.040]  we're in the petri dish we're in the guinea pig cage being manipulated on record and it makes
[2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:08.600]  me so angry and then i don't feel like i'm up to this i mean i why is it me why am i the guy
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:13.800]  always hammering the strum but then i see the positive side of it i'm not perfect i'm doing
[2:44:13.800 --> 2:44:19.160]  the best job i can people think i'm exaggerating and i and i'm not even actually articulating
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:25.320]  how bad it actually is it's actually worse than i'm saying but then i notice how suddenly
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:29.560]  everybody's talking about eugenics and how it's being discussed everywhere and how a lot of people
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:36.040]  are figuring it out on their own and a lot of big publications are discussing it and so we got a
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:42.040]  chance to beat these murderers if we can set the agenda at least to a certain degree off of michael
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:47.880]  jackson and oj simpson and anacol smith and barack obama and all these puppets and distractions
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:52.600]  and really start debating this and understanding what makes the new older tick and who they are
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:57.320]  and how they operate so i'm gonna try to summon energy and focus
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:03.720]  and do that in the last 40 minutes of the show but right now let's go to your calls

[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:31.720]  need to create like an encyclopedia of eugenics or an encyclopedia of the true history of the
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:36.600]  world just in the last hundred years and just chronicle at all with their own statements and
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:41.880]  documents i mean it's mind-blowing their philosophy their system makes my head hurt
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:49.800]  thomas in sweden thanks for holding her on the air thomas yeah hello alex i'm so happy to get
[2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:54.840]  through the actually uh i heard a guy giving you hand words of encouragement and actually i'd like
[2:46:54.840 --> 2:47:00.520]  to tell you like you are the superhero i'm calling from sweden and i actually wrote down some foot
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:07.640]  notes because we in sweden already have like the total surveillance society and the last couple
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:13.240]  of years they have been putting up cameras in every subway station and basically everywhere
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:19.640]  they admitted finland is the global model everyone's phones are listened to 24 seven
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:23.720]  and they track where you go with them and the government admits yeah it's everybody and the
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:31.720]  government takes your taxes out of your bank account themselves it's incredible interest today like
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:37.800]  for our banks and and a couple of things though that i wanted to tell you like in the 1930s we had
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:43.400]  this riot in a place called or darling in sweden and actually some people were shut down by the
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:49.480]  military and i think one of them died also and they actually made a law that the that the military
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:56.760]  could not intervene when they had a riot and after the g8 meeting in early 2000s in sweden in
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:03.160]  Gothenburg one person actually got shot by the police and he almost died and and and several
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:07.800]  other people were almost shot also by the police because they were shooting right out the masses
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:15.160]  and after that the actual guy that got shot he went to prison and the police they they didn't
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:21.000]  even get like they didn't even had a go to you know they didn't get anything for it and so after
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:28.120]  that they actually took away that law so now when we have a riot the next time the military will
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:33.240]  intervene yes they're getting rid of they're getting rid of policy common they're getting rid of
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:38.600]  posse common taught us type laws all over the world to use the military against the people the
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:43.480]  globalists have dominated almost every nation on earth but their war machine is now going to be
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:49.240]  directed on the family directed on the society just like china they're going to take your property
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:53.000]  they're going to take your children they're going to sterilize you they're going to inject you with
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:57.640]  cancer they're going to put you in hospice they're going to kill you and if you resist
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:03.000]  they're going to march the military out themselves when they've completed their usefulness will also
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:10.280]  be put into the carousel in this logan's run uh type scenario they mean but as long as the cops get
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:15.000]  petty power they don't care if they're being killed it's all about feeling like they're a winner
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:19.560]  feeling like they're part of the power structure and i asked the police break out of your mind
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:26.280]  control realize what's happened to you go ahead yeah i actually like to ask you like what do you
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:34.520]  think about carl built carl built is a member of the builder group yeah actually i heard that he
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:39.480]  went to these meetings and i think he's like told scumbag because sweden and england is like in the
[2:49:39.480 --> 2:49:45.960]  forefront of this whole scam and and and and we already have laws passed in sweden last year called
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:53.240]  the f ra and the ipron law and it actually what it does is that our military is listening to every
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:49:59.480]  single phone call and every single data no i know i know that look your military is owned by offshore
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:05.320]  banks they're carrying out a eugenics grid i've always explained how the pentagon calls it godlike
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:11.000]  power i saw that in mit magazine it's now back in the news where they say everything will be
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:17.400]  surveilled smart dust and rfid are to be in all products and the government can do a google search

[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:37.640]  and some videos are up on prism planet dot com and protesters there uh what did uh lord savage say
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:44.440]  well the interesting thing is he was uh very adamant about trying to avoid the main topic
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:50.040]  which was the uh sacrifice and then the backgrounds behind the sacrifice the epaig in backgrounds and
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:55.480]  and all that so what did he say about bohemian grove so he thought he was being a joking about

[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:04.760]  and get naked with the republicans and see newt gingrich naked and he was just being uh he was
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:09.960]  just he thought the whole thing was a joke basically well the reason it's important is it shows this
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:16.760]  whole left right thing as a complete joke generally the democrats like women and uh members of congress
[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:23.240]  and the republicans like men and it's it's all completely staged the republicans all go out there
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:29.400]  and dress up like women and have sex with uh male prostitutes and porn stars and worship satan

[2:59:59.080 --> 3:00:12.680]  well for the next 20 minutes
[3:00:13.480 --> 3:00:19.560]  Larry Pratt is our guest we're looking at the confirmation hearings of
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:29.320]  Judge Sotomayor and i have Reuters here from her testimony today Sotomayor defends race comments
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:34.760]  and hearing will cover this more tomorrow and she said that she didn't mean her scores of
[3:00:34.760 --> 3:00:40.440]  comments about wise latino women being better at making decisions than white men not just men but
[3:00:40.440 --> 3:00:50.840]  white men particularly being the devil the though her ancestors i guess were spanish white men but
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:59.800]  whatever and it goes on to say the the lady is expected to be confirmed you know as as bad as
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:05.480]  that is can you imagine you have a white judge had said over and over again in speech after
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:11.480]  speech publicly and wrote written books and letters and news articles she's written op ed
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:17.320]  pieces saying white men as a white man i could make better decisions than a black woman or a black
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:25.080]  man or as a hispanic woman i mean you wouldn't be confirmed to be dog catcher but the eugenicists
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:29.320]  love playing all the races off against each other and the white eugenicists love targeting
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:34.040]  their main target whites that aren't under their control because they see them as rivals this is
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:38.920]  all stated by the eugenicists i'm going to cover it later they've got to deal with them
[3:01:38.920 --> 3:01:43.320]  got to put those white males on riddling in prozac so you got that the fact that she's a
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:48.920]  mecha la raza for our race everything for those outside the race nothing is her motto she's a
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:54.840]  board member of that uh so she's basically part of the hispanic kuklux klan i don't know i don't
[3:01:54.840 --> 3:02:00.120]  like the kuklux klan and i don't like mecha and la raza either but why are their klan grips okay
[3:02:00.120 --> 3:02:06.520]  okay so uh you know i criticize khalid muhammad saying we kill the white women we kill the white
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:11.240]  babies we kill the white women because of the military manufacturing centers why is it okay
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:15.720]  when khalid shank muhammad says kill whites but if whites say kill blacks it's it's it's
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:23.800]  it's all right to say kill the whitey obama picks anti gun judge and she wrote a book calling for
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:31.080]  the same thing as uh the uh attorney general did in the federal case last year in the dc gun bad
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:36.120]  saying citizens have no right to any second amendment it is only for the national guard
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:43.560]  so not only is she a very scary looking woman she's got that janet reno look going uh so many of
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:50.360]  her rulings have been overthrown because she believes that if a black man makes a better score
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:58.840]  than a woman that the woman should get the job and that if a hispanic gets a better score than a
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:06.760]  black person they get the job or if i mean the lowest totem pole is a white male then it's white
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:14.040]  females then it goes up a chain but the lowest scum is whites i don't know why this is allowed
[3:03:14.040 --> 3:03:17.080]  but i guess that's part of the new freedom and we're about to go to break but i want to bring
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:22.200]  him up now for this segment the next and that's larry pratt executive director of donors of america
[3:03:22.200 --> 3:03:27.080]  the only true national cross-second amendment group uh it looks like so to me or is going to get
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:31.800]  confirmed or what are you hearing up there on the hill uh as long as the republicans don't care to
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:39.560]  fight i don't see very much likelihood at least at the moment um i was reflecting on your comments
[3:03:39.560 --> 3:03:47.800]  which i thought were excellent in introducing this segment and she had her wise latina remarks
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:54.440]  published one of them anyway published in the berkeley school of law journal edited by and
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:04:01.080]  published by la rasa uh which as you say means the race only the race anything outside the race
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:09.400]  toast um if a white man had said as you were saying something comparable the other comparable
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:14.840]  thing would have been for him to have it published had there ever been something as ludicrous uh in
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:21.640]  the journal in the law journal of the kuklux klan because that's really what la rasa is it's the
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:29.720]  hispanic klan uh and they have a journal uh the kluxers never had one uh so i guess uh it's inconceivable
[3:04:29.720 --> 3:04:38.440]  that uh a similar white racist remark would be published there well i mean if a white professor
[3:04:38.440 --> 3:04:45.160]  wrote that white men were better he would be kicked off he'd be an x professor yeah he would lose his
[3:04:45.160 --> 3:04:53.080]  tenure but not when a wise latina does it and you know i'm just so sick of all the racism pouring
[3:04:53.080 --> 3:04:59.000]  out of that community and then the screen bloody murder if anybody says hey don't say i should die

[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:30.600]  and that's actually newsworthy because i've got the quotes from her book i mean this is a virally
[3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:35.640]  anti-second amendment person that's way of larry pratt executive directors of gun owners of america
[3:08:36.680 --> 3:08:42.440]  gun owners dot org joining us but we were just firstations has just joined us talking about
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:48.440]  her saying wise latinas were better than white males and she said oh well she didn't mean that
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:53.800]  literally even though she published it in law journals and gave speeches over and over again
[3:08:53.800 --> 3:09:00.840]  and and even though she is um worked with la raza and metcha and other groups and is actually advised
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:06.920]  and and worked in the inner corporate workings of la raza whose motto is for those in the race
[3:09:06.920 --> 3:09:12.920]  everything for those outside the race nothing that's very hitlerian but people always call it
[3:09:12.920 --> 3:09:17.080]  reverse racism let me give you a little news tip there's african tribes killing african tribes
[3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:21.880]  christians killing muslims muslims killing christians animus killing christians there are
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:27.320]  arab groups killing each other there were germanic groups killing each others the galls killing the
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:35.400]  the visigoths this stuff is ongoing it's called tribalism and this is a woman from a virally
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:44.200]  anti-american anti-white gun grabbing just i didn't know they stacked crap this high and i'm sorry
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:49.320]  to have to talk like that but i mean i've been looking at her record she is a would be more at
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:54.360]  home in the soviet union i would love to have a hispanic supreme court person if she'd be pro
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:09:59.800]  second amendment pro free market pro america i could care less if she had purple skin but this
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:04.920]  woman is just a classic looks like a cps judge i've gone in and seen the cps courts where they're
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:09.080]  grabbing the families and breaking up the families she looks like a eugenics court judge but i'm
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:13.160]  going to shut up go to larry pratt larry tell us what you know about her you're up there covering
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:20.680]  this on the hill get into more on her race activity and also her gun grabbing activity well i indeed
[3:10:20.680 --> 3:10:27.640]  would like to comment a little bit more on that her racism if because she's a latina we're not
[3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:34.200]  supposed to really talk about these things that supposedly makes us racist to observe and comment
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:39.640]  on the fact that she's a racist well i want to say something about that because that has come up a
[3:10:39.640 --> 3:10:46.680]  number of times when we've been interviewing the media and i pointed brain on i'll be happy to talk
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:52.840]  about that my wife was born in latin america in fact her cousin just got elected president panama
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:10:59.400]  uh... she her first language was spanish she came to this country legally she became an american
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:05.720]  she chose to become a citizen of the united states because she really likes this country she loves
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:12.520]  america unlike judge sotomayor who was born in the united states but when she went off to the
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:19.960]  hot house ivy league schools that took her in as a self-admitted hot uh... affirmative action baby
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:28.200]  she was taught to hate this country that's what all too often happens when before somebody leaves
[3:11:28.200 --> 3:11:33.880]  one of those schools they come out hating the very country that's my issue i want to live in peace
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:39.800]  with everybody but all the multiculturalists do is hype up division and constantly play it up
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:46.040]  she says that if a white guy gets a better test score he doesn't get the job i mean that is racism
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:51.960]  and i'm sick of them replacing one ill-equality with a whole another ill-equality i mean i mean
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:59.160]  this is just out of control and she wants my guns it was also sexism because the test was written
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:04.840]  and you'll notice there was nothing in there about a physical component now as much as i love my wife
[3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:10.440]  and is really great at judges she would make compared to this person of course that's not
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:15.800]  much of a compliment to anybody to compare them to sonia sotomayor would you want my wife hauling
[3:12:15.800 --> 3:12:21.960]  you out of a burning building or uh... arnold schwarzenegger in his prime obviously you want
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:26.680]  a guy that could pass the highest physical test and those weren't even a factor because they'd
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:31.320]  already zeroed that part of the whole thing yeah let's be clear let's say you can bench press 300
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:37.160]  pounds squat 600 you can still blow your back out dragon 200 pound people out of buildings
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:42.440]  and it's it's a proven fact this is not women's work and we are different we're a different
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:47.800]  species that's why in every culture it's the men that go off the war yeah well at least i'm the man
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:54.680]  i can't produce a baby in my in my womb exactly so there's some fundamental differences sorry that's
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:13:00.200]  not politically correct but uh... golly that is the way god made us and uh...
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:04.280]  well it's actually he that they don't like and that's what we're really talking about
[3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:11.880]  they don't like a law above government they hate the idea that we have absolutes of right
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:17.720]  and wrong and they certainly don't like a constitution and you know she expressed herself
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:23.080]  so that whether you're a gun owner or whether you're concerned about property or any other issue
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:29.880]  you think about her view expressed here she said the public expects the law to be static and predictable
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:36.920]  the law however is uncertain and responds to changing circumstances well she personifies
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:43.320]  the law she thinks she is the law she in another speech at duke a few years back referred to herself
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:49.560]  as a policymaker so when she talks about the public expecting the law to be static yeah
[3:13:49.560 --> 3:13:55.080]  that's so that if i buy a piece of property with the expectation i'm going to develop it
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:59.160]  that i'm not going to have it taken away from me by the government the way she voted to allow
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:03.640]  happen in a very case that came before her yeah that's what's incredible i mean she would have
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:08.440]  been a good judge under joe stollen and i don't just say yes she's got a horrible voting record
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:13.800]  and she constantly speaks in speeches and in rulings that she's making legislation when
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:21.000]  that's 101 that judges don't legislate she says she's going to be an activist she says she wants
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:26.840]  our guns and i wouldn't care if she had green polka dots on her if she was pro-second amendment
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:32.840]  i'd support her but i don't like her because she wants my guns and is a parasite but of course
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:39.400]  i'm not allowed to because she's a godlike latina and i'm only an evil wicked white devil
[3:14:39.400 --> 3:14:44.760]  that seems to be the way the republicans have decided to respond which is basically
[3:14:44.760 --> 3:14:50.760]  there's a war going on that the democrats have launched they want to destroy this civilization
[3:14:50.760 --> 3:14:56.360]  they hate this country at least those that have been trained in these ivy league institutions
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:15:01.640]  and influenced by them and they're coming for everything that we have both materially and
[3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:06.040]  spiritually they want it all they want to eliminate it larry larry we've always told
[3:15:06.040 --> 3:15:10.040]  people this because we know who these people are and we know the big banks control them and want to
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:14.280]  you know basically bankrupt us all that's what i mean any old farmer will tell you the local
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:19.000]  local banker wants to take over i mean this is a monopoly game and the and the big central banks
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  kind of just turn loose these cockroach parasite you know quote liberals on us to kind of organize
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:29.960]  our society and shout us down but when you talk about how they're coming for everything we finally
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:35.640]  got the bill that passed the house and it says no total federal zoning they can throw you out of
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:41.720]  your house no judge jury they can tell you what to do what job to have selectively enforce all
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:47.480]  industries everything i mean if this is really happening we're really falling like we're falling
[3:15:47.480 --> 3:15:52.280]  into the soviet union or something i mean is this not the fall the republic we're witnessing larry
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:57.720]  pratt if obama's able to get his whole agenda through it with that one proviso that if that you
[3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:03.480]  just stuck in absolutely we are watching the beginning of the end meanwhile while we are
[3:16:03.480 --> 3:16:11.480]  watching something so catastrophic take place and so really clearly articulated we're coming for you
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:19.320]  the republicans are holed up in the country club having a game of tiddly wings this is really
[3:16:19.320 --> 3:16:26.040]  disgusting and the other thing that is of equally alarming concern is that the nr a while it has
[3:16:26.040 --> 3:16:31.480]  said that they have concerns about the judge they have not said the one thing that would
[3:16:31.480 --> 3:16:38.280]  make senators pause to think i might be held accountable the nr a has the staff not the
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:45.000]  the members or even the board which is pleading with the staff go figure that uh... the staff
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:53.560]  refuses to say we will score this vote on her nomination on her confirmation if you vote for
[3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:59.640]  her you just eliminated all the nice folks you may have cast on the second amendment and that
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:04.680]  we saw that in texas when the nr a when they were trying to ban shooting clubs for kids and
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:09.720]  shut down gun shows the nr a was in the dallas morning news attacking me but we still beat the
[3:17:09.720 --> 3:17:15.800]  bill so the issue here is they're clearly controlled opposition gun owners of america is the only
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:20.280]  true gun group and and and more and more nr a members are starting to discover this larry
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:26.680]  they have this philosophy apparently nothing ventured nothing lost it's sort of the opposite
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:32.920]  of the old american can do a notion about nothing ventured nothing gain let's set it out ahead of
[3:17:32.920 --> 3:17:39.880]  time even if they come on board i do think it's an uphill fight to stop her that's given i mean
[3:17:39.880 --> 3:17:45.400]  they got uh... sixty because she's a godlike latina and dirty whites can't you know i just need to
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:51.320]  lay down and die well in caligula just got his horse elected to the senate a k a l franken so
[3:17:51.320 --> 3:17:57.400]  uh... so we won't speak about which end of the horse got elected that's a good one larry but in
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:04.360]  any case uh... we're uh... we we're in this desperate struggle and uh... we're we're just
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:11.400]  kind of watching things happen we've been urging people please call the nr a if you go to gun owners
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:17.000]  dot org you'll find an alert we put out on it has an eight hundred number you can call and tell
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:23.880]  them hey guys there's a war get on the field you've got weapons you're equipped now what if we lose
[3:18:23.880 --> 3:18:28.840]  which certainly we have to admit that right now that's certainly more likely outcome
[3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:37.160]  we have to establish we have to draw the line now so that when these jaspers run for reelection
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:42.520]  we can say we told you now we're coming for you now it's your turn that's what happened if you
[3:18:42.520 --> 3:18:47.880]  remember on the panama canal it got given away anyway the senate neglected to listen to the people
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:57.400]  for the next two three elections those guys kept getting defeated people will act if they're reminded
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:02.840]  and of course we plan on reminding them and for those that don't know you have a detailed report
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:08.680]  at gunners dot org detailing she's probably would you agree one of the worst anti gun judges we've
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:13.560]  ever seen yeah and she's not even that well informed or in hatch of all people maybe he's
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:17.960]  begun feel a little heat i still don't expect them to vote right he's a real judoist code
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:24.200]  but uh... he drilled her pretty well this morning and uh... she said well you know according to
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:29.480]  heller in the footnote twenty three and and it turned out that she knew about footnote twenty
[3:19:29.480 --> 3:19:33.880]  three that talked about uh... there hasn't been a corporation of the second amendment
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:39.160]  she didn't know what the case was it was behind it she's just not well informed
[3:19:39.160 --> 3:19:42.600]  well she just knows she wants our guns so she can be our new slave master
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:47.400]  that's all she needs to know that's it she's the master we're the slaves we're evil whites and

[3:24:21.640 --> 3:24:33.560]  and
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:42.840]  the so-called left the social engineers that run our society
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:53.400]  and our control freaks they want to run your life they don't care about the color you are
[3:24:54.920 --> 3:25:01.240]  they want to control you they want to dominate you they want to manipulate you
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:12.040]  they want to divide and conquer and that's exactly what's happening now with eugenics
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:23.000]  when you see multiculturalism sonia sotomayor and her white devil comments and her i want your
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:28.840]  gun comments it's all just meant to get us fighting with each other in the final equation
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:35.560]  you never see matcha la raza funded by the fortune 500 talking about how they have death
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:41.960]  mills set up in the hispanic neighborhoods to abort the babies see it's all about
[3:25:43.880 --> 3:25:50.520]  the illusion of diversity and all about training women to think as women men to think as men
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:26:01.160]  hispanics to think as hispanics white to speak to to think as whites in the name of multiculturalism
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:06.600]  but to actually be obsessed with race and obsessed from where you are and where you came from
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:13.320]  so the media the establishment can then play us all off against each other
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:19.160]  and it's hard to not bite on it when you've got a racist who's a member of a hispanic
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:24.120]  kukluks clan and that's acceptable in the media to be a member of the hispanic kukluks clan
[3:26:26.760 --> 3:26:29.400]  it's just not acceptable if you're part of the white kukluks clan
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:34.760]  and i've just frankly had enough of it
[3:26:40.120 --> 3:26:44.360]  you know what even if i'm working on a film even if i've got all this other stuff going on
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:49.480]  what i'm going to do is i'm going to go through my articles in my files and i'm going to do the first
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:55.880]  hour of the show tomorrow on eugenics
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:26:59.720]  what's funny hartman
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:06.840]  that was a what
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:12.200]  sorry man i was just completing your sentences over here
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:14.200]  oh okay
[3:27:21.480 --> 3:27:23.080]  they're in there entertaining themselves
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:31.000]  you know at a certain point
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:44.680]  i'm not the smartest person in the world and i've got this figured out i've got it all figured out
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:53.240]  and i just don't get how all these other smart people they can amass wealth big houses fancy
[3:27:53.240 --> 3:28:01.080]  cars huge bank accounts they can't figure it out i talked to talk top scientists i talked to lawyers
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:06.040]  i talked to wealthy people and i can convince them with the facts and the evidence and i do
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:09.560]  but they are never aware of what's going on
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:15.800]  but then when you run into one of these globalists one of these minions and one of these
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:20.520]  scientist technocrats or one of these psychologists or psychiatrists they know all about it they go
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:25.880]  well we've got to get rid of the people oh well you just don't don't have the intellect to grasp
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:32.440]  that we've made the hard decisions that need to be made to call humanity and you'll notice
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:37.560]  mr jones that you warn the public and they don't want you to help them that's because they're
[3:28:39.640 --> 3:28:41.880]  genetically inferior and need to die
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:50.040]  and so i guess in the final equation it's a question of do you want to survive do you want
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:58.040]  to live do you like them poisoning your food and water do you like the cps family court eugenics
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:29:03.080]  racial hygiene brigades is what they are running around grabbing your children and your family
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:08.680]  do you like all the government documents and announcements of how they're putting poisons
[3:29:08.680 --> 3:29:13.640]  in your water and sterilizing you and putting cancer viruses in your vaccines i mean is this
[3:29:13.640 --> 3:29:24.440]  something that's fun to you so i'm going to do the last 30 minutes of the show on eugenics and
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:28.200]  i'm going to come back tomorrow and i'm going to cover it again in different facets of it because
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:34.280]  it's the only issue it's all that matters and then everything we see in government and social
[3:29:34.280 --> 3:29:41.080]  engineering and society feeds into that so i'm going to try to summon the mental focus to really
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:47.560]  try to break this down simply and succinctly and then i'm going to do program after program broadcast
[3:29:47.560 --> 3:29:53.960]  to broadcast broadcast detailing different sub sectors of it we're on the march the empires on
[3:29:53.960 --> 3:30:03.720]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones and i want to tell you again about

[3:32:08.360 --> 3:32:13.080]  he was devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:17.480]  for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day there is no job
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:22.920]  security you are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood

[3:33:00.920 --> 3:33:23.720]  all right finishing up that hour i did on eugenics earlier
[3:33:25.960 --> 3:33:29.400]  i want to ask you the listeners the viewers people seeing this for the first time
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:35.880]  do you like having your destiny controlled do you like the scientific dictatorship
[3:33:36.440 --> 3:33:43.320]  of social engineers putting sterilants to sterilize you in the water other chemicals
[3:33:43.320 --> 3:33:51.400]  that cause cancer on record saying they're doing it to sterilize you and euthanize you and kill you
[3:33:52.760 --> 3:33:58.200]  in a collectivist socialist society like the science fiction movie logans run when you hit 30
[3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:03.160]  they send you up the carousel to be blasted into bits and it's a spectacle to the rest
[3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:08.840]  of the slaves have you accepted this mindset i would say at least half the public i talked to
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:13.800]  especially know-it-all stupid buck-toothed white yuppies
[3:34:17.160 --> 3:34:22.440]  so i guess so do my oars right in the way that oh everybody knows there's too many people and
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:26.760]  we got to sterilize and get rid of the poor i don't like paying for them in welfare that
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:33.080]  welfare was done by the eugenics to get the quote undesirables on government payroll
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:38.520]  so they could institutionalize their kids and sterilize their kids that's what plant
[3:34:38.520 --> 3:34:47.240]  parent who was set up for a fact but but my question to you is just just overall
[3:34:48.440 --> 3:34:51.800]  how do you think i should approach this how do you think we should approach this
[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:58.440]  how do you think we should start an organization write more articles promote info wars dot com
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:03.720]  prison planet dot com that isn't enough make films like in game blueprint for global enslavement i mean
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:10.760]  what do i do knowing from united nations biological diversity assessments and presidential decision
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:18.760]  directives and state department random 200 and the the textbook written by john p holdren obama's
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:27.560]  science czar and one of bush's top advisors co-wrote at paul earlickman earlick
[3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:36.760]  i mean this isn't just another story like oh alex was on air talking about the pirates in
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:42.120]  the Mediterranean or alex was on the air talking about the rainforest or alex was on air talking
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:49.880]  about saunas so to my or wanting our guns i i mean there is a scientific dictatorship
[3:35:51.240 --> 3:35:56.840]  being set up the pentagon brags that it's a godlike that's their quote it's back on the news
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:02.440]  today in fact put that on screen that godlike control piece from the pentagon with satellites
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:08.520]  and tracking and cell phone and surveillance and smart dust and rfid tracking everywhere we go
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:15.560]  everything we do the pentagon puts out public white paper saying we won't even need troops soon
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:20.920]  we'll just need technicians to oversee the robotic factories that are going to build combat droids
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:28.440]  and remote control ai aircraft to take on the population everything's being taken out of our
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:41.960]  hands we are going into a engineered society and you can debate whether you want to be in an
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:48.200]  engineered global system a global government but we're not being asked if we want to be in that
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:52.280]  and there's not a big public debate about it and then when you look at who's running it
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:58.440]  it's a bunch of control freaks who are into reducing the world's population numbers and they
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:04.600]  admit their own documents for control and power and domination over society
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:14.040]  and then meanwhile we have this denial here's the story liberal website claims sorts of holdren
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:19.320]  controversy is radical right wing and they call us black helicopter cooks
[3:37:19.320 --> 3:37:26.680]  and say we made up the holdren thing there's no book there's no document none of it is real
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:28.920]  i'll put it over here
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:35.080]  we're basically saying none of it is real and we're just making all this up and that
[3:37:35.720 --> 3:37:41.240]  that gets into the whole other issue of
[3:37:41.240 --> 3:37:49.880]  what is this mass mental illness i mean we've got all these u.n documents all these public
[3:37:49.880 --> 3:37:56.760]  statements all the the the climate czars and the and the environmental cops in england in the u.s
[3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:03.080]  saying we need to only have one child and the carbon footprints too big and saying that only
[3:38:03.080 --> 3:38:11.080]  only essential travel is going to be allowed i mean a huge neo feudal straight jacket is coming down
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:17.880]  on us and when we source his book we have scans of it and photos of it and they just say it doesn't
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:25.000]  exist we're liars kind of like if i put a clip up of al gore calling for world government run by
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:32.760]  environmentalist which is what obama science r says to care a global police force to carry out
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:39.880]  the sterilizations to carry out the cps taking everyone's children to carry out the euthanasia
[3:38:39.880 --> 3:38:46.920]  i mean it's everywhere and and and do these fools i don't know what it is about kind of the star
[3:38:46.920 --> 3:38:52.840]  trek atheist type i see them all over youtube saying there's no new world order there's no
[3:38:52.840 --> 3:38:59.000]  eugenics plan but then they'll add oh but eugenics is a good idea you know they get off on claiming
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:04.040]  like they're the priests or the witch doctors that they know how the world works and they're
[3:39:04.040 --> 3:39:09.800]  going to decide and and i'm not even attacking atheist here it's just always atheist i see
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:15.080]  promoting eugenics they'll say it doesn't exist out on one side of the mouth and then on the other
[3:39:15.080 --> 3:39:23.560]  side say it's a good idea though and then you've got ruth bader ginsberg running around saying the
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:29.320]  same thing and i covered all these news articles in the new york times everywhere else i got two
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:36.120]  of them right here where they're saying having a family isn't good this article says having
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:41.880]  children makes you unhappy title does having children make you unhappy and then this other one i
[3:39:41.880 --> 3:39:50.200]  showed earlier says get you know break up with your husband don't be married this is the system
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:57.880]  wanting you totally isolated and we're only the state is your family and they write textbooks
[3:39:57.880 --> 3:40:05.000]  saying this i mean it's so diabolical that we've given the world over to these horrible people
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:12.280]  and let them run our lives and we write all these articles saying it's bipartisan both republican
[3:40:12.280 --> 3:40:18.520]  and democrat leaders are eugenicist and we write articles saying it's not partisan and so then we
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:26.360]  get called right wing people and they link to our article that's against partisanship trying to explain
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:31.560]  instead of getting caught up like in a washing machine going in circles arguing about left
[3:40:31.560 --> 3:40:40.680]  and right that all that is a false projection a false reality a false template to confuse the whole
[3:40:40.680 --> 3:40:47.000]  issue where people can't even discuss issues i'm like so to my or once our guns here's our quotes
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:50.680]  she doesn't leave the second amendment you're like oh you don't like mexicans or you don't like
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:57.480]  portuguese i'm like no i don't care about that she's a control freak new world order person
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:05.160]  see it it's all about well it's a woman oh well obama's black so you can't you know i still get
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:10.840]  dozens of emails a day about the obama deception saying you just don't like black people when the
[3:41:10.840 --> 3:41:15.480]  whole film is black people speaking out against him saying look he's a puppet he's a frontman
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:20.840]  for the new world order so they have white supremacists come out and attack obama now
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:26.280]  all blacks will support him no matter what he does just like they have the left fully discredited
[3:41:26.280 --> 3:41:32.120]  attacks bush so then right wingers all support bush no matter what because it's group think
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:37.080]  we're all in these little groups and that's the great game that's what these eugenicists are doing
[3:41:37.080 --> 3:41:42.360]  that's how they're controlling us that's how they're manipulating our society and it's all
[3:41:42.360 --> 3:41:48.920]  all socioeconomic it's all sociology it's all psychology it's all anthropology i've got a
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:54.840]  declassified public cia document they admit is theirs about how to torture people how to
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:42:00.040]  break their will how to control societies and it's exactly what they're doing through our media
[3:42:01.080 --> 3:42:08.600]  i have a 2004 army manual about how to stage terror attacks they teach army captains
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:13.720]  in black ops how to stage terror and blame it on people i mean this is standard procedure and i
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:21.160]  can't get the public to admit that's going on but when you realize they've done thousands and
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:27.880]  thousands of chemical biological and radiological tests inside the united states against the american
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:33.960]  people against troops against minorities against women against foster children they've killed
[3:42:33.960 --> 3:42:40.760]  us citizens thousands of times they've killed troops on record in the film in game documents
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:47.880]  the free bibliography and what is the end game dot com has everything in the film they're posted
[3:42:47.880 --> 3:42:53.160]  as government links and documents go look at it for yourself don't you know don't take my word for
[3:42:53.160 --> 3:43:00.120]  it verify this for yourself and then ask yourself do you like the government putting chemicals in
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:06.360]  the water that sterilize you greatly reduce your fertility they've got to do it incrementally they're
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:11.960]  testing it right now they admit they are do you like the sperm count dropping by almost 90% 87%
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:18.120]  in europe in the united states do you like the fact that in water supplies that aren't even connected
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:23.800]  to sewer runoff they're finding high levels of prozac type drugs and birth control it's being added
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:31.240]  do you like the fact that why house technologies are science are is calling for this folks they're
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:37.000]  already doing it just like they were already chem trailing us and then the exact recipe the
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:42.680]  exact cocktail we documented that's been sprayed on us that's being sprayed they now admit oh yeah
[3:43:42.680 --> 3:43:49.400]  we're doing the global spraying that was all just testing see exactly what we said they were
[3:43:49.400 --> 3:43:53.880]  putting in the water from the test that have been done by universities and even mainstream news
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:58.600]  but they never say why it's there they just say isn't this funny shouldn't be there but it is
[3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:05.800]  exactly what we said they're doing they're now proposing the japanese government's proposing
[3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:11.640]  putting drugs in the water to quote calm the public and to put sterilants in the water this
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:17.080]  is already going on when they started proposing a national ID card five years ago they'd already
[3:44:17.080 --> 3:44:25.400]  signed a treaty four years before in 2000 creating a world ID card when they tried to pass a law to
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:31.400]  allow warrantless wiretapping they'd already been doing it for decades see when they roll
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:41.000]  something out that means it's already system-wide they are sterilizing you and poisoning you sodium
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:48.760]  fluoride alone of over 200 chemicals they add to the water sodium fluoride alone massively
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:55.800]  increases bone cancers especially in the young it attacks every organ massively increases diabetes
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:45:01.240]  and a uh overworking and burning out of the pancreas that produces insulin
[3:45:01.240 --> 3:45:12.520]  um ladies and gentlemen this is a fact now you may like your feet rotten off and your toes getting
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:16.760]  chopped off and your legs getting chopped off you may like your kids dying of brain cancer at five
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:21.720]  and the news saying it's completely normal and having benefits you may think it's normal and fun
[3:45:21.720 --> 3:45:31.800]  to have them doing this to you but it's sick it's sick let me go over some of the notes i've written
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:38.120]  stuff like michael jackson and the rest of this isn't just a distraction it's about them setting
[3:45:38.120 --> 3:45:44.600]  the agenda into petty issues we have to set the issue in the debate and make it about eugenics
[3:45:44.600 --> 3:45:49.960]  and who the social architects and who the social engineers are who is setting up this government
[3:45:49.960 --> 3:45:54.600]  who controls these private central banks openly announcing world government all of this is now
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:46:04.840]  happening this textbook that he wrote for government policymakers that has now been
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:11.480]  implemented obama science are is the bible of how we live our lives today what we're under
[3:46:12.760 --> 3:46:16.680]  what these planners are doing to us and it's important to be aware of that
[3:46:16.680 --> 3:46:24.200]  i just want to add that again this is bipartisan and that george bush and and the last few
[3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:31.400]  presidents before him all supported this this puts us all in the same boat police officer
[3:46:31.400 --> 3:46:37.080]  fireman school teacher it's all government employees now against private citizens now
[3:46:37.080 --> 3:46:40.920]  the government's taking over what's left of private industry in a vertically integrated
[3:46:40.920 --> 3:46:46.200]  fascist society they want to bankrupt the economy to make you dependent on them their own documents
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:51.080]  their own statements state this they want us all dependent they want us all off the land
[3:46:51.080 --> 3:46:55.320]  they want to shut down the farms and ranches with the animal id and premises id to force you to eat
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:47:01.000]  gmail food designed to sterilize you we've had geneticist and engineers on about that they want
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:07.480]  you under their control so they can have their way with you they want you sleeping mentally
[3:47:07.480 --> 3:47:13.480]  and psychologically the metaphor is the vampire coming in in the dark while you're asleep if you
[3:47:13.480 --> 3:47:18.680]  wake up they with their television mind control tell you lay down stand down it's not happening
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:24.840]  don't believe that choose your own reality perceptions reality there were wmds fluoride's
[3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:33.480]  good for you laid down laid down so we're all in the same boat police military it doesn't
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:38.280]  matter listen to me and go check out the claims i've made and the documents we've posted at what
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:42.760]  is the in game dot com in game the movie dot com info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[3:47:44.440 --> 3:47:50.760]  go read our population control for dummies article paul watson did this is the most important thing
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:57.960]  in your life folks outside of getting yourselves right with god and starting to have confidence
[3:47:57.960 --> 3:48:02.360]  in yourselves again and starting to believe in yourselves again i can't believe how unconfident
[3:48:02.360 --> 3:48:07.240]  the general public is i can't believe how fearful people are i can't believe how fearful you are
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:15.320]  just of what your neighbors say and do you know i got a lot of neighbors that like me and listen
[3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:19.480]  to the show but i got some that literally when they find out who i am will not talk to me and
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:26.120]  run in their houses when they see me because they hear these shows and they are invested in the
[3:48:26.120 --> 3:48:30.520]  baloney system they're they're they're invested in this false reality they're invested in all this
[3:48:30.520 --> 3:48:40.200]  crap we're dealing with a death cult that's what the new order is look at hitler look at stalin
[3:48:40.200 --> 3:48:44.760]  they were funded by the very same eugenicist the same social engineers the same collectivist
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:51.160]  every time they get in control they try to forcibly reduce numbers it's their spirit it's their nature
[3:48:51.160 --> 3:49:03.880]  you don't worry about death individually or worry about social death what your neighbors think of
[3:49:03.880 --> 3:49:08.440]  you anymore when you realize the big picture and that you've got the facts and somebody's
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:13.800]  got to warn the people and stand up against this this information is so explosive so incredible
[3:49:13.800 --> 3:49:19.880]  so danning that it will just move the ball and expose what these eugenicists are doing how
[3:49:19.880 --> 3:49:25.480]  they're in control how they brag how they've engineered society to carry out mass extermination
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:31.480]  they will fall just like i kept telling you for years ought at the fed ought the fed and now it's
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:36.440]  all over news all over tv there's a huge rebellion on everybody wants to know and they're going to
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:42.920]  beat it this time but not the next time or the time after that it is a process you have to continue
[3:49:42.920 --> 3:49:48.120]  to fight somebody to beat them you don't normally knock somebody out the first time you pop them
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:53.400]  them and we got to learn how to fight we got to get our butt kicked a few times before we learn

[3:50:05.800 --> 3:50:09.800]  within the patriot movement the infighting and the you know it's like some kind of
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:17.480]  high school politics of a panoptagon and a pantheon of different characters and who's the
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:22.440]  biggest and who's the best and so i'm the most popular in them and so i'm the one that's always
[3:50:22.440 --> 3:50:30.680]  talked about and derided and then all that does is actually make me that much bigger but it's overall
[3:50:30.680 --> 3:50:36.200]  sick to the movement because we need everybody who's informed to move forward to warn the public
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:42.200]  and to wake people up so they're aware of what's going on we weren't this is this is life and death
