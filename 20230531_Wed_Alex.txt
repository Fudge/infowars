[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500]  A very important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.800]  It is Wednesday, May 31st, 2023.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.000]  And the crew was able to find a bunch of clips last year where I said they're
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  going to claim that a terror attack should happen on the power grid and
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.100]  blame it on the right wing and Russia.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.300]  They found the clip.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500]  This is key intel.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.400]  We'll play it next segment.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.900]  But first, they have declared war on the food supply, which is genocide.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100]  This is happening.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.300]  In his usual lying hysteria, John Kerry, who serves as the first U.S.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.700]  special presidential envoy for climate, told a series of lies and announced
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.100]  that our government is planning to shut down U.S.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.000]  agriculture.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.900]  They call it innovation because they are confident that our pain and
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.500]  desperation will someday give birth to an innovative new solution, or at
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.600]  least that's their cover story.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.500]  Emissions from the food system alone are projected to cause another half a
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.700]  degree of warming by mid-century on the current course that we are today.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.700]  And instead of being on a course to be able to hold the nurse temperature
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.300]  increase to 1.5 degrees, we're actually on a course to hit around three
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.300]  degrees right now.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.300]  And you just can't continue to both warm the planet while also expecting to
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.900]  feed it.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.600]  Doesn't work.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.400]  And as is so often the case with respect to the climate crisis, we have to
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.700]  fight on multiple fronts simultaneously.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.600]  This is the biggest organizational effort that I think we have faced,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.500]  certainly since World War Two, but perhaps ever.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.400]  So we have to reduce emissions from the food system to keep the 1.5 degrees
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.700]  alive.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000]  Why do we have to keep 1.5 degrees alive?
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.800]  Because scientists, as a basis of physics and mathematics, not ideology and
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800]  politics or party labels or anything else, as a matter of physics and
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.000]  mathematics and some biology and chemistry, have told us these are the
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.900]  consequences.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.300]  Everything out of his mouth is a lie.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.500]  The exact opposite of what he says is true.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.500]  The scientists he is referring to are almost all on the United Nations
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.300]  payroll.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.600]  The real scientific community of the world realize that the world's climate
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.800]  has changed in extreme erratic ways over the years without human pollution.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.000]  In one of the most recent studies, Our House University researchers found
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.700]  that the Arctic had ice-free summers just 10,000 years ago, and ice core
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.500]  samples show that the Earth is in a cooling period, not a warming one.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.400]  But these decrepit old gatekeepers want us all dead because the system isn't
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.700]  giving up control.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.000]  And I think to those in civil society, we got to push more.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.900]  We got to be more militant, maybe.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.200]  President Biden has demanded an all-of-government initiative.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.900]  We are all working together.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.700]  Every department of our government is engrossed in this, and if we make the
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.000]  right choices, there's no question in my mind we can win this battle.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.100]  While our food supply is under terrorist attack by our own government, the
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.400]  power grid is being targeted for a false flag, and a story is already being
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400]  spun to blame it on American patriots.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.300]  Meanwhile, the communist Chinese are meeting their bogus climate change
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.100]  quotas in a different way.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.200]  They are spray-painting rocks and sand green, and they are planting vast
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.900]  fields of fake flowers made of white rocks stuck on the ends of steel rebar.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.000]  According to local translators, this is being done to make areas look more
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.400]  green in aerial photography.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.100]  of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.900]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.900]  the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.600]  deficiency.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.900]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.800]  pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.100]  bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.700]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.900]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.400]  iodine.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.000]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.800]  You don't absorb it.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.800]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.200]  body. X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.400]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.900]  X3 back in stock.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.900]  Take action now.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.000]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:37.400]  I'm so honored to follow in the footsteps of men and women who discovered
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.700]  the New World Order plan in the last 120 years in what is the United
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.800]  States today and what is the UK today.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:58.000]  If you go back to those individuals like Lindbergh and others that came
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.200]  after him, they knew the private Federal Reserve was a foreign banking
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.900]  takeover.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.600]  They understood that Woodrow Wilson was a traitor.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.000]  The League of Nations plan was a corporate world government and they
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.900]  warned in congressional testimony about what would then happen.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.800]  And in many cases, they had their children kidnapped and murdered.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.400]  So we're aware historically of the reality that patriots have gone through
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.600]  so that here in the year 2023, we would not be caught.
[00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:38.492]  Flat-footed in this fight.
[00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:41.152]  Now, there's a lot of huge news we're going to cover today.
[00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:45.152]  We've got some very informative, important guests in the resistance.
[00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:47.152]  I want you all to be riding shotgun with me.
[00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:49.152]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:52.152]  But I spent most of the show yesterday,
[00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:54.152]  and I'm not going to spend most of the show today on this,
[00:07:54.152 --> 00:07:58.152]  but I'm going to just recap and add some new information
[00:07:58.152 --> 00:08:01.152]  and some old information that's really the newest information.
[00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:03.152]  Back to the future.
[00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:04.152]  Boomerang to the past.
[00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:07.152]  Back into the future and know the rest of the future.
[00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:08.152]  Boomerang to the past.
[00:08:08.152 --> 00:08:09.152]  Back into the future and know the rest of the future.
[00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:12.078]  Dealing with the power grid.
[00:08:12.078 --> 00:08:18.078]  It is insanely obvious and ridiculously out in the open
[00:08:18.078 --> 00:08:22.078]  that the globalists, just as John Kerry said in a speech a few days ago,
[00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:26.078]  need to get more militant and destroy the infrastructure
[00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:30.078]  and create a post-industrial world so you'll have nothing, own nothing,
[00:08:30.078 --> 00:08:32.078]  and be like it because you'll be dead.
[00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:35.078]  You're going to love it because you won't be alive to complain about it.
[00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:40.078]  The dead don't complain. The dead are happy, they say.
[00:08:40.078 --> 00:08:43.078]  And this is really happening.
[00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:47.078]  We've just been through three years, in many cases, of lockdowns in the third world.
[00:08:47.078 --> 00:08:50.078]  Yeah, I went six months a year in places like the U.S.
[00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:54.078]  or a year and a half in Australia or a year and a half in Canada.
[00:08:54.078 --> 00:08:57.078]  No, no, it's still going on a few months ago.
[00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:01.078]  Crushing them, shutting them down, not letting them farm,
[00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:06.078]  not letting them ranch, making them let the cattle just be out there on the range alone.
[00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:09.078]  In the case of milk cows, they had to slaughter them
[00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:12.078]  because they weren't allowing them to sell the milk for years.
[00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:15.078]  You can't just have the cows there in their stalls. They died.
[00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:20.075]  Billions, billions of gallons of milk dumped,
[00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:22.075]  it's estimated worldwide.
[00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:25.075]  You can't even make this stuff up.
[00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:27.075]  Because the cows keep producing, folks,
[00:09:27.075 --> 00:09:30.075]  even if you can't put it on a truck and ship it.
[00:09:30.075 --> 00:09:33.075]  So the wholesale destruction of our infrastructure,
[00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:35.075]  the shutting down of pipelines, all of this,
[00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:39.075]  and then Kerry, in the latest report by Greg Reese,
[00:09:39.075 --> 00:09:42.075]  that's up on InfoWars.com on the front page,
[00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:47.075]  literally declares a military operation against food
[00:09:47.075 --> 00:09:51.075]  and against nitrogen that plants need to live, their food.
[00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:55.075]  So he declares war on plant food and on the food we eat.
[00:09:56.363 --> 00:10:00.363]  And then spews a bunch of new lies for old.
[00:10:00.363 --> 00:10:03.363]  So that's where we are.
[00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:09.363]  So yesterday, I asked the crew to go back through some of the shows.
[00:10:09.363 --> 00:10:12.363]  I probably said it 500 times conservatively.
[00:10:12.363 --> 00:10:14.363]  And they were able to find four or five clips.
[00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:18.363]  I'm not going to play them all, but we're posting this to the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:40.593]  Learn why it's so important that Alex Jones was able to predict that the government would officially say you're a terrorist, and officially say that because you're a populist, or because you're a Christian, or because you're a conservative, or because you're not suicidal, or because you want the social contract back, that you are a terrorist that is going to blow up the power grid.
[00:10:41.593 --> 00:10:45.593]  Now, they don't want to physically blow it up, which they could do, because then they can't turn it on and off.
[00:10:45.593 --> 00:10:55.593]  They're going to claim cyber attackers hit it, to not just train you to not have power routinely, but to train you to have an internet ID and be able to get online, so that we can never have another cyber attack again.
[00:10:55.593 --> 00:11:11.593]  That's it. Internet ID, total takeover, next level of censorship, the social credit score, the cashless society, the central bank digital currencies, all of it unfolding, the ESGs, all of it unfolding right now.
[00:11:11.593 --> 00:11:14.593]  So they're moving at light speed against us.
[00:11:14.593 --> 00:11:15.593]  They're totally unpopular.
[00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:19.593]  What they're doing is totally insane, totally criminal, totally out in the open.
[00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:22.593]  But what are we going to do to stop it?
[00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:25.593]  Well, we need attorney generals and others that have been fighting.
[00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:28.593]  They're doing a great job in Missouri and other places to take action.
[00:11:28.593 --> 00:11:29.593]  We need to take action.
[00:11:29.593 --> 00:11:31.593]  We need to expose this.
[00:11:31.593 --> 00:11:53.593]  But the good news is, if you watch the globalists or different speeches like John Kerry and now the head of the spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation, Mrs. Ed, Mr. Ed's daughter, Chelsea Hubble, I mean, Clinton, they admit they're losing, but they're just doubling down.
[00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:55.593]  So it's this explosive situation happening.
[00:11:55.593 --> 00:11:56.593]  Here's just a few minutes.
[00:11:56.593 --> 00:11:58.593]  It's like a 12-minute clip.
[00:11:58.593 --> 00:11:59.593]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:00.593 --> 00:12:02.593]  I'll have it reposted onto the live show feed today.
[00:12:02.593 --> 00:12:12.593]  But just here's where I was on in August of last year, so about nine, 10 months ago, with Steve Bannon predicting what has now happened.
[00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:15.593]  Attacks on power supplies being blamed on the right wing.
[00:12:15.593 --> 00:12:19.593]  We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is domestic right wingers.
[00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:25.593]  And if you look at all the preprogramming data points that are there, they're hyping this up.
[00:12:25.593 --> 00:12:28.593]  It might be, oh, hackers took down a part of the power grid.
[00:12:28.593 --> 00:12:31.593]  How many times have I said they're going to blow the power grid up and say Trump supporters did it?
[00:12:35.593 --> 00:12:39.593]  We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is domestic right wingers.
[00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:44.593]  They've now defined it as fascism if you support President Trump or America first.
[00:12:44.593 --> 00:12:47.593]  And then now we start seeing headlines at the top of Drudge yesterday.
[00:12:47.593 --> 00:12:48.593]  You know, imminent.
[00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:50.593]  Trump's calling for violence.
[00:12:50.593 --> 00:12:52.593]  Trump's calling for insurrection.
[00:12:52.593 --> 00:12:54.593]  January 6, 2.0.
[00:12:54.593 --> 00:12:56.593]  So that's been all over the news building up.
[00:12:57.593 --> 00:13:02.593]  And if you look at all the preprogramming data points that are there, they're hyping this up.
[00:13:02.593 --> 00:13:05.593]  It is their main move.
[00:13:05.593 --> 00:13:12.593]  And again, they preprogrammed it, pre-rolled it out, pre-advertised it to provocateur or stage some very serious massive events.
[00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:14.593]  It might be a new war.
[00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:18.593]  It might be, oh, hackers took down a part of the power grid.
[00:13:18.593 --> 00:13:24.593]  You were on my show a month ago or six weeks ago where you said, hey, there are going to be some sort of cyber attacks.
[00:13:24.593 --> 00:13:27.593]  They're going to say these cyber attacks all came from Russia.
[00:13:27.593 --> 00:13:33.593]  And the other day, you know, was Associated Press said the cyber attacks at the airport.
[00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:36.593]  Oh, by then, the third paragraph, oh, yeah, the Russians are responsible.
[00:13:36.593 --> 00:13:42.593]  What did I tell you would happen in the last year and a half with all the preprogramming they were doing ahead of the election?
[00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:48.593]  They would hype that the right wing is going to engage in terror.
[00:13:49.593 --> 00:13:54.593]  And then, of course, they'll provocateur it just like we saw with Governor Whitmer.
[00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:56.593]  So what are they going to do?
[00:13:56.593 --> 00:13:59.593]  They're going to stage terror attacks or provocateur terror attacks.
[00:13:59.593 --> 00:14:02.593]  That is the obvious play they're going to run.
[00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:15.593]  I would predict racially motivated mass shootings, bombings, poisonings, attacks on power supplies being blamed on the right wing because they need us off air.
[00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:22.593]  When they stage the attacks, when the globalist stage the attacks, when the deep state stage the attacks, just say we're behind it.
[00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:24.593]  The globalist preprogramming, there's going to be all this violence.
[00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:25.593]  What's your take on that?
[00:14:25.593 --> 00:14:27.593]  How do we counter that?
[00:14:27.593 --> 00:14:29.593]  And what curveballs do you think they have?
[00:14:29.593 --> 00:14:31.593]  Hack attacks, energy takedowns.
[00:14:31.593 --> 00:14:33.593]  They've been preprogramming that.
[00:14:33.593 --> 00:14:35.593]  Artificial power outages.
[00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:37.593]  That's what's on the table in my view.
[00:14:37.593 --> 00:14:44.593]  In the climate we're in right now, they could do a cyber attack and blame it on the Russians tomorrow and turn the lights off.
[00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:54.593]  I've studied their attack profile and what they're doing at every angle to bring down civilization, cutting off the energy, dissolving the borders, creating race war.
[00:14:54.593 --> 00:15:00.593]  Their next moves will be cyber attacks and power outages.
[00:15:00.593 --> 00:15:03.593]  The globalists are going to cut our power off and say the Russians did it.
[00:15:03.593 --> 00:15:04.593]  They're all over the news.
[00:15:04.593 --> 00:15:07.593]  I told you years ago they'd do it, saying the Russians are going to cut the U.S. power.
[00:15:07.593 --> 00:15:08.593]  Type it in.
[00:15:08.593 --> 00:15:10.593]  Pentagon warns Russia planning cyber attack.
[00:15:11.593 --> 00:15:15.593]  Pentagon warns Russia turned off the colonial pipeline.
[00:15:15.593 --> 00:15:16.593]  No, they didn't.
[00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:17.593]  The globalists did.
[00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:19.593]  The globalists turned off the Keystone 2.
[00:15:19.593 --> 00:15:22.593]  The globalists just said we can't have any oil drilling in the Gulf.
[00:15:22.593 --> 00:15:24.593]  That's the Democratic Party.
[00:15:24.593 --> 00:15:26.593]  That's the New World Order.
[00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:27.593]  That's the eugenicists.
[00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.593]  They did it.
[00:15:28.593 --> 00:15:30.593]  A caller in New York.
[00:15:30.593 --> 00:15:33.593]  See the full 11, 12-minute clip at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:34.593]  It's even more powerful.
[00:15:34.593 --> 00:15:37.593]  And, of course, that was before they blew up the Keystone pipeline.
[00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:39.593]  Excuse me, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[00:15:39.593 --> 00:15:41.593]  So we know who wants to blow everything up.
[00:15:41.593 --> 00:15:43.593]  We know who runs Extinction Rebellion.
[00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:49.593]  We know who wants to blow up the family and blow up the culture and cut the little boys' penises off and cut the little girls' breasts off.
[00:15:49.593 --> 00:15:52.593]  We know who the Hellraiser death cult is, and we're fighting them.
[00:15:52.593 --> 00:15:56.593]  And people, you better join the resistance or roll over and die.

[00:17:22.592 --> 00:17:24.592]  It should be called 10-hour energy.

[00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:48.592]  But this is the King Kong. This is the boss.

[00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:02.592]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:18:02.592 --> 00:18:07.592]  is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:18:07.592 --> 00:18:08.592]  That is the hellish future.
[00:18:08.592 --> 00:18:12.592]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.592]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[00:18:15.592 --> 00:18:18.592]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWars.com.
[00:18:18.592 --> 00:18:23.592]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:18:23.592 --> 00:18:26.592]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[00:18:26.592 --> 00:18:31.592]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:31.592 --> 00:18:35.592]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:18:35.592 --> 00:18:38.592]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:18:38.592 --> 00:18:41.592]  You'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:18:41.592 --> 00:18:45.592]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:50.592]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWars.com and get a signed copy
[00:18:50.592 --> 00:18:55.592]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:58.592]  This is an InfoWar. I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:18:58.592 --> 00:19:02.592]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border exposing the cartels
[00:19:02.592 --> 00:19:06.592]  and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city
[00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:08.592]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[00:19:08.592 --> 00:19:11.592]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:15.592]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:19.592]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:22.592]  And, again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[00:19:22.592 --> 00:19:26.592]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions,
[00:19:26.592 --> 00:19:31.592]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[00:19:31.592 --> 00:19:36.592]  under the InfoWars team, and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know,
[00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:40.592]  get these types of clips, because Alex's whole mentality was, you know,
[00:19:40.592 --> 00:19:44.592]  go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[00:19:44.592 --> 00:19:46.592]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[00:19:46.592 --> 00:19:49.592]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[00:19:49.592 --> 00:19:54.592]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[00:19:55.592 --> 00:20:00.592]  InfoWars
[00:20:00.592 --> 00:20:05.592]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.592 --> 00:20:08.592]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:27.750]  Thank you for joining us here today, if you just tuned in, you missed a little three or
[00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.750]  four minute clip.
[00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.870]  I played a small portion of an archival video over the last two years, where I specifically
[00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.669]  say they're going to blame Russians for cyber attacks.
[00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:44.909]  And then at the key point, they'll blame the right wing working with the Russians.
[00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:49.350]  So first they call anybody that's a populist, anybody that's against open borders, or turning
[00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:57.110]  your guns in, or fentanyl, or force injections, or the Afghan withdrawal, or lockdowns.
[00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.429]  That's all official, you're a white supremacist.
[00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:05.030]  They define white supremacists as anybody that can find their ass with one hand, anybody
[00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:10.030]  that can tell the sun's yellow, anybody that doesn't want to live under communism.
[00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.469]  And you're like, well, screw that, they call everybody a racist, yeah, but they've got Homeland
[00:21:13.469 --> 00:21:16.830]  Security saying we're criminals, and they're going to come after us.
[00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.310]  So I mean, these people are maniacs, okay?
[00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.429]  And so you're saying, well, they'll never, that dog won't hunt.
[00:21:22.429 --> 00:21:25.590]  Oh yeah, when they turn the power off and blame us for it, they will.
[00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.550]  Well, they release another virus on our ass and claim we did it, some of the public's going
[00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.550]  to believe it.
[00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.189]  And then, yes, the globalists have been out more than they can chew.
[00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:39.469]  If they go to a full war like this, they're going to lose physically, but it's not going
[00:21:39.469 --> 00:21:40.469]  to be pretty.
[00:21:40.469 --> 00:21:44.149]  And, you know, I like having plenty of food at the grocery store.
[00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:45.149]  I like air conditioning.
[00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:46.149]  I like being alive.
[00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:52.750]  So I'm not spoiling for a 1776 part two, because quite frankly, my life's worth way more than
[00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.750]  the dumb minions of the new war.
[00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:01.270]  My life's worth way more than the weird communists at the FBI, and the CIA, and the woke military
[00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.270]  they've got.
[00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.830]  And I'm not saying they're all bad, but a lot of them are bad now.
[00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:10.230]  My life, my children's life is worth way more than being stuck like two roosters in a cockfight
[00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.230]  and we kill each other.
[00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.350]  I mean, look, you take the grid down, you're trying to take us to FEMA camps?
[00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.550]  Don't worry, you're going to get what your ass been looking for.
[00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:22.590]  Let me tell you something right now, but I understand that if we don't work our asses
[00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:29.270]  off in the information war and stop this, that war and physical conflict, it means we've
[00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.270]  really failed.
[00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:35.750]  Of course, we'll win in the physical fight, but believe me, ladies and gentlemen, if we
[00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:41.949]  fail at fixing this peacefully, you're going to wish, wish very soon that you'd have done
[00:22:41.949 --> 00:22:42.990]  a lot more.
[00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.230]  And suddenly you'll realize all the things you could have done that were peaceful to
[00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.230]  stop this.
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.870]  I want every listener now, if you want to stop this and you're the folks they hate because
[00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.270]  they know you're a big group of white people, you go to city council, county commissioners,
[00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.990]  school boards this week and next week and the next week and the next week, and it'll
[00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.990]  be on cable.
[00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.990]  It'll be on TV.
[00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.189]  Get up there in your three minutes and talk about the new world order and the power grid
[00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:07.669]  attacks and the globalists.
[00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:10.070]  We need veterans to go up and I've seen their great speeches.
[00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.669]  We need them to go back and do it again and those that haven't go back and do it again
[00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:17.750]  and talk about the martial law and the preparation for war with the people and how the poison
[00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.030]  shots have killed all these people.
[00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.189]  Now a journalist and friend of Jamie Foxx has come out and said he didn't want to take
[00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:25.189]  the shot.
[00:23:25.189 --> 00:23:26.350]  They made him take it on the movie set.
[00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.350]  His third shot.
[00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.350]  Boom.
[00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.350]  He's basically, you know, a vegetable.
[00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.350]  They haven't been seen in months.
[00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.350]  Blood clot in the brain.
[00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:36.550]  I already knew that from a high level source, but was told I couldn't say it.
[00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:42.949]  Someone that knows Jamie, believe it or not, a big talk show host that knows Jamie, put
[00:23:42.949 --> 00:23:43.949]  them together.
[00:23:43.949 --> 00:23:47.110]  I was told that a month ago that no, it's the shot.
[00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:52.550]  Well, Jamie, if he can talk and the word is he really can, he needs to come out and maybe,
[00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.030]  you know, on a typewriter or a computer console and say, don't take it.
[00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.030]  It'll kill you.
[00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.669]  I mean, he's a victim.
[00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:04.750]  Now he can come out and save millions if he would just come out and tell them, but instead
[00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.550]  their managers, their buyer telling him, keep your mouth shut.
[00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.550]  This will destroy your career.
[00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.550]  Oh, why?
[00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.830]  Because if somebody makes you take a shot and hurt you, you then can't because you're such
[00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.830]  a free country.
[00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.830]  Come on.
[00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.830]  Say it was the shot.
[00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.830]  I mean, he'll probably die.
[00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.830]  Okay.
[00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.830]  That's what they think.
[00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.830]  And he'll still go to his grave and never tell anybody.
[00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.830]  We got that clip coming up.
[00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:21.830]  What I'm saying is, is that nobody's safe in this system and we've all got to not go along
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.420]  and we've all got to do everything we can to stop this. So I want you at the state
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.000]  houses peacefully. I want you to, we need to march in DC and not let them intimidate us,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.720]  you know, to not do that peacefully. We need to call the talk radio, we need to be speaking up
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.800]  at our churches. We need to get really active and militant in a peaceful way because they're
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.780]  militant on our ass in a violent way. Now that said, a lot of you just tuned in, you're like,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.920]  well what's the big deal about you predicting that they say there's gonna be a cyber attack
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.180]  and blame the Russians and then they did that and then the final piece is then they're gonna say
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:12.380]  that the American people that are the opposition are working with Russians. So you're not just
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.740]  Nazis now, you're also a Russian agent and that Homeland Security's got to get you to get the
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:21.780]  power back on. That's been their move, no one else figured that out. I saw the pre-programming
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.960]  and figured out it would be blame the American people, not just the Russians. Now I said when
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.260]  they do that, I said it hundreds of times, you know they're about to make their move. So I've
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.660]  literally got the hair on the back of my neck literally standing up right now, okay? Let me
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.700]  tell you, I mean, I got children, I got a life, you do too. I mean, they go this next move folks,
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:45.340]  it's all over, okay? I mean, I like pulling into a Mexican food restaurant and getting fajitas and
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:51.300]  a margarita, okay? I mean, I like, you know, the electricity turning on and all you dumbasses that
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.020]  work for the government that have been going along with this, are you freaking nuts? You
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:26:00.600]  understand tyranny isn't fun, you dumb bastards. I mean, I know the psycho New World Order lizards
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.040]  up at the top think it's all cute and funny, but it isn't cute for us, ladies and gentlemen. Damn
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.740]  you people. So sick of it. Going against your own interests because you've been manipulated
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.880]  incrementally to follow orders over and over again until now you're throwing this all over a
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.600]  cliff along with your own dumbasses. It doesn't matter, you're not gonna listen, you were chosen
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.520]  because you're weak, service system. But those of us that aren't weak, we see what's going on,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.020]  we're gonna stop it. So here's a short clip for those that don't know. You're like, why is he
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.140]  playing this prediction from a year ago that they blame right wingers with Russians? How
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.300]  preposterous is that for bringing on the power grid? Just crazy stuff Alex Jones says, no, I can
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.220]  see the linear line of the progression of the enemy. Here they are again, two days ago, it's
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.100]  all over the news. Here's just one clip saying what I predicted.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.060]  Homeland security is warning of a potential troubling escalation in tactics from right
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.500]  wing extremists. Catherine Harrods has more on this as she joins us from Washington. Catherine,
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:00.680]  we understand the power grid could be a target. Good morning. According to the intelligence report
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.520]  obtained by CBS News, these groups have developed credible and specific plans to attack the power
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.780]  grid since at least 2020 as a way to disrupt the country and the ability of government to
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:17.880]  operate. The report warns extremists adhering to a range of ideologies will likely continue
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:24.060]  to plot and encourage physical attacks against power networks, which include more than 6400
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:29.580]  plants and nearly a half million miles of high voltage lines. While the bulletin emphasized
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.140]  small scale attacks are unlikely to cause widespread power loss, it may cause disruption
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.260]  to critical infrastructure like hospitals and police departments. Homeland Security noted
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:46.020]  several indicators, including online chatter. While the report does not suggest an imminent
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.640]  threat, the Homeland Security secretary has warned lone wolf actors and small bands of extremists
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:57.400]  are among the greatest domestic threat because they are hard to detect, disrupt and can mobilize
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.840]  quickly. All right, Catherine, got it. That's good. So let's translate that. Who's attacking
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.680]  the police department, shutting them down, defunding these people, shutting off the power,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.040]  these people. And so they're drilling the public. It's not going to shut all the power off forever.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.940]  We'll be able to contain it. But these are the bad guys when it happens. And we're going to take
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.740]  over the web and take over the Internet when it does. But it's imminent. And so now the media is
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.220]  all being drilled and walk through. Oh, it's just exactly like they said. Not all the power is
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:31.260]  obviously up in certain areas. The hackers did it. Oh, they've got some 25 year old right winger.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.580]  He supposedly ran. He's never seen again. He's disappeared. And it's just well, these damn right
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.680]  wingers, you know, they just they're just I mean, it's all scripted. It's all prepared.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.000]  A five year old can figure this out. We've got to stop it. I'm sure he's right to shotgun with us.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  Mickey Willis has a powerful new movie coming out. You know, he did the big
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.720]  pandemic movies and more. He is coming up on the other side. Stay with us.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.800]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up. It
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.420]  will change your life. The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:16.180]  two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:23.620]  is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.860]  to other elements. So your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.560]  into the cells. And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.920]  has this type of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.639]  It's very hard to produce. And it's finally back in stock. In fact, I was just taking some before
[00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:50.440]  I shot this ad. This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family need it.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:56.920]  It's 25 percent off back in stock. X3 tri iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.940]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.540]  and take him off the air. People said no way he's the most powerful that ever happened.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.380]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.980]  believe they can control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:21.420]  air. It's the same thing with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.840]  George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers, our listeners.

[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:10.700]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:17.360]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.680]  fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable. Now these companies had a stockpile
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:29.040]  of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.800]  stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who was responsible for the public health service
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:41.380]  at the time. And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.060]  waste product and dumping it into our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's causing
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:53.540]  various cancers and other disease. With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:59.060]  and a remedy to this madness. Available now at Infowarstore.com.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:07.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:26.830]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, you're listening to Alex
[00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.830]  Jones.
[00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:35.790]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, well, a good friend of mine, Mickey Willis, has made so
[00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.750]  many powerful films, and he used to do a lot of big work with the Hollywood establishment.
[00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.910]  He woke up in the last decade, has now been one of the leading forces fighting these tyrants.
[00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:49.710]  And he, of course, made Plandemic, Fear is the Virus, Truth is the Cure.
[00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:54.630]  He helped bring Judy Mikovits' information to the fore, helped really wake up Robert
[00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:57.670]  Kennedy Jr. about what was happening.
[00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.710]  And now he's made a bunch of other powerful films as well, Fighting the Globalists.
[00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.510]  But now what he believes is the most important film is The Great Awakening.
[00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:08.990]  When you've been saying this for three years, for The Great Reset, three plus, that the
[00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.750]  answer to The Great Reset is The Great Awakening.
[00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:18.630]  And so that'll be the new term, not just a hundred books on The Great Reset, mind one
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:25.830]  of them, but films and then books on The Great Awakening, the counter to the enemy, which
[00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:26.830]  is here.
[00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.870]  So here's the trailer for the film.
[00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.590]  The premiere is this Saturday in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.110]  He joins us in a moment to give us more info.
[00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.110]  Here it is.
[00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:51.950]  Breaking news, the president declaring a national emergency, a new stay at home order.
[00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:53.070]  We will shut you down.
[00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.550]  Don't think you can get on a plane or a train.
[00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.430]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.350]  And we will take you to jail.
[00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:06.630]  We've got to get them vaccinated or we will keep you in a facility longer.
[00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:12.790]  As the world was descending into synchronized tyranny, I began to ask myself, how did they
[00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.830]  get everyone to go along with this?
[00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.510]  You guys just put some hell in it?
[00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:23.030]  Obsessed with finding the answer, I began studying every moment in recorded history
[00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:28.190]  where masses of people acted against their own self-interest.
[00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:35.830]  The only mechanism that could explain what was happening in society was what is usually
[00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.310]  referred to as mass formation.
[00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:43.070]  We are now in an economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity, unprecedented opportunity
[00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.070]  for a reset.
[00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.990]  Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished heads of state and government, the future is built
[00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.990]  by us.
[00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.990]  We need a great reset.
[00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:59.030]  And they say, what they mean is you'll be enslaved.
[00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:04.910]  Today, we have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale.
[00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:10.750]  Who masters those technologies will be the master of the world.
[00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:16.990]  Those who control the data control the future, not just of humanity, but the future of life
[00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.150]  itself.
[00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.590]  Every aspect of our life has been infiltrated by people that do not have our best interests
[00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.590]  at heart.
[00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.670]  There are forces using fear and isolation to induce mass psychosis.
[00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.070]  I don't want you to be hopeful.
[00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.310]  Environmental bill fires.
[00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.310]  I want you to panic.
[00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:34.310]  Storms.
[00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.310]  It will kill your children.
[00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.310]  I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.
[00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.310]  People are starting to wake up.
[00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.310]  They're starting to wake up.
[00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.310]  Boss, we're off.
[00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:49.510]  I'm seeing people come together from all walks of life, finally saying enough is enough.
[00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.870]  We didn't come here for no reason.
[00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:51.870]  We have a voice.
[00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:52.870]  We're here to share it.
[00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:53.870]  We have to be the solution.
[00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.590]  We cannot rely on the media, the president or whoever to fix these problems.
[00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.230]  I would rather pick up cans on the side of the highway than to live out of alignment
[00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.230]  with my truth.
[00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.550]  We're all being driven back to the dream.
[00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:11.790]  As you see in the audience, Democrats, Republicans, white, black, everyone, all in between.
[00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:16.470]  This is the example that they do not want to see, but they have no choice.
[00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.070]  The masses of humanity have been slapped awake.
[00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.630]  Open your eyes.
[00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:29.310]  It's time to wake up.
[00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:34.030]  This is the great awakening.
[00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.870]  People cannot go back into the matrix now.
[00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.550]  A lot of people are trying to.
[00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.550]  They can't.
[00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:47.870]  Welcome back here.
[00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:48.870]  We've got Mickey Willis on with us.
[00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.870]  Owen's going to be popping in.
[00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.870]  We're going to skip some of our breaks.
[00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:51.870]  We have more time.
[00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.870]  Hopefully, he'll make you a little bit the next hour if he can do it.
[00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.870]  But I want to explain something.
[00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:54.870]  This isn't about a movie.
[00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.870]  It isn't about even bringing the criminals to justice that created the virus and released
[00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:56.870]  it and gave us the eugenics-based poison shots.
[00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:57.870]  That's all important.
[00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:58.870]  But it's really about the fact that they're going to have future attacks and they're
[00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:59.870]  building more of these vaccine quarantine centers.
[00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:20.390]  And so, they're going to put people in them who disagree with the new lockdowns, and this
[00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:26.550]  is the rollout of permanent martial law and a world ID with your vaccine, quote, proof
[00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.310]  and assignment of vaccine.
[00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.070]  This is the end of your bodily autonomy.
[00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:36.870]  So if you think millions conservatively, four or five million dead from the shot, several
[00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:42.670]  million dead from the lack of medical care and the lack of therapeutics from the virus
[00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:47.190]  that was novel, was engineered because they had to have something engineered to have the
[00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.990]  patents for the so-called vaccine for it.
[00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.710]  But that's just the leading edge.
[00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.630]  That's just the beginning of the enemy attack.
[00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.310]  They plan to kill billions of their own words.
[00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:59.710]  They want to depopulate the planet.
[00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.510]  The globalists are making their move because they're selfish, they're evil, they're horrible.
[00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.590]  They have quadrillions of fake currency they've created.
[00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.030]  They've gotten us to accept it and they want us off the planet.
[00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.750]  They've taken over by fraud and their next move is, we don't need you.
[00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:14.750]  There's too many people.
[00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:15.750]  We've got robots.
[00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:16.750]  You're dead.
[00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:22.470]  So this film and understanding the counter to the Great Reset and their build back better
[00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:26.510]  on our ashes is The Great Awakening.
[00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:32.910]  And so I'm glad because I said this last year, I said soon it's not going to be The Great
[00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:37.310]  Reset we're writing about and talking about, hundreds of books written on it by the New
[00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:42.470]  York Times bestseller, number one, to be The Great Awakening.
[00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.950]  So I'm glad that Mickey's already been ahead of the curve for several years working on
[00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.830]  this film and is getting it out now because the future isn't what the enemy did.
[00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.590]  It's what we're going to do to them to stop them and how we're going to wake up to this.
[00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:59.550]  So the premiere is in Austin at a huge, beautiful, gigantic theater.
[00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.950]  People can still, I'm told, get tickets to that, though they're going quickly.
[00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:03.950]  I'm going to be there.
[00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.230]  A bunch of other people are going to be there.
[00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:12.950]  And I get back Friday evening into Austin and I'll be there Saturday for it.
[00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.070]  But regardless, I can't wait till the film is available online.
[00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:21.110]  It'll go super viral because the pandemic has reached probably 100 million people conservatively.
[00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.790]  This needs to go even, even bigger.
[00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.510]  So Mickey Willis, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.390]  And congratulations on the bombshell film.
[00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.310]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.310]  Great to see you, my brother.
[00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.750]  Well, I've been ranting for eight, nine minutes here.
[00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.510]  So talk about the film.
[00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.790]  I've only seen excerpts of it.
[00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:39.790]  It blows me away.
[00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:40.790]  Your films are all super powerful.
[00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.790]  But this content you've got is so nightmarish.
[00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.510]  They hope we forget about what they did, but you lay it all out and then talk about
[00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.510]  the resistance.
[00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.470]  So tell us why this film is so important to you.
[00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.630]  I mean, it is so important.
[00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.470]  We have a chance to really break their back right now.
[00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.790]  They're actually on their heels.
[00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.310]  We've got to push now so hard.
[00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:01.190]  Yeah, you make a great point there, Alex.
[00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:07.310]  This really is about how to stop the agenda and to understand what COVID was used to advance
[00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:11.710]  all of the ways that we surrender our liberties and above all, how to come out of the mass
[00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:19.430]  hypnosis because we do a brief examination of all of the different dictator led genocides
[00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.750]  that have ever happened in history.
[00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.470]  And it's really interesting when you understand that no dictator would have had any power
[00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.590]  to do anything if it weren't for the fact that they were able to lull the people into
[00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.310]  their cults and have the people do their dirty work.
[00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:36.150]  And so it's a real wake up call to all citizens, not just in America, but all over the world
[00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.670]  to let them know that we're all being used and turned against each other, because that's
[00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:47.390]  the only way that these very few powers have the ability to overcome millions and billions
[00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.190]  of people is by having them turn on each other.
[00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:56.350]  And we have technologies now that they never had before, that Mao Zedong or Lenin or Hitler
[00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:57.830]  that they didn't have before.
[00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.950]  And that's the ability to do what we're doing right now, Alex, which you've been doing for
[00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:05.070]  years, which is communicate with each other and share the truth and really wake people
[00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.110]  up before we reach that point of no return.
[00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.790]  Well, I can't wait to see the film.
[00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.310]  I haven't seen it yet, but I've talked to folks to see if they say it blows away your
[00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.270]  other films that have been giant hits, not just, you know, obviously the numbers that
[00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:21.230]  it's reached, but the content is so key.
[00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.910]  If somebody watches a Super Bowl game, sure, it's entertaining, but it does no good for
[00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:25.910]  humanity.
[00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.230]  You're getting Super Bowl audiences, but for the truth and really causing ripple effects
[00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.710]  everywhere that wake people up.
[00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:37.150]  But I can't wait to see you document the cult of mass psychology, mass brainwashing, and
[00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:41.230]  how it's happening again, because they're reloading, they're getting ready to do this
[00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.230]  again on a bigger scale.
[00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:46.390]  So give us a little bit of a prelude of what's in the film and then tell us about the premiere
[00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.990]  Saturday and then out into the future, when is it going to be in theaters?
[00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.190]  How do we get behind it to make sure it blows up even bigger than Plandemic?
[00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.510]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:42:54.510 --> 00:43:00.270]  So yeah, as you said, June 3rd in Austin is the live premiere, and we do have a few tickets
[00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.550]  left, just a few, and that's available.
[00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.630]  Everything I do is free, so I don't charge for anything Plandemic related.
[00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.510]  Plandemicseries.com, you can grab those tickets if you're anywhere in the Texas area.
[00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.870]  Otherwise, also look at the same site, Plandemicseries.com, and you'll see that we're doing a live global
[00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:20.390]  broadcast through The High Wire, which is Del Bigtree's weekly show with a very, very large
[00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.390]  reach.
[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.630]  And then we're also doing stuff with London Real and other platforms that are going to
[00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:30.050]  be launching it out starting from June 3rd to June 4th and beyond.
[00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.750]  On our website, we will have downloadable links to the movie, which is how we bypass
[00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:39.470]  the gatekeepers of truth, how Plandemic One was seen by over one billion people, and Number
[00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.830]  Two was seen by a few hundred million.
[00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:46.750]  And that is, we give the files to the people, and we say, it's yours, share it, download
[00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:53.310]  it, don't just watch it, it's a decentralized, people-powered distribution model.
[00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.310]  And so I urge everybody-
[00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.310]  Well, let's just say what it is.
[00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.310]  It's a weapon.
[00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.310]  It's a weapon.
[00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.010]  They have their lies that are a weapon, we have the truth that's a weapon.
[00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:05.290]  This is a giant, nonviolent, hydrogen bomb of truth.
[00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.970]  I will say this, Alex.
[00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.529]  It is the most important work that I've ever been involved in, and I'm incredibly excited
[00:44:11.529 --> 00:44:13.050]  to share this with the people.
[00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:17.690]  It has been a beast to make a film in real time because, you know, the world is changing,
[00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.190]  and so we have to keep up with it every single day.
[00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.570]  We flip onto our, you know, different apps, and we realize, okay, there's a whole new
[00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.910]  narrative that we have to keep up with now, and so it's been a real beast to put together.
[00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.070]  But I have an incredible team, couldn't have done it without them.
[00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:36.390]  And as of just this week, I sat back and started to watch the whole film together and realized
[00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.310]  what a bombshell it is.
[00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:43.430]  It really delves into, it's indisputable once you see it, once you understand, because we
[00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:50.150]  have historical references of, you know, really predictions of what's coming, of, you know,
[00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.670]  words from their own manifestos of what they're going to do, and then we have side-by-side
[00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.430]  split-screen comparisons of showing people this is what they said they were going to do
[00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.550]  in the 50s and 60s, and here it is right now.
[00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:07.110]  And the one, you know, repeated compliment that I've received from the two audiences
[00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:12.190]  who have seen a very, very early rough cut of the film is that suddenly the insane world
[00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:13.190]  makes sense.
[00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:18.710]  They understand why all of this insanity of the woke ideologies and all this crazy stuff
[00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:19.710]  is happening.
[00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:25.390]  I won't give it away, but in a sense, I draw a comparison to Mao's cultural revolution
[00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:29.390]  to understand that that's the only way that they can bring down America, which is the
[00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.590]  firewall for the rest of the world.
[00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:36.430]  So we have a lot of immigrants and defectors in the film that are really warning America
[00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:41.910]  of what's happening, but it's also packed with solutions of how we the people, we get to
[00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:42.910]  choose.
[00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:47.510]  Like, even when it comes to AI and all these technologies that our people are being terrified
[00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:51.670]  by, we get to choose on how we engage with these technologies.
[00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.830]  We can use these technologies and actually allow these robots and technologies to free
[00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.110]  up all the, to take all the jobs that people don't want to do, all the slave labor jobs
[00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.430]  that people don't want to do.
[00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:06.430]  There could be a very bright side to this if we engage with it responsibly, and it really
[00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.950]  comes down to the responsibility of the people, because there's, you know, no technology is
[00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:15.350]  inherently good or bad, you know, but in the same way, like, food is one of the greatest
[00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:18.750]  killers in America right now, and it's the kind of food we eat.
[00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.170]  It's how we eat and how we engage with it.
[00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:26.170]  So once we step out of this mindset of being consumers and understand that we're here to
[00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:32.450]  create, we're creators, whole different action, consumption takes and creation gives, we can
[00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.090]  flip this around to understand that the power, we've always had the power.
[00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.210]  People always say, take the power back.
[00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.210]  We've always had it.
[00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.170]  We just need to wake up and realize that.
[00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:41.170]  We have it.
[00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.370]  And we see this happening with Anheuser-Busch and Target, you know, when the people get
[00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.770]  tired of something and they don't like the way something is moving, they understand that
[00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:52.730]  with our voting power, by the way that we participate or don't participate in the market,
[00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.529]  we can actually make change.
[00:46:54.529 --> 00:46:58.050]  And so we're gonna, we're really hoping to amplify that on a global scale.
[00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:00.050]  And let's expand on this.
[00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:04.450]  I mean, you're a very successful filmmaker already that woke up many years ago and decided
[00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.610]  to fight the globalists.
[00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:07.610]  And it's so exciting.
[00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:11.730]  You know, I've just been talking to you, hanging out for years, having you on the show, not
[00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:17.290]  just waiting for the film to come out, but that's very exciting that your model, I was
[00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.370]  aware of it, but that's really a big point.
[00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:22.570]  How, that's kind of what we do here on air and we have advertising.
[00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:26.410]  How have you been able to make a big budget film with all these huge guests and spend
[00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:33.130]  several years making this and then just say, I'm giving it to the world for free because
[00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.250]  it's bigger than just how good you are doing that.
[00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.970]  I see you giving yourself and your family a gift back by stopping the next lockdown
[00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:39.970]  and the tyranny.
[00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.210]  The goal is being these people, not just the massive money, but it also takes money as
[00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.330]  an energy system to continue to fight on and be independent.
[00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:51.210]  So how are you able to fund this and then give it out for free?
[00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:55.090]  A hundred percent donations right now, thanks to the people out there who have been very
[00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.090]  generous with us.
[00:47:56.090 --> 00:48:01.450]  We have a donation button on our site at PlandemicSeries.com and that allows me to, even with my book,
[00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.850]  I told my publisher, I said, as soon as it makes its money back, because I realized you
[00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.650]  guys have put some money into this to get it out there.
[00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.010]  Once it's made its money back, I want to give it away.
[00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.050]  That's the only way I'm going to do a book deal.
[00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.310]  And so my book is free on PlandemicSeries.com.
[00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.270]  And it's because this particular information I feel has been stolen from the people and
[00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.450]  we're just returning it.
[00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:27.029]  And so I didn't feel morally that it was my right to sell it back to the people.
[00:48:27.029 --> 00:48:31.950]  And so we've created other things to create a revenue model because we have small salaries
[00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:32.950]  that we pay ourselves.
[00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:33.950]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.950]  It's great.
[00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:35.950]  We should give this out.
[00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:36.950]  That's why I'm free to air.
[00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:38.870]  At the same time, we don't have George Soros.
[00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.470]  So you can do both here.
[00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:42.470]  Yeah.
[00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.470]  We need the support from the people.
[00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:48.550]  If we want to combat these trillion-dollar industries that have destroyed our societies
[00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:54.150]  and dividing it and doing damage to our children, dividing us at all points, we need to really
[00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:58.430]  get behind all of the people, the shows like yours and all of the different people that
[00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:03.310]  are willing to stand on the front line and to do their best to turn the ship around.
[00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:07.890]  So I do thank the people out there because without your continued support, we have four
[00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.310]  movies in production right now.
[00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.029]  We had five and one was just finished.
[00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.510]  And they're all very important movies that will be released within the next three months
[00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.350]  and none of that would be possible.
[00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:21.870]  We're creating a movie to revolutionize the educational industry so we can pull our kids
[00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:26.990]  out of these corrupt indoctrination centers and teach them the way that we choose to teach
[00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.990]  them.
[00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:33.110]  Let me stop you and give you the floor here because I was aware of this and I'd forgotten.
[00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:37.790]  You've been working for several years behind the scenes feverishly and now you're launching
[00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:38.790]  your counteroffensive.
[00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:44.070]  Say that again, multiple, multiple films coming out in the next three, four months.
[00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:48.830]  I mean, it's got to be satisfying because I've made films as well, but you just build
[00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.950]  up all this work and then finally you actually see it change the world.
[00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.910]  I mean, describe these films that are about to hit.
[00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:59.750]  Yeah, so we have a film called Bad Medicine and it's about the protocols, the COVID protocols
[00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.870]  that were introduced into our hospital systems here in America and around the world that
[00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:09.110]  are still today killing people with things like remdesivir, a drug that failed its trials
[00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:15.750]  and yet that was somehow pushed into the hospital protocols and ventilators and we have stories
[00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:21.050]  of helicopter rescues from American hospitals, people that, you know, that were families
[00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.470]  that knew that their loved ones were being killed and they had to actually get them rescued
[00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.470]  by helicopter.
[00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:28.390]  Like some really crazy stuff is happening in this country that a lot of people aren't
[00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.390]  aware of.
[00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.270]  And so that one's called Bad Medicine and then we have a film called Follow the Silenced
[00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:37.970]  and that's about some of the main people who were first injured through the trials
[00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:41.470]  of the COVID vaccines and then they were totally silenced.
[00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:47.190]  And so they followed the science and then they were silenced and so we've been, I have
[00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:49.970]  a director on that named Matthew Guthrie and he's been doing an incredible job for two
[00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:54.130]  years following these people around, living with them in their homes, really getting an
[00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.330]  idea of how they've been damaged and what they're doing to try to heal so that we can
[00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:02.810]  offer that to people who have been damaged by this agenda.
[00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:07.010]  And then we have the school documentary and then a couple of others that are in the works
[00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.770]  and it's really about having to shift our culture back into a state of balance so that
[00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:16.930]  people can understand, again, like I said earlier, that we really do have the ability
[00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:21.970]  as the people, as we wake up to come out of this mass hypnosis.
[00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:26.210]  And I speak from experience, as you know, you know my backstory, Alex, you know, I come
[00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.970]  from the far left.
[00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:32.930]  I was a pretty radical activist on the far left, woke up while I was on the road with
[00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.730]  Bernie Sanders' campaign, documenting his 2016 campaign.
[00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.569]  And that's when I woke up politically to realize, I'd seen behind the curtain, I realized something
[00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:43.130]  is afoul here.
[00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.050]  People can't answer my questions.
[00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:50.250]  And this thing they call democratic socialism, I'm starting to realize that it's no different
[00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.090]  than socialism, which is no different than communism.
[00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:57.810]  It's just another fancy word in front of another, you know, mysterious word.
[00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.210]  It doesn't change anything.
[00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.370]  And then I started to meet a lot of young people on the road that had, you know, Fidel
[00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:07.970]  Castro shirts and linen stickers and Mao stickers.
[00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:13.450]  And I would say, you know, those Mao killed 80 million people, why are you promoting that
[00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:14.450]  figure?
[00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:19.810]  And they'd say, well, it's, you know, they're pro-communist and communism is what's going
[00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:20.810]  to save America.
[00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.850]  And I literally thought, when I first heard that, that they were joking.
[00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:29.170]  And then the more I met, the more I realized, oh, this, this stuff is, it really does lead
[00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.490]  to communism.
[00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:35.130]  And there's a lot of young people that are pushing for this in our universities and all
[00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.130]  over America.
[00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.330]  And they hate, hate this country.
[00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:39.930]  And yet they've never traveled outside of America.
[00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.450]  And I've been all over the world.
[00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:47.330]  And when you have that perspective of understanding how fortunate and how, you know, really how
[00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:52.010]  lucky we are to be in this country and what we have that other countries don't have.
[00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:57.170]  And why, then you start to understand why all the immigrants choose to escape here.
[00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.450]  And that's the thing that they just can't reconcile is if it's, if this is the most
[00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:05.090]  systemically racist, horrible country in the planet, then why do people, mostly people
[00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:10.010]  of, of, you know, brown and black cultures, why did they escape here when they're choosing
[00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:14.290]  to flee their socially destroyed nations?
[00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.810]  And so we pose that question.
[00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:19.529]  We delve deep into the way that race has been used to divide us.
[00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:23.210]  We have some incredible people, experts and people that are speaking from their direct
[00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:28.650]  experience in the film and how we come out of that, how we, how we come back to really,
[00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:30.650]  for me, the internal intention is real simple.
[00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.109]  We've been dehumanized and it's time to rehumanize.
[00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.730]  So what does that take?
[00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:39.130]  And we pose the question that is it, is it, you know, what do we need to learn more to
[00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.130]  do that?
[00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:43.890]  Or do we need to just unlearn what we've been taught and come back to a place of remembering
[00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:46.010]  who and what we are.
[00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:49.690]  And that dream we had as children and that way that we knew we were interconnected as
[00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:53.850]  children that we have been systemically divided from that knowledge.
[00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:59.690]  And so it's time to come back into what we knew and, and how intelligent, brilliant and
[00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:08.430]  resilient the human system is and to respect it more and to really celebrate the, the progress
[00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:09.810]  that we've made in this nation.
[00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:13.529]  No nation is course corrected like the United States has.
[00:54:13.529 --> 00:54:22.370]  It's doing its best and with a very challenging, um, uh, different model, a, a, a, a, an experiment
[00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:29.010]  to allow a melting pot of different beliefs and different cultures and different ideologies
[00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:32.690]  to coexist like no nation has done before.
[00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:38.210]  And they're trying to destroy that because when the people are celebrating each other,
[00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:39.210]  we're united.
[00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:44.330]  And when we're, when we are united, we are unstoppable and we can do anything.
[00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:48.590]  You said the key term earlier, and I'm going to steal it because it's so true.
[00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:50.210]  We are creators, not consumers.
[00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:54.529]  I've always said we're creators, not destroyers, but it's, it's, it's more subtle than, as
[00:54:54.529 --> 00:54:58.810]  you say, if you're just consuming, you are the slave of who is creating and the enemies
[00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.370]  creating poison.
[00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:05.609]  We have to take control of the creation for ourselves and our children and really create
[00:55:05.609 --> 00:55:08.730]  the social contract of what we want to build for humanity again.
[00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:13.090]  And, you know, I, I see that theme and all the films you've made, the new films that
[00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:14.930]  we really powered up to go next level.
[00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:15.930]  It's amazing.
[00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.210]  It's all zeitgeist issues.
[00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.010]  People know the schools are taken over.
[00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.130]  There's an exodus out of them.
[00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:21.130]  You're on top of that.
[00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:26.090]  And, and, and, and just all what really happened with COVID is critical to stop the next thing
[00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:30.850]  they're going to do, not just, you know, avenge those that have been put under this tyranny.
[00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:34.250]  I look forward to being there with you on Saturday.
[00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:37.529]  I'm glad London real is going to do it as a great job.
[00:55:37.529 --> 00:55:38.529]  The Dell big tree.
[00:55:38.529 --> 00:55:43.450]  If you want us to come put it out or stream the event to it, man, nobody remembers, let
[00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:44.450]  the crew know.
[00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:49.490]  We'll do it, but, but not, we'll just put links up to those guys, but I'm fantastic
[00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.930]  that I'm going to have Rob doing them call.
[00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:55.210]  We'll send a crew or we can hook into your cameras or whatever you want to do, but we'll
[00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.650]  stream it at band on video.
[00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.529]  We'll put it on the front page.
[00:55:58.529 --> 00:56:01.850]  We'll make the whole front page of info wars, you know, be a big pop-up that's just the
[00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:07.290]  movie on Saturday and Sunday, because I want to get total surgery for my family, for your
[00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.210]  family, for all our children's futures to break the back of this enemy that I believe
[00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.529]  is so close to being defeated and, and, and promise me, I know you're a busy guy.
[00:56:15.529 --> 00:56:19.370]  You'll come in studio the next few weeks if you can, we can just really promote the film
[00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:23.850]  and play some excerpts and talk about it in hindsight and really take it next level.
[00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:24.850]  I'd love to.
[00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:25.850]  And I'm sorry, I couldn't do that today.
[00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:30.850]  We're just in a very final pinch here to get this the final film delivered tonight to our
[00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:31.850]  sound mixer.
[00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.410]  So otherwise I know you guys are working no brother.
[00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.410]  I know how hard you're working.
[00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:37.410]  I know folks involved.
[00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:38.410]  You are kicking ass.
[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:39.410]  You got that passion.
[00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:40.410]  Love you.
[00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:41.410]  Mickey Willis.
[00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:42.410]  And again, one more time.
[00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:43.410]  Where do people go?
[00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:48.330]  Find the film of this Saturday, plandemic series.com and also check out our new site, which is get
[00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:49.330]  fierce.
[00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.330]  Now check it out.
[00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.330]  Get fierce.
[00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:52.330]  Now.
[00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:53.330]  Thank you so much.
[00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.330]  Maybe look forward to seeing Saturday.
[00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.330]  Thanks for your support.
[00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.330]  Alex.
[00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.330]  See you Saturday.
[00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:58.330]  You bet folks.
[00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.330]  It's game over.
[00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.330]  That guy is so smart.
[00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:01.330]  Such a beautiful soul.
[00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.330]  Such a great friend.
[00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:03.330]  He is the real deal.
[00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.330]  And he is just churning out badass content against the enemy.
[00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:05.330]  Yeah.
[00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:06.330]  I mean, this is what it's about.
[00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:07.330]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:08.330]  This is so good.
[00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:09.330]  And the great journey we're all on.
[00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:10.330]  I get to know the Owen Shroyers.
[00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:11.330]  I get to know the Terry Carlson, the Mickey Willis.
[00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:12.330]  I get to know you.
[00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:13.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.330]  We are the people that love freedom.
[00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:15.330]  Black, white, Hispanic, old people.
[00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:16.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:17.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:18.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:19.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:21.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:22.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:23.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.330]  I get to meet you.
[00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:30.330]  The United States has been so much cooler.
[00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.330]  We are a lot younger, the United States is so young, everything.
[00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.330]  And we're here together loving the future and our children.
[00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:33.330]  And we're alive.
[00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:37.109]  The enemy are a bunch of dumb-ass zombies and a bunch of weird-ass John Kerry freakazois.
[00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:38.410]  I mean, and Diane Feinstein.
[00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.390]  Give me a fricking break man.
[00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:42.390]  Whoo!
[00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:43.390]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.390]  Hour number two.
[00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:45.390]  Owen Shroyers has got a lot to say.
[00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.390]  I'm writing shotgun with him.
[00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:47.390]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:51.790]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:53.850]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.470]  It will change your life.
[00:57:55.870 --> 00:58:00.330]  The UN admits, and the Lansink Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:04.590]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:10.109]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:15.850]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:20.150]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:25.990]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of
[00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.990]  full effect.
[00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:30.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:33.270]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:36.250]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.430]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:39.750]  You and your family need it.
[00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.950]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:46.270]  X3 triiodine exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:48.790]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:54.590]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:57.310]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:03.069]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:08.069]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:11.350]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:15.710]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:20.870]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:24.550]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:25.550]  two or three times.
[00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:28.430]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.830]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:33.830]  competitor.
[00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:39.069]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:40.830]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:43.870]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:47.990]  The point is you get the filters at m4store.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:51.109]  in stock.
[00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:56.990]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:41.310]  Hold on, my friends, and no, they can't break your will, because if you point your spirit
[01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:51.870]  at God, at Christ, and Christ's spirit, and you invite that into you, your discernment,
[01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:58.550]  your IQ, your will will exponentially grow.
[01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:03.830]  That's why our guests, our people have electricity in their eyes.
[01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.710]  It's why they're so smart, why they're so alive.
[01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:09.109]  I don't care what damn color their skin is.
[01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:12.910]  The eyes, Chico, it's always in the eyes.
[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.910]  The eyes never lie.
[01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:23.069]  Tony Montana says the Scarface, the eyes, the eyes never lie.
[01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:25.190]  And the enemy's eyes are dead.
[01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:30.109]  So I'm not signing on to anything where people's eyes are dead, and they look like Frankenstein,
[01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:33.830]  like John Kerry, ain't happening.
[01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:37.630]  I'm going where the truth and the energy is in the life, because like Mickey Willis said
[01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:40.550]  last hour, we are not.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:49.520]  Consuming, we are creating.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:58.260]  Consuming is not bad, but if you're not creating and you're just consuming, you're destroying.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:06.260]  But if you are a creator, which is you're designed to be, we're made in the image of God, the Bible starts Genesis.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:11.340]  The last thing God does is put humans on the earth.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.340]  It says you're made in my image.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:23.580]  A little G. Not like the radical New Agers say we're God, or the left says we're gonna be God.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.580]  Don't believe in God yet, Ray Kurzweil says. No, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:34.180]  You are made in the image of God and are able down at your little
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:38.180]  microscopic level to do a microscopic version of what God does.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.180]  And it's still, I mean, look at what the art, the culture,
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.180]  the literature, the design, the music, the weapons.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.180]  You blow the damn earth up.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.180]  And we're babies in what we're going to become.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.180]  And when we're not babies anymore in our full-scale 12th dimension,
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.180]  we'll be like an atom compared to God,
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:02.180]  who is the entire universe of universes,
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.180]  all time, all dimension.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.180]  God can just create quadrillions of universes,
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.180]  quadrillions of new civilizations instantly.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180]  That's what this is.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.180]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.180]  But we are super small and little,
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:22.180]  but we're connected to the infinite and we are creatures,
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:27.180]  probes fired out by God so that God can experience reality from the lowest
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.180]  levels all the way up to the highest levels.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:33.180]  But free will is allowed to operate.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.180]  So there are entities and creatures and civilizations that have decided to
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:41.180]  break from the master plan and build their own systems,
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:47.180]  which are tombs where they cut themselves off from the all source and create
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.180]  their own hell.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.180]  I will not be part of that.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:56.180]  I reach out like a tree in the sky.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.180]  You see it everywhere.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.180]  The enemy tells you what they're doing everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.180]  Let me draw you a picture.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.180]  Guys, come back from break.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.180]  I'm going to show this and talk to Owen.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.180]  He's been very patient sitting there while I've been ranting.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.180]  I love Owen to death.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.180]  Pull up the death rune.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.180]  Just type in the rune of death.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.180]  It's Norse, it's Germanic.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.180]  Of course, it's the peace symbol.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.180]  It's a tree with its limbs down.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:21.180]  It's like the peace symbol is the rune of death.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.180]  The rune of life, which they now call a white supremacist symbol,
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.180]  which is not the damn ADLs.
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.180]  They probably lost it or go out and create fake Nazi groups everywhere and
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.180]  then take all these sacred symbols and invert them.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.180]  That's what Satans do.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.180]  And yeah, there it is.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:42.180]  The life is the tree up and death is when the tree's limbs fall and it's dead.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.180]  All you got is the trunk left.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.180]  Powerful language.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.180]  I choose this.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.180]  Put me back on screen, please.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.180]  This is Alice Jones.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.180]  Boom, baby.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.180]  My limbs are up.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.180]  And I come in peace.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.180]  I come in prosperity.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.180]  I come to help.
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.180]  Sold out for more than a year.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:07.180]  We now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular tooth
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.180]  whitening coral calcium toothpaste full of essential oils,
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.180]  back in stock and infowarestore.com.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.180]  Another great product sold out for almost a year is our activated charcoal
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.180]  essential oil toothpaste as well.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.180]  These are both incredible for your gums, polish your teeth,
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.180]  amazing to counter gingivitis, and they fund the info war.
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.180]  There are no fillers in these products.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.180]  These are fluoride free, next level toothpaste,
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:37.180]  10,000 of each tube, limited run, available exclusively at infowarestore.com.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.180]  And your purchase funds the operation.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.180]  Plus, these are incredible products you need.
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.180]  So the coral calcium tooth whitening and the activated charcoal essential oil
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:50.180]  toothpaste are now both back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.180]  I thank you for your support.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.180]  But regardless, these are great products you need.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.180]  So take action now.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:00.180]  Go to infowarestore.com for both this great toothpaste back in stock.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:23.180]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.180]  All right.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.180]  Very powerful first hour.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.180]  Alex Jones here.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.180]  I went shorty riding shotgun.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.180]  I had Mickey Willis on last hour.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.180]  I have all this breaking news, all this incredible information.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.180]  We're going to cover in the next three hours.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.180]  But I have to go back to what I first covered at the beginning of the show
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:45.180]  because it sends shivers up my spine, not of fear, but of anticipation.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:51.180]  Like in Lord of the Rings, you've got the elvish sword, Sting.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.180]  And when goblins or orcs are near, it glows blue.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.180]  That's an archetype, like your spirit knowing the enemy's close.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.180]  I mean, it's like it's not a thing of fear.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:04.180]  It's like I'm ready to protect war because, I mean, I know evil is upon us.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.180]  Okay.
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:10.180]  And I'm literally getting chills for the last hour because I know I'm talking
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.180]  to millions of people.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.180]  I love you.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.180]  I know we can win.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.180]  I know we've got a real chance at this.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:18.180]  If we just reach out our arms towards heaven to God and say we want to live
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.180]  with the rune of life versus the rune of death, the peace movement,
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.180]  submit to them in peace and die.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.180]  Arms down, death, you're dead.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.180]  Arms up to God, you live.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:30.180]  Everything they do is a ritual against you.
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.180]  You've got to pull that sword, which is the Holy Spirit,
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.180]  and it's going to glow bright white blue, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.180]  and say I'm ready.
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.620]  Life, beginning, protection, death, end, war.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.620]  I see the left so funny.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:51.620]  They took the ancient north symbol of war and death and called it peace because it's a war on you.
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.620]  It's a lie.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.620]  They want to control people and think they're pushing peace when they're pushing death.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.620]  Everything is an inversion.
[01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:05.770]  So I finally figured out what the new designer t-shirt's going to be.
[01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:09.290]  I told you I'm going to design these t-shirts, we'll come out with one or two, then when
[01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:12.570]  we're done, they're gone forever, and then I'm going to have a new one, and that's what
[01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:13.570]  the new shirt's going to be.
[01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:14.570]  And by the way, I'm not in competition with anybody.
[01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:15.570]  I hope everybody takes this idea.
[01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:16.570]  I hope it takes off.
[01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:17.570]  It's really smart, in my view.
[01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:26.170]  We're going to have a white t-shirt with a rune of life on the front in black, you know,
[01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.170]  on white.
[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.210]  And then on the back, it'll be like a concert t-shirt, and it'll say, this is the rune of
[01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:32.930]  life.
[01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:38.730]  It's an ancient Germanic and Norse symbol of a tree with its limbs up towards the sun
[01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:44.010]  and towards creativity and the future and new beginnings and creation.
[01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:48.050]  This is the rune of death, war, destruction, failure, betrayal.
[01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:53.530]  You may have seen this symbol before, because your enemy masquerades as those that want
[01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:56.290]  to stop war and want to promote peace.
[01:08:56.290 --> 01:09:00.450]  But in truth, notice that the people that lead this movement are destroying everything.
[01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:09.130]  And what does the ADL say?
[01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:17.010]  They say the rune of life that is at least 10,000 years old, carved on cave walls, is
[01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:18.330]  a Nazi symbol.
[01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:22.390]  What does the Southern Primary Law Center say?
[01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.390]  But the rune of death!
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:31.420]  An upside-down rune of life is liberal and loving, you see.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:35.420]  By the way, I think we'll put another shirt out soon that's just a star.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:39.420]  It's not a satanic symbol, it's not an occult symbol, it's a symbol of a man.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.420]  A woman. A head, arms, and legs.
[01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:47.010]  And say, this is a star, a symbol of an upright human being.
[01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:52.010]  And on the back, have it upside down and say, this is the sign of death.
[01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:54.010]  A man being crucified upside down.
[01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:57.010]  That's what all this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:01.010]  A star is alive and powerful.
[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.010]  God made it.
[01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:04.010]  So Hollywood goes, oh, you're a star.
[01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:07.010]  In God's mind, you are a star.
[01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:08.010]  And see, that's how this all works.
[01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:10.010]  This is the real esoteric secret knowledge.
[01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.010]  And see, they invert that and say, no, you're going down.
[01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.010]  You're going down, down, down.
[01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.010]  That's when the dying comes.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:24.180]  You got it all figured out, they hope you live in the dark and never figure it out but we have
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.940]  figured it out. So the new t-shirt, I was going to bring back mass murderers agree gun control works,
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:34.420]  a new version of that, I'm gonna do that later. The new shirt is going to be the rune of life
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:40.420]  and I guarantee you the ADL is going to run headlines saying Jones is selling a Nazi item.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:46.340]  Just like the ADL is trying to get Buddhists to get rid of their temples that are 4,000 years
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.700]  old because they got swastikas on it. Swastika is the sun symbol of the sun
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:56.100]  and it's a sacred symbol and it's not bad because Hitler took it doesn't mean it's bad.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:03.940]  But the rune of life, oh the rune of death is liberally good but oh a rune of life is
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.620]  Nazi.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.700]  Life is Nazi, see?
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.080]  Death is liberal.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.840]  Total crap.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]  Total inversion.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  False reality.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]  All right.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  My nose hairs are spectacular.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.840]  I need to trim them.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.840]  The crew's like, hey, man, you got boogers hanging out of your nose.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.720]  I'm like, no, those are dim.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.240]  As you get older, you lose hair on the top of your head, and you grow it in your ears
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240]  and your nose.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]  I could, like, braid my nose hairs.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.880]  The damn things grow, like, an inch a week or something.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.480]  I trimmed them four days ago.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.480]  Anyway, it's a little bit of self-deprecation here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.120]  Next, the ADL say nose hairs are racist.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.720]  I bet they say beards are racist.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]  I'm not even joking.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.320]  Because men know they're under attack, so men have all grown beards the last decade
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.960]  to say, hey, we're men, we're different.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960]  And I get it.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.680]  So I grew one in solidarity, and I like it.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.040]  And the point is, women obviously love it.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.480]  And I bet the ADL says beards are racist next.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480]  I'm not kidding.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480]  All right.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480]  I'm going to stop and bring Ellen Schreier in here.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.080]  But let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.080]  This is the intro.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.080]  It's a 12-minute video.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]  The archivists got together here.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]  They did a great job.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.960]  Here I am the last year and a half, over and over again, saying they're going to blame
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.480]  Russians for the power grid attack, and then say right-wingers are working with them.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.560]  And when they do that, you know the attack on the power grid is imminent.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.960]  So this is a big deal, folks.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.200]  It's now been announced everywhere.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.200]  It's now happening.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200]  Here's a clip.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.480]  We've seen power supplies being blamed on the right wing.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.720]  We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is domestic right-wingers.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.640]  And if you look at all the pre-programming data points that are there, they're hyping
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.640]  this up.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.800]  It might be, oh, hackers took down part of the power grid.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.520]  How many times have I said they're going to blow the power grid up and say Trump supporters
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.400]  did it?
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.640]  We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is domestic right-wingers.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.080]  They've now defined it as fascism, if you support President Trump, or America first, and then
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.440]  now we start seeing headlines at the top of Drudge yesterday, you know, imminent, Trump's
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:09.240]  calling for violence, Trump's calling for insurrection, January 6, 2.0.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.400]  That's been all over the news building up.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.360]  And if you look at all the pre-programming data points that are there, they're hyping
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]  this up.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.720]  It is their main move, and again, they pre-programmed it, pre-rolled it out, pre-advertised it to
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.340]  provocateur or stage some very serious massive events.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.040]  It might be a new war.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.440]  It might be, oh, hackers took down part of the power grid.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.120]  You were on my show a month ago, or six weeks ago, where you said, hey, there are going
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.860]  to be some sort of cyber attacks.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.520]  All came from Russia.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.880]  And the other day, you know, it was Associated Press, you know, said the cyber attacks at
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880]  the airport.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.520]  Oh, by then, the third paragraph, oh, yeah, the Russians are responsible.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.360]  Why did I tell you what happened in the last year and a half with all the pre-programming
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.560]  they were doing ahead of the election?
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:05.400]  They would hype that the right wing is going to engage in terror.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.000]  And then, of course, they'll provocateur it, just like we saw with Governor Whitmer.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.660]  So what are they going to do?
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.960]  They're going to stage terror attacks or provocateur terror attacks.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.960]  That is the obvious play they're going to run.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.160]  I would predict racially motivated mass shootings, bombings, poisonings.
[01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:36.350]  Attacks on power supplies being blamed on the right wing because they need us off air when they stage the attacks, when the globalist stage the attacks, when the deep state stage the attacks, just say we're behind it.
[01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:41.350]  The globalist pre-programming, there's going to be all this violence. What's your take on that? How do we counter that?
[01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:47.350]  And what curve balls do you think they have? Hack attacks, energy takedowns, they've been pre-programming that.
[01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:59.350]  Artificial power outages, that's what's on the table in my view. In the climate we're in right now, they could do a cyber attack and blame it on the Russians tomorrow and turn the lights off.
[01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:09.350]  I've studied their attack profile and what they're doing at every angle to bring down civilization, cutting off the energy, dissolving the borders, creating race war.
[01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:15.350]  Their next moves will be cyber attacks and power outages.
[01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:22.350]  The globalists are going to cut our power off and say the Russians did it. They're all over the news, I told you years ago they do it, saying the Russians are going to cut the US power. Type it in.
[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:31.350]  Pentagon warns Russia planning cyber attack. Pentagon warns Russia turned off the colonial pipeline. No they didn't, the globalists did.
[01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:42.350]  The globalists turned off the Keystone 2. The globalists just said we can't have any oil drilling in the Gulf. That's the Democratic Party, that's the New World Order, that's the eugenicists, they did it.
[01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:52.350]  I'll call her in New York first because the globalists love to tell you what they're about to do and they go, soon the power will go out, terrorists are going to hit it.
[01:15:52.350 --> 01:16:09.350]  And that sounds more like Schwarzenegger than Klaus Schwab, but the point we've made to the governments is your power will soon be out and we will take over and don't get used to having power anymore. Cyber outages will make COVID look like a happy time. These are basically quotes.
[01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:14.350]  And so yeah, they're losing, but they're in control of the infrastructure.
[01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:28.350]  I remember reading that from January to August of this year that we had what they thought was an intentional or a hundred attacks on our electrical grids and substations. And then I know that we had that big one in North Carolina.
[01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:31.350]  And in Washington and all over the place.
[01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:39.350]  Yeah, Pacific Northwest and that one in Washington. I know they kind of just wanted to blame on Trump supporter terrorists.
[01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:43.350]  How many times have I said they're going to blow the power grid up and say Trump supporters did it?
[01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:51.350]  Exactly. And so I wondered because it just kind of seemed to get memory hole and I don't really see anyone talking about it. And I know there's a lot of other stuff going on.
[01:16:51.350 --> 01:17:02.350]  Well, it was globalists cut off most of the pipelines in the country. And yeah, they're going to cut off a few pipelines and say we did it to blame the total collapse they've already caused.
[01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:10.350]  You understand? Oh, the thousand pipelines we shut down or plus didn't do it. It was this one got blown up by some Trump supporter. Yeah, right.
[01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:13.350]  Yeah. So I just noticed that.
[01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:21.350]  And if you look at the and we got to make a bigger deal about this, I know the listeners get this, but the general public used to get it.
[01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:31.350]  When you look at John Kerry or Barack Obama or any of these globalists running around, plumbing at the mouth, they keep saying the viruses are coming out of the jungle.
[01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:32.350]  There's a global warming. It's your fault.
[01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:42.350]  They're making the viruses lab or the third world's collapsing because of global warming. No, you wouldn't let them under IMF World Bank control, farm or ranch or go to their jobs for over two years.
[01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:53.350]  You collapsed them on purpose and organized them as refugees. It's the same same story over and over and over again where they say, well, we're not we're no longer just an existential crisis.
[01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:58.350]  We're in the crisis. The world's collapsing is a global warming. John Kerry said last weekend.
[01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:01.350]  When they collapsed the world.
[01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:08.350]  And are now now saying they're going to save you by, oh, we'll shut off the farms and shut off the food.
[01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:14.350]  And we'll stop oil drilling and that'll fix. They're not big enough resources.
[01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:18.350]  And then, oh, high carbon dioxide and heat is very bad.
[01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:21.350]  No, it just makes the earth green and things be healthy.
[01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:30.350]  And so literally, it's the most dystopian supervillain crap ever being spewed because the general public is illiterate when it comes to science.
[01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:35.350]  In fact, very just goes all the scientists agree the earth is boiling over.
[01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:40.350]  Well, they said by 2010, there'd be a multi foot rise.
[01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:44.350]  All they bought houses right on Martha's Vineyard at one foot above sea level.
[01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:49.350]  And I mean, Al Gore, Obama, all of them, they all bought these big houses on the beach.
[01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:56.350]  And then they go, oh, 2017 is going to flood in 2011 or 2012 over and over again.
[01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:59.350]  Well, there are floods. Floods do happen at the beach.
[01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:03.350]  It's always happened. But the point is, or they'll show rogue waves hitting Hawaii all the time.
[01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:06.350]  Rogue waves have always hit Hawaii. There's tsunamis.
[01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:10.350]  Oh, look, a 10 foot wave came in and hit a restaurant. It shows the earth's over.
[01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:14.350]  Look, there's this flooding in a restaurant in Hawaii. A big wave came in.
[01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:18.350]  And they just play this superstitious game with people.
[01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:23.350]  But the reason I keep harping on this with all the other news is, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:29.350]  they want to be able to shut down their political competition when they run other false flags, when they release other virus.
[01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:34.350]  So there's a lot of scenarios, but this is how I'd do it if I was them, from their past operations.
[01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:39.350]  They want to test and make sure it works. The media goes along with them.
[01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:45.350]  So they'll hit, of the five major power grids in the U.S., they'll hit one of those grids
[01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:48.350]  and claim that a right wing group with the Russians took it down.
[01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:52.350]  They'll see if the media parrots that and properly operates.
[01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:56.350]  Then they'll get it back on, blame their enemies, maybe put some patsy in jail.
[01:19:56.350 --> 01:20:00.350]  Few months later, airports get hit, some other things get hit again.
[01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:03.350]  And then two power grids go down.
[01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:05.350]  But they get them back on in just a couple of days.
[01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:08.350]  Okay, there was some rioting, looting, but we got it fixed.
[01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:10.350]  Yeah, we think it's the same people again.
[01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:14.350]  And if they didn't think you're going along with it, if they didn't think you bought into it,
[01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:21.350]  they'll take down four of the five grids for a couple of weeks.
[01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:23.350]  And then they'll say, what do we do?
[01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:26.350]  Oh, we just happened to have these emergency plans.
[01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:30.350]  We have an app that you've got to sign on to, to go online,
[01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.350]  whether it's on a desktop or your phone or whatever.
[01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:37.350]  And with this app, we'll know who you are and it'll save things.
[01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:42.350]  And the hackers won't be able to get on to the computers and do all this and get the grid.
[01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:45.350]  And people will be like, damn it, sign up for it, have your job.
[01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:48.350]  Your bosses will be telling you, get on an airline, come on,
[01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:49.350]  the power was off for three weeks.
[01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:51.350]  You want this to happen again?
[01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:53.350]  And there'll be this peer pressure.
[01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.350]  Just go along to get along.
[01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:57.350]  Even though you're signing up for the control grid,
[01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.350]  even though you're being signed up for the social credit score,
[01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:01.350]  you're being put into the internet of things.
[01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:03.350]  You're still be like, damn it, just get on board.
[01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:05.350]  Let's just get over this.
[01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:07.350]  And the noose just got tighter.
[01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:09.350]  And it just gets tighter and tighter.
[01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:11.350]  And I'm not just saying that.
[01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.350]  They say when the cyber terrorists attack,
[01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:16.350]  they're going to have to shut the web down.
[01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:18.350]  They're going to have to shut the web down to protect it.
[01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:20.350]  And we're going to have to give them an ID,
[01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:22.350]  which we have ready for you.
[01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:24.350]  So it's all here.
[01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.350]  And so it's not hard to predict.
[01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.350]  It's like, oh, how does Jones predict it?
[01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:31.350]  It's not hard, people.
[01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:33.350]  You have to admit predators are coming after you.
[01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.350]  This is real.
[01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:37.350]  But I told you, it's one thing for them to say the Russians are going to take the power grid.
[01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:40.350]  I said when they come out and say the general public are terrorists,
[01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:42.350]  because we're all white supremacists,
[01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:45.350]  and then they say we're going to take down the power grid, that's new.
[01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:48.350]  That's my prediction.
[01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:53.350]  That right there lets you know they can do it next week.
[01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:56.350]  I think they'll do it like a few months before the election, probably next year.
[01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:58.350]  But who knows?
[01:21:59.350 --> 01:22:00.350]  So we better get out ahead of this right now.
[01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:02.350]  Because if you think the lockdowns and the COVID,
[01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:04.350]  the millions dead from that was bad,
[01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:06.350]  ladies and gentlemen, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:08.350]  They talk about climate lockdowns
[01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:12.350]  and artificially cutting off power to make you, quote, reach greenhouse limits.
[01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:14.350]  They are throttling humanity.
[01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:15.350]  They are shutting us down.
[01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:17.350]  This is their goal.
[01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:22.830]  Extinction Rebellion is just the lower level manifestation of these people.
[01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:24.830]  Oh, Troyer, you've got the floor for the next five minutes.
[01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:26.830]  You've been very patient there, my compadre.
[01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:28.830]  Give us your take on the situation.
[01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:32.830]  Well, you know, most Americans, if you tried to tell them about this,
[01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:34.830]  probably couldn't even comprehend it, Alex.
[01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:37.830]  It's knowledge that they've never even been near before,
[01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:40.830]  so it's kind of a harder thing for them to understand.
[01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:44.830]  But the basic understanding that, I mean, even I had,
[01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:47.830]  I would imagine most Americans have at some point in their lives,
[01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:50.830]  sometimes it leads them to liberalism, quite frankly,
[01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:54.830]  is this resentment towards government,
[01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:59.830]  this resentment towards some untouchable, unseen body
[01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:03.830]  that can dictate your life, interfere in your life, intervene in your life
[01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:05.830]  at any given moment.
[01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:09.830]  And I think this is what actually turns a lot of people to the left,
[01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:12.830]  or at least it used to, because it was very anti-establishment,
[01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:14.830]  it was very anti-government.
[01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:17.830]  That was kind of the liberalism of the 90s and early 2000s.
[01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:20.830]  Well, now modern-day liberalism is just total establishment
[01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:24.830]  as their thought leaders and their political leaders
[01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:26.830]  have taken over all these systems.
[01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:28.830]  But the government still persists.
[01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:31.830]  The government intervening in your life still persists.
[01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:34.830]  Stealing your money, you know,
[01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:37.830]  dictating what your kids are going to be indoctrinated into,
[01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:39.830]  that is still there.
[01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:45.830]  The problem is it's understanding that there's a level on top of that,
[01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:48.830]  which we refer to as the globalists, the World Economic Forum,
[01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:51.830]  they implement things like the Great Reset.
[01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:56.830]  They want to have a permanent infrastructure of a global government,
[01:23:56.830 --> 01:24:00.830]  which is fascistic in nature, aligned with the major corporations,
[01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:03.830]  the ones that will be left, the ones that will be allowed to operate.
[01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:07.830]  That's part of what all this gay pride propaganda is all about.
[01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:11.830]  It's the same reason why you're going to start seeing clips from Fox News now,
[01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:14.830]  where you'll have people talking about the Target boycotts
[01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:17.830]  and Chick-fil-A boycotts or stuff like that for the gay pride stuff.
[01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:19.830]  And you'll have Fox News people saying,
[01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:22.830]  oh, no, no, we've got to be careful, let's not do these boycotts, it's okay.
[01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:25.830]  Because Fox News is going to eventually start promoting it too.
[01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:28.830]  It's just inevitable if you want to exist after the Great Reset.
[01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:33.830]  So if we can just take this natural inclination,
[01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:37.830]  this organic human nature to reject government,
[01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:40.830]  this unnatural tyranny over man,
[01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:44.830]  and then get people to understand this is what it's going to look like in the future.
[01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.830]  You've just had a taste of it with COVID,
[01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.830]  or you've just had a taste of it with property taxes,
[01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:51.830]  or you're just getting a taste of it with the indoctrination in the schools
[01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:55.830]  and all the other stuff, the diversity, the equity,
[01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:57.830]  all this other crap that they shove down your throat.
[01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:59.830]  This is just a taste of it.
[01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:01.830]  This is just the portal opening in it,
[01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.830]  where if you don't buy in digital currency, you won't be able to buy or sell.
[01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:09.830]  They're going to make it impossible to own anything.
[01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:11.830]  You won't even be legally allowed to farm.
[01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:13.830]  So that's the understanding.
[01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:16.830]  How do you get people to that level of understanding?
[01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:21.830]  What is the skeleton key to access that understanding?
[01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:24.830]  And by the way, Owen, what you say is dead on.
[01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:26.830]  I mean, it's not like it's coming.
[01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:31.830]  I made the Obama deception six months after he was in office.
[01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:32.830]  It was out.
[01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:35.830]  And I said they'll ban farming in the future because they said that,
[01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.830]  and that only weird chemical bug farms will operate.
[01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:40.830]  They're now announcing they're going to ban traditional farming.
[01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:42.830]  They even say organic farming is bad.
[01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:44.830]  And people hear that and go, that's not true.
[01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:46.830]  CNN headline, we need to cut down all the trees.
[01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:47.830]  They're bad.
[01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:48.830]  They're carbon.
[01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:50.830]  Folks, these people mean business.
[01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:52.830]  They are declaring war on life itself.
[01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:58.830]  They are a psychotic group of anti, not just humans, but anti-carbon cult.
[01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:00.830]  That's why I think they're run by aliens.
[01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:03.830]  I believe in God, the devils, the fallen angel.
[01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:04.830]  It's all right there.
[01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:09.830]  But the point is, literally, if I was just a top general or an analyst,
[01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:11.830]  and I didn't believe in God, and I was looking at this,
[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:14.830]  and I'd say, why are they going against the plants and the animals
[01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:18.830]  and the biosphere, and why are they attacking with all their real moves,
[01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:22.830]  with genetic engineering and GMO and toxic chemicals and all of it.
[01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:26.830]  They're actually killing the earth while they're the guardians of the earth.
[01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:30.830]  And while the earth is dying, they're telling you they're trying to save it,
[01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:31.830]  and you're killing it.
[01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:32.830]  Oh, look, it's dying.
[01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:33.830]  It's your fault.
[01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:35.830]  Do what I say more, and it might come back.
[01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:37.830]  Oh, look, it's dying faster.
[01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:39.830]  I mean, it's just a cover story.
[01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:41.830]  It's like Oblivion with Tom Cruise.
[01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:43.830]  Don't really like Tom Cruise, but that's a great movie,
[01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:46.830]  where there's a cover story where they think, oh, earth's been destroyed.
[01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:48.830]  We're going to go to this new planet.
[01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:52.830]  But really, it's just a big AI robot sucking all the water out for its engines
[01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:56.830]  to go to the next civilization and suck it dry.
[01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:58.830]  We're literally being sucked dry, though.
[01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:59.830]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:02.830]  It's just that this is so ridiculously obvious now.
[01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:07.830]  Well, that's actually one of my favorite movies ever because it's in that realization.
[01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:11.830]  It's in that realization the whole world was a lie,
[01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:15.830]  but there's kind of that subtle moment of Tom Cruise's character.
[01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:16.830]  He knew it the whole time.
[01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:18.830]  Like, he knew it was a lie the whole time.
[01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:21.830]  He just couldn't understand it, so he kept going through the motions
[01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.830]  until he saw it for himself.
[01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:25.830]  But here's an example, Alex.
[01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:31.830]  About 10 years ago, probably, is when Airbnb started to get popular.
[01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:36.830]  And at the time, everybody may remember, if you were using Airbnb,
[01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:40.830]  unironically, I've been banned for no cause or reason at all.
[01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:42.830]  Just one day, they just banned me out of nowhere.
[01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:48.830]  But Airbnb used to be so much better than going to a hotel for multiple reasons.
[01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.830]  It was a lot cheaper.
[01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:51.830]  You had your own privacy.
[01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:56.830]  You had more selection upon what type of place you wanted to stay at.
[01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:57.830]  Airbnb was taking over.
[01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:01.830]  Well, now it's kind of reached this point where hotels are popular again,
[01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:05.830]  and Airbnb is more expensive, and nobody likes using Airbnb anymore.
[01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:08.830]  So it's kind of the same thing they're trying to sell us with this new world order.
[01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:10.830]  It's like, oh, it looks good.
[01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:12.830]  It's like, oh, yeah, alternative energy.
[01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.830]  It's like, oh, yeah, we're kind of approaching things from a global scale.
[01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:16.830]  We're in a global marketplace.
[01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:18.830]  It's like, oh, yeah, you know, this all kind of feels good.
[01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:21.830]  It all kind of seems innovative, and maybe this is going to be a good thing.
[01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:25.830]  But then it catches up, and you realize, same thing, what's going on with Airbnb?
[01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:28.830]  Now people realize, you know what, I'd rather stay in a hotel.
[01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:30.830]  I don't really like what goes on in the Airbnbs.
[01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:31.830]  They're messier.
[01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:33.830]  They're more expensive now.
[01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:34.830]  I've got 500 service fees.
[01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:36.830]  I think I'm just going to go to the hotel.
[01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.830]  That was the system that worked.
[01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:41.830]  This is the realization we're going to have here soon, Alex, if not already.
[01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:46.830]  This whole globalist system, global government, yeah, you know what, they kind of had a nice package.
[01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:47.830]  It kind of sucks.
[01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:49.830]  Let's go back to self-government.
[01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:50.830]  Let's go back to independence.
[01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:52.830]  Let's go back to sovereign nation states.
[01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:53.830]  That's what works.
[01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:56.830]  That's what made us successful and raised our standard of living.
[01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:57.830]  I totally agree, Owen.
[01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:58.830]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:03.830]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely
[01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:08.830]  popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste full of essential oils.
[01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:11.830]  Back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:15.830]  Another great product sold out for almost a year is our activated charcoal essential
[01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:17.830]  oil toothpaste as well.
[01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:22.830]  These are both incredible for your gums, polish your teeth, amazing to counter gingivitis,
[01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:23.830]  and they fund the InfoWars.
[01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:26.830]  There are no fillers in these products.
[01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:32.830]  These are fluoride free, next level toothpaste, 10,000 of each tube, limited run, available
[01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:35.830]  exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:40.830]  And your purchase funds the operation, plus these are incredible products you need.
[01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:44.830]  So the coral calcium tooth whitening and the activated charcoal essential oil toothpaste
[01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:48.830]  are now both back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:52.830]  I thank you for your support, but regardless, these are great products you need.
[01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:53.830]  So take action now.
[01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:57.830]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com for both this great toothpaste back in stock.
[01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:00.830]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:02.830]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.830]  It will change your life.
[01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:09.830]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have
[01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:13.830]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:18.830]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:24.830]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:28.830]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:35.830]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:38.830]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:42.830]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:44.830]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:46.830]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:48.830]  You and your family need it.
[01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:50.830]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:54.830]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:57.830]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:01.830]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:06.830]  is a historic book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:07.830]  That is the hellish future.
[01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:11.830]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:14.830]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:17.830]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:20.830]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:22.830]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:25.830]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:28.830]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:30.830]  a signed copy, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:34.830]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:37.830]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:40.830]  You'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:43.830]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:44.830]  or unsigned copies.
[01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:48.830]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTore.com
[01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:51.830]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:54.830]  and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:55.830]  This is an InfoWar.
[01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:57.830]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:01.830]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:06.830]  I want you all to know something.
[01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:08.830]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:12.830]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:15.830]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:19.830]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:21.830]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:25.830]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:29.830]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:32.830]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:33.830]  Years ago.
[01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:35.830]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:37.830]  Not for a second.
[01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:40.830]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:42.830]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:45.830]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:47.830]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:50.830]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:32:56.610 --> 01:33:06.610]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:27.240]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.240]  the InfoWar.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:36.040]  Hi ladies and gentlemen, I want to cover the listeners right now and just lay it on the
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.480]  line for you.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:44.720]  You've just heard an hour and a half of hardcore, tip of the spear, game-changing intel that
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.640]  can save our species and the future of humanity, and you're not going to have to wait and see
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640]  the New World Order take over.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.520]  I've been doing this 29 years.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.080]  You now get front seats to this.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.760]  You can be spectators and be run over, or you can get in the arena and win.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.040]  Let me explain something.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.160]  You're in this stadium, whether you like it or not, and being in the bleachers is the worst
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.160]  place to be.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.560]  That's where the flying monkeys of the New World Order are pulling people's eyeballs
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560]  out.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.480]  Down in the arena is where you want to be.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.440]  And yes, when you're sitting up in the stands, you'll have a little gremlin attack, it'll
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:21.400]  be a low-level system, but it's more dangerous, because they're like zombies, they keep going.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:28.080]  You want to be down on the floor, in the heat, going up against the big bosses.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:33.440]  Because if you actually pull back and look at this as a gladiatorial event, with seven
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.480]  million people in the stands and a billion people on the grid, there's a few thousand
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.080]  globalists and a few million minions that serve them.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:52.920]  And if you looked at the field of a billion people on the field, 990 plus million.
[01:34:52.990 --> 01:35:06.950]  The vast majority, 90 plus percent are our people, but here's the problem, those players
[01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:11.990]  on the field, those gladiators might stick a sword out once a month, might put a shield
[01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:15.670]  up every once in a while, they realize they're on the field, but they don't think of it as
[01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:20.389]  themselves like being in the front of the fight, okay?
[01:35:20.389 --> 01:35:25.230]  And so imagine, we're on the field against a few thousand globalists, and a few million
[01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:30.070]  of their minions, and we have hundreds of millions of our people at every level of society
[01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:36.070]  with eyes and ears, we're the real intelligence, we're the real AI, we're everywhere, and most
[01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:39.190]  of our people are not swinging for the fences.
[01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:43.349]  So even those of you on the field, really, how hard are you fighting?
[01:35:43.349 --> 01:35:47.550]  I'm gonna ask you that question, because they're gonna take your food away, they're gonna take
[01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:50.349]  your energy away, they're gonna take your children away, they're gonna take your dignity
[01:35:50.349 --> 01:35:53.550]  away, they're gonna take your right to self-defense away, they're already killing babies up to
[01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:58.070]  birth in like 20-something states in the U.S., I mean, how far has this gotta go?
[01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:59.630]  How much humiliation you gotta take?
[01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:05.070]  And I'm gonna say this again, I'm not running around looking for a fight, I need to prove
[01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:10.110]  myself, you know, I love that famous who song, it will come in the next segment playing it,
[01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:16.510]  I forget the name of it, but he's like, I don't have to fight to prove I'm right.
[01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:22.110]  Out here in the fields, it's great poetry, maybe you guys can text message me the lyrics
[01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:24.349]  to that song, forget the name of it.
[01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:28.550]  That's what this is.
[01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:33.070]  So I'm doing this because I believe in you and I know we can beat him.
[01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:36.990]  But also, again, when people call and say, oh, you're such a hero, you got such courage.
[01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:37.990]  No, man.
[01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.990]  This is not courage.
[01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:44.670]  I mean, if I was at the gas pump pumping gas and it blew up, I got gasoline on me.
[01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:47.390]  I'm going to roll to get the fire out, not because I'm a hero, because I don't want
[01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:48.390]  to die.
[01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:53.470]  I mean, I talk about this a lot because if listeners will just get this through your
[01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:57.350]  head and get it through other people's heads, you're going to get the answers to things.
[01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:14.370]  If I'm in a parking lot loading groceries in my car, and some mugger comes over and punches me in the back of the head, and I get up and open a can of whoop-ass and jump on top of him and bash some brains out on the ground, it's because I'm aligned with my instincts to not roll over and die.
[01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:17.370]  It's not courage. It's default. I'm going to kill you.
[01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:25.370]  I don't want somebody to attack me, but if you do, I am going to attack you back.
[01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:28.370]  And that's what this is all about, is getting aligned with your instincts.
[01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:32.370]  But we're being hit by a more sophisticated, multivariate system.
[01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:39.370]  And so all I'm saying is, when you're being attacked, fighting back against it isn't courage, it's survival.
[01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:41.370]  I've said this a hundred times, I'll say it again.
[01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:51.370]  If somebody tied bowling balls to your legs and threw you into the deep end of a swimming pool, when you're fighting with everything you've got to swim back to the surface,
[01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:57.590]  and you're starting to get the bowling balls off, you got to go harder, you're going to
[01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:58.110]  get out.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.020]  Is that courage?
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:06.020]  No one would take blind, mindless, stupid courage and say, well, my time has come.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:10.020]  I'll enjoy the last few minutes before I suffocate and drink water into my lungs.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.020]  I'm going to sit here at 10 feet under the water with bowling balls here.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:17.020]  And I'm just, you know, I'm going to take this.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.020]  No.
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:29.620]  When a raccoon gets caught in a trap, and you know somebody's coming to kill him in an hour, and he chews through his arm, does the raccoon have courage?
[01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:36.750]  Or does a raccoon have life force?
[01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:40.790]  Anybody knows about a raccoon, they're real sweet and funny, till you corner even a little
[01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:41.790]  one.
[01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:45.510]  Or a big one can kill a dog, they can grab a dog by the ears, shove its head in the water,
[01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:46.510]  they'll drown.
[01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:47.510]  Bloodhounds.
[01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:52.150]  But the point is, it's a raccoon, what is it about that little, or a wolverine, it's
[01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:58.190]  a little bitty, it'll attack and dominate a mountain lion that weighs five times, ten
[01:38:58.190 --> 01:38:59.190]  times more.
[01:38:59.630 --> 01:39:03.950]  It has a spirit, folks, and it's not courage, it's living.
[01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:09.750]  It's not rolling over, it's not dying, it's not bowing down.
[01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:13.710]  That's all I'm saying to you, is it's not heroic to fight back.
[01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:15.910]  It's life force.
[01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:16.910]  It's default.
[01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:20.990]  It's not heroic if you see a three-year-old somehow opens the front door of their house
[01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:25.470]  and runs out into a busy road, and you run over and grab the little kid.
[01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:28.910]  It's instinct, because if your kid was doing that, you'd want somebody else to do that
[01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:29.910]  for your kid.
[01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:32.910]  You see it as your child, because it is collectively your child.
[01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:36.190]  They say it takes a village, that's the truth, but a real village are real people that know
[01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:41.150]  each other and trust each other, not a UN, New World Order, globalist village, I'd destroy
[01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:44.470]  us saying it's the village.
[01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:46.830]  Let me say this and go to break and come back with Owen.
[01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:51.710]  I just did two and a half hours, went out two hours and 40-something minutes with not
[01:39:51.710 --> 01:39:56.630]  one plug, and if we don't do the plugs and sell the products, we won't be here.
[01:39:56.630 --> 01:40:01.190]  Plus, again, these are really powerful products you need, so I want to encourage everybody
[01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:05.550]  to go to InfoWarsTore.com, ultimate fish oil, ultimate krill oil, the highest grades of
[01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:09.750]  fish and krill oil, and we've only had enough money to buy limited supplies.
[01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:14.550]  A lot of products have been back in stock, but we have to sell out of all of those to
[01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:19.430]  get enough money to buy a bigger shipment and then get back on our feet, and we're very
[01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:23.110]  close, but we still need to discount products, because that's when you buy them is when we
[01:40:23.110 --> 01:40:24.110]  discount them.
[01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:30.550]  Ultimate fish oil, ultimate krill oil are both still discounted right now, but only until
[01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:31.550]  next Tuesday.
[01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:34.670]  It's got to end next Tuesday.
[01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:38.550]  It's got to stop, because they're very close to selling out, and then we'll put it back
[01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:41.670]  to regular price for a month or so until hopefully more comes in.
[01:40:41.670 --> 01:40:45.750]  We've got to put all the profit we have from that forward to get a bigger shipment and
[01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:50.310]  then have enough product to basically be clean sailing, so we're barely in the black.
[01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:53.230]  If people just buy the products, which you already need that are great, we'll be able
[01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:57.590]  to get bigger shipments and be stabilized again and be able to stay on air, so they're
[01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:59.150]  great products you need.
[01:40:59.150 --> 01:41:00.310]  They're discounted right now.
[01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:03.310]  They're selling out, and your purchase keeps the broadcast on air.
[01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:05.590]  The only way we fail is you don't take action.
[01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:10.310]  Also, we're going to have to end the sale on TurboForce.
[01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:12.510]  Sold out for seven, eight months, finally got back in.
[01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:14.430]  We've sold out of 90% of it.
[01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:16.430]  It'll go back to full price next week.
[01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:18.590]  Last chance to get TurboForce discounted.
[01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:20.790]  And X3, we got a limited shipment.
[01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:24.590]  It was a pretty good-sized shipment, but it was one of the only main products we had.
[01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:26.870]  We've sold out of 85% of that.
[01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:30.030]  We got a couple thousand bottles left, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:33.550]  And when it's gone, it's going to be gone for at least three to six months.
[01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:38.750]  So the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine sold out for, again, almost a year.
[01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:41.950]  It's finally back in stock, X3.
[01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:44.110]  Billions of people have cognitive disabilities who lack iodine.
[01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:45.750]  Most iodine's bound to other compounds.
[01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:46.750]  This is pure iodine.
[01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:47.750]  You need it.
[01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:48.750]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:51.590]  Last chance to get X3 discounted.
[01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:53.630]  Last chance to get TurboForce discounted.
[01:41:53.630 --> 01:41:55.790]  Last chance to get Ultimate Crystal Oil discounted.
[01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:58.270]  Last chance to get Ultimate Fish Oil discounted.
[01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:03.950]  Last chance on all of these next Tuesday, the sale on these ends.
[01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:08.110]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:13.750]  And it's also your last chance to get Alex Jones for President shirts and Donald Trump
[01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:15.150]  political prisoner shirts.
[01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:16.150]  We're not printing anymore.
[01:42:16.150 --> 01:42:17.830]  They're limited edition.
[01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:19.270]  It's your last chance to get those.
[01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:20.270]  I need your support.
[01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:22.030]  Plus, these are historic products.
[01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:23.630]  It's an adventure to wear the shirts.
[01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:28.630]  Go now to Infowarsstore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:42:28.630 --> 01:42:33.030]  Get a book, get a film, get a T-shirt, and just look at how we've delivered.
[01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:35.430]  It's not like Gladiator was like, are you not entertained?
[01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:36.590]  Are you not invigorated?
[01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:37.990]  Are you not inspired?
[01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:39.670]  Are we not fighting hard together?
[01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:40.670]  It's a simple action.
[01:42:40.670 --> 01:42:44.910]  Take it and break the will of the globalists, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:47.430]  But whatever you do, share the word about the broadcast.
[01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.430]  Pray for the broadcast.
[01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:53.430]  Keep taking clips out of the show and four-wind it, because we are going to win together.
[01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:55.430]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:58.430]  Now take action.
[01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:02.930]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:04.430]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:05.430]  People said, no way.
[01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:06.430]  He's the most powerful.
[01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:07.430]  It never happened.
[01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:08.930]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:11.930]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:14.930]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:16.930]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:22.430]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like
[01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:23.430]  Joe Rogan.
[01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:26.930]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:28.930]  And when you support us, we are unstoppable.
[01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:33.430]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:37.430]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:40.430]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:42.930]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:44.430]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:48.430]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products
[01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:50.430]  at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:51.430]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:56.430]  Go to infowarsstore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit
[01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.430]  to these tyrants.
[01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:04.430]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:06.430]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:07.430]  It is.
[01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:11.430]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:13.430]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:15.430]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:17.430]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:20.430]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:23.430]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:24.430]  And I'm just sorry.
[01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:25.430]  You want something like this?
[01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:26.430]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:28.430]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:29.430]  It's so good, in my view.
[01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:31.430]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.430]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:36.430]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:42.430]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:48.430]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:51.430]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:52.430]  I just can't do it.
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:00.430]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:05.430]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:09.430]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:10.430]  It takes commitment.
[01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:14.430]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarStore.com
[01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:17.430]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life
[01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:21.430]  while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:26.430]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book,
[01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:28.430]  The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth,
[01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:33.430]  Back and Stop, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have
[01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:37.430]  that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:39.430]  It's all available at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:41.430]  Some of the very best products.
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:43.430]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarStore.
[01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:45.430]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years,
[01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:48.430]  but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarStore.
[01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:51.430]  These are great products that really work and are amazing,
[01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:52.430]  plus they keep us on air.
[01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:54.430]  So again, please take action.
[01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:57.430]  Go to InfoWarStore.com today, and I thank you.
[01:45:57.430 --> 01:46:01.430]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:04.430]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:09.430]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:13.430]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:16.430]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:19.430]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:24.430]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:28.430]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:33.430]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day
[01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:38.430]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:44.430]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:50.430]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:57.430]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:46:57.430 --> 01:47:05.430]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:28.620]  Crashing through the lies and misinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:34.420]  Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals, I get my back into my living, I don't need
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:41.420]  to fight to prove I'm right, I don't need to be forgiven, bring it up.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:58.220]  Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals, I get my back into my living, I don't need
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:14.300]  to fight to prove I'm right, I don't need to be forgiven, you hear that ADL, I know
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:22.860]  you're evil, I'm not and I love you, I'm not like you, yeah, yeah, yeah, don't cry, don't
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:29.540]  raise your eye, it's only a wasteland you're in, and I'm not in it with you, the exodus
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:36.380]  is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we get much older, all of
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:37.380]  us, stop it now, damn it.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:38.380]  Don't cry, don't raise your eye, it's only a wasteland you're in, and I'm not in it with
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:58.380]  you, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we get much
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:27.380]  longer, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we get
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:48.380]  much longer, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:50:17.380]  get much longer, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:43.380]  get much longer, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we get
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:51:07.380]  much longer, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we get much
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:36.380]  longer, the exodus is here, the happy ones are near, let's get together before we get much longer, the

[02:08:48.250 --> 02:08:53.250]  An emergency lawsuit to the EU trying to block it.
[02:08:53.250 --> 02:09:00.250]  Saying it'll cause blood clots, myocarditis, and strokes amongst sterilization, all of it.
[02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:04.250]  You just saw Owen last hour reading new studies about attacks to testicles, attacks to everything.
[02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:06.250]  I mean, it's a bioweapon.
[02:09:06.250 --> 02:09:11.250]  All four of the so-called vaccines, whether they're VirusVector, the J&J AstraZeneca,
[02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:16.250]  which are just as bad as Moderna or Pfizer, they use nanotech and mRNA.
[02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:22.250]  The others use a re-engineered chimpanzee DNA added with RNA.
[02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:25.250]  I'm not a scientist, but I read what they do.
[02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:34.250]  Firing a virus in, carrying a reprogram to make your cell create spike protein that's highly poisonous.
[02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:36.250]  This is spike protein from HIV.
[02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:38.250]  Can't make it up, isn't it?
[02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:40.250]  And Fauci was behind that.
[02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:43.250]  So they're just retooling another weapon that is nanotech.
[02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:47.250]  We've been hit with a nanotech bioweapon that, by the way, does it just from the shots.
[02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:50.250]  It shits.
[02:09:50.250 --> 02:09:52.250]  So this is just off the chart right now.
[02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:55.250]  So Jamie Foxx is fighting for his life.
[02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:56.250]  Hadn't been seen in months.
[02:09:56.250 --> 02:09:57.250]  It is the shots.
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:10:03.250]  And here's yet another individual that has talked directly to the folks and given the information.
[02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:04.250]  They're trying to suppress this.
[02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:05.250]  Get this out.
[02:10:05.250 --> 02:10:06.250]  Here it is.
[02:10:06.250 --> 02:10:12.250]  And I lost a few friends the last couple of years who got the injection.
[02:10:12.250 --> 02:10:16.250]  One of my best friends died last Saturday.
[02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:22.250]  Paratrooper, ex-special forces, 51 years old, in best shape of his life.
[02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:24.250]  I mean, lived life.
[02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:25.250]  You have no idea.
[02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:27.250]  Just goes to sleep, doesn't wake up.
[02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:28.250]  Black guy.
[02:10:28.250 --> 02:10:33.250]  I think this ties into the Jamie Foxx theory.
[02:10:33.250 --> 02:10:38.250]  I worked my butt off to get a story about what happened to Jamie Foxx.
[02:10:38.250 --> 02:10:40.250]  It was all baloney what they were reporting.
[02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:41.250]  He's playing pickleball.
[02:10:41.250 --> 02:10:43.250]  He's responding on Instagram.
[02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:44.250]  No, he's not.
[02:10:44.250 --> 02:10:45.250]  People do that for you.
[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:46.250]  It's all lies.
[02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:56.250]  I had somebody in the room who let me know that Jamie had a blood clot in his brain after he got the shot.
[02:10:56.250 --> 02:10:57.250]  He did not want the shot.
[02:10:57.250 --> 02:11:01.250]  But the movie he was on, he was pressured to get it.
[02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:03.250]  This movie he's doing with Cameron Diaz.
[02:11:03.250 --> 02:11:10.250]  And I'm thinking, is that why he blew up on the set a week before this medical emergency happened?
[02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:15.250]  Is that why he fired three or four people because he just had had it with these mandates?
[02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:16.250]  I don't know.
[02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:27.250]  But what I found out from the man in the room was that the blood clot in the brain caused him at that point to be partially paralyzed and blind.
[02:11:27.250 --> 02:11:32.250]  Because if you read into what they were saying early on, he's communicating with us.
[02:11:32.250 --> 02:11:33.250]  That doesn't mean talking.
[02:11:33.250 --> 02:11:34.250]  That could be anything.
[02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:37.250]  It could be writing, signing.
[02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:39.250]  I know those little code words.
[02:11:39.250 --> 02:11:44.250]  And then when you tell me your father's playing pickleball, give me a break.
[02:11:44.250 --> 02:11:45.250]  You know, I don't know.
[02:11:45.250 --> 02:11:48.250]  There's a great shroud of secrets.
[02:11:48.250 --> 02:11:52.250]  Probably the most multi-talented person we have in Hollywood.
[02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:55.250]  But even TMZ is not reporting this.
[02:11:55.250 --> 02:12:01.250]  And I know TMZ has got sources in hospitals who give them information, whether it's legal or not.
[02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:02.250]  But they're not.
[02:12:02.250 --> 02:12:05.250]  Mike Tyson got close.
[02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:12.250]  I think after I broke my story on my show, Mike Tyson said that Jamie had a blood clot in his brain.
[02:12:12.250 --> 02:12:15.250]  No one's gone that far to say that yet.
[02:12:15.250 --> 02:12:17.250]  I think Mike did, and he probably got a phone call.
[02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:18.250]  Hold on.
[02:12:18.250 --> 02:12:28.250]  AJ, let me sort of step back a little bit from what you're saying and just say, look, blood in the brain is a cerebral bleed.
[02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:29.250]  It's not a stroke.
[02:12:29.250 --> 02:12:36.250]  A stroke is a blood clot in an artery to the brain that cuts off the blood supply to the brain and the brain dies.
[02:12:36.250 --> 02:12:41.250]  So we're talking about, and it's been widely known that he had a stroke, right?
[02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:43.250]  I mean, they've said stroke many times.
[02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:44.250]  Yeah.
[02:12:44.250 --> 02:12:48.250]  So it's to say it's a blood clot in the brain is sort of, it's a stroke.
[02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:51.250]  It's a blood clot in an artery that cuts off the supply.
[02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:53.250]  That part of the brain is dead.
[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:56.250]  And it has very serious consequences.
[02:12:56.250 --> 02:13:02.250]  It depends on which artery and what the anatomy of that artery is to what parts of the brain and whatnot.
[02:13:02.250 --> 02:13:07.250]  But it is not something that, I mean, let's put it this way.
[02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:08.250]  Is he still in the hospital?
[02:13:08.250 --> 02:13:10.250]  Is that what I'm supposed to believe?
[02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:11.250]  And playing pickleball?
[02:13:11.250 --> 02:13:14.250]  It's all baloney.
[02:13:14.250 --> 02:13:15.250]  It's all baloney.
[02:13:15.250 --> 02:13:17.250]  The daughters are doing the speaking for him.
[02:13:17.250 --> 02:13:19.250]  His oldest daughter, Corinne, is doing the speaking.
[02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:22.250]  She said he's been out of the hospital for weeks, but that's not true.
[02:13:23.250 --> 02:13:28.250]  He's at a very good hospital in Chicago, which specializes in this kind of rehab.
[02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:36.250]  And every friend who comes out, whether it's Kevin Hart or Nick Cannon or whoever, all says pray for Jamie.
[02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:37.250]  He's got to get through this.
[02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:39.250]  Nobody comes out with great news.
[02:13:39.250 --> 02:13:42.250]  It's always somber.
[02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:43.250]  All right.
[02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:46.250]  And remember DeMar Hamlin?
[02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:53.250]  I don't think he's dead, but I agree with folks who pointed out that he did die on the field.
[02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:55.250]  Had to be resuscitated on the field, reportedly in the ambulance.
[02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:57.250]  That's confirmed.
[02:13:57.250 --> 02:14:04.250]  And then he shows up with a mask over his face for the NFL because I believe he was still in the hospital at that point.
[02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:09.250]  And then they put out this video where you can't see the tattoos on his arms.
[02:14:09.250 --> 02:14:12.250]  And it had that AI look.
[02:14:12.250 --> 02:14:18.250]  If you've got enough footage of somebody, you can do an AI spoof.
[02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:22.250]  You can do that same thing.
[02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:34.250]  I'm not saying he's dead, but, again, I can walk into a showroom to buy furniture and look 70 feet away and see a bowl of fake fruit.
[02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:35.250]  And you can see the bananas.
[02:14:35.250 --> 02:14:36.250]  You can see the apples.
[02:14:36.250 --> 02:14:37.250]  You can see the grapes.
[02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:42.250]  And your brain is so sophisticated, from 50 feet away, you know it's fake.
[02:14:42.250 --> 02:14:43.250]  Not just because you're in a showroom.
[02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:45.250]  Sometimes they have real apples out there.
[02:14:45.250 --> 02:14:47.250]  You walk over, it's fake.
[02:14:47.250 --> 02:14:51.250]  Looks real, but you just know it's fake because it's got a certain thing about it.
[02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:58.250]  And I watched that DeMar Hamlin when everybody was saying he was really dead, and they put that video out.
[02:14:58.250 --> 02:14:59.250]  I'm fine.
[02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:00.250]  I'm doing great.
[02:15:00.250 --> 02:15:01.250]  I'm wonderful.
[02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:06.250]  And he looked, what I noticed was, I'm not a big NFL guy, but I looked at photos of him on the field, interviews he'd done,
[02:15:06.250 --> 02:15:09.250]  and his muscles were as big or bigger.
[02:15:09.250 --> 02:15:12.250]  You think after a heart attack and all this stuff, you're going to look the same?
[02:15:12.250 --> 02:15:13.250]  No.
[02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:17.250]  So, again, the point is, it's completely normal to question this.
[02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:26.250]  Like, at the time of the San Bernardino shooting in, what, 2015, all the local news said three white men in black uniforms were shooting everybody.
[02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:27.250]  Now, I'm not defending Islam.
[02:15:27.250 --> 02:15:32.250]  I just said local news and all these witnesses, including retired police, saw this.
[02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:37.250]  Now it's in the FBI report there were other shooters, and it was the local police guns given to them.
[02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:38.250]  I'm not saying the police did it.
[02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:41.250]  I'm just saying what we were told isn't the truth.
[02:15:41.250 --> 02:15:45.250]  And they do not want us asking these questions.
[02:15:45.250 --> 02:15:49.250]  They do not want us using our brains because then we're going to find the truth.
[02:15:49.250 --> 02:15:51.250]  I'm just saying ask the questions.
[02:15:51.250 --> 02:15:52.250]  But where is Jamie Foxx?
[02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:54.250]  Because I see the stories, oh, he's playing pickleball.
[02:15:54.250 --> 02:15:56.250]  He's fine, but you can't see him.
[02:15:57.930 --> 02:16:03.930]  And then Mike Tyson, who I know is friends with him, he's been on the show and I know they're friends.
[02:16:03.930 --> 02:16:11.930]  He calls up, it's Mike Tyson, he has a stroke, he's really bad, they may take the shot, it's a huge deal, take Ice Cube.
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:22.580]  He refused and what turned out was $9 million to be in a movie just last year.
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:28.620]  Hollywood aren't just a bunch of rapists that want to rape little kids.
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:31.620]  They want to rape everybody.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:34.820]  They want to rape you.
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:35.820]  They want to rape me.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.820]  They want control of our bodies.
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:37.820]  They want to sacrifice us.
[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:39.820]  That's what their God wants.
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:41.820]  With the fluoride, the water, the GMO,
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.820]  the chemtrails, the poison shots,
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:45.820]  and the 5G, and all the rest of it.
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:46.820]  And we've got to stop fighting with each other
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:47.820]  over what color we are.
[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:49.820]  It doesn't mean if you're some black guy
[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:50.820]  in some weird southern town,
[02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:52.820]  and a bunch of white guys come to beat your ass,
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.820]  that you don't pull a gun out and defend yourself.
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:56.820]  It doesn't mean if a big group of black racists,
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:57.820]  and this is what's really happening,
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:16:59.820]  come to attack you because you're white,
[02:16:59.820 --> 02:17:00.820]  that's a real thing.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:01.820]  They're idiots.
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:02.820]  You've got to defend yourself.
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:03.820]  And you should have pride that you're white.
[02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:04.820]  You should have pride that you're black.
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:05.820]  You should have pride that you're human.
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:06.820]  There's real beefs going on.
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:09.820]  But the point is the globalists are exacerbating that
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:12.820]  and making it as bad as they can to control people.
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:14.820]  And we're all under attack.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:18.820]  Whether you are Baron Trump,
[02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:20.820]  who I'm not supposed to give sources away,
[02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:22.820]  but he did get damaged.
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:24.820]  He did have convulsions.
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:26.820]  He was 18 months when he got shots.
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:28.820]  And it messed him up for a while.
[02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:29.820]  He's gotten better.
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:31.820]  But it really messed Baron up.
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:32.820]  He's autistic because of it a little bit.
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:33.820]  He's getting better.
[02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:35.820]  And Trump is really pissed we talk about this,
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:36.820]  so I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:38.820]  I mean, I've been told I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:40.820]  Just, you know.
[02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:47.270]  And sorry Trump, I like you in a lot of levels and I'm loyal in things we've
[02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:50.950]  done together, but I'm loyal to children first. So if I talk about Barron and
[02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:53.550]  what's happened to him and it saves a bunch of kids, I'm gonna do it. I'm loyal to
[02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:58.990]  kids, not you. And so if I get bitched at, I'll just tell all of it, okay? But it's a side
[02:17:58.990 --> 02:18:03.230]  issue. It's just because I'm going to Jamie Foxx here. He needs to speak out
[02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:07.210]  before he dies. Because when stuff's this bad and the spike protein's growing in
[02:18:07.210 --> 02:18:10.670]  you like this, I don't think Jamie's gonna make it, okay? I hope he does. Let's
[02:18:10.670 --> 02:18:14.790]  pray for him. But for all we know, he's in a coma. For all we know, he's already
[02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:18.190]  dead. Because they know something like that and you're like, well wait, did they
[02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:21.310]  knew they were gonna kill a bunch of people giving them a shot? It's all a test
[02:18:21.310 --> 02:18:24.910]  to see what they can get away with. And they can get away with killing Jamie
[02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:30.470]  Foxx and all these other people they've done it to and Delmar Hamlin. They can
[02:18:30.470 --> 02:18:35.230]  get away with any of it. And I'm not saying Delmar Hamlin's dead. I'm saying
[02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:39.870]  there's a lot of creepy stuff going on, a lot of spooky stuff going on here. And we
[02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:43.590]  have a right and a duty to ask questions. Because how many times have we been lied to?
[02:18:43.590 --> 02:18:48.590]  Now the FBI reports, yeah, it was police guns and there were other shooters. I got
[02:18:48.590 --> 02:18:52.270]  attacked by the national media saying, oh Jones says San Bernardino didn't
[02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:55.630]  happen. No, they went and shot up a Christmas party. And they killed a bunch
[02:18:55.630 --> 02:18:58.910]  of people. It was horrible. I'm not defending Islam too. I go, those radical
[02:18:58.910 --> 02:19:02.430]  Muslims, why'd they have police guns? Why did the neighbors all know? Why were they
[02:19:02.430 --> 02:19:06.630]  reporting three other men? And now it's in the FBI report years later. Okay, it's
[02:19:06.670 --> 02:19:11.070]  true. Well, then where's the investigation? I don't know what happened
[02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:15.430]  in San Bernardino. I just reported what everybody was saying. And man, it's
[02:19:15.430 --> 02:19:19.310]  surprising how many times where it's not true. I mean, most of the time what
[02:19:19.310 --> 02:19:20.110]  you're told is not true.
[02:19:21.170 --> 02:19:26.170]  I've reached out and interviewed federal marshals and others off-record that responded.
[02:19:26.170 --> 02:19:34.170]  The people that actually showed up when the cops all stood around in West Texas at that big mass shooting,
[02:19:34.170 --> 02:19:39.170]  Evaldi, and they saw the dead kids.
[02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:44.170]  They let that guy sit in there for an hour and a half and kill all of them and sat there with their thumbs up their rear ends
[02:19:44.170 --> 02:19:48.170]  because they thought it was another runaway illegal being chased,
[02:19:48.170 --> 02:19:50.170]  which happens like every day in that town.
[02:19:50.170 --> 02:19:52.170]  And so they go, oh, it's just an illegal.
[02:19:52.170 --> 02:19:56.170]  He's in there because he's in there executing everybody.
[02:19:56.170 --> 02:19:59.170]  And I've talked to people that actually went in and finally stopped it.
[02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:00.170]  But I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:02.170]  I don't want to give away too much.
[02:20:02.170 --> 02:20:05.170]  It's just that we actually look for the truth, OK?
[02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:06.170]  And that's all we're trying to do.
[02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:07.170]  It doesn't mean we always have the answers.
[02:20:07.170 --> 02:20:11.170]  But this Jamie Foxx situation is huge.
[02:20:11.170 --> 02:20:13.170]  Owen Schroeder, what do you think about it?
[02:20:13.170 --> 02:20:17.170]  Well, I think here's one of the key understandings we need to take away from this.
[02:20:17.170 --> 02:20:22.170]  And this is why finding out the whole story, I think, is going to be imperative here.
[02:20:22.170 --> 02:20:27.170]  I think we're learning now from our own experience.
[02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:29.170]  I mean, I do know people that took one vaccine.
[02:20:29.170 --> 02:20:35.170]  And I would say for the most part, there have been side effects.
[02:20:35.170 --> 02:20:41.170]  But for the most part, younger, healthier people, one vaccine doesn't seem to do the irreparable damage.
[02:20:41.170 --> 02:20:48.170]  It's once you start getting two, three, four, now you're really starting to take the risk.
[02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:52.170]  And so if Foxx got three shots, then we need to know that.
[02:20:52.170 --> 02:20:56.170]  If you get one shot, the odds of you making it out all right are better.
[02:20:56.170 --> 02:20:58.170]  It's kind of like a game of Russian roulette, Alex.
[02:20:58.170 --> 02:20:59.170]  I mean, that's basically what it is.
[02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:04.170]  You got your six chambers, and you got one bullet in there.
[02:21:04.170 --> 02:21:10.170]  Well, if you pull the trigger three times and it doesn't go off, well, boy, I mean, you know now.
[02:21:10.170 --> 02:21:16.170]  Gee, I got a lot bigger chance that that bullet is going to go into my head now playing Russian roulette.
[02:21:16.170 --> 02:21:18.170]  So it seems like that's what's going on with these shots.
[02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:23.170]  The more you take, the higher the odds you're going to have the severe side effects.
[02:21:23.170 --> 02:21:24.170]  Exactly.
[02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:27.170]  I mean, let me back you up on this.
[02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:28.170]  I don't want to give her name out.
[02:21:28.170 --> 02:21:29.170]  She's a great lady.
[02:21:29.170 --> 02:21:35.170]  She's, like, 24 years old, has a college degree, another degree, and she's a nanny for us.
[02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:37.170]  And I've been able to talk to people.
[02:21:37.170 --> 02:21:46.170]  Her ex-boyfriend two years ago was pressured by her mother, not the nanny's mother, her boyfriend's mother, to take the shot.
[02:21:46.170 --> 02:21:49.170]  He took one Pfizer shot, and he was an athlete.
[02:21:49.170 --> 02:21:51.170]  You know what affects athletes worse.
[02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:58.170]  So he was in great shape, all this stuff, played, you know, sports at college level,
[02:21:58.170 --> 02:22:05.170]  had myocarditis three times with her, collapsed, and had to go to the hospital, passed out.
[02:22:05.170 --> 02:22:08.170]  They said, no, it's myocarditis from the shot.
[02:22:08.170 --> 02:22:12.170]  The mother now feels bad but won't say she's sorry for pushing it.
[02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:14.170]  So she basically had to break up with him.
[02:22:14.170 --> 02:22:18.170]  And we know half the people that get myocarditis, like, this will be dead within 10 years.
[02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:25.170]  Then the last family she worked for, first started working for us a year ago.
[02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:29.170]  You know why she quit working for us when working for them?
[02:22:29.170 --> 02:22:38.170]  Three little kids, 50 years old, guy in great shape, takes the second shot, this Moderna,
[02:22:38.170 --> 02:22:42.170]  dies of a heart attack two days after he takes the second shot.
[02:22:42.170 --> 02:22:43.170]  So the family falls apart.
[02:22:43.170 --> 02:22:45.170]  They move out of the state.
[02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:50.170]  So that's just my nanny's boyfriend's almost dead.
[02:22:50.170 --> 02:22:52.170]  The last family she's with, and it goes on.
[02:22:52.170 --> 02:22:54.170]  I've got family that happened to that's in the military.
[02:22:54.170 --> 02:22:56.170]  I've got family that works at facilities.
[02:22:56.170 --> 02:22:57.170]  They've been having to take it.
[02:22:57.170 --> 02:22:59.170]  And they take the shot and almost die.
[02:22:59.170 --> 02:23:01.170]  One shot.
[02:23:01.170 --> 02:23:04.170]  I mean, it's like, because families are tough.
[02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:07.170]  They're like, well, I work at this facility, and I've been 30 years in the Army,
[02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:12.170]  and now I work at this facility, and I'm in order to do it, so I'm going to do it.
[02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:15.170]  And then they take the shot that almost kills them.
[02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:19.170]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:21.170]  And this is out of control.
[02:23:21.170 --> 02:23:27.170]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit somebody that's been hurt by this, Owen.
[02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:30.170]  Well, and that's it exactly.
[02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:32.170]  Why won't they talk about Jamie Foxx?
[02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:36.170]  I mean, they love to talk about celebrity news, celebrity gossip,
[02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:39.170]  especially if there's one that, you know, is hurting or in a situation.
[02:23:39.170 --> 02:23:41.170]  They bring him on to all the talk shows.
[02:23:41.170 --> 02:23:42.170]  Yeah, he was a great guy.
[02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:44.170]  I actually met him once before he died.
[02:23:44.170 --> 02:23:48.170]  He's the main guy in Red Dawn, the older brother.
[02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:52.170]  And he did really silly, funny movies like Roadhouse.
[02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:54.170]  Who's that guy?
[02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:56.170]  Patrick Swayze?
[02:23:56.170 --> 02:23:57.170]  Patrick Swayze.
[02:23:57.170 --> 02:24:00.170]  He died in six months of pancreatic cancer.
[02:24:00.170 --> 02:24:06.170]  It was the number one story for six months, watching Patrick Swayze die, okay?
[02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:08.170]  Why are we hearing about Jamie Foxx?
[02:24:08.170 --> 02:24:11.170]  You just bingoed it.
[02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:13.170]  It's because they know it's the vaccine, Alex.
[02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:18.170]  They know what's even scarier to think because we're led to believe, right?
[02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:22.170]  We have this concept of, oh, a celebrity status.
[02:24:22.170 --> 02:24:24.170]  They've got all the means.
[02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:25.170]  They've got all the resources.
[02:24:25.170 --> 02:24:26.170]  They've got all the control.
[02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:28.170]  Well, here's Jamie Foxx.
[02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:30.170]  I'm sure he's worth probably $100 million.
[02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:33.170]  And look at how little control he has.
[02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:35.170]  Forced to take the poison injections.
[02:24:35.170 --> 02:24:39.170]  Now sitting in a hospital bed fighting for his life.
[02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:45.170]  And his story is being covered up by the very people that manufactured the virus
[02:24:45.170 --> 02:24:48.170]  and then forced him to take the vaccine.
[02:24:48.170 --> 02:24:54.170]  So it just shows you, even the big celebrities that we are supposed to sit here and idolize and revere,
[02:24:54.170 --> 02:24:58.170]  they have just as little control at the end of the day as you or I.
[02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:02.170]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:05.170]  So we need to really get on the Jamie Foxx situation.
[02:25:05.170 --> 02:25:09.170]  And I'm going to call back my source a couple of months ago and say, why aren't you talking about it?
[02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:11.170]  Why aren't we making a bigger deal out of this?
[02:25:11.170 --> 02:25:13.170]  It's like, well, it's for his privacy.
[02:25:13.170 --> 02:25:15.170]  Screw his privacy, man.
[02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:17.170]  We got to save all the people that haven't taken the shot yet.
[02:25:17.170 --> 02:25:20.170]  We got to bring the perpetrators to justice here.
[02:25:20.170 --> 02:25:21.170]  But think of Hollywood.
[02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:22.170]  They want control over our kids, everything.
[02:25:22.170 --> 02:25:23.170]  How do we know?
[02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:25.170]  Because we know when somebody gets a big enough catalog,
[02:25:25.170 --> 02:25:32.170]  they have managers that are getting 20% of the hundreds of millions that Jamie Foxx has made.
[02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:34.170]  We know star killing is a big thing in Hollywood.
[02:25:34.170 --> 02:25:35.170]  It's a big thing.
[02:25:35.170 --> 02:25:38.170]  You know, Jimi Hendrix was murdered by his manager.
[02:25:38.170 --> 02:25:39.170]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:43.170]  They held him down and dumped a gallon of vodka down his throat.
[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:45.170]  He was already drugged out.
[02:25:45.170 --> 02:25:50.170]  They want to kill him and get the catalog because now the manager gets 100%.
[02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:52.170]  So how do we know?
[02:25:52.170 --> 02:25:54.170]  Hollywood's like, oh, we got special here for you.
[02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:57.170]  It's a higher dose of the spike protein.
[02:25:57.170 --> 02:25:59.170]  They want to kill us.
[02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:04.170]  They want the president, the presidents to be able to murder us when they want,
[02:26:04.170 --> 02:26:05.170]  how they want, when they want.
[02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:11.170]  Well, now we're getting into a whole nother future argument here, which is over the AI.
[02:26:11.170 --> 02:26:18.170]  You know, Bruce Willis is unable to do any acting work now because he's had a serious problem.
[02:26:18.170 --> 02:26:21.170]  I think it's even dementia, maybe, that he's suffering from.
[02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:22.170]  It suddenly started.
[02:26:22.170 --> 02:26:24.170]  Reportedly, that's from the shot, too, two years ago.
[02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:27.170]  So now, but they're discussing, oh, well, what about AI images?
[02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:32.170]  What about AI versions of these famous actors and actresses if they should pass?
[02:26:32.170 --> 02:26:37.170]  Well, now, gee, I don't have to pay Bruce Willis, you know, $5 million to start a film.
[02:26:37.170 --> 02:26:41.170]  Tom Hanks just came out and said, I'll be on the air for thousands of years after I'm dead.
[02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:43.170]  I'm still going to be on air.
[02:26:43.170 --> 02:26:47.170]  Yeah, for example, my guess is they filmed this before the individual died.
[02:26:47.170 --> 02:26:48.170]  I forget the individual's name.
[02:26:48.170 --> 02:26:49.170]  He was in The Wire.
[02:26:49.170 --> 02:26:51.170]  He's in the John Wick films.
[02:26:51.170 --> 02:26:52.170]  He's the concierge.
[02:26:52.170 --> 02:26:56.170]  They just released John Wick 4, and I was watching John Wick 4, and the guy popped up.
[02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:59.170]  I forget his name, the black actor, bald guy.
[02:26:59.170 --> 02:27:00.170]  This guy's like in his 60s.
[02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:01.170]  He looks young.
[02:27:01.170 --> 02:27:06.170]  This guy looks as healthy as it gets, and he dies suddenly.
[02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:08.170]  And I'm sitting there thinking as I'm watching the film.
[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:10.170]  I think he was seen as 60.
[02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:12.170]  And he looked as healthy as ever.
[02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:16.170]  And I'm watching the film in John Wick 4, and I'm like, wow, you know, he looks really healthy in this.
[02:27:16.170 --> 02:27:17.170]  This isn't AI.
[02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:18.170]  This is actually him.
[02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:20.170]  I don't think they have the AI version of him out yet.
[02:27:20.170 --> 02:27:22.170]  I think they actually filmed this.
[02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:25.170]  It's like, wow, here's a guy who looks healthy, dies suddenly.
[02:27:25.170 --> 02:27:28.170]  Is he going to start popping up in TV shows with AI?
[02:27:28.170 --> 02:27:31.170]  Is he going to start popping up in new movies with the new AI renderings?
[02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:39.170]  So, I mean, if you want to get real deeply conspiratorial here with the star killing, Alex, well, think about it.
[02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:49.170]  Beyond just the catalog of work, now you can start having these famous actors and actresses that you might normally pay tons of money to film these movies.
[02:27:49.170 --> 02:27:53.170]  Now you can just put an AI version of them in the film.
[02:27:53.170 --> 02:27:55.170]  And you don't have to pay them jack.
[02:27:55.170 --> 02:27:57.170]  Exactly.
[02:27:57.170 --> 02:28:01.170]  And Hollywood is really up there at the top of the pyramid, the mind control.
[02:28:01.170 --> 02:28:02.170]  And that's what it is.
[02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:03.170]  And that's what's happening.
[02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:05.170]  Owen, you're going to take over the final segment of this hour.
[02:28:05.170 --> 02:28:07.170]  We have a great guest host coming up.
[02:28:07.170 --> 02:28:12.170]  Please remember, ladies and gentlemen, there's two more segments of this hour left.
[02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:14.170]  We can't do this without you.

[02:28:39.170 --> 02:28:41.170]  Everybody should experience X3.
[02:28:41.170 --> 02:28:43.170]  Learn why they're trying to cut eye and eye out of your diet.
[02:28:43.170 --> 02:28:45.170]  See what it does for your body.
[02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:46.170]  X3 is selling out.
[02:28:46.170 --> 02:28:50.170]  Still discounted 25% at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:54.170]  X3, get X3 while you still can at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:29:24.170 --> 02:29:26.170]  There are no fillers in these products.

[02:29:57.170 --> 02:30:04.170]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:30:05.170 --> 02:30:14.170]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:30:14.170 --> 02:30:17.170]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:30:17.170 --> 02:30:20.170]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:30:20.170 --> 02:30:28.170]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:30:28.170 --> 02:30:33.170]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:45.170]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:51.170]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:58.170]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:58.170 --> 02:31:04.170]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:31:04.170 --> 02:31:07.170]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:31:07.170 --> 02:31:09.170]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:31:09.170 --> 02:31:12.170]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:15.170]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:17.170]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:31:17.170 --> 02:31:23.170]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:31:23.170 --> 02:31:27.170]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:31:27.170 --> 02:31:29.170]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:31:29.170 --> 02:31:33.170]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:31:33.170 --> 02:31:37.170]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:31:37.170 --> 02:31:40.170]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:43.170]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:31:43.170 --> 02:31:44.170]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:31:44.170 --> 02:31:50.170]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:50.170 --> 02:31:51.170]  So don't procrastinate.
[02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:52.170]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:52.170 --> 02:31:54.170]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air.
[02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:57.170]  And never submit to these tyrants.
[02:31:57.170 --> 02:32:02.170]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot.
[02:32:02.170 --> 02:32:04.170]  Because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:32:04.170 --> 02:32:06.170]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:08.170]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:32:08.170 --> 02:32:10.170]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:32:10.170 --> 02:32:13.170]  And it says, political prisoner.
[02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:15.170]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:17.170]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:32:17.170 --> 02:32:20.170]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:32:20.170 --> 02:32:21.170]  Political prisoner.
[02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:23.170]  With Trump on the front.
[02:32:23.170 --> 02:32:26.170]  There in a mugshot jail background.
[02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.170]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:31.170]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:32:31.170 --> 02:32:33.170]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:34.170]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:32:34.170 --> 02:32:36.170]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:37.170]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:32:37.170 --> 02:32:38.170]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:32:38.170 --> 02:32:39.170]  2024.
[02:32:39.170 --> 02:32:41.170]  It's a fun, conversational piece.
[02:32:41.170 --> 02:32:42.170]  And a limited edition shirt.
[02:32:42.170 --> 02:32:44.170]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:32:44.170 --> 02:32:52.170]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarsstore.com
[02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:56.170]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:58.170 --> 02:33:03.170]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:05.170]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.690 --> 02:33:25.530]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now
[02:33:25.530 --> 02:33:32.530]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:32.530 --> 02:33:38.290]  Let's just dive right into the topic here, the boycott of Target, the culture wars over
[02:33:38.290 --> 02:33:43.370]  the LGBTQ pedophile plus agenda.
[02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:47.090]  We're going to correct a couple of things on that and show you some of the news.
[02:33:47.090 --> 02:34:02.050]  Now the reporting here, Target has lost $12 billion in market capital since May 17th.
[02:34:02.050 --> 02:34:07.650]  I guess the significance of that day being when the Pride section for kids became a national
[02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:12.130]  story, a national phenomenon, $12 billion market cap in 14 days.
[02:34:12.130 --> 02:34:14.330]  That is not an insignificant number.
[02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:20.370]  Now they could potentially reclaim that $12 billion in a short enough period of time, we
[02:34:20.370 --> 02:34:22.610]  shall see.
[02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:30.250]  Or are the boycotts at large working now when it comes to boycotting Target and Bud Light
[02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:32.130]  and other things?
[02:34:32.130 --> 02:34:38.330]  Now I've been talking ad nauseum about this for the last two weeks since this story has
[02:34:38.330 --> 02:34:43.090]  been out there, but they continue to make the same claim, so we'll continue to retort.
[02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:48.810]  Target boycotts are literally terrorism, economics professor claims, yeah, an economics professor
[02:34:48.810 --> 02:34:55.690]  on MSNBC claimed the boycotts against Target in response to its LGBTQ campaign for kids,
[02:34:55.690 --> 02:35:00.850]  for kids, that's the point there, for kids, is literally terrorism.
[02:35:00.850 --> 02:35:06.530]  But when the left wing of America, when the Democrats, the liberal progressive groups
[02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:11.890]  that support Black Lives Matter and Antifa, when they engage in rioting and looting that
[02:35:11.890 --> 02:35:20.450]  costs $2 billion in property damage and led to 175 Target stores being closed, that is
[02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:27.210]  not literally terrorism, but you just choosing not to shop at Target is literally terrorism.
[02:35:27.210 --> 02:35:29.330]  Do you understand the psychology of these people?
[02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:32.230]  Do you know why left wingers are so dangerous now?
[02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:36.610]  They say you existing is violence.
[02:35:36.610 --> 02:35:39.970]  Just you existing is violence, therefore they should have the right to kill you.
[02:35:39.970 --> 02:35:41.850]  That's the logical conclusion.
[02:35:41.850 --> 02:35:46.950]  They say if you don't want to shop at the stores that they own, operate and propagandize
[02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:50.290]  and indoctrinate your kids at, that's literally terrorism.
[02:35:50.290 --> 02:35:51.830]  So therefore what?
[02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:56.050]  They should force you to shop at those stores?
[02:35:56.050 --> 02:36:07.770]  Folks, I know you know, but it has to be restated every day, because ultimately, ultimately,
[02:36:07.770 --> 02:36:13.610]  if we want to stop where this country is headed, the Democrat Party and all of its
[02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:23.370]  agenda and policies must be met head on and rejected and put in the dirt.
[02:36:23.370 --> 02:36:28.330]  It's Democrat Party policies that lead to all the violent crime, poverty, homelessness
[02:36:28.330 --> 02:36:31.410]  and all the cities that they run.
[02:36:31.410 --> 02:36:37.170]  It's the Democrat Party culture that led to 175 Target stores being shut down and over
[02:36:37.170 --> 02:36:39.410]  $2 billion in property damage.
[02:36:39.410 --> 02:36:47.970]  Dozens of people murdered, hundreds of police officers hospitalized, thousands overall hospitalized.
[02:36:47.970 --> 02:36:50.730]  And all of this was during Pride, as you can see on the screen.
[02:36:50.730 --> 02:36:56.570]  So they literally ransacked, looted and burned Targets to the ground during Pride month,
[02:36:56.570 --> 02:36:59.090]  the left wing, and they endorsed that.
[02:36:59.090 --> 02:37:02.050]  But you just decide you don't want to shop at Target anymore.
[02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:04.170]  And they say that's literally terrorism.
[02:37:04.170 --> 02:37:07.810]  This is the makings of a French revolution, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:07.810 --> 02:37:13.770]  They will haul you out into the streets and chop your head off.
[02:37:13.770 --> 02:37:15.570]  That's where the left wing in America is at.
[02:37:15.570 --> 02:37:16.570]  You get it.
[02:37:16.570 --> 02:37:17.930]  I need to continue with the news coverage.
[02:37:17.930 --> 02:37:23.690]  Universal Studio to host all ages Pride night featuring drag shows, photo ops with children's
[02:37:23.690 --> 02:37:24.690]  characters.
[02:37:24.690 --> 02:37:29.570]  Now, keep that in mind, children, children.
[02:37:29.570 --> 02:37:31.010]  That's the problem here.
[02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:34.810]  Kohl's is selling transgender themed clothing for three month old babies.
[02:37:34.810 --> 02:37:38.250]  Guess you got to boycott Kohl's.
[02:37:38.250 --> 02:37:43.890]  Chicago Pride event will feature drag dress up and makeovers for children.
[02:37:43.890 --> 02:37:47.090]  Now they can't do this in Florida anymore.
[02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:51.650]  Ron DeSantis, the laws already exist, folks, but you have to rewrite and reiterate the
[02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:55.010]  laws now because the left wing finds ways around them.
[02:37:55.010 --> 02:38:01.010]  You cannot have lewd and nude activity around children at your parades now.
[02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:02.610]  Ron DeSantis signs that new bill.
[02:38:02.610 --> 02:38:05.730]  And so the Pride parades in Florida had to be canceled because they don't know how to
[02:38:05.730 --> 02:38:11.970]  do a Pride parade without lewd and nudity, lewd activity and nudity directed towards
[02:38:11.970 --> 02:38:12.970]  children.
[02:38:12.970 --> 02:38:13.970]  So they had to cancel the event.
[02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:17.570]  And then they do stuff like this.
[02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:22.250]  This is from a school in California, lives of TikTok, has the document.
[02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:26.690]  This survey asking middle schoolers, middle schoolers, you know, oh, middle school.
[02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:27.690]  Yeah.
[02:38:27.690 --> 02:38:28.690]  I was like, what kind of bike am I going to get?
[02:38:28.690 --> 02:38:29.690]  Where am I going to ride my bike?
[02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:31.890]  Are we going to play football or baseball after school?
[02:38:31.890 --> 02:38:36.930]  This survey asking middle schoolers if they're trans or non-binary is used in hundreds of
[02:38:36.930 --> 02:38:42.810]  schools and was recently given to over one million students across California.
[02:38:42.810 --> 02:38:47.770]  In school core survey, healthy kids, California survey, which of the following best describes
[02:38:47.770 --> 02:38:51.330]  your school scheduling in the past 90 days?
[02:38:51.410 --> 02:38:52.410]  Okay.
[02:38:52.410 --> 02:38:53.410]  Oh, not bad.
[02:38:53.410 --> 02:38:54.410]  Next.
[02:38:54.410 --> 02:38:55.410]  We'd like some background information on you.
[02:38:55.410 --> 02:38:56.410]  What grade are you in?
[02:38:56.410 --> 02:38:57.410]  Okay.
[02:38:57.410 --> 02:38:58.410]  What is your gender?
[02:38:58.410 --> 02:38:59.410]  Male?
[02:38:59.410 --> 02:39:00.410]  Female?
[02:39:00.410 --> 02:39:01.410]  Non-binary?
[02:39:01.410 --> 02:39:02.410]  Something else?
[02:39:02.410 --> 02:39:03.410]  What?
[02:39:03.410 --> 02:39:06.130]  Some people describe themselves as transgender.
[02:39:06.130 --> 02:39:10.130]  When how they think or feel about their gender is different from the sex they were assigned
[02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:11.130]  at birth.
[02:39:11.130 --> 02:39:12.130]  Assigned at birth.
[02:39:12.130 --> 02:39:13.290]  Already the indoctrination.
[02:39:13.290 --> 02:39:15.410]  You're not assigned it at birth, folks.
[02:39:15.410 --> 02:39:17.810]  You can take a test now.
[02:39:17.810 --> 02:39:19.710]  I believe it's at four or six weeks.
[02:39:19.710 --> 02:39:20.770]  You can take a test now.
[02:39:20.770 --> 02:39:22.770]  You can find out if your baby is male or female.
[02:39:22.770 --> 02:39:29.570]  The chemicals in your body, the chemicals in the pregnant woman, the mother's body at
[02:39:29.570 --> 02:39:34.050]  six weeks or eight weeks, maybe, I don't know the exact date, can tell you whether it's
[02:39:34.050 --> 02:39:36.170]  a boy or a girl.
[02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:37.910]  So it's not even assigned at birth.
[02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:38.990]  You can have an ultrasound.
[02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:42.610]  You can see if it's a male or female before birth.
[02:39:42.610 --> 02:39:44.190]  There's no assigning at birth.
[02:39:44.190 --> 02:39:48.230]  It's absurd that we're even having this conversation.
[02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:49.770]  It's even more absurd.
[02:39:49.770 --> 02:39:54.130]  You're putting it on a document for middle school children.
[02:39:54.130 --> 02:39:56.450]  Which of the following best describes you?
[02:39:56.450 --> 02:39:57.450]  Straight?
[02:39:57.450 --> 02:39:58.450]  Lesbian or gay?
[02:39:58.450 --> 02:39:59.450]  Bisexual?
[02:39:59.450 --> 02:40:00.450]  Something else?
[02:40:00.450 --> 02:40:01.450]  Not sure?
[02:40:01.450 --> 02:40:02.450]  Decline to respond.
[02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:04.970]  Middle school!
[02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:07.770]  If you were doing this in high school, you'd be a sick freak.
[02:40:07.770 --> 02:40:10.210]  If you were doing this in college, you'd be deranged.
[02:40:10.210 --> 02:40:13.610]  They're doing this in middle school in California.
[02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:18.290]  Oh, well, you know.
[02:40:18.290 --> 02:40:20.890]  Believe it or not, it's not about sex.
[02:40:20.890 --> 02:40:21.890]  They're just looking out for the children.
[02:40:21.890 --> 02:40:22.890]  Really?
[02:40:22.890 --> 02:40:23.890]  It's not about sex.
[02:40:23.890 --> 02:40:24.890]  How about this one?
[02:40:24.890 --> 02:40:27.770]  So they put out the new Little Mermaid.
[02:40:27.770 --> 02:40:29.530]  Little Mermaid is a black girl now.
[02:40:29.530 --> 02:40:30.530]  Okay, fine.
[02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:33.930]  And also, they have the Little Mermaid sisters.
[02:40:33.930 --> 02:40:37.250]  They're all different races now.
[02:40:37.250 --> 02:40:39.410]  It's the same thing that they do.
[02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:40.770]  Is it a race replacement thing?
[02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:42.250]  Are they just trying to hire the best actress?
[02:40:42.250 --> 02:40:43.250]  I don't know.
[02:40:43.250 --> 02:40:45.210]  Little Mermaid, not really my battle.
[02:40:45.210 --> 02:40:48.610]  But see, it's the same propaganda.
[02:40:48.610 --> 02:40:53.770]  New York Times ripped for lamenting lack of kink in New Little Mermaid.
[02:40:53.770 --> 02:40:58.530]  The New York Times is facing online backlash after publishing a review of the live-action
[02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:04.570]  Little Mermaid remake, complaining that kink was missing from the film.
[02:41:04.570 --> 02:41:06.490]  Kink!
[02:41:06.490 --> 02:41:08.410]  Kink!
[02:41:08.410 --> 02:41:19.490]  So if your Disney film is not sexually propagandized with sexual innuendo and nuanced subliminal
[02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:24.210]  sexual messages like we've seen in Disney films for decades, the New York Times is upset.
[02:41:24.210 --> 02:41:27.710]  They want more kink.
[02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:31.410]  They want more kink for kids.
[02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:39.490]  Now, the culture wars are starting to seep into professional sports.
[02:41:39.490 --> 02:41:45.510]  And one pitcher decided to promote a video that was promoting the idea of boycotting
[02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:48.410]  Target or anybody that's doing Pride for Kids.
[02:41:48.410 --> 02:41:51.210]  And the media came after him, and he had to apologize.
[02:41:51.210 --> 02:41:52.610]  And of course, he's in Toronto.
[02:41:52.610 --> 02:41:57.970]  Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass apologizes for posting anti-LGBTQ video.
[02:41:57.970 --> 02:42:02.770]  No, it's just saying if you don't like Pride for Kids, you don't shop at Target.
[02:42:02.770 --> 02:42:04.770]  Oh, but that's anti-LGBTQ.
[02:42:04.770 --> 02:42:07.770]  No, it's the kids.
[02:42:07.770 --> 02:42:10.450]  And then they write stories like this in Toronto.
[02:42:10.450 --> 02:42:13.770]  The Blue Jays should cut ties with Anthony Bass now more than ever.
[02:42:13.770 --> 02:42:17.970]  How dare you dissent from the liberal establishment?
[02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:21.730]  How dare you dissent from the liberal order?
[02:42:21.730 --> 02:42:25.570]  How dare you dissent from the liberal tyranny and the liberal propaganda?
[02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:27.170]  By the way, we're really tolerant.
[02:42:27.170 --> 02:42:30.970]  But if you don't agree with everything we say and do, then we will destroy you.
[02:42:30.970 --> 02:42:32.770]  We're tolerant.
[02:42:32.770 --> 02:42:36.370]  One pitcher decided not to be such a wuss.
[02:42:36.370 --> 02:42:40.810]  Nationals pitcher Trevor Williams calls for boycott against Dodgers after their mockery
[02:42:40.810 --> 02:42:44.730]  or fellow Catholics of fellow Catholics with drag race nuns.
[02:42:44.730 --> 02:42:45.730]  He's not.
[02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:47.290]  He's not backing down.
[02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:51.970]  But the Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who went up against this, was like, oh, well,
[02:42:51.970 --> 02:42:53.530]  we'll have a Catholic night here, too.
[02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:56.530]  And that'll make up for them targeting the kids for sex.
[02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:27.250]  There are no fillers in these products.
[02:43:27.250 --> 02:43:33.570]  These are fluoride free, next level toothpaste, 10,000 of each tube, limited run, available

[02:43:58.450 --> 02:44:02.850]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:06.650]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[02:44:06.650 --> 02:44:07.650]  addicts and criminals.
[02:44:07.650 --> 02:44:11.010]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:44:11.010 --> 02:44:12.810]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:44:12.810 --> 02:44:14.650]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:44:14.650 --> 02:44:17.650]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:44:17.650 --> 02:44:19.290]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:44:19.290 --> 02:44:22.210]  And again, you know, I have InfoWare to thank for that.
[02:44:22.210 --> 02:44:26.170]  Coming back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:44:26.170 --> 02:44:30.770]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:31.770]  under the InfoWare team.
[02:44:31.770 --> 02:44:37.010]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips
[02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:42.050]  because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream
[02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:43.050]  media refuses to.
[02:44:43.050 --> 02:44:47.690]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:49.450]  helping the American people.
[02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:53.130]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[02:44:53.130 --> 02:44:54.130]  in my career.
[02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:25.170]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[02:45:25.170 --> 02:45:30.370]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:45:30.370 --> 02:45:34.050]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[02:45:34.050 --> 02:45:35.050]  two or three times.
[02:45:35.050 --> 02:45:37.930]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:42.330]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[02:45:42.330 --> 02:45:43.330]  competitor.
[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:48.570]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:45:48.690 --> 02:45:50.330]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:45:50.330 --> 02:45:51.890]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:45:51.890 --> 02:45:53.370]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:45:53.370 --> 02:45:57.490]  The point is, you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[02:45:57.490 --> 02:45:58.490]  in stock.
[02:45:58.490 --> 02:46:03.330]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:46:03.330 --> 02:46:05.490]  We made it even stronger.

[02:46:11.050 --> 02:46:16.130]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:16.130 --> 02:46:22.650]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[02:46:22.650 --> 02:46:24.270]  called 10-hour energy.
[02:46:24.270 --> 02:46:29.730]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:46:29.730 --> 02:46:34.890]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[02:46:34.890 --> 02:46:35.890]  it.
[02:46:35.890 --> 02:46:39.690]  It is the super fuel.
[02:46:39.690 --> 02:46:42.650]  RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Ultra is great, they're two different nootropics, they
[02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:48.010]  go good with this, but this is the King Kong, this is the boss.
[02:46:48.010 --> 02:46:59.090]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[02:46:59.090 --> 02:47:05.290]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:21.800]  How deliciously ironic is it that you can sit here and watch these videos.
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:24.800]  We did this exercise last week.
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:27.800]  Others did it via their Twitter accounts.
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:31.800]  The trolling was so effective that the community notes at Twitter,
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.800]  and I think they were being a little ironic themselves,
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:40.800]  they understood the story where we just showed you all the videos
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:44.800]  of Democrats, liberals, progressives, BLM, Antifa,
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:48.800]  rioting, looting, arson at targets.
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:52.800]  175 target stores shut down because of the left-wing terrorism.
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:55.800]  Two billion dollars in property damage.
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:00.800]  And you can sit here and you roll the footage from two years ago
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:02.800]  when they were rioting, this is left-wing terrorism,
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:04.800]  and they're destroying the pride section.
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:08.800]  Literally pride stuff on the ground, pride signs,
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.800]  and all the pride crap has been thrown all on the ground,
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:13.800]  stepped on and smashed.
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:15.800]  But, oh, hey, that's left-wing terrorism.
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  So left-wing terrorism is peace.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:21.800]  Right-wing boycotts are terrorism.
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:24.800]  Yeah, there's the pride section, flags on the ground, smashed,
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:27.800]  the mannequins with the clothes, all on the ground.
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:30.800]  So, I mean, look, I don't want to belabor the point.
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.800]  It's just so frustrating that we have to continue to live in this
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:38.800]  upside-down, backwards world where the left literally engages
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.800]  in violent terrorism, and then all you do is say,
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:43.800]  hey, I'm not going to shop there anymore,
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:45.800]  and they say, that's violence, that's terrorism.
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:47.800]  You're like, wait a second, you just burned the target to the ground.
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:51.800]  I'm just not shopping there anymore. You're the terrorist.
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:54.800]  But here's my point, and I'm not going to speak for all conservatives,
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:56.800]  but I think it's pretty clear.
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  This isn't a mass movement against LGBTQ people.
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:03.800]  This is a mass movement against you targeting kids
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:05.800]  with sexual propaganda and grooming children.
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:07.800]  That's what this is about.
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:10.800]  Activists gear up for terrifying pride months
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.800]  as threats increase and brands drop out.
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:17.800]  No, there's no threats. There's no threats.
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:19.800]  The only threats are coming from left-wingers.
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:22.800]  Again, there was the targets that had shut down because left-wingers
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:26.800]  called them and said, we're going to bomb you because you are
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:30.800]  catering your message now to the right-wing in America,
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:32.800]  so we're going to bomb threat you,
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:34.800]  and you're going to have to shut down your target store.
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:36.800]  That was, again, left-wingers.
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:38.800]  So even when right-wingers are doing a peaceful boycott,
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:41.800]  left-wingers still find a way to be terrorists.
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:43.800]  Now, this one is hilarious.
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:45.800]  I'm going to have a follow-up on this tomorrow.
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:48.800]  One of the members of the audience, Matt Hardy,
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:50.800]  not the famous wrestler,
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:54.800]  gay Floridians are leaving in droves, says Pride organizer.
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:57.800]  It's just not happening.
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:01.800]  And the funny thing is you actually have the founder of
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:03.800]  Gays Against Groomers, Jamie Mitchell.
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:05.800]  She lives in Florida.
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:08.800]  She couldn't be happier there with her wife and loves DeSantis.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:10.800]  So it's like, oh, if you're black, don't go to Florida.
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:13.800]  And it's like black people out on boats having a great time,
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:15.800]  listening to music, dancing, swimming around with their kids,
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:17.800]  having barbecues, like, hey, I'm a black guy in Florida.
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:19.800]  Couldn't be better down here for me.
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:23.800]  Left-wing's like, oh, my gosh, don't go to Florida if you're black.
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:27.800]  And it's like Jamie Mitchell, Gays Against Groomers founder, married to her wife.
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:29.800]  It's like, hey, look at us in Florida. We love Florida. It's so great.
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:31.800]  I'm voting DeSantis.
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:33.800]  Like, oh, you can't be in Florida if you're gay.
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:35.800]  They're going to find you in the streets and beat you.
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:37.800]  And she's walking the streets having a great time.
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:42.800]  It's not like in Turkey.
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:50.800]  LGBT cannot infiltrate among us.
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:54.800]  Iran wins reelection to five-year term as president after 20 years in power.
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:57.800]  Yeah, not all nations are so LGBT-friendly.
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:02.800]  And again, the U.S. is maybe the most LGBTQ-friendly nation on the planet.
[02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:04.800]  So it's like they do this crazy thing.
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:07.800]  I don't know if there's a better place in the world to live if you're black
[02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:10.800]  than the United States of America or any race for that matter.
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:12.800]  I'm just saying they say, oh, it's so bad.
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:14.800]  It's like, no, where would it be better?
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:16.800]  Same thing, LGBTQ.
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:18.800]  Where's a better place for you to live than America?
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:21.800]  Probably nowhere.
[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:23.800]  But, oh, complain about how bad it is.
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:26.800]  Transgender biological male skier wins girls.
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:27.800]  Wait, what?
[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:32.800]  Transgender biological male skier wins girls high school state championship.
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:35.800]  Father of competitor declares it's not fair.
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:38.800]  Well, get used to it, buddy.
[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:39.800]  Get used to it.
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:41.800]  This is the new world created by the left.
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:42.800]  It's not based in reality.
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:44.800]  It's not based in fact.
[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:46.800]  It's not based in common sense.
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:52.800]  It's based in their propaganda and their false worldview and their victimology.
[02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:55.800]  Now, here's where I want this to come into home.
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:57.800]  And again, I'll speak for myself.
[02:51:57.800 --> 02:52:02.800]  I don't really like being put in any of these boxes, conservative, right-winger,
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:03.800]  any of this.
[02:52:03.800 --> 02:52:05.800]  I don't really like being put in any of these boxes, but fine.
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:06.800]  I have some conservative beliefs.
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:09.800]  I vote Republican, whatever.
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:13.800]  I think I speak for the majority of people that have a similar worldview or
[02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:17.800]  politics when I say I don't care about the LGBTQ people.
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:22.800]  I would say that the right wing in America, and some people might not like this,
[02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:27.800]  and I'm not denying that that's out there, but the right wing in America has
[02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:29.800]  become socially liberal.
[02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:31.800]  Some people don't like that.
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:33.800]  I don't necessarily mind that.
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:37.800]  I'm socially liberal, but it's the issue with the kids.
[02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:41.800]  And so I saw this argument going around, Pedro Gonzalez, one example.
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:44.800]  Oh, I can't believe Target would do this.
[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:47.800]  And it shows a bunch of LGBTQ Trump gear.
[02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:52.800]  And it's funny because the Trump hat, the Make America Great Again rainbow hat,
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:53.800]  it sold out so quickly.
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:57.800]  I remember I actually wanted one, and it sold out so quickly I couldn't get one.
[02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:02.800]  Two members of my audience ended up giving me that hat as a gift.
[02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:05.800]  It was, I guess, gay members of my audience.
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:06.800]  They had extra hats.
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:07.800]  They were like, hey, you couldn't get one here.
[02:53:07.800 --> 02:53:08.800]  I got two gifted to me.
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:11.800]  So the point is all their propaganda isn't working.
[02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:14.800]  They say Trump's anti-this, Trump's anti-LGBTQ.
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:15.800]  Really?
[02:53:15.800 --> 02:53:18.800]  Well, then how can he sell out of his LGBTQ rainbow hat in a day?
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:28.800]  Generally speaking, conservatives, right wingers, Trump supporters,
[02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:31.800]  are not anti-LGBTQ.
[02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:32.800]  They are not.
[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:35.800]  I'm not going to say they're pro, but they're not anti.
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:42.800]  We draw the line at the children.
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:44.800]  It's that simple.
[02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:47.800]  You start sexually propagandizing children.
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:51.800]  You start sexualizing children, sexually indoctrinating children,
[02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:53.800]  grooming children, abusing children.
[02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:57.800]  That's our issue.
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:01.800]  So you thinking, Pedro Gonzalez thinks he's so genius,
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:06.800]  ooh, I'm going to get one over on the Trump people
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:09.800]  that don't like Target sexualizing kids.
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:11.800]  I'm going to show them Trump's gay hat.
[02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:14.800]  It's not marketed for kids.
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:16.800]  Why do I even have to explain this?
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:18.800]  I thought people were smarter than this.
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:20.800]  I guess they're not.
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:23.800]  The issue is not a pride flag.
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:27.800]  The issue is not LGBTQ marketing.
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:32.800]  The issue is you aiming it at children.
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:35.800]  That's the issue.
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:41.800]  So thinking, oh, look, here's Trump with a gay flag.
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:43.800]  Oh, look, here's Trump selling a gay hat.
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:45.800]  See, I got all the conservatives now.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:46.800]  I got all the right-wingers now.
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:48.800]  I'll show them how hypocritical they are.
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:50.800]  Wrong-o.
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:51.800]  Wrong-o.
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:54.800]  You missed the picture entirely.
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:58.800]  We don't care what consenting adults do or wear.
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.800]  You're marketing it and aiming it at children.
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:06.800]  How do you not see how disgusting that is?
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:09.800]  How do you not see what a righteous fight it is
[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:13.800]  to stop children from being groomed sexually
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:18.800]  and being exposed to pornographic material in the classroom?
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:21.800]  No, you're not some genius.
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:23.800]  You didn't get one over on the Trump supporters
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:26.800]  because you showed a Trump hat with a gay flag.
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:29.800]  No, you showed what the argument really is.
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:33.800]  Stop sexualizing children.
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:37.800]  Stop aiming your pride propaganda at children.
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:39.800]  It's that simple.
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:42.800]  People are getting sick of it, by the way.
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:46.800]  Unhinged climate activist disrupts Swedish TV show,
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:51.800]  gets KO'd by the cameraman on the jib.
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:53.800]  We've got a jib camera here.
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:56.800]  We've got a jib operator in here every once in a while.
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:58.800]  That was a master move.
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:02.800]  You swung that camera down and knocked out that climate change protester
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:05.800]  and everybody cheered.
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:10.800]  You've now got this deranged they-them, self-proclaimed they-them,
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.800]  glued themselves to the Oxford Union debate chamber,
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:17.800]  glued themselves to the chamber with a dead trans kid.
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:19.800]  No more dead trans kids.
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:20.800]  Well, guess what?
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:22.800]  If there's no trans kids, then there's no more dead trans kids.
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:26.800]  So that's an ironic argument you didn't realize you made.
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:27.800]  You have just stopped oil.
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:32.800]  They blocked four bridges in London yesterday.
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:35.800]  They blocked four bridges in London yesterday.
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:38.800]  Folks, I'm telling you, people are getting sick of the left wing.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:40.800]  They see how violent they are.
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:43.800]  They see how they want to disrupt normal civilization,
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:46.800]  and they see how they're sexually grooming and abusing children.
[02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:49.800]  So the gig is up, man.
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:52.800]  Abortion advocates brutally assault pro-life people outside Planned Parenthood.
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:57.800]  Well, yeah, they say just your existence is violence.
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.800]  So you see, this is what the left wing does, folks.
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:04.800]  They build up a narrative to justify all of their actions.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:10.800]  So they say, oh, your existence is violence.
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:15.800]  Well, then that justifies whatever violence that they want to have against you, you see.
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:18.800]  Oh, boycotting Target is terrorism.
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:21.800]  So then they justify when they spy on you and label you a terrorist.
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:23.800]  You say, wait, why did you spy on me?
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:24.800]  Why did you label me a terrorist?
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:26.800]  Well, because you didn't shop at Target.
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:27.800]  What?
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:28.800]  So that's the left wing.
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:30.800]  They want to force you.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:32.800]  That's fascism.
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:36.800]  They want to force you to shop at the outlets they control.
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:39.800]  And if you're even existing as a conservative, that's violence to them,
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:42.800]  so they can justify violence against you.
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:44.800]  That's what we are up against.
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:49.800]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:52.800]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:54.800]  It will change your life.
[02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:57.800]  The UN admits and the Lansink Medical Journal admits
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:01.800]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:03.800]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:08.800]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:12.800]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:14.800]  so your body can't absorb it.
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:18.800]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:22.800]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:25.800]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:28.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for 6 months.
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:32.800]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:34.800]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:36.800]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:38.800]  You and your family need it.
[02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:40.800]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:44.800]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:58:47.800 --> 02:58:49.800]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,
[02:58:49.800 --> 02:58:52.800]  joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The Reiss Report.
[02:58:52.800 --> 02:58:55.800]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.

[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:08.800]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:10.800]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:15.800]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[02:59:15.800 --> 02:59:17.800]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:21.800]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:27.800]  Absolutely, and we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:30.800]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:32.800]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:35.800]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.

[02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:45.800]  and the rest of us on air.
[02:59:45.800 --> 02:59:47.800]  Do it today. Do it now.
[02:59:47.800 --> 02:59:49.800]  Support The Info War.
[02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:53.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:56.800]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:03.800]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:06.800]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from The Kate Dally Show,
[03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:08.800]  KateDallyRadio.com.
[03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:10.800]  Wow, we've got a lot to talk about today.
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:13.800]  I want to talk about the Second Amendment.
[03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:14.800]  I know.
[03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:17.800]  But a fresh take on that, and I hope you enjoy that
[03:00:17.800 --> 03:00:19.800]  and learn something from that today.
[03:00:19.800 --> 03:00:20.800]  And then Neuralink.
[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:22.800]  I want to talk about SB40.
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:24.800]  I want to talk about the presidential race.
[03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:28.800]  I also want to talk about why they named Kindle, Kindle.
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:30.800]  There's a lot of things I want to talk about.
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:33.800]  But first off, I do want to mention that by 2030,
[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:36.800]  you will own nothing, and you will be gay.
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:40.800]  So I just want to start off with that fresh bit of news.
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:44.800]  I know Bill Maher said, 2054, we would all be gay.
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:47.800]  But I just want you guys to know that you'll own nothing,
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:49.800]  you'll be happy, I don't think so, Klausie,
[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:51.800]  and you'll be gay.
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:56.800]  In fact, we're about to enter into the June Pride summer month.
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:00:57.800]  I know.
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:00:59.800]  I know you thought you were just going to have to be nauseated
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:02.800]  for a month as it's crammed down your ever-living throat.
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:05.800]  But no, we get a whole summer,
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:08.800]  and I'm sure it's been talked about on this show.
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:09.800]  I'm sure of it.
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:13.800]  The North Face, obviously, Patagonia.
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:14.800]  Sorry.
[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:17.800]  Encourage viewers to come out into nature,
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:22.800]  although I don't know what was so nature about Patagonia.
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:26.800]  But anyway, she vowed to have the summer of pride.
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:28.800]  You're going to see a lot more of that.
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:32.800]  You're going to see a lot more of pride summer instead of month.
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:34.800]  You're going to see pride year.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:36.800]  I mean, we're already getting it shoved down our throats anyway,
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:38.800]  but just wait, just wait.
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:43.800]  So she showed up, of course, in the all-rainbow getup.
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:45.800]  I hate what they've done to the rainbow.
[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:47.800]  Anyway, North Face gear,
[03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:51.800]  donning a full mustached face of multicolored makeup.
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:53.800]  That's nature.
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:56.800]  Anyway, and went out in their commercial.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.800]  Now, if North Face wants to commit this kind of corporate suicide,
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:03.800]  just like Bud Light and all the other companies, Target.
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:05.800]  Target's getting a huge hit today.
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:07.800]  If they want to do that, I guess it's up to them.
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:08.800]  They can.
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:09.800]  They can make that choice.
[03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:11.800]  But then you have to kind of wonder,
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:13.800]  why are they making that choice knowing, right?
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:15.800]  And so we all know it goes back to the credit scores.
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:18.800]  We all know it goes back to the corporate score,
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:21.800]  the I'm with you government, wink, wink.
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:24.800]  I'll do anything you say so I can get future loans,
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:26.800]  which is all about the Great Reset.
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:28.800]  Alex wrote a book on the Great Reset.
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:30.800]  And so you've got the Summer of Pride.
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:35.800]  You've got more and more companies committing corporate suicide by doing this.
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:37.800]  And the backlash is getting huge
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:39.800]  because people are just about done with this kind of crap.
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:41.800]  They don't want their kids seeing it.
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:43.800]  I don't want my kids seeing it, right?
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:49.800]  And so this Patty Gonia, this tour has everything.
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:53.800]  Hiking, community, arts, lesbians, lesbians making art.
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:57.800]  And it reminded me of the grants they're giving away for lesbian farmers.
[03:02:57.800 --> 03:02:59.800]  I don't know how many lesbian farmers there are,
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:03.800]  but they do have a grant program for them courtesy of our government.
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:06.800]  So you have all this stuff going on right now and it's in our face.
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:10.800]  But you have to wonder, is there anything else they're getting out of this?
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:13.800]  Is Bud Light getting something else out of this?
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:16.800]  They have to be, wouldn't they?
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:18.800]  Knowing they're going to lose revenue,
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:20.800]  knowing they have examples right in front of their face,
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:24.800]  yet they make the choice, Target makes the choice to come out with Tuckett underwear.
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:26.800]  Really?
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:28.800]  Something just seems a little off, doesn't it?
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:32.800]  It almost, well, I'll bring this up in just a second,
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:38.800]  but it almost strikes me as something that goes along the same lines as the racial war.
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:40.800]  But I'll get to that in just a moment.
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:44.800]  So in the headlines today, it's war on pride,
[03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:48.800]  revolt on Chick-fil-A, Bud Light sails down 30%.
[03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:51.800]  Okay, so we all know all this is going on,
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:55.800]  but when mainstream, particularly Drudge, right,
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:57.800]  which has gone full mainstream,
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:01.800]  when they're saying this, then I get a little surprised,
[03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:03.800]  maybe a little concerned.
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:06.800]  Okay, why are they trying to shove this into our face?
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:08.800]  What is the reason behind this?
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:12.800]  There has to be way more to it than just wanting us to be outraged.
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:14.800]  It's got to be deeper than this.
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:16.800]  So they want the outrage, yes.
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:19.800]  They want people to have a war on pride, yes.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:22.800]  We can see that, right, right in front of our faces.
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:24.800]  But then you have to go some layers deeper
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:28.800]  just because it never really works like this on the surface.
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:30.800]  This is not what they're all about.
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:32.800]  You know, Florida has laws in place,
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:34.800]  and of course they're going into feardom.
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:37.800]  Fear, oh, we can't go to Florida, oh my gosh.
[03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:39.800]  And I want to comment on that when we get back.
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:42.800]  Then I want to talk Second Amendment, Kindle, all kinds of things,
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:45.800]  because I am not going to give all the time to this.
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:46.800]  It doesn't deserve it.
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:48.800]  Honestly, this is ridiculous.
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:52.800]  It's ridiculous, and it's such a small percentage of our population anyway.
[03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:53.800]  I'll be right back.
[03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:55.800]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for The Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:04:59.600]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:01.600]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:05.600]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:07.600]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:10.600]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:14.600]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:17.600]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:05:17.600 --> 03:05:19.600]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:21.600]  five, six, seven days a week,
[03:05:21.600 --> 03:05:23.600]  it's really just incredible.
[03:05:23.600 --> 03:05:25.600]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:27.600]  I thank you for your past support.
[03:05:27.600 --> 03:05:29.600]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:32.600]  InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:05:32.600 --> 03:05:34.600]  I know you spread the word.
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:35.600]  I know you pray for us.
[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:36.600]  And that's wonderful.
[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:37.600]  Keep doing it.
[03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:40.600]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:43.600]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:05:43.600 --> 03:05:45.600]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:05:45.600 --> 03:05:47.600]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:05:47.600 --> 03:05:49.600]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:50.600]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:52.600]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:52.600 --> 03:05:54.600]  If just 1% more of you took action
[03:05:54.600 --> 03:05:55.600]  and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:57.600]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:05:57.600 --> 03:05:58.600]  Please take action.
[03:06:02.600 --> 03:06:03.600]  All right.
[03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:04.600]  You're on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.600 --> 03:06:05.600]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:07.600]  Oh, we hit summer.
[03:06:07.600 --> 03:06:09.600]  Everybody wants a normal summer,
[03:06:09.600 --> 03:06:11.600]  especially after this last three years.
[03:06:11.600 --> 03:06:12.600]  I completely get it.
[03:06:12.600 --> 03:06:13.600]  I do too, right?
[03:06:13.600 --> 03:06:15.600]  All of us want a break from all of this crap
[03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:17.600]  shoved in our face.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:18.600]  But we're not going to get it.
[03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:20.600]  And I think there's some definite reasons for that.
[03:06:20.600 --> 03:06:22.600]  You know, the drag shows are everywhere right now.
[03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:24.600]  And do they target nursing homes?
[03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:25.600]  Do they say,
[03:06:25.600 --> 03:06:27.600]  hey, we want to do a show at a nursing home?
[03:06:27.600 --> 03:06:28.600]  No.
[03:06:28.600 --> 03:06:30.600]  Just where kids are,
[03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:31.600]  just in parks,
[03:06:31.600 --> 03:06:33.600]  conveniently where they play,
[03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:35.600]  or just in libraries,
[03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:36.600]  or, you know,
[03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:38.600]  they want to go read to kids in libraries,
[03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:39.600]  or they want to have drag shows
[03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:43.600]  that are targeted to family-friendly audiences.
[03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:44.600]  But for some oddball reason,
[03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:47.600]  they don't want their audience to be in a nursing home.
[03:06:47.600 --> 03:06:49.600]  Does anyone else find that a little strange?
[03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:50.600]  And why don't they go there?
[03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:51.600]  They've got a captive audience.
[03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:53.600]  It's not like they can run out.
[03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:55.600]  And maybe they might even look like they're enjoying it.
[03:06:55.600 --> 03:06:56.600]  Who knows?
[03:06:56.600 --> 03:06:58.600]  But I don't think they would.
[03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:00.600]  It is interesting, the targeting.
[03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:05.600]  And I would hope that the people that are drag queens
[03:07:05.600 --> 03:07:08.600]  would possibly realize that it's creepy.
[03:07:08.600 --> 03:07:10.600]  Most of America isn't going to take it.
[03:07:10.600 --> 03:07:13.600]  Most of America is pretty pissed off about it.
[03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:16.600]  And all they're doing is alienating themselves
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:18.600]  by doing this whole thing for kids.
[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:20.600]  Drag queens have always been around.
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:22.600]  I don't have a problem with do your life.
[03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:23.600]  If that's what you want in your life,
[03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:24.600]  that's who you are,
[03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:25.600]  what you want to be, fine.
[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:26.600]  If you want to live a gay lifestyle,
[03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:27.600]  have no problem with it.
[03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:28.600]  I have friends that are gay.
[03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:29.600]  We all do, right?
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:30.600]  We all know somebody.
[03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:31.600]  All right.
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:32.600]  So, okay.
[03:07:32.600 --> 03:07:33.600]  No big deal.
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:35.600]  But it's when you're shoving it down our throats
[03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:37.600]  is when we have a problem.
[03:07:37.600 --> 03:07:39.600]  Disney, I'm sure you guys all saw the video by now,
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:41.600]  they have the little greeter at the door
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:43.600]  of the Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo boutique
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:45.600]  with the beard and the princess dress.
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:46.600]  And yeah, it looks weird.
[03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:48.600]  And yes, you should think it looks a little strange.
[03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:50.600]  And why are they doing that?
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:52.600]  But again, corporate suicide.
[03:07:52.600 --> 03:07:53.600]  They don't care.
[03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:56.600]  So, are they getting money from somewhere else
[03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:59.600]  to shore up their businesses?
[03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:01.600]  They're not going to take a fall like that.
[03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:02.600]  You guys know it.
[03:08:02.600 --> 03:08:03.600]  I know it.
[03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:05.600]  They're not going to pony themselves up
[03:08:05.600 --> 03:08:06.600]  to take a fall.
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:07.600]  They care too much.
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:08.600]  They care too much.
[03:08:08.600 --> 03:08:11.600]  So, why are they joining in this war?
[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:12.600]  Why are they doing this?
[03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:15.600]  And what are they actually getting out of it?
[03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:16.600]  I don't know yet.
[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:18.600]  But I'm investigating right now.
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:20.600]  And I want to find out what they're actually receiving.
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:23.600]  Because there's something way more to this.
[03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:24.600]  They wouldn't do that.
[03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:26.600]  And I think we all know that.
[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:28.600]  Leah Thomas, since we're on the topic,
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:32.600]  U.S. Olympic Committee says Leah Thomas is
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:35.600]  welcome to try out for the men's team,
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:36.600]  not the women's team.
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:39.600]  And she was, he was, whatever,
[03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:42.600]  the biological male who went swimming as a female
[03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:44.600]  and looked extremely male
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:47.600]  and shattered every record in NCAA history,
[03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:49.600]  has petitioned officially the U.S. Committee
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:51.600]  for a spot on the women's national team
[03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:52.600]  and was shut down.
[03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:53.600]  It's not an option.
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:56.600]  I really do hope the Olympics don't cave.
[03:08:56.600 --> 03:08:58.600]  I don't really care about the Olympics anymore.
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:08:59.600]  I don't know if anyone does.
[03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:01.600]  I mean, honestly, I hate to say that,
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:02.600]  but it kind of lost its luster.
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:03.600]  Do you know what I mean?
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:05.600]  When they went all weird on COVID
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:07.600]  and tried to do an Olympics with COVID
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:09.600]  and it was strange and nobody even wanted to watch,
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:11.600]  I think a lot of people kind of,
[03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:13.600]  it's kind of lost its gloss.
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:14.600]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:15.600]  Anyway, so we'll have to,
[03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:17.600]  we'll have to see what happens with this.
[03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:18.600]  But I thought, you know,
[03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:21.600]  you're welcome to try out for the men's team.
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:22.600]  And I love that.
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.600]  And it's kind of a win in the win column.
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:26.600]  But that gets me back to racial war.
[03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:28.600]  I want to talk about this for just a moment.
[03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:30.600]  They've been promoting a racial war in this country,
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:32.600]  but we're not really biting.
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:33.600]  Why is that?
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.600]  Because we know when we go to sporting events,
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:40.600]  funerals, weddings, graduation events,
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:42.600]  everybody's kind of going to graduation events this month
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:43.600]  and next, right?
[03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:47.600]  Airports, airplanes, movies,
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:48.600]  you're all in line, right?
[03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:50.600]  Theme parks, you're in line for hours.
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:52.600]  Okay, it's hot, it's exhausting.
[03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:54.600]  Okay, these are the moments when,
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:57.600]  when something might be triggered or happen.
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:58.600]  It doesn't.
[03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:02.600]  Standing in lines with people with all races
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:06.600]  from all places, yet nothing ever really happens.
[03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:10.600]  I'll even venture to guess that in your life,
[03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:13.600]  you have not ever noticed truly,
[03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:16.600]  maybe I'll give you a once,
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:18.600]  maybe once you've noticed,
[03:10:18.600 --> 03:10:19.600]  but I'm going to venture to guess
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:22.600]  you've never seen a huge brawl
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:25.600]  or big, huge thing happen
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:27.600]  at any of those kinds of events
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:29.600]  that I just named over race.
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:30.600]  Why?
[03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:32.600]  Because in 2023, we don't care about race.
[03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:33.600]  We're so beyond it.
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:35.600]  And we've been beyond it for decades.
[03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:40.600]  But this incredibly stupid narcissist fake administration
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:42.600]  loves to bring it up all the time.
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:44.600]  They think they're going to sell you on it.
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:46.600]  But I think they do realize
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:49.600]  that they can create an LGBT war, right?
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:52.600]  We only have about 6% of the country that's LGBT,
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:54.600]  maybe seven if you want to go with those
[03:10:54.600 --> 03:10:56.600]  that think it's cool to claim it,
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:10:57.600]  but not really, okay?
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:01.600]  So five, 6%, that's kind of how it's always been.
[03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:03.600]  The war they're going to promote,
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:06.600]  and you can see this with coming out with pride,
[03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:09.600]  summer of pride and all of these kinds of things.
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:11.600]  You can kind of see it coming now
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:14.600]  that they want this kind of war.
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:15.600]  What does it do?
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:17.600]  Keeps our eyes off all the money laundering,
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:18.600]  keeps our eyes off all the stuff
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:19.600]  that's actually going on,
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:21.600]  the permanent coup that we're in.
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:22.600]  I spoke yesterday to Lee Smith
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:24.600]  who wrote the permanent coup.
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:27.600]  The permanent coup is in
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:30.600]  and nobody's changing a thing for the future elections.
[03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:34.600]  So nobody's doing anything about the GEMS system.
[03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:36.600]  I've been speaking about GEMS, G-E-M-S,
[03:11:36.600 --> 03:11:40.600]  in our electoral system, in the voting system,
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:43.600]  the software, the actual software that you vote with
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:46.600]  for eight years, eight years now.
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:47.600]  It went to court in California.
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:49.600]  You can read all about it.
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:51.600]  So that GEMS software that turned into Dominion
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:53.600]  and turned into everything else,
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:55.600]  that really, truly isn't going to change.
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:58.600]  So they want our eyeballs on all these companies
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:00.600]  committing corporate suicide,
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:02.600]  trying to get near our kids.
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:04.600]  There are drag queens in a city
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:07.600]  that are suing the city for discrimination
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:09.600]  because they could not have it at a park
[03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:11.600]  when they themselves were the ones
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:13.600]  that screwed up the paperwork.
[03:12:13.600 --> 03:12:14.600]  The only reason they couldn't do it
[03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:15.600]  was because of the paperwork,
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:17.600]  but they're all playing the victim card.
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:19.600]  See, it had nothing to do with censorship.
[03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:21.600]  It had nothing to do with discrimination.
[03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:22.600]  It had everything to do with
[03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:23.600]  they couldn't fill out the right paperwork
[03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:26.600]  and understand when to advertise and when not to,
[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:27.600]  violating city rules.
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:29.600]  But you're going to see more of that.
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:30.600]  It's happening all over.
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:33.600]  That particular event is happening in my hometown.
[03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:35.600]  So we're going to see more and more and more of this.
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:37.600]  And I think they actually have their hooks
[03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:39.600]  in this war a little bit more
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:41.600]  than they do the racial war.
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:43.600]  The racial war, we're just not biting.
[03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:44.600]  Why?
[03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:47.600]  Because we're surrounded by people all the time
[03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:50.600]  of different races and different ethnicities.
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:52.600]  We don't have issues with it.
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:55.600]  So the examples in your own life
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:58.600]  do not dictate anything like that.
[03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:00.600]  You have a whole, it's like climate change.
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:04.600]  You've got an entire lifetime of it never affecting you.
[03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:07.600]  Climate change does not affect you in 60 years.
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:09.600]  Remember, that's the one question
[03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:12.600]  that totally stumps a climate activist.
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:14.600]  It hasn't affected you
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:17.600]  in any way, shape, or form your life.
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:19.600]  I always crack up when I look back
[03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:21.600]  at that chick in the 90s.
[03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:22.600]  Who was she?
[03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:23.600]  The one that got up at the UN
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:25.600]  and she was somebody's daughter, right?
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:27.600]  Some government official's daughter
[03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:28.600]  got up and spouted off
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:31.600]  about how we were all going to die by 1999.
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:32.600]  Okay?
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:33.600]  So far, she's had a great life.
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:34.600]  Two kids.
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:37.600]  Nothing has stopped her.
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:39.600]  She's done well.
[03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:41.600]  You don't hear a peep out of her
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:44.600]  about climate change destroying everything and everybody.
[03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:45.600]  Same thing with Greta.
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:46.600]  Greta now says,
[03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:50.600]  No, I was just kind of kidding when I said have fear.
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:52.600]  And so you have all of those things going on right now
[03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:54.600]  because they can't back it up.
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:57.600]  Time and history do not back up a racial war.
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:00.600]  LGBT war, you might have that on your hands
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:03.600]  only because they're doing what they're doing with it.
[03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:05.600]  But they have to be getting kickbacks.
[03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:07.600]  They have to be getting money for this.
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:09.600]  They would never do it to themselves.
[03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:11.600]  Bud Light would never do this to themselves.
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:12.600]  By the way, Dylan,
[03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:14.600]  and I know you guys know this,
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:17.600]  he came out and said now he's attracted to women again
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:21.600]  after being gendered, whatever, and this and that.
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:24.600]  And now he's so, this kid's so confused.
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:25.600]  He's so confused.
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:26.600]  And you know what?
[03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:31.600]  He was propped up for the role of Mr. Bud Light.
[03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:34.600]  They wanted him in that role.
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:36.600]  In the whole year that he was doing what he was doing,
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:39.600]  he never even had time to go through all those surgeries.
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:40.600]  Okay?
[03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:42.600]  And so, you know, you get,
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:43.600]  so he was a theater actor
[03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:45.600]  and then he got the role of a lifetime.
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:47.600]  And that was to be on the cover of Bud Light,
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:50.600]  do all the things he's doing to try to influence kids.
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:52.600]  They want kids to think they're gay.
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:14:54.600]  They want kids to think they're trans.
[03:14:54.600 --> 03:14:56.600]  And they want to,
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:14:57.600]  and if they really are,
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:01.600]  and I mean a small percentage would actually be,
[03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:03.600]  but what they're doing is making it cool
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:04.600]  and we all know that.
[03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:08.600]  So they're conjuring up the LGBT war this summer.
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:11.600]  They're gonna extend it past June, okay?
[03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:12.600]  Past a month.
[03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:16.600]  They want to see people completely eyes-on embroiled
[03:15:16.600 --> 03:15:19.600]  into this kind of nightmarish little fiasco
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:20.600]  that they're creating.
[03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:21.600]  Don't do it.
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:22.600]  Don't give in to it.
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:24.600]  Don't give in to it.
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:25.600]  Just like you didn't with the racial war.
[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:26.600]  You didn't buy in.
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:28.600]  Don't do it.
[03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:30.600]  You have a whole lifetime
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:33.600]  to tell you that this is not a war to be involved in
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:36.600]  and they want you to get in on the LGBT war.
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:37.600]  But don't.
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:38.600]  Say no.
[03:15:38.600 --> 03:15:39.600]  Just say no.
[03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:40.600]  When I come back,
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:42.600]  I want to talk about Second Amendment.
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:43.600]  This is a really,
[03:15:43.600 --> 03:15:45.600]  this actually comes from a friend of mine,
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:46.600]  my friend Dana,
[03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:47.600]  and I thought it was good enough.
[03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:49.600]  I really want to share this with you on Second Amendment,
[03:15:49.600 --> 03:15:50.600]  a different understanding,
[03:15:50.600 --> 03:15:52.600]  right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:52.600 --> 03:15:54.600]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:15:58.600]  I want to thank all of you over the years
[03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:00.600]  who have supported InfoWars financially
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:02.600]  and with word of mouth and prayer.
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:04.600]  The success that we've had together against the globalists
[03:16:04.600 --> 03:16:06.600]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:09.600]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:12.600]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:16:12.600 --> 03:16:14.600]  I just want to thank you all for buying products
[03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:15.600]  at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:17.600]  like books and films and supplements
[03:16:17.600 --> 03:16:19.600]  and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:22.600]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation
[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:24.600]  so we get almost 100% of the money
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:26.600]  to fund our operation during this critical time,

[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:36.600]  a one-time donation of $5, $10, $50,
[03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:38.600]  or a recurring donation you can cancel any time.
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:40.600]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[03:16:40.600 --> 03:16:42.600]  I want to encourage those of you out there
[03:16:42.600 --> 03:16:44.600]  that want to support freedom to take action now
[03:16:44.600 --> 03:16:46.600]  and be part of the global awakening,
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:49.600]  the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset
[03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:51.600]  by going to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:53.600]  and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:55.600]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:16:55.600 --> 03:16:56.600]  Please take action.
[03:16:56.600 --> 03:16:58.600]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,
[03:16:58.600 --> 03:17:01.600]  joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The Reese Report.
[03:17:01.600 --> 03:17:04.600]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:07.600]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reese.
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:11.600]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality,
[03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:13.600]  or what Greg has.
[03:17:13.600 --> 03:17:14.600]  Greg, what do you got there?
[03:17:14.600 --> 03:17:16.600]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:19.600]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:22.600]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:23.600]  wherever you want it.
[03:17:23.600 --> 03:17:25.600]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:28.600]  the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:30.600]  Absolutely.
[03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:35.600]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:36.600]  I was telling Greg earlier,
[03:17:36.600 --> 03:17:40.600]  we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:43.600]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[03:17:43.600 --> 03:17:44.600]  Take out your phone.
[03:17:44.600 --> 03:17:45.600]  Click that QR code.
[03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:47.600]  It'll take you directly to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:48.600]  Buy something.
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:49.600]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:52.600]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King,
[03:17:52.600 --> 03:17:53.600]  and the rest of us on air.
[03:17:53.600 --> 03:17:54.600]  Do it today.
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:55.600]  Do it now.
[03:17:55.600 --> 03:17:56.600]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:17:56.600 --> 03:17:58.600]  In the early 1900s,
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:02.600]  certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases
[03:18:02.600 --> 03:18:04.600]  into the atmosphere.
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:06.600]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:11.600]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:15.600]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:17.600]  still highly toxic but containable.
[03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:20.600]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:23.600]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:24.600]  Lucky for them,
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:28.600]  one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:31.600]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:32.600]  And by 1950,
[03:18:32.600 --> 03:18:35.600]  the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:38.600]  untreated industrial waste product
[03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:40.600]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:18:40.600 --> 03:18:45.600]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:47.600]  With the Alexa Pure Pro,
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:49.600]  you can have clean drinking water
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:51.600]  and a remedy to this madness.
[03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:55.600]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:18:58.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:00.600]  The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:19:00.600 --> 03:19:03.600]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:05.600]  plan for our future.
[03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:06.600]  That is a hellish future.
[03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:08.600]  Now you'll always,
[03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:09.600]  while they still allow books,
[03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:10.600]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:13.600]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:16.600]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:19.600]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:21.600]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:24.600]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:27.600]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:29.600]  a signed copy at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:31.600]  And there is a markup there
[03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:33.600]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:35.600]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:36.600]  and this powerful book,
[03:19:36.600 --> 03:19:39.600]  you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:42.600]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:43.600]  or unsigned copies.
[03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:45.600]  But I want to encourage all of you
[03:19:45.600 --> 03:19:46.600]  who haven't yet
[03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:49.600]  to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a signed copy
[03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:50.600]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:51.600]  and donate them to the library
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:53.600]  or give them to the local school.
[03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:54.600]  This is an InfoWar.
[03:19:54.600 --> 03:19:55.600]  I'm counting on you.
[03:19:55.600 --> 03:19:56.600]  And thank you for your support.
[03:19:57.600 --> 03:20:02.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:04.600]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:17.260]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show today, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:20:17.260 --> 03:20:18.940]  So good to be with you.
[03:20:18.940 --> 03:20:24.260]  You know, I hope you actually have a really wonderful summer and just ignore the summer
[03:20:24.260 --> 03:20:25.740]  of pride.
[03:20:25.740 --> 03:20:26.740]  It's just getting ridiculous.
[03:20:26.740 --> 03:20:27.740]  And you know what?
[03:20:27.740 --> 03:20:29.260]  Use your dollars to boycott.
[03:20:29.260 --> 03:20:32.540]  That's the most important thing we can do right now, boycott.
[03:20:32.540 --> 03:20:33.740]  Let them feel it.
[03:20:33.740 --> 03:20:34.740]  Let them feel it.
[03:20:34.740 --> 03:20:37.220]  They might be getting kickbacks from the government, yeah.
[03:20:37.220 --> 03:20:38.220]  But let them feel it.
[03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:43.580]  But most importantly, let the rest of the country realize and know right where America's
[03:20:43.580 --> 03:20:44.580]  at right now.
[03:20:44.580 --> 03:20:47.500]  Because that's actually truly telling the tale right now.
[03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:50.660]  You're seeing the backlash because we've just about had it, right?
[03:20:50.660 --> 03:20:54.340]  And so it's kind of nice to see people go, not shopping there anymore, not doing that
[03:20:54.340 --> 03:20:55.860]  anymore.
[03:20:55.860 --> 03:20:57.700]  Really and truly think about that.
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:20:58.980]  This is the time.
[03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:00.900]  You can do something small, do it.
[03:21:00.900 --> 03:21:03.980]  And something small would mean just don't go to Target.
[03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:06.980]  Don't go other places, right?
[03:21:06.980 --> 03:21:08.420]  Let's talk Second Amendment.
[03:21:08.420 --> 03:21:10.740]  I have to give my friend Dana credit for this.
[03:21:10.740 --> 03:21:14.140]  He was great and brilliant in this description.
[03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:16.980]  And I think a lot of people never really think about the words.
[03:21:16.980 --> 03:21:21.420]  The words are really important when you think about the meaning of what they were saying
[03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:23.700]  when they were saying it.
[03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:28.740]  So when you go back to dictionaries and you go back in time of these events, of these things
[03:21:28.740 --> 03:21:34.860]  that we did back in the late 1700s, you realize that there were certain kinds of meaning
[03:21:34.860 --> 03:21:35.860]  attached to words.
[03:21:35.860 --> 03:21:38.740]  This is why they're so intent on changing the meanings now.
[03:21:38.740 --> 03:21:43.780]  They love to change meanings on us because of this very thing so that we don't understand.
[03:21:43.780 --> 03:21:48.200]  So he said, you know, a well-regulated militia, this is the Second Amendment, being necessary
[03:21:48.200 --> 03:21:52.780]  to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
[03:21:52.780 --> 03:21:53.780]  not be infringed.
[03:21:53.780 --> 03:21:54.780]  I know you've heard it.
[03:21:54.780 --> 03:21:55.780]  I've heard it.
[03:21:55.780 --> 03:21:58.420]  We've read it many, many times.
[03:21:58.420 --> 03:21:59.420]  But think about this.
[03:21:59.420 --> 03:22:01.860]  This is the common thinking about the Second Amendment.
[03:22:01.860 --> 03:22:05.180]  When most people read the Second Amendment, including all the attorneys, you know, the
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:13.560]  author, you know, they all have these gross misconceptions as to its meaning and intent.
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:18.860]  And after questioning a lot of people, when people include attorneys and politicians read
[03:22:18.860 --> 03:22:24.940]  the Second Amendment, the thing they notice that it refers to is a regulated militia.
[03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:31.620]  And they've dropped out the word well, OK, well-regulated militia as part of it and assume
[03:22:31.620 --> 03:22:36.260]  that the regulated militia means controlled.
[03:22:36.260 --> 03:22:39.440]  Then they in their minds wonder, well, who's doing the controlling?
[03:22:39.440 --> 03:22:43.280]  And they read on and they come to the word state, which is capitalized.
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:47.500]  And they assume the word state means the state of Massachusetts or New Hampshire or any
[03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:49.660]  state in the Union.
[03:22:49.660 --> 03:22:55.020]  And what they conclude from that is that the militia is a state-controlled entity.
[03:22:55.020 --> 03:23:01.020]  They conclude further that it is a well-regulated, which means very much so or completely, because
[03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:06.260]  we kind of think of the word well like it's completely regulated or, you know, very much
[03:23:06.260 --> 03:23:10.120]  so it's regulated, well-regulated, right?
[03:23:10.120 --> 03:23:15.820]  And so from this, they continue to wrongly conclude that the militia is organized and
[03:23:15.820 --> 03:23:18.260]  directed by a state government.
[03:23:18.580 --> 03:23:21.900]  No, nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:23:21.900 --> 03:23:27.240]  Another misconception beyond the above is that no one will hear others and politicians
[03:23:27.240 --> 03:23:31.420]  say it is the right to carry a gun and that right is for self-defense.
[03:23:31.420 --> 03:23:35.860]  And with respect to the founding fathers, the right to self-defense was thoroughly understood
[03:23:35.860 --> 03:23:41.460]  principle which did not need explanation or support as they relied heavily on the philosophy
[03:23:41.460 --> 03:23:47.140]  of natural law in which self-defense is a first principle and a given, right?
[03:23:47.140 --> 03:23:51.940]  So what was enumerated in the Second Amendment goes far beyond self-defense.
[03:23:51.940 --> 03:23:58.060]  Recently the new governor, Kathy Hochul, absurdly, she's such a joke, absurdly indicated that
[03:23:58.060 --> 03:24:02.460]  the Second Amendment referred to muskets and that if you wanted a musket, well, okay, but
[03:24:02.460 --> 03:24:06.020]  you certainly should not be allowed to have modern weaponry.
[03:24:06.020 --> 03:24:10.420]  You love it when they call it that or assault weapons, give me a break, they don't understand
[03:24:10.420 --> 03:24:11.420]  it at all.
[03:24:11.420 --> 03:24:14.860]  None of the newspapers or other politicians in New York or elsewhere even called her out
[03:24:14.860 --> 03:24:19.340]  on this and it kind of highlights how confused politicians in the media are in the Second
[03:24:19.340 --> 03:24:22.220]  Amendment, especially those of a blue origin.
[03:24:22.220 --> 03:24:27.020]  Anyways, the well-regulated militia is defined as follows.
[03:24:27.020 --> 03:24:29.100]  Well-regulated is a compound adjective.
[03:24:29.100 --> 03:24:35.580]  It's the definition 9C in the large unabridged Oxford Dictionary of the English language,
[03:24:35.580 --> 03:24:39.380]  the large dictionary and libraries that no one, you know, that people have to have a
[03:24:39.380 --> 03:24:42.260]  magnifying glass, okay, to read.
[03:24:42.260 --> 03:24:49.100]  The only two uses where it could be used are well-regulated sluice or well-regulated motor
[03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:50.260]  back in the day.
[03:24:50.260 --> 03:24:54.700]  A sluice is a waterway with a control gate that diverts water into a water wheel, which
[03:24:54.700 --> 03:24:59.980]  has been used to grind grain in a mill or a power saw in a sawmill.
[03:24:59.980 --> 03:25:04.620]  A well-regulated sluice was one of the proper amounts of, kind of gives the proper amount
[03:25:04.620 --> 03:25:09.060]  of water as it was directed into the water wheel to get it to turn appropriately for
[03:25:09.060 --> 03:25:10.340]  the work at hand.
[03:25:10.340 --> 03:25:13.420]  Too much water would cause the water wheel to turn fast and break.
[03:25:13.420 --> 03:25:17.020]  Too little water wouldn't deliver enough power to the water wheel to do what it was
[03:25:17.020 --> 03:25:18.460]  supposed to do.
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:23.740]  With respect to the well-regulated motor, the meaning is that the motor is operational,
[03:25:23.740 --> 03:25:28.780]  the timing is correct, the spark plugs are gapped correctly, right, and the carburetor
[03:25:28.780 --> 03:25:33.260]  is adjusted such that the proper amount of fuel is being supplied to the correct amount
[03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:37.740]  of air to give proper ignition, right, inside the cylinders, also that the motor has enough
[03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:39.740]  fuel is ready to go.
[03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:44.440]  And from these two uses, you can see that something is well-regulated in its existence.
[03:25:44.440 --> 03:25:48.420]  It is tuned, it's organized, it has what it needs to run correctly and do the job it
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:50.500]  was designed to do.
[03:25:50.500 --> 03:25:56.860]  And from this, one should understand that a well-regulated militia is one that is in existence,
[03:25:56.860 --> 03:26:02.340]  it is organized and trained and tuned to do the job that it's assembled to do.
[03:26:02.340 --> 03:26:06.860]  And it has the supplies and materials necessarily to do that job, not that it's controlled by
[03:26:06.860 --> 03:26:11.980]  the state, but that it just is able to do what it's supposed to do.
[03:26:11.980 --> 03:26:16.380]  The founders thought when they wrote well-regulated that people would understand its meaning.
[03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:23.140]  In the 1700s, the people did understand what well-regulated meant.
[03:26:23.140 --> 03:26:28.020]  Given that one has a well-regulated militia, I'm having a hard time saying that today,
[03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:30.580]  one now wonders about the purpose of this.
[03:26:30.580 --> 03:26:34.780]  The purpose is laid down in the next part of the Second Amendment, well-regulated militia
[03:26:34.780 --> 03:26:38.340]  being necessary to the security of a free state.
[03:26:38.340 --> 03:26:45.060]  State is capitalized and people today believe it means a state, but it's not a state.
[03:26:45.060 --> 03:26:48.660]  It's generally a free state.
[03:26:48.660 --> 03:26:51.020]  It covers it all.
[03:26:51.020 --> 03:26:53.180]  It's not designated state by state.
[03:26:53.180 --> 03:26:55.500]  It doesn't mean the state that you live in.
[03:26:55.500 --> 03:27:01.460]  It means a free state, a free state of being, actually.
[03:27:01.460 --> 03:27:06.300]  In the 1700s, when one wished to emphasize a word, it was often capitalized.
[03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:10.380]  So Locke and Blackstone were two of the main philosophers that the founding fathers were
[03:27:10.380 --> 03:27:15.180]  reading and whose ideas the founders were incorporating into the Declaration of Independence
[03:27:15.180 --> 03:27:16.820]  and Constitution.
[03:27:16.820 --> 03:27:22.700]  In Blackstone's writings, he defined a free state as the condition of liberty.
[03:27:22.700 --> 03:27:24.340]  This is the state of being.
[03:27:24.340 --> 03:27:27.100]  This is the liberty for all.
[03:27:27.100 --> 03:27:30.340]  One should know there's a difference between liberty and freedom, right?
[03:27:30.340 --> 03:27:34.380]  Liberty is with morals, okay?
[03:27:34.380 --> 03:27:37.340]  Liberty is freedom with morals.
[03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:44.820]  That is, liberty can do as one wishes as long as they're not harming somebody else or their
[03:27:44.820 --> 03:27:47.500]  pursuit of one's happiness.
[03:27:47.500 --> 03:27:50.700]  The call in 1776 was for liberty.
[03:27:50.700 --> 03:27:54.500]  That means that we live with morals.
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:58.340]  Tell that to the war going on.
[03:27:58.340 --> 03:28:02.940]  Given that well-regulated militia and its purpose to maintain the free state, that is
[03:28:02.940 --> 03:28:05.780]  the condition of liberty.
[03:28:05.780 --> 03:28:10.780]  And in the next question, what rights must have in order to organize and supply a well-regulated
[03:28:10.780 --> 03:28:14.260]  militia, this question is answered in the last part of the Second Amendment.
[03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:18.860]  The right of the people to bear and keep arms shall not be infringed.
[03:28:18.860 --> 03:28:25.340]  They were talking about them being the well-regulated militia, ready for whatever happens, ready
[03:28:25.340 --> 03:28:31.940]  for what they need to do, but not controlled, not state-controlled.
[03:28:31.940 --> 03:28:35.860]  And the Founding Fathers enumerated many times in their other writings that our rights are
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:38.180]  God-given.
[03:28:38.180 --> 03:28:39.300]  They are.
[03:28:39.300 --> 03:28:42.260]  In the Second Amendment, they're confirming that the people have the right to carry and
[03:28:42.260 --> 03:28:46.780]  bear arms, weapons of any kind, right?
[03:28:46.780 --> 03:28:48.780]  Kathy doesn't know what she's talking about.
[03:28:48.780 --> 03:28:49.780]  I'll be right back.
[03:28:49.780 --> 03:28:50.780]  Isn't that great?
[03:28:50.780 --> 03:28:51.780]  Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:51.780 --> 03:28:52.780]  I'll be right back.
[03:28:52.780 --> 03:28:54.700]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:28:56.200 --> 03:29:01.380]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[03:29:01.380 --> 03:29:03.060]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:29:03.060 --> 03:29:05.740]  People said, no way he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:29:05.740 --> 03:29:07.460]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:29:07.460 --> 03:29:10.420]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[03:29:10.420 --> 03:29:13.620]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:29:13.620 --> 03:29:15.420]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[03:29:15.420 --> 03:29:21.420]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe
[03:29:21.420 --> 03:29:22.420]  Rogan.
[03:29:22.420 --> 03:29:25.780]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:29:25.780 --> 03:29:27.700]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:29:27.700 --> 03:29:32.340]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:29:32.340 --> 03:29:36.220]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:29:36.220 --> 03:29:39.620]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[03:29:39.620 --> 03:29:41.980]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[03:29:41.980 --> 03:29:43.260]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:29:43.260 --> 03:29:47.100]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products
[03:29:47.100 --> 03:29:49.060]  at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:49.060 --> 03:29:50.060]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:29:50.060 --> 03:29:51.780]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:51.780 --> 03:29:55.780]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:29:57.780 --> 03:30:00.780]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:30:00.780 --> 03:30:02.780]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:02.780 --> 03:30:06.780]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:30:06.780 --> 03:30:11.780]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:30:11.780 --> 03:30:15.780]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:30:15.780 --> 03:30:19.780]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[03:30:19.780 --> 03:30:24.780]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:30:24.780 --> 03:30:27.780]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:27.780 --> 03:30:32.780]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not
[03:30:32.780 --> 03:30:33.780]  support us.
[03:30:33.780 --> 03:30:34.780]  I know you spread the word.
[03:30:34.780 --> 03:30:35.780]  I know you pray for us.
[03:30:35.780 --> 03:30:36.780]  And that's wonderful.
[03:30:36.780 --> 03:30:37.780]  Keep doing it.
[03:30:37.780 --> 03:30:40.780]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:40.780 --> 03:30:44.780]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time
[03:30:44.780 --> 03:30:45.780]  keep us on air.
[03:30:45.780 --> 03:30:49.780]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:54.780]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[03:30:54.780 --> 03:30:55.780]  will be over.
[03:30:55.780 --> 03:30:56.780]  Please take action now.
[03:30:56.780 --> 03:31:01.780]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[03:31:01.780 --> 03:31:04.780]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:31:04.780 --> 03:31:06.780]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:31:06.780 --> 03:31:07.780]  Period.
[03:31:07.780 --> 03:31:08.780]  Case closed.
[03:31:08.780 --> 03:31:10.780]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:31:10.780 --> 03:31:14.780]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[03:31:14.780 --> 03:31:16.780]  It's been around about 15 years.
[03:31:16.780 --> 03:31:18.780]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:31:18.780 --> 03:31:22.780]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[03:31:22.780 --> 03:31:24.780]  that sells for twice the price.
[03:31:24.780 --> 03:31:27.780]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:31:27.780 --> 03:31:30.780]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:31:30.780 --> 03:31:32.780]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:35.780]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:31:35.780 --> 03:31:39.780]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:40.780]  leading competitor.
[03:31:40.780 --> 03:31:45.780]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:31:45.780 --> 03:31:47.780]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:31:47.780 --> 03:31:49.780]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:31:49.780 --> 03:31:50.780]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:31:50.780 --> 03:31:53.780]  The point is you can get the filters at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:53.780 --> 03:31:54.780]  They're discounted right now.
[03:31:54.780 --> 03:31:55.780]  Finally back in stock.
[03:31:55.780 --> 03:32:00.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[03:32:00.780 --> 03:32:01.780]  in plain view.
[03:32:01.780 --> 03:32:04.780]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:32:04.780 --> 03:32:09.780]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[03:32:09.780 --> 03:32:14.780]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:32:14.780 --> 03:32:21.780]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in
[03:32:21.780 --> 03:32:27.780]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:32:27.780 --> 03:32:33.780]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[03:32:33.780 --> 03:32:37.780]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:32:37.780 --> 03:32:39.780]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[03:32:39.780 --> 03:32:40.780]  You don't absorb it.
[03:32:40.780 --> 03:32:45.780]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:32:45.780 --> 03:32:48.780]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:48.780 --> 03:32:51.780]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:32:51.780 --> 03:32:53.780]  X3 back in stock.
[03:32:53.780 --> 03:32:54.780]  Take action now.
[03:32:54.780 --> 03:32:56.780]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:56.780 --> 03:33:02.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:02.780 --> 03:33:04.780]  www.infowarsstore.com
[03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:14.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.240 --> 03:33:17.840]  I'm just clarifying a little bit on the Second Amendment, and I think this kind of brings
[03:33:17.840 --> 03:33:20.280]  kind of a fresh take and understanding.
[03:33:20.280 --> 03:33:23.080]  When you really look at the words, you always have to go back into the dictionaries.
[03:33:23.080 --> 03:33:24.920]  I've done this a lot with research.
[03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:28.320]  You go back into the dictionaries of the day and you say, okay, what does that word actually
[03:33:28.320 --> 03:33:29.360]  mean?
[03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:32.600]  So when they wrote the Second Amendment, the words are really, really important.
[03:33:32.600 --> 03:33:33.600]  Well-regulated militia.
[03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:41.180]  It's a very interesting word choice for what the founders, when they came up with this,
[03:33:41.180 --> 03:33:43.360]  there was a certain meaning to it.
[03:33:43.360 --> 03:33:48.400]  And the second part of the Second Amendment, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
[03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:49.920]  shall not be infringed.
[03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:55.880]  It was the second part of the same sentence that included well-regulated militia, a militia
[03:33:55.880 --> 03:33:58.960]  ready to go, okay, talking about the people.
[03:33:58.960 --> 03:34:01.520]  And the founding fathers said this a lot.
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:03.560]  You know, the rights are God-given.
[03:34:03.560 --> 03:34:09.000]  And they made sure that the people realize that they knew where the rights came from.
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:11.720]  The Second Amendment, they were confirming to the people they have the right to keep
[03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:15.320]  and bear, carry and use arms, weapons.
[03:34:15.320 --> 03:34:19.800]  It's intrinsic to the Second Amendment that it is the people that make up the militia.
[03:34:19.800 --> 03:34:20.800]  This is so.
[03:34:20.800 --> 03:34:24.360]  I mean, it doesn't even have to be a group or a named group or whatever we want to kind
[03:34:24.360 --> 03:34:26.120]  of conjure up in our minds.
[03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:28.400]  It's just the people.
[03:34:28.400 --> 03:34:33.880]  So the right of the people to keep and bear arms, necessary component to forming a well-regulated
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:34.880]  militia.
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:39.560]  That kind of means just, it's not state controlled, just means everybody's ready to go to protect
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:45.800]  the liberty of the people because it's the state of being, not necessarily the state.
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:47.560]  It's important to understand that.
[03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:52.920]  And during the Revolutionary War, cannons were owned by individuals as well as towns.
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:54.760]  The town didn't have the cannon.
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:34:56.440]  People had cannons too.
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:34:58.960]  The word arms was carefully chosen.
[03:34:58.960 --> 03:35:03.200]  The right to keep and bear arms is qualified by the word infringed, which means not a little
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:05.400]  bit, not a whisper, not at all.
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:10.080]  The politicians, the powers that be have disregarded and trampled the right and the people have
[03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:11.080]  allowed it.
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:17.040]  So shame on us, right, for allowing the creep, the creep of the creeps.
[03:35:17.040 --> 03:35:20.760]  And of course, the founders are now rolling in their graves about how we have given this
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:22.760]  up and so many infringements.
[03:35:22.760 --> 03:35:27.760]  It is interesting that they chose the word infringement, not laws, but just infringements,
[03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:28.760]  regulations.
[03:35:28.760 --> 03:35:31.240]  I mean, it covers a lot, doesn't it?
[03:35:31.240 --> 03:35:35.600]  Infringement covers a lot of the things that have taken away our rights to just go and
[03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:37.240]  buy a firearm like we used to.
[03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:40.680]  We used to order them off a catalog and they'd arrive on our doorstep in the 1950s, for
[03:35:40.680 --> 03:35:42.480]  Pete's sakes.
[03:35:42.480 --> 03:35:47.240]  So the rights of a government, a self-feeding beast that has this limitless appetite for
[03:35:47.240 --> 03:35:51.600]  controlling the people, stealing their wealth and usurping their God-given rights.
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:55.720]  And of course, you know, the second amendment follows the first.
[03:35:55.720 --> 03:36:00.040]  I think we could probably come up with a lot of reasons as to why.
[03:36:00.040 --> 03:36:04.240]  Even if it wasn't written or they didn't come up with it in that particular order, they placed
[03:36:04.240 --> 03:36:05.240]  it in that order.
[03:36:05.240 --> 03:36:07.040]  It's kind of interesting.
[03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:10.400]  The second is the foundation, right?
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:13.600]  The foundation to keep freedom of speech.
[03:36:13.600 --> 03:36:19.440]  We're all very, very, very aware of censorship and how that's working right now.
[03:36:19.440 --> 03:36:24.400]  And so, of course, you had the, we can go back to the Nazis in Germany that we're all
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:26.280]  being accused of being, right?
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:28.680]  Isn't that their new MO?
[03:36:28.680 --> 03:36:30.200]  Everyone's a Nazi.
[03:36:30.200 --> 03:36:31.200]  Yeah.
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:36.000]  They failed to say that they brought all the Nazi scientists over here to run everything,
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  but whatever.
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:38.760]  We're all a Nazi.
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:39.760]  Okay.
[03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:43.800]  And then also, of course, Stalin came to power when he took the guns away from the people
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:45.480]  in Russia.
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:46.480]  Mao came to power.
[03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:49.280]  We took away the weapons from people in China.
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:51.240]  So it goes on and on and on.
[03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:53.360]  We all know the stories.
[03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:56.720]  And it's always this time when people are running for president, you know, Chris Christie
[03:36:56.720 --> 03:36:59.280]  threw in his little donut into the ring.
[03:36:59.280 --> 03:37:01.680]  Go eat a donut, Chris Christie.
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:02.680]  Nobody cares.
[03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:03.680]  Nobody wants this guy.
[03:37:03.680 --> 03:37:05.000]  And it's pathetic.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:07.960]  It's so pathetic to see him try to run for president.
[03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:13.480]  But what we have to stop doing as a public is to stop giving it the mantle that they
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:16.120]  so desperately want you to give it.
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:17.640]  It's really figurehead.
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:21.160]  We should all be saying, well, who's running for figurehead of the country?
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:24.640]  Because we all know that they're not actually running the country.
[03:37:24.640 --> 03:37:32.440]  King fraught a lot in his weird facial mask with the headlight, you know, with the forehead
[03:37:32.440 --> 03:37:33.440]  marbling.
[03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:36.680]  Anyway, we all know, right?
[03:37:36.680 --> 03:37:37.760]  He's not running the country.
[03:37:37.760 --> 03:37:40.200]  Who gets a facelift at 80?
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:41.200]  Nobody.
[03:37:41.200 --> 03:37:42.200]  We are.
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:43.200]  We already know that.
[03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:44.200]  We already know this.
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:45.800]  They don't run the country.
[03:37:45.800 --> 03:37:47.960]  They're the simple figurehead.
[03:37:47.960 --> 03:37:49.440]  They're the mannequin.
[03:37:49.440 --> 03:37:55.800]  They're the person that that comes to the fake scenery looking oval office that they
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:38:00.000]  built on the side of the White House to give a to give a weird speech that doesn't make
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:01.000]  sense.
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:02.280]  That's what they're there for.
[03:38:02.280 --> 03:38:07.800]  So we as a people should start saying figurehead back in the day when when the title of president
[03:38:07.800 --> 03:38:12.560]  was given, it was given because it was the lowliest title they could come up with.
[03:38:12.560 --> 03:38:15.280]  It was the equivalent of like a McDonald's manager.
[03:38:15.280 --> 03:38:17.480]  I'm not saying anything bad about McDonald's managers.
[03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:18.480]  We need to.
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:23.960]  But what I'm saying is, is that it was a manager, the head of a committee that it was never
[03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:25.640]  supposed to be like royalty.
[03:38:25.640 --> 03:38:27.200]  We were never supposed to treat it like this.
[03:38:27.200 --> 03:38:29.740]  It was never supposed to be that big of a deal.
[03:38:29.740 --> 03:38:33.320]  It was supposed to be somebody that, well, let me put it this way.
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:36.880]  Article two of the Constitution, the president's responsible for the execution and enforcement
[03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:39.600]  of the laws created by Congress.
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:42.400]  But Congress is the big kahuna.
[03:38:42.400 --> 03:38:44.200]  Congress is the important branch.
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:46.440]  Congress is the one that makes the laws.
[03:38:46.440 --> 03:38:49.680]  President's just standing there and watching it.
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:50.680]  Right.
[03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:54.560]  And it also says the president shall be the commander in chief of the Army, Navy of the
[03:38:54.560 --> 03:38:57.840]  United States and of the militia.
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:38:59.040]  Right.
[03:38:59.040 --> 03:39:00.040]  Very interesting.
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:01.040]  And of the militia.
[03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:02.040]  That's us.
[03:39:02.040 --> 03:39:05.800]  We're the militia, 90 percent gun owners in America.
[03:39:05.800 --> 03:39:07.680]  It's pretty darn good.
[03:39:07.680 --> 03:39:10.760]  That's why our gun crime rate is so low.
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:12.840]  That's why it's so far under 1 percent.
[03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:13.840]  It can't be calculated.
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:15.520]  Why?
[03:39:15.520 --> 03:39:16.520]  Gun death?
[03:39:16.520 --> 03:39:21.800]  Because we have gun ownership in this country, keeps people at bay.
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:25.680]  So don't buy into the lie that everything is falling apart at the seams and we're just
[03:39:25.680 --> 03:39:27.320]  this violent mass of people.
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:28.320]  We're not.
[03:39:28.320 --> 03:39:30.000]  There's a lot more crime.
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:31.280]  There's a lot more petty crime.
[03:39:31.280 --> 03:39:33.960]  I was just watching a documentary about leaving California.
[03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:34.960]  I'm from California.
[03:39:34.960 --> 03:39:37.040]  A lot more crime.
[03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:41.520]  But when it comes to gun death that they want to blame everything on, just like I said a
[03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:43.920]  couple of weeks ago, doesn't shake up.
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:44.920]  Right.
[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:45.920]  Doesn't shake out.
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:46.920]  I should say.
[03:39:46.920 --> 03:39:47.920]  Doesn't shake out.
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:51.160]  There isn't anonymous mass shootings, OK?
[03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:53.000]  Because usually they're always targeted.
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:54.320]  Usually it's a vengeful thing.
[03:39:54.320 --> 03:39:56.480]  Well, unless you're propped up by the FBI.
[03:39:56.480 --> 03:39:58.400]  Did I just say that?
[03:39:58.400 --> 03:40:02.800]  Anyway, the president was supposed to be this lowly, lowly title.
[03:40:02.800 --> 03:40:07.320]  It was the lowliest title they could actually give him without just making him look like
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:09.480]  a stump sitting there.
[03:40:09.480 --> 03:40:13.840]  So when we talk about who's running for president, and of course, you know, in radio, it's really
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:14.840]  interesting.
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:17.000]  I've been doing radio for lots of years.
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.800]  And radio is interesting because every four years is when you peak, right?
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:24.280]  The numbers are huge and everybody's tuned in.
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:25.680]  Why?
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:27.000]  Everybody shows up to the polls.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  Why?
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:29.440]  To see who's going to be president.
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:30.440]  As if it matters.
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:32.000]  Do you know what matters more?
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:33.780]  Your city council.
[03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:38.680]  Your county commissioners in each county playing the Agenda 30 game.
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:39.880]  Okay?
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:43.360]  Introducing all kinds of new Agenda 30 tricks up their sleeves.
[03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:44.640]  That's what's more important.
[03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:47.080]  That affects your life more.
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:50.440]  The president doesn't really matter anymore.
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:54.520]  So when people ask me, you know, who you're going to vote for for president, does it matter?
[03:40:54.520 --> 03:40:56.180]  Does it really matter?
[03:40:56.180 --> 03:40:59.160]  It matters more who your sold-out governor is.
[03:40:59.160 --> 03:41:05.240]  At the last Governor's Association, they were all vying for, including mine, my ridiculous
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:09.040]  governor, Little Gavin, we call him Little Gavin Newsom.
[03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:14.960]  They were all vying for Pfizer, Pfizer plants to be, you know, Pfizer wants to spread the
[03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:17.520]  wealth around and put more plants on the ground.
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:18.520]  Because why?
[03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:19.520]  Right?
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:22.200]  Because they have a lot more shots to make up.
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:26.160]  They've got a lot more shots in the works to give to you.
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:31.160]  And it's sad and disgusting that the governors would be dancing for Pfizer to get Pfizer
[03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:33.120]  to come to their states.
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:34.120]  Right?
[03:41:34.120 --> 03:41:38.600]  In the light of what's going on, but that's where we're headed.
[03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:44.240]  The insurance companies and pharma run a lot more of this country than the president ever
[03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:46.440]  will and ever does.
[03:41:46.440 --> 03:41:47.920]  So does it actually really matter?
[03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:49.960]  I'm not quite sure it does.
[03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:52.980]  I think what's more important is that you're invested into local politics.
[03:41:52.980 --> 03:41:58.440]  You show up at the meetings and you see what ridiculousness is happening next.
[03:41:58.440 --> 03:42:00.240]  And they'll always give you two excuses.
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:02.080]  These are the excuses to look for.
[03:42:02.080 --> 03:42:06.320]  Well, we've always done it this way and it's worked for us.
[03:42:06.320 --> 03:42:08.280]  So they're not willing to change anything.
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:11.520]  And then when they get in, they say, I can't change anything because it's already set
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:12.520]  in stone.
[03:42:12.520 --> 03:42:13.960]  Those are the excuses you'll get.
[03:42:13.960 --> 03:42:14.960]  You need to fight those things.
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:21.080]  You got to fight locally and in our states and get rid of these governors, these monstrosities
[03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:25.000]  that we have for governors that are so bought and sold.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:26.920]  Just kind of picture them like Target and Bud Light.
[03:42:26.920 --> 03:42:28.480]  Now you have your governors.
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:32.320]  They're ready to roll with whatever, whatever the feds tell them to do.
[03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:35.880]  And the feds are trying to connect with all your local cities now, try to get their hooks
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:39.040]  in and things done throughout the cities.
[03:42:39.040 --> 03:42:41.480]  And that's what we have to stop.
[03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:44.040]  Don't worry so much about who the president is.
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:46.320]  It could be, you know, donut loving Chris Christie.
[03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:47.320]  It could be anybody.
[03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:49.360]  But I really do think we have to focus on local.
[03:42:49.360 --> 03:42:50.680]  I'm going to come right back.
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:54.480]  I have some information on the shots I want to share with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:54.480 --> 03:42:56.920]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:42:59.480]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:42:59.480 --> 03:43:01.560]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:03.600]  It will change your life.
[03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:08.080]  The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:12.320]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:17.840]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:23.580]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[03:43:23.580 --> 03:43:27.900]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[03:43:27.900 --> 03:43:33.740]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of
[03:43:33.740 --> 03:43:34.740]  full effect.
[03:43:34.740 --> 03:43:37.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[03:43:37.980 --> 03:43:40.980]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[03:43:40.980 --> 03:43:43.980]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:43:43.980 --> 03:43:46.180]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[03:43:46.180 --> 03:43:47.500]  You and your family need it.
[03:43:47.500 --> 03:43:49.700]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[03:43:49.700 --> 03:43:54.020]  X3, try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:55.020]  Take action now.
[03:43:55.020 --> 03:43:57.260]  But regardless, research is info.
[03:43:57.260 --> 03:44:01.060]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[03:44:01.060 --> 03:44:02.780]  This is their big move.
[03:44:02.780 --> 03:44:06.580]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:44:06.580 --> 03:44:08.340]  He doesn't care.
[03:44:08.340 --> 03:44:09.580]  That's not his job.
[03:44:09.580 --> 03:44:11.340]  He's not the president of the United States.
[03:44:11.340 --> 03:44:15.020]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:44:15.020 --> 03:44:19.660]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[03:44:19.660 --> 03:44:20.660]  They must be opposed.
[03:44:20.660 --> 03:44:28.500]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no, exactly.
[03:44:28.500 --> 03:44:32.020]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:44:32.020 --> 03:44:35.140]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:44:35.140 --> 03:44:37.620]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:44:37.620 --> 03:44:40.120]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:43.740]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:44:43.740 --> 03:44:46.300]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[03:44:46.300 --> 03:44:47.300]  You're right.
[03:44:47.300 --> 03:44:49.900]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[03:44:49.900 --> 03:44:51.700]  And we say no.
[03:44:51.700 --> 03:44:56.780]  And we say no to your war.
[03:44:56.780 --> 03:45:01.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[03:45:01.460 --> 03:45:03.100]  in plain view.
[03:45:03.100 --> 03:45:05.860]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:45:05.860 --> 03:45:10.140]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[03:45:10.140 --> 03:45:15.380]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:45:15.460 --> 03:45:22.660]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in
[03:45:22.660 --> 03:45:28.980]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:45:28.980 --> 03:45:34.660]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[03:45:34.660 --> 03:45:39.060]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:45:39.060 --> 03:45:41.300]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[03:45:41.300 --> 03:45:45.140]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together.
[03:45:45.900 --> 03:45:46.900]  It supercharges your body.
[03:45:46.900 --> 03:45:51.580]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com, it's been sold out for over six months for
[03:45:51.580 --> 03:45:52.820]  25% off.
[03:45:52.820 --> 03:45:56.460]  X3, back in stock, take action now, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:56.460 --> 03:46:02.580]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:46:02.580 --> 03:46:03.580]  the atmosphere.
[03:46:03.580 --> 03:46:06.420]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:46:06.420 --> 03:46:12.860]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:46:12.860 --> 03:46:15.020]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:46:15.020 --> 03:46:17.300]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:46:17.300 --> 03:46:22.060]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to
[03:46:22.060 --> 03:46:23.180]  dispose of it.
[03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:28.100]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:46:28.100 --> 03:46:31.620]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:46:31.620 --> 03:46:38.140]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:46:38.140 --> 03:46:40.500]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:46:40.500 --> 03:46:45.780]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:46:45.780 --> 03:46:52.220]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[03:46:52.220 --> 03:46:57.180]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:57.180 --> 03:47:03.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:04.800 --> 03:47:15.920]  I'm here with you, last segment of the Alex Jones show for me today.
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:19.439]  Look, and you're halfway through your week, I hope that makes you happy.
[03:47:19.439 --> 03:47:23.759]  So Elon's Neuralink, I want to talk about this and I want to talk about Kindle, why
[03:47:23.759 --> 03:47:25.000]  it's called Kindle.
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:31.439]  Elon's Neuralink, the groundbreaking news, the FDA grants approval to Elon Musk's Neuralink
[03:47:31.439 --> 03:47:33.920]  for human trials.
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:39.560]  And they also talked about a monumental breakthrough, brain implant startup Neuralink has received
[03:47:39.560 --> 03:47:43.840]  approval in its first ever human clinical trial.
[03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:45.759]  I think they actually already started this.
[03:47:45.759 --> 03:47:48.960]  I think they're doing portions of this with the COVID vaccine.
[03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:53.279]  You know, I often call it a drip system for a reason, because you need multiple shots
[03:47:53.279 --> 03:47:57.380]  to be able to have our bodies not kick it out completely, but I actually think they've
[03:47:57.380 --> 03:47:58.380]  already been doing this.
[03:47:58.380 --> 03:48:02.279]  He's been working on Neuralink for quite a long time, but you know, he props himself
[03:48:02.320 --> 03:48:05.320]  up as the guy with the free speech guy.
[03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:09.759]  He might be a free speech guy, but I don't really trust what Elon's doing out there,
[03:48:09.759 --> 03:48:10.759]  I really don't.
[03:48:10.759 --> 03:48:12.759]  Anyway, that's just me.
[03:48:12.759 --> 03:48:17.080]  But I just kind of wanted to mention too, that the whole AI thing, there's a lot of
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:19.800]  people commenting on AI right now.
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:25.560]  And I think they're showing us the equivalent of introducing us to 8-Track.
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:30.199]  In what they can do with AI right now and what they're presently doing with AI fakery and
[03:48:30.199 --> 03:48:32.080]  everything else.
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:34.960]  They're showing the people 8-Track.
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:38.439]  I mean, let's go back 50 years and go back to 8-Track, shall we?
[03:48:38.439 --> 03:48:42.800]  They're showing people 8-Track as if this is where we're at right now with AI.
[03:48:42.800 --> 03:48:44.640]  And it couldn't be further from the truth.
[03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:47.880]  I think we're actually 50 years ahead of that.
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:52.080]  And I think that they don't want to show us what they've got, because they're using it
[03:48:52.080 --> 03:48:53.080]  so much.
[03:48:53.080 --> 03:48:54.960]  Just my thoughts.
[03:48:54.960 --> 03:49:01.640]  I also wanted to mention that Japanese professor, Marikame, I'm probably saying that wrong,
[03:49:01.640 --> 03:49:02.640]  murdering his name.
[03:49:02.640 --> 03:49:07.599]  But he's a professor of Tokyo and with the astonishing finding that the Pfizer jab contained
[03:49:07.599 --> 03:49:11.720]  the SV40 sequence, which is known as the promoter of cancer virus.
[03:49:11.720 --> 03:49:15.840]  You may be noticing a lot of people around you suddenly coming up with cancer.
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:20.000]  I think a lot of people can have cancer in their systems based on all the other stuff
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:22.439]  that they've been doing to us for decades.
[03:49:22.439 --> 03:49:26.840]  But I think the COVID shots kick it up and kind of light it on fire.
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:31.000]  Just as Judy Mikevitz, I interviewed Judy Mikevitz clear back in 2020.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:33.880]  And she said, yep, this is exactly what's going to happen, cancer.
[03:49:33.880 --> 03:49:38.080]  Because what's in the shots is mice, leukemia, AIDS, all kinds of things.
[03:49:38.080 --> 03:49:42.619]  And when people get this into their system, what it does then is it lights up cancers
[03:49:42.619 --> 03:49:45.840]  and problems that they already have.
[03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:47.279]  And I think that's going on right now.
[03:49:47.279 --> 03:49:51.640]  You can go to all kinds of different genocide websites right now, and people are offering
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:54.640]  up their sad stories, and it really is sad.
[03:49:54.640 --> 03:49:57.640]  Nobody's not, well, we're all affected by it, right?
[03:49:57.640 --> 03:49:59.439]  We all know somebody.
[03:49:59.439 --> 03:50:03.599]  And perfectly good health, and then all of a sudden, they're jabbed to the hilt, and
[03:50:03.599 --> 03:50:06.080]  now they're fighting cancer.
[03:50:06.080 --> 03:50:11.199]  And I know that when people at a hospital in my own state were going in, they were
[03:50:11.199 --> 03:50:15.560]  saying that, hey, if you want a breast exam, just don't come in right now if you just had
[03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:16.679]  those shots.
[03:50:16.679 --> 03:50:20.080]  Make sure, this was last year, don't come in right now because it'll light up his cancer.
[03:50:20.080 --> 03:50:21.080]  We'll see cancer.
[03:50:21.080 --> 03:50:22.080]  Scary, right?
[03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:27.960]  Really scary, because I know a lot of loved ones probably of yours have gotten those shots.
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:29.240]  I also want to talk about Kindle.
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:32.840]  I'm going to shift gears just a little bit because we're kind of out of time, but I wanted
[03:50:32.840 --> 03:50:37.640]  to talk about Kindle for a moment because, of course, this involves Bezos, Jeff Bezos,
[03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:42.840]  Mr. CIA, and what could be, like he said, back in Entrepreneur Magazine.
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:46.000]  And the reason I'm talking about this too is I know people do a lot of summer reading,
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  right?
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:48.000]  You're getting those books out.
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:52.679]  I like Don Fotheringham's book, The President Makers.
[03:50:52.679 --> 03:50:54.199]  That's like must-have reading.
[03:50:54.199 --> 03:50:55.439]  I love his book.
[03:50:55.439 --> 03:50:57.279]  He was a total, he's a total warrior.
[03:50:57.279 --> 03:51:02.320]  Still alive, World War II vet, by the way, but The President Makers on Amazon.
[03:51:02.320 --> 03:51:09.720]  But back in, this was years ago when he was inventing this, in Entrepreneur Magazine,
[03:51:09.720 --> 03:51:15.000]  Bezos said, what could possibly be more important than reinventing the book itself?
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:20.960]  In 2017, Business Insider did an article about Kindle and the team that worked on it.
[03:51:20.960 --> 03:51:25.279]  They wanted it to be called, the team wanted it to be called Fiona, but Jeff Bezos wanted
[03:51:25.279 --> 03:51:31.480]  Kindle because it evoked the idea of starting a fire, like kindling.
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:32.480]  You mean like book-burning?
[03:51:32.480 --> 03:51:36.759]  Uh-huh, like that.
[03:51:36.759 --> 03:51:42.800]  Message boards lit up from people claiming that this name, Kindling, in the dystopian
[03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:47.720]  novel Fahrenheit 451, Fahrenheit's the story of a fireman whose government job it is to
[03:51:47.720 --> 03:51:48.720]  burn books.
[03:51:48.720 --> 03:51:50.439]  I know you guys have probably read this book.
[03:51:50.439 --> 03:51:55.480]  You can also change the text in electronic books, but you can't change text and words
[03:51:55.480 --> 03:51:58.000]  in printed books in people's basements, right?
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:03.560]  It's a lot easier electronically, and I think a lot of that is going on, actually.
[03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:08.439]  Ray Bradbury, who died in 2012, the author of Fahrenheit, pronounced at a book expo
[03:52:08.439 --> 03:52:13.920]  in 2008, there is no future for e-books because they're not books.
[03:52:13.920 --> 03:52:14.920]  He knew.
[03:52:14.920 --> 03:52:20.359]  He knew they could be absolutely tinkered with, and he talked about the need for physical
[03:52:20.359 --> 03:52:25.800]  books that can't be taken away from you and could not be wiped out, right?
[03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:34.720]  Electronic books could be wiped out, and so Jeff Bezos, the same guy in 2013 that secured
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:39.800]  that $600 million contract with the CIA, no biggie, right?
[03:52:39.800 --> 03:52:40.800]  Right.
[03:52:40.800 --> 03:52:48.019]  Amazon Web Services, and of course, you guys all know that, and then, of course, the National
[03:52:48.019 --> 03:52:52.640]  Security Agency being awarded the secret cloud computing contract worth up to $10 billion
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:55.519]  from Amazon Web Services, right?
[03:52:55.519 --> 03:53:00.199]  That all came from NextGov, and so, of course, there's lots of weird things going on over
[03:53:00.199 --> 03:53:02.480]  there at Amazon.
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:08.880]  But I have to say that most people are not really aware of what disrupting what books
[03:53:08.880 --> 03:53:09.880]  look like.
[03:53:09.880 --> 03:53:11.199]  I know a lot of people like Kindle.
[03:53:11.199 --> 03:53:14.160]  They like these kinds of things because they're easy, right?
[03:53:14.160 --> 03:53:15.160]  You just take that.
[03:53:15.160 --> 03:53:19.000]  You've got a lot of books, and you don't have a heavy load to carry, but I think it's really
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  important.
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:22.840]  A neighbor of mine was getting rid of all their books, and they said, well, we've all
[03:53:22.840 --> 03:53:24.199]  got them electronically.
[03:53:24.199 --> 03:53:26.800]  There's just no need for it anymore, and my heart sank.
[03:53:26.800 --> 03:53:29.640]  I thought, no, keep those books.
[03:53:29.640 --> 03:53:30.920]  Keep those books.
[03:53:30.960 --> 03:53:35.679]  When Don Fotheringham was writing The President Makers, he actually had to spend two to three
[03:53:35.679 --> 03:53:40.640]  years going into people's basements to find the books that are no longer available anymore
[03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:46.800]  so he could write the book about who was behind every presidency since the turn of the 20th
[03:53:46.800 --> 03:53:51.599]  century, since the early 1900s, starting with Colonel House, and he wrote who was creating
[03:53:51.599 --> 03:53:54.920]  all these things, who was behind the EPA, who was behind all of that.
[03:53:54.920 --> 03:54:00.679]  He couldn't have done it with the electronic books today because so many books are not there.
[03:54:01.439 --> 03:54:04.920]  He had to go to people's basements to find these books that people had hung on to for
[03:54:04.920 --> 03:54:10.039]  years to be able to write The President Makers and have the proof and the pictures, the things
[03:54:10.039 --> 03:54:11.679]  that he needed.
[03:54:11.679 --> 03:54:13.160]  This is so important.
[03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:16.000]  Please do not get rid of your old books, please.
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:17.480]  Keep them in your basement.
[03:54:17.480 --> 03:54:19.240]  Keep them wherever you can.
[03:54:19.240 --> 03:54:24.279]  It's kind of like in Fahrenheit and the discussion on the message boards right after Kindle came
[03:54:24.279 --> 03:54:29.720]  out and right after they were kind of shifting to celebrating this new way to read was, well,
[03:54:29.759 --> 03:54:35.800]  you can hide a book somewhere, but if you're electronically wiped out of all your books,
[03:54:35.800 --> 03:54:40.080]  you can't even do that, you know, from the powers that be.
[03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:44.199]  And so there is something there that I think we all need to think about in the future.
[03:54:44.199 --> 03:54:47.560]  You know, what are we doing getting rid of all these things?
[03:54:47.560 --> 03:54:55.199]  And when they set about that, the Kindle name, you know, the team wanted Fiona, but he wanted
[03:54:55.199 --> 03:55:00.039]  Kindle because it evoked the idea of starting a fire like Kindling.
[03:55:00.039 --> 03:55:04.759]  I just thought that was something that you guys needed to be really aware of.
[03:55:04.759 --> 03:55:10.920]  When I saw that, I thought, wow, there was really a situation that was admitted to in
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:15.199]  which they wanted to change history again.
[03:55:15.199 --> 03:55:19.840]  Now, they took over public education on the deep state.
[03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:26.439]  The Rockefellers took over education clear back with the Carnegie Foundation in 1907
[03:55:26.439 --> 03:55:31.400]  and it was in their notes and they said they were going to change history by erasing American
[03:55:31.400 --> 03:55:32.400]  history.
[03:55:32.400 --> 03:55:34.720]  They weren't going to talk about the Constitution in class as much.
[03:55:34.720 --> 03:55:38.679]  They weren't going to refer to all the things that truly, truly happened.
[03:55:38.679 --> 03:55:39.800]  They weren't going to do it anymore.
[03:55:39.800 --> 03:55:44.359]  They wanted all the teachers trained over in London and then bring them back here.
[03:55:44.359 --> 03:55:49.720]  And there was a concerted effort by the Carnegie Foundation to go after education.
[03:55:50.599 --> 03:55:52.840]  And they did successfully and turned public into education.
[03:55:52.840 --> 03:55:55.640]  I don't even know if you can call it education anymore.
[03:55:55.640 --> 03:55:58.759]  It's just public.
[03:55:58.759 --> 03:56:00.920]  I don't know what the word is agenda.
[03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:01.920]  I don't know.
[03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:04.279]  But that's the direction that they're going.
[03:56:04.279 --> 03:56:10.720]  And I, I want to let you guys know that because there is something, well, he admitted it.
[03:56:10.720 --> 03:56:15.160]  Jeff Bezos actually admitted that it invoked starting of a fire.
[03:56:15.160 --> 03:56:17.599]  He really wanted real books to go away.
[03:56:17.599 --> 03:56:21.000]  But yes, of course, it was about profit and it was about a lot of things.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:23.359]  Of course, it's Jeff Bezos.
[03:56:23.359 --> 03:56:30.080]  But I do think that there was a very much an effort to say, we are no longer going to be
[03:56:30.080 --> 03:56:35.119]  looking at our history and any books we can kick to the curb, we will.
[03:56:35.119 --> 03:56:39.660]  And so it's really important right now to go back to those very, very old books and
[03:56:39.660 --> 03:56:42.800]  read those instead of the new garbage they come out with.
[03:56:42.800 --> 03:56:46.480]  And instead of the biopics they come out with to paint a certain candidate or a certain
[03:56:46.480 --> 03:56:50.359]  person in whatever way they want, you're probably not going to get a whole lot of
[03:56:50.359 --> 03:56:51.359]  the truth.
[03:56:51.359 --> 03:56:54.800]  It's kind of like, you know, one of those ABC or CBS movies, you're not going to get
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:58.640]  a whole lot of truth, but go back into the very, very old books.
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:03.080]  I think it would do us some favors to go to a few more thrift stores to find some books
[03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:06.640]  that aren't really in print anymore and grab those and read them.
[03:57:06.640 --> 03:57:10.720]  I think we'll be surprised at what we find in the changing of history and in the changing
[03:57:10.720 --> 03:57:17.199]  of the agenda over the last 120 years that we've been going through.
[03:57:17.199 --> 03:57:19.480]  Make no mistake, that agenda is strong.
[03:57:19.480 --> 03:57:20.480]  It's here.
[03:57:20.480 --> 03:57:21.480]  We all feel it.
[03:57:21.480 --> 03:57:22.480]  We all know it.
[03:57:22.480 --> 03:57:24.560]  And we have to do everything we can do to fight it and stop it.
[03:57:24.560 --> 03:57:29.119]  I do think we're all, we all have the accountability of what did you do?
[03:57:29.119 --> 03:57:30.119]  What was your part?
[03:57:30.119 --> 03:57:35.359]  We're all here for a reason, but what did you do to stop the insanity of what's happening
[03:57:35.359 --> 03:57:36.359]  right now to us?
[03:57:36.359 --> 03:57:37.359]  And we can do it.
[03:57:38.359 --> 03:57:43.679]  Get those old books, lots of things we can do and get involved locally in local politics.
[03:57:43.679 --> 03:57:44.679]  Thanks for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:44.679 --> 03:57:46.960]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.

[03:58:32.279 --> 03:58:35.080]  But this is the King Kong.
