[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  Welcome on this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host for
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  today. It's kind of interesting a story that we have on InfoWars. It's not something that
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.040]  we're unaccustomed to. The fact that you have people attacking free speech. We see them doing
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.360]  this in every way possible. We had Jake Lloyd go out and do a report. They grabbed the microphone out
[00:45.360 --> 00:52.880]  of his hand. They've done that to us at Planned Parenthood protests where we're talking about
[00:52.880 --> 00:59.200]  the genocide of Planned Parenthood. This is the left tactic as we were there holding up signs of
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.320]  little babies and saying black lives do matter and this has been planned as a genocide from the
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.360]  very beginning. They showed up to put black signs in front of our signs. They had nothing to say.
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.120]  They just didn't want us to say anything. Of course you see it all the time on social media.
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.440]  I just had somebody troll me on something and they didn't like what I had to say. So they said
[01:17.440 --> 01:21.440]  somebody needs to take away David Knight's Twitter account. They need to take the keyboard out of his
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.280]  hand. I retweeted it and I said well you know this is a typical response from the left. They
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.440]  don't want to debate you. They want to censor you. But of course it's going to get more violent.
[01:29.440 --> 01:35.040]  And what we're seeing in the UK is Tommy Robinson just walking down the street being singled out by
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.720]  10 individuals with balaclavas on their head covering up their face so nobody can see them
[01:40.720 --> 01:47.840]  attacking him. And we have the clip at InfoWars.com. I want to play you a little bit of this clip. Just
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.800]  give you an idea of what's going on. It's about a 20 minute clip so we're not going to play it. And
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.400]  there's a lot of visual stuff here so it's not appropriate for the radio. But let's play a little
[01:54.400 --> 01:58.960]  bit of that clip so you get a taste of what that is. This is the way the left reacts to people. The
[01:58.960 --> 02:05.840]  way they bully and target. I guess we could even say bully and harass people. We're a shoot tube
[02:05.840 --> 02:09.120]  to protect Tommy Robinson. They're not going to be there. Here's a little bit of that clip.
[02:09.120 --> 02:20.960]  All right these guys with masks on. Attacking a woman who is filming them. 10 of them coming
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.880]  after Tommy Robinson. Trying to take the camera away from her.
[02:30.240 --> 02:34.800]  Coming at him from the back. Attacking him. Knocking him down from the back and jumping
[02:34.800 --> 02:40.400]  on him. But he gets up and starts fighting him. And he basically fights him off. Spoiler
[02:40.400 --> 02:44.000]  flirt here. But he basically fights him off and then talks about it to other people.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.560]  And the amazing thing about this clip to me. I was still standing here. Your mate's run off.
[02:50.400 --> 02:55.040]  He's talking to the police. He's run off. It's not that they'll worry about it. There's no
[02:55.040 --> 03:00.800]  allegation for me. It's not a deal of it. You cowards. He walks down to the police and said
[03:00.800 --> 03:11.280]  how many of them were there? Your friends ran away. And how did they do? You're not on camera.
[03:14.720 --> 03:22.240]  He's asking some people there. How did I do? He had to fight off 10 people who were teaming up
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.200]  attacking him from every angle because the police would not do anything. As he pointed out to the
[03:27.200 --> 03:43.440]  police, he said your friends, your mates ran away. All right. And that's, you can see the
[03:43.440 --> 03:49.680]  rest of that report at Info Wars. It's pretty amazing to me. But this is the tactic to the left.
[03:49.680 --> 03:57.280]  And this is the tactic of the police who basically will not do anything. Absolutely amazing. They
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.680]  see a fight like that. They don't want to get in the middle of it. They just run away. We can
[04:01.680 --> 04:08.560]  expect that. And as we are going to talk in the show, we've now had the Florida governor sign a
[04:08.560 --> 04:15.040]  massive gun control bill. It's a $400 million gun control bill. There you go. Big spending
[04:15.040 --> 04:22.240]  Republican, anti-self-protection Republican, $400 million gun control bill from the Republican
[04:22.240 --> 04:28.160]  governor there, Rick Scott. Because, you know, you can't protect anybody unless you've got a uniform,
[04:28.160 --> 04:35.520]  right? And we saw a lot of that, didn't we, at the Stoneman Douglas School that began all of
[04:35.520 --> 04:41.920]  this gun control movement in Florida. The people with uniforms did basically the same thing there
[04:41.920 --> 04:47.040]  that the police and uniform did when you had Tommy Robinson surrounded and attacked by 10
[04:47.040 --> 04:53.600]  individuals. They protect themselves. They walk away. See, sometimes it doesn't require a uniform
[04:53.600 --> 04:58.480]  to be a hero. You can be a hero and wear a uniform, but you can also be a hero without a uniform.
[04:58.480 --> 05:02.880]  Stay with us and be right back. I'm David Knight. I'm so excited. The new product at
[05:02.880 --> 05:09.520]  InfoWarsLife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute
[05:09.520 --> 05:16.800]  top, the real red bill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants
[05:16.800 --> 05:23.360]  in it. But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I
[05:23.360 --> 05:28.800]  saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging
[05:28.800 --> 05:35.360]  people $100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists
[05:35.360 --> 05:42.560]  and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen,
[05:42.560 --> 05:47.600]  you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body
[05:47.600 --> 05:55.040]  has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available
[05:55.040 --> 06:11.280]  at infowarsstore.com and your purchase funds the operation. News, analysis, reports. It's the
[06:11.280 --> 06:23.760]  Alex Jones show. And now your host, David Knight. Welcome to this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.480]  show. I'm David Knight, your host today. I just played at the top of the hour a video of Tommy
[06:28.480 --> 06:34.560]  Robinson being attacked by an anti-fog gang of 10 guys wearing masks. Of course, they're ashamed
[06:34.560 --> 06:38.320]  of what they do. They should be ashamed, bunch of cowards, 10 people attacking one individual,
[06:38.320 --> 06:44.240]  but he fought them off. A very compelling video. It's about 20 minutes long. I played a clip of it
[06:44.240 --> 06:49.520]  at the top of the hour when we didn't have our radio stations joining us. If you want to see that,
[06:49.520 --> 06:55.360]  you can see that at infowars.com. Tommy Robinson attacked by anti-fog gang. And it's important
[06:55.360 --> 07:03.280]  to understand what the tactics of the left are. And you can see it in that clip very easily. And
[07:03.280 --> 07:08.080]  of course, afterwards, he walked over to a large group of police officers not far away who were
[07:08.080 --> 07:14.400]  just standing there doing nothing. And he said, Hey, why didn't you guys help me? Oh, nothing to
[07:14.400 --> 07:21.840]  worry about. And he says, your major friends ran away when they saw this. Kind of like what we
[07:21.840 --> 07:28.640]  have seen with the cowards of Broward County, the sheriff's officers who would not go in. That wasn't
[07:28.640 --> 07:32.000]  the case of the police department. That was the case for the sheriff's department. See,
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.560]  just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean that you're a hero. Doesn't mean that you will protect
[07:36.560 --> 07:40.480]  other people. Doesn't mean that you'll put your life on the line. Certainly, the police department
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.840]  did. Not the county sheriff's office. And so you have different rules on different people.
[07:45.840 --> 07:50.880]  And the very fact that somebody is wearing a uniform doesn't make them a hero. You don't have
[07:50.880 --> 07:56.080]  to have a uniform to be a hero. We saw that in the Sutherland Springs Church shooting.
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.280]  The guy who was the hero there had the gun that the left hates so badly, the AR-15,
[08:04.320 --> 08:08.720]  which they want to ban. That's got to be purged from the earth. We're going to wish that away
[08:08.720 --> 08:14.480]  into the cornfield. Never again, never again, they say. Never again is the most naive thing
[08:14.480 --> 08:19.040]  I've ever heard anybody say. You can't say that about anything. Certainly can't say that about
[08:19.040 --> 08:25.840]  conflicts. We heard that after World War I. Maybe these high school students didn't get that in
[08:25.840 --> 08:30.720]  history. You know that war to end all wars? Well, it didn't actually do that, did it?
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.760]  You're never going to find a situation where we're going to change the nature of man. That's
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.200]  basically what they need to understand. It's in the nature of man. So the best we can do
[08:41.920 --> 08:47.200]  is make sure that good people that have been vetted that are trained are able to protect
[08:47.200 --> 08:50.720]  other people. But that's not what they're doing in Florida. We're going to get into gun control
[08:50.720 --> 08:56.320]  and how Florida has responded. The Republican governor acting like you would expect Hillary
[08:56.320 --> 09:04.080]  Clinton to act, spending $400 million, creating a new gun control bill. So here we have big spending,
[09:04.080 --> 09:10.720]  anti-second amendment, Republican rhino. See, did I miss anything? Let's say big spending,
[09:11.520 --> 09:17.200]  anti-second amendment, anti-self-protection, Republican, quote unquote, Republican, in
[09:17.200 --> 09:23.440]  name only, Rick Scott. And immediately the NRA has filed suit. So I'm going to tell you about that.
[09:23.440 --> 09:29.120]  And I'm going to give you an example of why Rick Scott is wrong inciting with the Democrats in
[09:29.120 --> 09:33.520]  this. We'll talk about that in a moment. We're also going to talk about Trumponomics. We're going
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.400]  to talk about the victory left that he was taking in Pennsylvania as he's taking the stump trying to
[09:38.400 --> 09:44.480]  help a Republican in a congressional race that's coming up there in Pennsylvania. This is a very
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.600]  wise move politically, but it's the right thing to do. It's what President Trump campaigned on.
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.400]  And I think we're going to look back at this and we're going to talk about, instead of
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.280]  Reaganomics, we're going to talk about Trumponomics. And I think Trumponomics looks better than
[09:59.280 --> 10:07.040]  Reaganomics because it's not only a large tax cut, but it's also large cuts in regulation
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.240]  as well as economic nationalism, which was never a part of the Reagan recovery.
[10:12.240 --> 10:16.640]  So we're looking at something here that is far bigger than anything Ronald Reagan ever did.
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.040]  Now, he's making the same mistake on economics that Ronald Reagan did in terms of not cutting
[10:21.040 --> 10:28.240]  spending because the deficit is still continuing to go up. But it will be mitigated somewhat by
[10:28.240 --> 10:32.880]  economic growth. So I think we're going to be talking about Trumponomics. And instead of talking
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.760]  about the Reagan Democrats, we're going to be talking about the Trump Democrats when we get to
[10:37.760 --> 10:42.160]  the next elections. I think that is a big win. So we're going to talk about trade. We're going to
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.720]  talk about North Korea with President Trump. And in the third hour, I'm sorry, second hour,
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.560]  it's the last hour of the show, I was thinking of a three-hour show. It's typically you can find
[10:50.560 --> 10:57.120]  me a three-hour show every morning, eight to 11 here at InfoWars. But today we have a two-hour
[10:57.120 --> 11:02.720]  show. And in the second hour, we're going to be talking to Christian Saucier. He is the sailor,
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.680]  who many of us were so upset about the fact that he was sent to jail for doing something
[11:08.320 --> 11:12.080]  that really wasn't a serious crime. As his defense attorney pointed out,
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.640]  this should have been taken care of with probation. It should have been taken care of by the military.
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.040]  There could have been some discipline for what he did. What he did was he took some pictures
[11:23.040 --> 11:30.080]  of where he had served. It was the lowest possible level of classification, confidential,
[11:31.280 --> 11:38.320]  and they basically hung him out to dry. This was a very vindictive move by the Obama administration,
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.960]  especially when you look at the FBI involvement and the involvement of the FBI director, saying
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.560]  that even though Hillary Clinton had violated national security blatantly and continually
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.640]  at the highest level, I mean, you got three basic levels of classification. Confidential
[11:54.640 --> 12:00.320]  secret and top secret. It doesn't take much of anything to have something classified as
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.600]  confidential. As a matter of fact, our government wants to classify everything as secret. Remember
[12:05.600 --> 12:11.040]  the memo that came from the Republicans? Remember when they declassified that? There was all this
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.920]  back and forth and the FBI was saying and then other people in the Justice Department and the
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.760]  Democrats, you can't show that to anybody, President Trump. That's classified. He says it
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.480]  doesn't give away anything important. It doesn't give away any methods. It doesn't expose any
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.280]  personnel. There's no reason for this to even be classified. They had it classified top secret.
[12:32.080 --> 12:38.720]  And yet this poor sailor was raked over the coals. He basically had been sent to prison for a year.
[12:38.720 --> 12:45.520]  They had him still under house arrest and on parole. And being a convicted felon
[12:46.240 --> 12:52.240]  was destroying his life. He couldn't get a job. And President Trump took that away. So we're going
[12:52.240 --> 12:58.880]  to talk to him. This was something that Trump tweeted about yesterday, Saturday, that he finally
[12:58.880 --> 13:04.080]  took this away. He had already served a year in time. This is just taking away the stigma
[13:04.080 --> 13:09.440]  that was going to follow him throughout life. And it's a great thing that President Trump did that.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.680]  All right, let's take a look at some of the news here. We have besides gun control in Florida,
[13:13.680 --> 13:18.640]  they want to exercise a little bit more control over the sunshine and the sun. They're now saying
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.800]  that they would like to adopt year round daylight savings time. I think that would be a good idea.
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.160]  I mean, I really don't like the fact that they mess with the clock twice a year. You like the
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.200]  fact that you lost an hour last night? I don't. I don't like that at all. I think it's a very
[13:35.200 --> 13:41.040]  bad idea. I think they should call it sunshine state savings time. They could go on time zone
[13:41.040 --> 13:47.600]  and say the heck with the feds nullify their daylight savings time. I say, I'm all for nullification.
[13:47.600 --> 13:52.720]  I'm not with Jeff Sessions. Jeff Sessions out there saying there's no such thing as nullification
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.760]  and secession. We settled that question a long time ago. Just go to Gettysburg and look at this
[13:57.760 --> 14:03.520]  stuff and said, well, you can also go to a bunker hill in Yorktown because I'm sure that the British
[14:03.520 --> 14:10.960]  government said that you can't leave the king at that time as well. That's always going to be the
[14:10.960 --> 14:17.360]  case. But there is a peaceful method in our Constitution. It's called nullification. And
[14:17.360 --> 14:23.360]  people have already peacefully nullified a part of the unconstitutional war on drugs that Jeff
[14:23.360 --> 14:31.520]  Sessions likes so much. We have over 30 states, over 60% of the states have declared medical marijuana
[14:31.520 --> 14:37.760]  or just outright legalized it. That is nullification, folks. Marijuana is prohibited under the UNs,
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.240]  and it is the UN's drug schedule. The UN created that drug schedule, by the way, conservatives.
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.040]  Did you know that when you fight for the war on drugs, you're fighting for a UN agenda?
[14:47.600 --> 14:51.920]  Think about that. They created the four schedules. They put all the drugs in the four schedules.
[14:51.920 --> 14:58.800]  They did it 10 years before Nixon implemented the UN agenda verbatim for you. How's that?
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.640]  How's that? And we've been suffering under that now for a half a decade,
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.280]  and it hasn't helped any addiction has it. But it has given us a lot of corruption.
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.560]  It has created a prison population that is greater in absolute numbers, let alone the
[15:12.560 --> 15:16.560]  percentage of the population, but greater in absolute numbers than any other country, even
[15:16.560 --> 15:22.240]  communist dictatorships here in America. And it has corrupted our law enforcement,
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.200]  it's corrupted our constitution, our legal system. But it hasn't done anything to our
[15:27.200 --> 15:33.040]  addiction rate, hasn't done anything to that. But anyway, we're going to take a look at
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.920]  some other issues. We've got Mother's Day cards going gender neutral. Can you believe this?
[15:38.800 --> 15:44.640]  And actually, it has something to do, I think, with why Rex Tillerson is in
[15:44.640 --> 15:50.320]  darkest Africa and totally out of the loop on North Korea. So we're going to tell you the
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.160]  connection between gender neutral Mother's Day cards and Rex Tillerson's Africa trip when we
[15:56.160 --> 16:22.160]  come back. Stay with us.
[16:26.160 --> 16:28.160]  This is it.
[16:56.160 --> 16:58.640]  888-253-3139.

[18:24.720 --> 18:30.480]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals. That's what I'm talking about. And when compared
[18:30.480 --> 18:35.680]  to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, like what you get at the
[18:35.680 --> 18:42.720]  grocery store, there is no comparison. Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste,
[18:42.720 --> 18:50.160]  color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years. Now that's what I call the miracle
[18:50.160 --> 18:55.520]  of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[19:36.800 --> 19:42.160]  some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then
[19:42.160 --> 19:48.240]  we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a
[19:48.240 --> 19:52.880]  bigger problems going on. And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and
[19:52.880 --> 20:05.360]  ourselves, we can take our country back. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:05.360 --> 20:26.480]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with David Knight.
[20:30.480 --> 20:33.840]  Welcome back on this Sunday. I'm David Knight and of course you'll find me Monday's through
[20:33.840 --> 20:41.760]  Fridays 8 to 11 on the infowars network. We have a daily show there. But I told you before we went
[20:41.760 --> 20:47.840]  to the break that I would tell you how Mother's Day Gender Neutral Cards that are now being proposed
[20:47.840 --> 20:57.200]  by some store in the UK. I don't know if this is a drug store or a grocery store. It's Waitrose.
[20:57.200 --> 21:01.680]  Waitrose, I think is the way you pronounce that, but it's in the UK. And they're now putting out
[21:01.680 --> 21:08.560]  Gender Neutral Mother's Day Cards. It's going to require a completely new language if we go down
[21:08.560 --> 21:13.520]  this mentally ill path. And of course, they've already got a completely new language for us.
[21:13.520 --> 21:16.560]  I'll tell you about that in just a moment. But I told you before we went to the break that I would
[21:16.560 --> 21:23.200]  tell you how these Gender Neutral Mother's Day Cards relate to T-Rex, Rex Tillerson in Africa.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.520]  Why is he in Africa? Well, I'm going to get to that in just a moment. But first,
[21:27.520 --> 21:34.000]  let's talk about the beginning of Mother's Day Cards, Gender Neutral. They say they're going to
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.320]  broaden out, no pun intended. They're going to broaden out the mothers who the cards can go to.
[21:40.320 --> 21:47.680]  And so they have happy you day cards in the Mother's Day section. The word mother does not appear.
[21:48.240 --> 21:53.360]  Now, you might think that that's silly, but it's really not funny, folks. We have schools that have
[21:53.360 --> 21:58.880]  been working for quite a long time, seriously, working on getting rid of the terms mother and father.
[21:59.840 --> 22:03.440]  They said there were hateful terms. You can't have the terms mother and father.
[22:04.080 --> 22:09.440]  You have to understand what a fundamental level these people want to destroy our society.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.680]  They don't want to just get rid of the Christopher Columbus statues. No, no, no, no.
[22:13.680 --> 22:17.120]  They don't want to just get rid of Western civilization. They don't want to just purge
[22:17.120 --> 22:25.680]  Christianity. They want to impose upon us a kind of gender insanity. If you will, a new kind of
[22:25.680 --> 22:33.600]  birth control. This is a brave new world that they're trying to operate here. We've got sperm counts
[22:33.600 --> 22:39.200]  that are crashing because of toxins in the water and the food and so forth. But it's also this kind
[22:39.200 --> 22:45.600]  of insanity where they are trying to stop all kinds of natural procreation. It's an attack on
[22:45.600 --> 22:50.400]  the family. It's an attack on everything that the basis of our culture. Let me tell you something.
[22:50.400 --> 22:55.920]  The basis of our society is not government. How about that? What is the basis of our society?
[22:55.920 --> 23:01.040]  Is it the individual? I'm a libertarian, but the basis of our society is not an individual.
[23:01.920 --> 23:09.280]  The basis of our society is the family. The family. That is why they have to make
[23:09.280 --> 23:14.560]  Mother's Day cards, no longer Mother Day cards or Father's Day cards. But if they're not just
[23:14.560 --> 23:20.560]  coming out to the Father's Day cards because they are perhaps too toxically masculine.
[23:21.200 --> 23:26.400]  No, they're coming after mothers. Mothers. And they have cards like Two Moms Are Better Than One
[23:26.400 --> 23:31.920]  or Dad. Thanks for being the most amazing mum. These are some of the cards that these people
[23:31.920 --> 23:39.040]  are putting at the store in the UK. But let's take a look at some of the other things that
[23:39.040 --> 23:44.640]  these trans activists are doing. I mean, we've seen this many times. Remember Justin Trudeau
[23:44.640 --> 23:51.200]  when he told that young questioner, don't say mankind. And then after everybody called him
[23:51.200 --> 23:56.320]  on the insanity, he said, I was just joking. Well, what is Justin Trudeau joking when he was
[23:56.320 --> 24:02.800]  very happy? The fact that back in February that the Canadian National Anthem had had its lyrics
[24:02.800 --> 24:09.200]  changed so that they would be gender neutral instead of in all my son's command and all of us
[24:09.200 --> 24:15.360]  command. And he tweeted out of the time this bill to make O Canada gender neutral past third
[24:15.360 --> 24:21.600]  reading in the Senate tonight. Another positive step towards gender equality in all of us command.
[24:21.600 --> 24:25.280]  He does hashtag. And then you can take a look at how this insanity plays out
[24:25.920 --> 24:32.240]  in college campuses because that's where most of the stuff is being taught. You send your kids away
[24:32.240 --> 24:37.840]  for what you think is going to be an essential part of their career. It's going to give them
[24:38.800 --> 24:46.560]  an advance in terms of earning a wage. Well, to some degree and some to some degree with some
[24:46.560 --> 24:52.320]  degrees and other degrees, you don't get any advantage. But what they do is they load them up
[24:52.320 --> 24:59.040]  with debt. And they cover them with this kind of insanity. Look at what campus reform has
[24:59.040 --> 25:05.520]  uncovered. At Kennesaw State University, the LGBT Resource Center has produced a new pamphlet
[25:06.080 --> 25:13.920]  that has seven different gender neutral pronouns, things like knee, V, A, Z. I don't even know how
[25:13.920 --> 25:20.320]  to pronounce the difference of pronouncing Z, E and X, E. I don't even know. And I'll give you
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.880]  an example of what some of their sample sentences sound like. It sounds like you got a speech
[25:24.880 --> 25:33.600]  impediment. Here's one example. Refer to a student who identifies as knee. One could say knee, laugh.
[25:33.600 --> 25:42.320]  That is nears. What is this? Clockwork orange? Yeah, it is. Vitty well, little brother. Yeah,
[25:42.320 --> 25:46.640]  they got a whole new language that they're creating. And you better understand what they're doing.
[25:47.920 --> 25:53.040]  Yeah, they and their droogs. This is what they're trying to impose upon us. It is
[25:53.040 --> 25:57.600]  a kind of insanity that they're putting on us. I remember we had the Corporal Klinger
[25:58.880 --> 26:04.000]  in MASH all those years, trying to get a Section 8 so he could get out, dressing as a woman so
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.040]  they would say he was crazy. That's what Section 8 is. They knew that he didn't really mean it,
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.160]  but these people really mean it. And now we've got a Pentagon that is bringing in transgender troops
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.400]  because then they're going to burden that institution with that insanity,
[26:20.400 --> 26:25.040]  as well as burden the taxpayer with their operations that they want to do. There he is,
[26:25.040 --> 26:33.440]  Corporal Klinger. See, sometimes the stuff starts out as silly, and sometimes they put it out there
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.320]  as funny, but you better understand they're deadly serious about this stuff. We can laugh at it,
[26:38.320 --> 26:43.600]  but they're deadly serious about it. Now let's go on to the reactions because this is, I want to get
[26:43.600 --> 26:50.000]  down through the North Korea stuff to get to the link between the transgender insanity that we
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.280]  that we're seeing here with Mother's Day and the transgender insanity that we're seeing with the
[26:55.280 --> 27:02.080]  State Department in Africa. And Rex Tillerson is right at the center of that. So let's start here
[27:02.080 --> 27:10.160]  with reactions to the peace talks with North Korea. As I pointed out on Friday at the beginning,
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.720]  there was a lot of praise. Erin Burnett said, wow, after she talked to a panel of six or eight people,
[27:14.720 --> 27:20.560]  she said, if this really happens, and if President Trump pulls this, he'll go down as a great president.
[27:20.560 --> 27:25.200]  No question about that. You can't question that. And she was being honest. And that was what happened
[27:25.200 --> 27:30.960]  at the beginning, and then everything changed. And even people on MSNBC, and of course,
[27:30.960 --> 27:36.800]  Chris Matthews, when he was looking at President Trump's moves to protect the steel and aluminum
[27:36.800 --> 27:40.160]  industries, but especially the steel industries, Chris Matthews, who's from Pennsylvania said,
[27:40.160 --> 27:46.320]  this is going to be a big win for President Trump. He said, this is a cultural touch point,
[27:46.320 --> 27:51.520]  because people understand that their society is being destroyed, just as they understood that
[27:51.520 --> 27:56.960]  Obama and Hillary Clinton wanted to destroy the economies and the manufacturing base of the coal
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.440]  industry in West Virginia and other places like that. The steel industry and the manufacturing
[28:01.440 --> 28:07.040]  industry, and it is much broader than just steel. We have seen the establishment Republicans and
[28:07.040 --> 28:13.200]  Democrats under the mantle of open trade eviscerate our economy. You want to talk about a trade war?
[28:14.320 --> 28:21.040]  The Chinese and the globalist shills, I guess we could call them quizlings here in America,
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.320]  have been bombing our economy, our factory, our manufacturing base. They've been bombing it for
[28:26.320 --> 28:33.520]  50 years. It's a 50 year war against us. And it's about time we wake up and understand that we're
[28:33.520 --> 28:38.480]  not going to let this continue happening. It has been a stealth war, but everybody can see it now.
[28:38.480 --> 28:43.120]  I can't even believe that the Koch brothers are out there trying to lecture us on quote-unquote
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.280]  free trade. As I said over and over again on the show, there is no such thing as a free lunch,
[28:47.280 --> 28:50.960]  and folks, there's no such thing as free trade. We're going to talk about that later in the show
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.880]  as well. But I want to tell you the connection to Mother's Day and rec social and I will get to it
[28:56.880 --> 29:03.600]  in the next section. They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to
[29:03.600 --> 29:08.720]  teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.640]  and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use
[29:14.640 --> 29:21.040]  their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest, make them
[29:21.040 --> 29:27.920]  scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down
[29:27.920 --> 29:34.000]  interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for
[29:34.000 --> 29:40.400]  the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse
[29:40.400 --> 29:47.680]  for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom
[29:47.680 --> 29:55.120]  is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association
[29:55.120 --> 30:01.920]  of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place. Hey, how are you doing? Good, brother. Just recently
[30:01.920 --> 30:06.560]  started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a
[30:06.560 --> 30:10.000]  lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here. Well, thank you, brother. It's
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.080]  because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I'm going to have the highest quality.
[30:14.080 --> 30:21.040]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using
[30:21.040 --> 30:26.640]  synthetic chemicals. We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.760]  energy. We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a statement, a ton of money there.
[30:31.760 --> 30:38.720]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum
[30:38.720 --> 30:44.080]  potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff. Just cover that up for a while,
[30:44.080 --> 30:48.720]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[30:48.720 --> 30:54.080]  goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I love it. Visit infowarsalife.com today

[33:30.400 --> 33:35.280]  Welcome back. As we left, I said we're going to take a look at the way people reacted to President
[33:35.280 --> 33:42.640]  Trump's North Korean initiative that we have here. And of course, understand it was his being the bad
[33:42.640 --> 33:48.640]  cop, South Korea being the good cop, they're bringing Kim Jong-un to the table. But of course,
[33:49.680 --> 33:55.040]  Rachel Maddow cannot allow that that is a good thing. She's got to show herself to be nothing but
[33:55.040 --> 34:01.680]  a partisan hack because who other than a partisan hack would try to pretend that denuclearizing North
[34:01.680 --> 34:09.760]  Korea is not a good thing. And so I want to play you a clip of Rachel Maddow and how she responded
[34:09.760 --> 34:14.560]  to this. I mean, even the people on CNN for the at least for a while, at least the people on CNN
[34:14.560 --> 34:21.040]  said, hey, this would be really good if we could stop this guy who is lobbing missiles over Japan
[34:21.840 --> 34:26.320]  and setting off one nuclear test after the other. This guy is really dangerous. He's looking for
[34:26.320 --> 34:32.000]  attention. Wouldn't it be a good thing if we could stop that by just giving him a selfie
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.400]  with President Trump? Is that all it takes to give this guy the attention that he wants and then
[34:36.400 --> 34:41.760]  take away his nuclear toys? I think that'd be a great thing. But Rachel Maddow is not really so
[34:41.760 --> 34:48.000]  sure. Here's what she has to say. You might imagine another president in this circumstance.
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.280]  Kim Jong-un makes a request. You might think like another president in this circumstance,
[34:53.280 --> 34:59.680]  you could imagine a president asking himself or herself. Why has no other American president
[34:59.680 --> 35:05.440]  ever agreed to do this? Good question. I've asked that. Why has no sitting American president ever
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.080]  met with a leader from North Korea? Yeah, good question. Why has that never happened in all the
[35:10.080 --> 35:16.000]  decades North Korea has existed as a nation? Why hasn't any other president ever done?
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.240]  Should I take that to mean that this might be a particularly risky or even an unwise move?
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.240]  See, I think that's how most presidents would approach the idea of a personal presidential
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.440]  meeting with the North Korean dictator. I think a lot of people probably suspect tonight that
[35:31.440 --> 35:36.640]  those are not the kinds of questions that this president asked himself before agreeing to this
[35:36.640 --> 35:44.080]  meeting. But this is the president we have and he said yes to North Korea. The New York Times
[35:44.080 --> 35:50.960]  tonight headlining this breaking news as quote, a breathtaking gamble. Oh wow. And this is the
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.760]  president that we have saying yes to North Korea. She tries to portray it as us saying yes to North
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.400]  Korea. You know who said yes to North Korea, Rachel? All your Obama and Clinton and state
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.120]  departments that enabled these people. How about the fact that you had the guy that you
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.920]  loved so much, President Obama. You fond over him, didn't you? This is newsbusters.org points out
[36:09.920 --> 36:18.080]  that Rachel Maddow fond over President Obama when he said yes to the North Koreans. That was a good
[36:18.080 --> 36:26.400]  thing because it was President Obama, wasn't it, Rachel? That's what a hopeless, smarmy, snarky hack
[36:26.400 --> 36:32.320]  she is. Just disgusting to watch her there. Lying through her teeth. Lying through her teeth. She
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.640]  had said when Obama pushed for the Iran nuclear deal, she said it's the major foreign policy
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.880]  achievement, not only of this presidency, but of the American generation. That's right. It was a
[36:44.880 --> 36:53.280]  foreign policy achievement, but not for America's benefit, for the Iranian benefit. It's amazing.
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.760]  You might think, she said, why has no other American president ever agreed to do this?
[36:57.760 --> 37:02.080]  That's the right question, but she gives the wrong answer. She said, should I take it that
[37:02.080 --> 37:06.560]  to mean that this might be particularly risky or even an unwise move? Let me tell you what is
[37:06.560 --> 37:14.000]  unwise. Just sit there and let these people continue because obviously he is willing to do anything.
[37:15.440 --> 37:21.120]  What is going to happen, Rachel, if in some of these moves where he lobs missiles over Japan,
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.960]  if it actually hits Japan, people are going to have to respond to that then.
[37:27.760 --> 37:33.840]  You think it'd be a better thing to have a war, I guess. So you have an MSNBC, another host,
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.640]  says, well, it's definitely risky. So one of the things this would do if we have a picture of Kim
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.800]  Jong-un and President Trump standing next to one another, this actually achieves one of Kim
[37:42.800 --> 37:50.080]  Jong-un's longstanding and his father's goal, which is to elevate North Korea. So that's the risk.
[37:50.880 --> 37:58.800]  That's the risk. We cannot lose our prestige by having our president take a selfie with
[37:58.800 --> 38:04.160]  the North Korean president. That is what MSNBC, that's their desperate attempt to try to say
[38:04.160 --> 38:09.040]  that this is a bad idea to talk to them. No, it'd be much better, wouldn't it, MSNBC,
[38:09.040 --> 38:14.880]  to just allow this little dictator to continue his nuclear program, his missile program,
[38:14.880 --> 38:22.000]  until he shoots a missile at Guam or lands one on Japan and then we have the whole area
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.120]  erupt into war. Oh, that would be much better. Let's take the advice of the hacks at MSNBC.
[38:27.120 --> 38:34.640]  To me, that's a small price to pay. And we've had Michael Malish, who spent a lot of time in North
[38:34.640 --> 38:40.480]  Korea, say, this guy just wants attention. Let's give him a little bit of attention if we can
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.840]  denuclearize a place. There is no risk involved in this. Understand that the deal that has been
[38:45.840 --> 38:50.160]  announced is that nothing is going to change in the sanctions until they have the meeting.
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.640]  And unless he denuclearizes, nothing is going to change. He is still going to be under siege
[38:57.280 --> 39:05.040]  with the largest military in the world pointed at his country. He has nothing to gain,
[39:05.040 --> 39:07.520]  but to denuclearize at this point. But then we got another hack,
[39:08.320 --> 39:14.240]  another Democrat hack. This is Tommy Vitor. He is someone who worked with Obama. He was Obama's
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.880]  former National Security Council spokesman. And he tweets out, why would the Trump administration
[39:18.880 --> 39:23.760]  announce this like it's some kind of accomplishment? It's a conversation with a homicidal dictator,
[39:23.760 --> 39:32.400]  not an invitation to the Met Gala. Really, really. So the reason he would do this, Obama,
[39:33.280 --> 39:39.280]  National Security spokesman. Obama left us with a lot of national security didn't he?
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.440]  We don't have secure borders. We don't have a secure situation with North Korea or with Iran,
[39:45.440 --> 39:53.200]  anybody else. But really, the answer is to disarm them, not to arm them like you and the
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.440]  Clintons did with Iran and China and others. I mean, that's what the Democrats have done.
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.800]  Dan McLaughlin of National Review came back and pointed out that his boss had spent his time going
[40:04.800 --> 40:10.720]  to Havana, Cuba, and powering around with the president there, who had run communist death
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.520]  squads. That's Raul Castro, who's still there. So in fact, the two-year anniversary of their super
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.920]  awkward handshake is coming up later this month. How about that? This is the hypocrisy of the left.
[40:21.920 --> 40:25.920]  But I want to take a moment here with Rex Tillerson because the top of drugs yesterday,
[40:26.640 --> 40:34.880]  it said Tillerson is sick. He's not going to meet with anybody in Kenya. And then later on,
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.640]  he's coming out and saying, well, I'm feeling a little bit better. I think what he was saying
[40:40.640 --> 40:47.200]  sick of is being left out of the loop. I reported this on Friday. They said this is AP saying
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.440]  several Pentagon officials had said shortly before the announcement that they had no knowledge
[40:51.440 --> 40:55.840]  of what the South Koreans planned to announce. The South Koreans came in and talked to President
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.520]  Trump privately. Then they came out and announced that President Trump and Kim Jong-un would be
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.880]  meeting to talk about denuclearizing North Korea and that nothing was going to change
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.400]  unless they did that and until they did that after the meeting. But at the same time, they reported
[41:12.400 --> 41:16.880]  that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had just hours before that
[41:16.880 --> 41:23.920]  announcement said that the U.S. was, quote, a long ways, unquote, from direct talks. That was
[41:23.920 --> 41:30.080]  Tillerson in the dark, in the dark continent. The Secretary is not feeling well, he said the next
[41:30.080 --> 41:35.120]  day, after a long couple of days working on major issues back home, such as North Korea.
[41:35.120 --> 41:40.000]  And he has canceled his events for the day. So think about that. They managed to put that in
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.960]  the statement saying he's kind of sick because of that North Korea stuff that he was left out of
[41:44.960 --> 41:53.280]  the loop in. To me, I'm hoping this is what the coded message is. I am sick of this job. I hope
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.560]  he is sick of this job. I hope he joins Gary Cohen. I think there's a door at the White House
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.720]  with a label on it. It's a door that leads out of the White House as an exit. And hopefully,
[42:02.720 --> 42:05.760]  there is a door there that somebody in the White House has put a sign on that says,
[42:06.320 --> 42:12.000]  globalist enter here. Because I would like to see him join his fellow globalist, Gary Cohen,
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.120]  and just get out. This is a guy who has fought President Trump. He's been wrong on every issue.
[42:19.920 --> 42:26.400]  And even when you look at what we knew about this guy before he came in, when I heard that he was
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.760]  being rumored to be the Secretary of State, I said, why? Why in the world would we have this guy?
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.680]  This is a guy who has pushed climate change. And he continued to do that through the first
[42:37.680 --> 42:41.520]  six months of President Trump. He was a key man pushing back against President Trump. He went
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.840]  in this Paris climate treaty. But I'm going to tell you, finally get to it in the next segment.
[42:45.840 --> 42:52.480]  Finally tell you why he was there and how that ties to a gender neutral Mother's Day. Yes,
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.320]  it all runs through Rex Tillerson, even though he's in Africa. We'll tell you about the insanity

[47:21.200 --> 47:28.880]  Welcome back. We're going to take a look at Rex Tillerson and what he is trying to do
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.800]  in Kenya to the Kenyan boys. What the State Department is doing. $600,000 investment
[47:37.360 --> 47:41.440]  to mess with their gender. It's not just here in America and it's the State Department and
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.520]  it's Rex Tillerson and he has a history of doing this. I'm going to get back to that. I'll wrap up
[47:45.520 --> 47:51.440]  the connection between Rex Tillerson and gender neutral Mother's Day cards in just one moment.
[47:51.440 --> 47:55.520]  But before I do real quickly, I want to let you know about the sales that we have at Infowars
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.280]  Store.com. It's part of our Operation Paul Revere 2018. We have extended this stuff because you know
[48:01.280 --> 48:10.400]  it's very important for you to purchase from us directly. We don't live by ads that are sold
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.760]  for big pharma on our site like CNN does but they're trying to shut us down. They think they can
[48:15.760 --> 48:22.400]  shut us down by getting YouTube to take our videos off, to take our channel off, to demonetize
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.320]  our channel. That's not how we make our money. We make our money through the products. We fund
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.720]  this operation through the products that we sell at our site and of course we have some of the
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.800]  finest products that you're going to find that will help your health as well as the health of
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.400]  your family. Natural products that we don't have to, when I tell you about these products, I don't
[48:40.400 --> 48:49.280]  have to spend 30 seconds rapidly running through a list of dangerous side effects like heart disease,
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.520]  stroke and all these other things that you typically hear on the big pharma commercials on CNN
[48:53.520 --> 48:56.720]  and other cable news outlets. But let me give you an idea of some of the sales here because we've
[48:56.720 --> 49:04.640]  got sales throughout the site 30 to 80% off plus free shipping. We have super male and female vitality,
[49:04.640 --> 49:08.240]  50% off. Let me tell you some of the other popular products we have at 50% off. We've got
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.800]  pollen block, immune wall to help your immune system naturally, real red pill, biome defense,
[49:14.800 --> 49:21.760]  true whey protein, prebiotic fiber, that is fiber plus probiotics. We also have an infowars life
[49:21.760 --> 49:29.600]  select products, that's our storeable food products, 40% off. Our apparel is at 80% off
[49:29.600 --> 49:36.640]  and we have the Aegis armor backpack insert, 20% off. As I said once before and I got singled out
[49:37.440 --> 49:44.240]  by one of these news, leftist news outlets for saying it, remember the time the guy took the,
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.080]  first he went to the FBI office in Alaska and said, I've got voices in my head telling me to
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.920]  shoot people. I said, oh that's nice, have a nice day, we're not going to do anything about it.
[49:51.920 --> 49:55.200]  And they got on a plane and he flew to Florida and he started shooting people up with his pistol
[49:55.200 --> 50:01.360]  that he managed to get through security, started shooting people up in the airport. And I said,
[50:01.360 --> 50:07.120]  this is the state of our security, our TSA. As much as they harass you, they don't do anything to
[50:07.120 --> 50:15.520]  protect you. I said, at the very least, put an armor backpack insert into your backpack and take
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.120]  it with you. So you've at least got a little bit of something to hide behind if all you can do is
[50:19.120 --> 50:22.880]  just shelter in place, at least you can have something to stop a bullet. I got called out for
[50:22.880 --> 50:30.240]  that. They said, look at this, this guy is trying to profit off of a disaster here. I said, I'm not
[50:30.240 --> 50:34.560]  trying to profit, I'm trying to help people to defend themselves. That's what we talk about when
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.720]  we say a win-win situation. If we've got a solution that's going to help you to defend yourself and
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.280]  the government refuses to do so, they didn't get that guy's gun out of his hand. They didn't do
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.200]  anything when he complained about voices in his head. They're not going to do anything to protect
[50:47.200 --> 50:52.640]  you. Maybe you realize that by now. And if you have, take things into your own hands and you can
[50:53.440 --> 50:59.760]  select food to store for a disaster. You can get things to help you to fight the toxins that are
[50:59.760 --> 51:05.760]  in your food, the environment, and you can also filter your water. Do a lot of things like that.
[51:05.760 --> 51:11.520]  Why is that a bad thing? I don't know why the left wants to call us out on that. But let's finish
[51:11.520 --> 51:17.360]  up with Rex Tillerson. As I just pointed out, he had just hours before this happened, said we're
[51:17.360 --> 51:22.320]  very, very long away from any kind of talks with North Korea. And then it was announced that it
[51:22.320 --> 51:27.600]  was happening. And this is while he's in Africa, in the dark, in the dark continent. And he was
[51:27.600 --> 51:34.400]  going to be in Nairobi on Friday. And he was going to have a ceremony that was going to mark 20 years
[51:34.400 --> 51:43.040]  after al-Qaeda had bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people. See, al-Qaeda
[51:43.680 --> 51:51.200]  and Islamic jihad terrorism is all over Africa. You've got Kenya on the west, you've got
[51:52.880 --> 51:59.520]  Nigeria on the eastern side of Africa, but it's everywhere. But Rex Tillerson is not so concerned
[51:59.520 --> 52:04.960]  about that. As a matter of fact, we've got another neocon, HR McMaster, who can't even bring himself
[52:04.960 --> 52:11.920]  to say the term radical Islam. And so to save face, and I really do hope he's not going to
[52:14.160 --> 52:18.880]  stick with this, I hope Rex Tillerson sees this as a personal front and leaves like Gary Cohen
[52:18.880 --> 52:25.840]  did when he lost the debate on protecting our economy. Gary Cohen wanted to continue to sell
[52:25.840 --> 52:29.440]  us out to China and other countries. And when President Trump said, no, we're not going to do
[52:29.440 --> 52:34.160]  that, he said, all right, fine, my advice, I'll leave. Well, we don't want or need Rex Tillerson's
[52:34.160 --> 52:38.880]  advice. And we don't want or need his advice on the climate, and we don't want or need his advice
[52:38.880 --> 52:46.640]  on what the causes of terrorism are. The State Department under Rex Tillerson has spent $600,000
[52:47.600 --> 52:52.640]  to explore gender identities of boys and men in Kenya. And when I first saw this announcement
[52:52.640 --> 52:56.880]  where he was out of the loop, and of course, now he's saying, oh, yes, I was very busy with that.
[52:56.880 --> 53:02.240]  And I've been in the, he said on Friday, he said, this was not a surprise in any way.
[53:03.040 --> 53:07.680]  After having said, we're a long ways away from talk a couple of hours before,
[53:07.680 --> 53:10.880]  then President Trump does it. And he says, well, this wasn't a surprise in any way. Then the next
[53:10.880 --> 53:16.720]  day he goes, I'm sick, I'm sick, I can't go to any meetings. Hopefully he's sick of being out of the
[53:16.720 --> 53:24.320]  loop. But this is what I'm sick of. I'm sick of our State Department continuing the Obama
[53:24.320 --> 53:30.160]  Nation policies of Barack Obama and trying to do gender confusion, not just in this country,
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.680]  but in other countries as well. Let me tell you how this is coming out. I reported this
[53:36.400 --> 53:40.960]  when this was announced back at the end of January. I haven't really seen anybody talk about this.
[53:40.960 --> 53:48.480]  The State Department is spending $600,000 to explore gender identities. They suggest that
[53:48.480 --> 53:56.640]  the ideals of masculinity in Kenya are the cause of terrorism. No, it's not Islam. It's that toxic
[53:56.640 --> 54:01.040]  masculinity that needs to be taken down in Kenya. And so Rex Tillerson State Department
[54:01.040 --> 54:06.720]  is going to spend $600,000 because the enemy is masculinity, not Islam.
[54:06.720 --> 54:10.960]  They said, gender is increasingly recognized as an essential aspect to understanding and
[54:10.960 --> 54:16.000]  to countering violent extremism throughout the world, said the State Department, spending $600,000
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.760]  of your money. They said, men and boys are disproportionately recruited by and join terrorist
[54:21.760 --> 54:29.120]  groups and carry out terrorist operations. So therefore, terrorism is male. It's not Islamic.
[54:29.120 --> 54:34.800]  It's a male thing, except that they have female terrorists as well and have female suicide
[54:34.800 --> 54:39.760]  bombers as well. But let's not pay any attention to that, says the State Department and Rex Tillerson.
[54:39.760 --> 54:45.920]  In Kenya, they said, there currently exist no CVE, and that's their countering violent extremism.
[54:45.920 --> 54:51.840]  There's no CVE programming dedicated to the role of gender, of boys and men, and vulnerability
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.520]  to violent extremism. So Tillerson State Department lays the blame on terrorism,
[54:57.520 --> 55:05.040]  lays the blame on terrorism, not of terrorism on male gender issues, not on things like Boko Haram
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.840]  or Islam. And of course, Boko Haram is in Nigeria. He was just in Nigeria as well. Maybe he's selling
[55:11.840 --> 55:19.280]  them the same gender confusion. Let me tell you, Rex Tillerson has been into gender confusion from
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.360]  the very beginning. He was head of the Boy Scouts. What did he do to the Boy Scouts?
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.640]  The same thing that he's, I guess he thought that the Boy Scouts were too toxic masculine,
[55:29.200 --> 55:34.320]  because he allowed them, he pushed the idea that they would have homosexual Scouts as he was
[55:34.320 --> 55:39.840]  head of the Boy Scouts. And then he pushed for homosexual scout leaders at the Boy Scouts.
[55:41.040 --> 55:47.600]  And then, keeping with his example, as he left, the Boy Scouts then began pushing for transgender
[55:47.600 --> 55:55.920]  Scouts. This is the Rex Tillerson who now at the State Department is trying to bring gender confusion
[55:55.920 --> 56:03.040]  to the poor people of Kenya, as if that was their problem. You see, in Nigeria,
[56:04.240 --> 56:07.600]  where they have the same problems as they do in Kenya, I just talked about how they had mass
[56:07.600 --> 56:15.360]  bombings in Kenya and so forth. It is al-Qaeda, it is radical Islam, it is jihadism. Boko Haram
[56:15.360 --> 56:21.760]  literally means the people committed to the Prophet's teachings for propagation and jihad.
[56:22.400 --> 56:30.000]  Now, Boko Haram is really just the nickname. What it means is Western education is Haram,
[56:30.000 --> 56:37.600]  is forbidden. And that's why they go in and capture all of these, they just captured a whole
[56:37.600 --> 56:44.240]  another group of young girls who were studying and getting educated at Western schools. Can't
[56:44.240 --> 56:52.640]  have that, can't have that. So especially women, can't have women. But that's toxic masculinity
[56:52.640 --> 56:58.720]  as the State Department and Rex Tillerson see it. It's not a problem with Islam, it's a problem
[56:58.720 --> 57:03.920]  with toxic masculinity. So what they need is some gender confusion. And who are the people
[57:04.560 --> 57:12.240]  that join Boko Haram in Nigeria? Well, they typically come from university students,
[57:12.240 --> 57:18.880]  you know, kind of like Antifa over here. Those are the people that join the group.
[57:19.840 --> 57:26.000]  Less than four years after the high-profile kidnapping of 200 girls, Boko Haram has now
[57:26.000 --> 57:34.800]  abducted another 110 girls from the region, out of a school in the region. That's what they're
[57:34.800 --> 57:42.080]  doing. But of course, as they misidentify the problem, that allows the military industrial
[57:42.080 --> 57:45.840]  complex to sell them weapons. Last August, the US sold Nigeria half a billion dollars
[57:45.840 --> 57:51.520]  worth of military gear. So we spend... You know, someone very profoundly once said
[57:51.520 --> 57:55.600]  many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[57:55.600 --> 57:58.880]  You're a white male! You're a white man!

[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:26.320]  you are the resistance. From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  worldwide, it's Alex Jones. Welcome back. In the next hour we're going to be talking about gun
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.000]  control, how that is playing out in Florida with the rhino governor there. We're also going to be
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  talking about the Trumponomics and the big win that President Trump has had with that. This is
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.840]  as big as the tax cut folks and make no mistake about it. The Chinese have been in a trade war
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:04.800]  with us for decades and even as we passed massive tax and regulation cuts, as President Trump,
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:10.240]  the Republicans passed that, the response from the European Union was, this is something that
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:17.680]  is unfair advantage for the American people and they threatened to take us to the World
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.040]  Trade Organization. They said, nothing is off the table. We are going to appeal to the World
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.080]  Trade Organization because of America's domestic tax and regulation cuts. See, they're not going
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.040]  to cut their taxes. They're not going to cut their regulations. They're strangling their economy and
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.960]  they're strangling the sovereignty of the individual countries that they have taken over.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.440]  And they were going to fight us on that. And so this is not the beginning of the trade war.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.440]  If you want to say the trade war started, well, the trade war started with the tax cuts at Wall
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.920]  Street love so much. But Wall Street doesn't love economic nationalism. Main Street does,
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.200]  however, especially Main Street and the states that Trump needs to win. They absolutely do love
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.840]  it. So we're going to talk a little bit about that and people's reactions to it and what that
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.960]  really means. I just want to finish up with what I ran out of time to say as we went to break.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.320]  You know, when we look at what the big picture is here with Rex Tillerson,
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:20.160]  they spent with the State Department a half million dollars to go into Kenya and to misidentify the
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.200]  problem to tell the people there that all the terrorism is because of toxic masculinity and
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.520]  you need to feminize these boys like we're trying to feminize the Boy Scouts under Rex Tillerson.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.240]  To say that we're going to have homosexual scouts, we're going to have homosexual leaders,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.760]  and then we're going to have transgender scouts. That's been his agenda. That's been the agenda
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:44.400]  of the establishment. Rex Tillerson is a globalist. And so they misidentify the problem,
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.360]  spend a half million dollars to do that. And if they can move people away from
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:55.520]  seeing that the real problem is Islam, then they'll be able to sell them a half a billion
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.360]  dollars worth of arms from the military industrial complex. See how they can turn LGBTQ
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.920]  into MIC, the military industrial complex? It's just that simple. It's just that simple.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:15.600]  It is a way to confuse and to destroy and to divide people. But let's talk about somebody else
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:22.720]  in the White House staff here, White House Chief of Staff Kelly, versus I think one of
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.760]  the best appointments that President Trump has made, Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Now, one of the
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:35.680]  ideas that Scott Pruitt had was to have a debate. He wanted to, he's at the EPA, and he said, let's
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:42.560]  have a public debates that would challenge climate change scientists, science rather.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.960]  And Michael Kelly now has shut that down. He said, no, no, no, no. That's a bad idea. That's a bad
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:52.960]  idea. No, it's a great idea because they can't win that debate. We started the program in the last
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:04:03.120]  hour with 10 masked individuals, probably identifying with Antifa, attacking Tony Robinson
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.520]  in the UK, 10 against one. They had masks on. They hid him from behind. They circled in so
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.960]  they could hit him from every different angle, but he fought him off anyway. And that really is a
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.760]  metaphor for what would happen if we had a climate change debate. Let me tell you something. They've
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:28.160]  got all the quote unquote talking heads and pundits and people with scientific authority to
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.560]  argue with people. Now, there's a clip of what happened with Tony Robinson, but they've got all
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.360]  these people. They load up the debate on CNN and elsewhere, but they can't let go of
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:45.840]  that land of punch because they haven't really got a model or any experimental data to back it up.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.080]  We've had Lord Moncton point that out. That would be a great thing to happen. But of course,
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.360]  Kelly has shut that down. Stay with us when we come back. We're going to talk about gun control.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:53.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.080]  In Full Wars Life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:12.160]  source prebiotic fiber. And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits

[01:05:51.840 --> 01:06:04.320]  it's sold out. And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber. Get yours today in FullWarsLife.com.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.440]  Welcome back. We're going to talk about gun control and what's happening in Florida
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.560]  in the wake of the school shooting down there in Parkland, Florida, the Stoneman Douglas School,
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:38.080]  and talk about what the Republican governor did here and how the NRA has responded. And we're
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.280]  also going to talk about Trumponomics. And at the bottom of the hour, we have joining us
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.240]  Christian Saussier, the sailor who was just pardoned by President Trump yesterday. I was
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.440]  so happy to see that. What a travesty that was. What a travesty it was. And President Trump had
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:58.480]  in the past tweeted out that it was a travesty. It was hypocrisy to let Hillary Clinton get away
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:05.440]  with multiple felonies of the most classified documents. I mean, the stuff that she had,
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:12.400]  just as this fellow who took pictures, those pictures did not go through a formal classification
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.040]  process. They said, if you take pictures anywhere within a submarine, it's going to be classified.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.240]  Now, at the lowest level of classification, at confidential, but nevertheless, it would be
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.680]  born classified, is what we would say. Now, do you think that Hillary Clinton's conversations
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:36.080]  with foreign leaders are born classified? If a picture of a bunk in a submarine is born classified,
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.680]  do you think that her conversations with foreign leaders are born classified? Of course they are.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.840]  As a matter of fact, they're above top secret, above top secret. But of course, the FBI director
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.800]  said he was going to let her go. Said she'd committed all these felonies. I can still remember
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.720]  listening to that. I was sitting there with my wife and he's talking about these,
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.320]  he's not lying to people. He said, yeah, yeah, she violated national security. I said, I can't believe
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:08.480]  this. Hillary for prison. He's going to do it. And then he did something even more unbelievable.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:14.080]  He said, but we're not going to do anything about it. And then he doubled down on the
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.680]  unbelievable hypocrisy and said, but don't you try this at home. And then shortly after that,
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.960]  they went after Christian Saussier. So we're going to talk to him today. He's going to be joining
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.560]  us and telling us what this means for his life. I'm glad to see the President Trump noticed this
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.600]  and has done the right thing for him. But before we get into Gunter and Crowl, I just want to talk
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:40.000]  a little bit about Elizabeth Warren. Fokahanis, or as James Woods called her, Liawatha.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.800]  I talked about this on Friday and now everybody is talking about the fact. On Friday,
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:56.880]  I had the news that the Massachusetts Berkshire Eagle, the newspaper, wrote an editorial and said,
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.320]  hey, Elizabeth Warren, you can get a DNA test for only $99. It's not a lot of money. And you
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:09.280]  can put this to rest one way or the other. Are you or are you not of Indian descent? Because
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.760]  you use that to get a leg up at the university there to get a job that you weren't going to get
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:22.080]  if you were white. You claimed Indian heritage so you could not only do cultural appropriation,
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:30.720]  but take a job that people of your ilk had reserved for people of different races. They
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.680]  got different racial slots there and different kinds of discrimination, depending on who you are.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:43.600]  And so you identified as an Indian for those purposes and tried to sell that. And so do a DNA
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.520]  test and prove to us that you really are an Indian. It's only $99. If you can't afford it,
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.480]  we'll pay for it. How about that? All you have to do is spit in the cup. It's not even an intrusive
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.760]  process. Well, I talked about that Friday morning. And again, if you want to follow my program,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.960]  it's Monday through Friday, 8 to 11. You can follow Real News with David Knight. Well,
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.240]  she came back over the weekend and said she's not going to do it, essentially. She doubled down and
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:15.040]  said, when asked, again, at a press conference, whether she would take the DNA test, she said
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:21.120]  she was going to hold on to the folklore of her parents' love story. She said, my mother and daddy
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.040]  were born and raised in Oklahoma. And she gives this long story. I'll play this story for you
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.560]  that she had. But you know what? As I heard her story, ask yourself, if maybe she didn't hear
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:39.760]  this from her mother and father. Maybe, you know, when she was younger, there was a top 40 novelty
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.880]  hit called Running Bear. And maybe that just somehow kind of worked its way into her psyche.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.320]  Maybe that's going to be her excuse next. But here's what Elizabeth Warren said
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:57.120]  at the Pocahontas press conference. I have to ask you because I cover the White House and I hear
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.360]  the president going after you from time to time, referring to you as Pocahontas. And recently,
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.080]  you were speaking about your Native American heritage. Does that get under your skin when you
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.720]  do that? Under your skin. It's like getting under your red skin.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:17.280]  In 2020. I am not running for president in 2020. But let me tell you my story. You know, my mother
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:23.920]  and dad were born and raised in Oklahoma. My father fell in love with my mother when they were both
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.280]  still teenagers. And he was just head over heels over her. I'm telling you, this is the Running
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:35.200]  Bear song. He was literally opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.840]  So does that bother you when the president called you Pocahontas? Do you think that he is being
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.960]  disrespectful to Native Americans when he does that? Doesn't that bother you because your family's
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:54.480]  heritage? This is what I was trying to tell you. It's about my family's story. Because my family's
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:01.440]  story is deeply a part of me and a part of my brothers. It's what we learned from our parents.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.800]  It's what we learned from our grandparents. It's what we learned from our aunts and our uncles.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:13.040]  I went to speak to Native American tribal leaders, and I made a promise to them that every time
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:20.240]  President Trump wants to try to throw out some kind of racial slur, he wants to try to attack me,
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.880]  I'm going to use it as a chance to lift up their stories. And I'm going to do that right now
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:31.440]  by pointing out. She's identifying with them as a victim again. Native women in this country
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:38.480]  have been the victims of sexual violence. There we go. So she's a woman and an Indian. You can't
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.080]  really tell about that Indian thing, and she's not going to prove it to you. But you know, she
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.960]  identifies. Remember, we're talking about the transgender insanity that's being
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.440]  foisted upon our kids by our educational system. That's the influence of the federal government
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.720]  on education in your school, in the school that you send your kids to. They're pushing this on
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.920]  the kids. They're doing it in kindergarten. They're telling these young kids they can pick
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.440]  whatever sex they want to be, whatever race they want to be. So you can be focahanist too.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  You know, just like Elizabeth Warren, if you identify as being another race,
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.040]  you can be another race. Nobody can say anything about that. And they're telling
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.600]  that to the kids in kindergarten. So she just needs to wait until these kindergarten kids
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.240]  grow up and vote, and they'll be perfectly fine with that. Because if she identifies as an Indian,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.480]  whether she is or not, then President Trump is racist to criticize her for trying to
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.680]  appropriate their culture and trying to appropriate the set-asides that they got from the Democrats.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:41.360]  She comes in and says, oh, I can get that job because I'm an Indian. That's the issue here,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:48.560]  folks. Never forget that the demagogue party that uses demographics all the time to divide us
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:57.120]  will use those same demographics to take their own privilege. You understand? She took that
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:02.960]  away from them, and she used it and claimed privilege to get her job at Harvard. I think
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.000]  it was Harvard that she was going to. But anyway, she used that job. Now they're saying the Democrats
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.840]  are pledging to limit superdelegates, but they don't really know how they're going to do it yet.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:18.640]  And I find it interesting that Tom Perez, the current DNC chairman, says the party will, quote,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.840]  improve the democratic process before 2020. Well, that implies that there's something wrong with
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.680]  what they did. Is there something wrong with what they did? I think there is, but they won't admit
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.680]  it. You're not going to find them admitting that. All right, let's take a look at gun control.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.400]  And let's look at the shameful things that Republicans are doing here. Trying to identify
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.600]  as Democrats. I guess that you could say that Governor Rick Scott is now identifying as a Democrat
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:50.480]  in the same way that Fulcajanes or Lio Watha is identifying as an Indian. You've got Governor Rick
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:57.280]  Scott signing a $400 million big spending bill. There you go. That's identifying with Democrats.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.600]  And then putting in gun control and confiscating guns from people who are peaceful law-abiding
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:10.000]  citizens that are now going to be banned from having guns. This is what this carpet beggar
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.920]  in Florida is doing. Rick Scott, this Rhino Republican in name only. The bill also bans bump
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:22.160]  stocks. And as a Breitbart points out, they weren't even used in the Florida school shooting.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.120]  I'm not sure the bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas shooting either. None of that stuff
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:34.720]  really adds up. As a matter of fact, we see pictures of a bump stock and a bipod on the
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.880]  same gun. Now, you're not going to use those two things together. We've had people demonstrate
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.160]  that it doesn't work when you do that. And we've got ballistics calculations reportedly found on
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.520]  the table. And yet you're going to do a spray and pray. None of that stuff makes any sense,
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:57.120]  but neither does the gun control bill. We'll talk about that when we return. Stay with us.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.280]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States

[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.200]  welcome back in the next segment we're going to have Christian Saussier the sailor that
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:39.600]  president trump pardoned yesterday and it was an incredible miscarriage of justice it was
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:47.040]  a double standard that we saw happen with this poor sailor who was sent to jail for a year
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.720]  for a couple of pictures that were born classified at the lowest level confidential
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.680]  but he's out now and now he has had his future given back to him by president trump so we want
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:05.680]  to celebrate that with him and we want to talk to him about that have him give his perspective
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.920]  on what has happened and what that means in his life so he'll be joining us in the next segment
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.520]  anxious to talk to Christian Saussier I want to finish up on gun control because we had the
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.680]  Florida governor sign a 400 million dollar gun control bill let me tell you what is in this
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.120]  besides banning bump stocks which were not even alleged to have been used in the Florida shooting
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.320]  but it also the bill was originally going to allow teachers to be armed on a broader basis
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:38.080]  but they had to have that augmented governor scott didn't want teachers to be armed for
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.360]  self-defense he doesn't like that idea he only wants people with uniforms and of course where
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.720]  do you get that idea well he got that idea from the florida education association the fea and they
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:55.040]  told him they said we urge you to honor your instincts and act to keep additional firearms
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.240]  from our schools unless they're in the hands of trained law enforcement personnel you know those
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:05.760]  official people in uniform that stood outside and did nothing the sheriff's department the people
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.520]  who were assigned to protect that school and did nothing those uniformed characters
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:18.480]  meanwhile you've got a real hero who had nothing but his body to put in the way of the bullets
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:24.880]  and he was killed why don't we allow heroes you don't have to wear a uniform to be a hero
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:30.160]  and as we saw with these cowardly sheriff's deputies you can wear a uniform and not be a hero
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.840]  how about allowing people who have the disposition the ability who have been vetted who have been
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.840]  trained who are not afraid of guns who understand what this is about how about giving them some
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:47.600]  tools to protect themselves and to protect other people see the answer in this case is to allow
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.040]  more liberty not take liberty away that's the way we get a better society it's always the right
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.640]  answer to add more freedom and to give freedom to law-abiding responsible people because they
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:05.600]  don't need to be the only people unarmed in the room see the crazy people the criminal people
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.640]  they're going to be able to get guns on the black market regardless do you think that your
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:14.800]  gun-free zones are any more real than your drug-free schools no your schools aren't drug-free
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:20.640]  your schools aren't gun-free and we need to allow people to at least defend themselves against guns
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:28.320]  but anyway as I go through this the immediate response of the NRA was to sue Florida over the
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.680]  gun bill same day that Governor Scott signed it into law they said we filed a lawsuit against
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:41.280]  the state for violating the constitutional rights of 18 to 21 year olds said the NRA and they said
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.880]  this blanket ban violates the fundamental rights of thousands of responsible law abiding Florida
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:53.680]  citizens and is thus invalid under the second and the 14th amendments I see the 14th amendment
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.600]  that's kind of equal protection of the law that's what we're talking to Christian Saucer about
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:03.520]  it means that people in power don't get special privileges that the rest of us don't enjoy but
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:09.120]  of course FBI Director James Comey isn't down with that idea we got a lot of people watching that
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:15.440]  don't agree with that the complaint says the law particularly affects young women the NRA said
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.960]  females between the ages of 18 and 21 pose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:26.800]  shooting have we had any school shootings of females between the ages of 18 and 21 not that
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:34.480]  I'm aware of they said however they are frequently the victims of that type of crime and let me
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:41.200]  give you an example of this this is a case that was highlighted by Reason Magazine and they asked
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:49.680]  if this is a situation with um uh it's in Illinois uh an Illinois woman who is a licensed firearm
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:57.040]  owner and looking to live in the east st louis housing authorities homes tenants and they said
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.400]  well sorry uh you are licensed to fire own a firearm but you have to prove to us that you
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:09.040]  don't have one before you can live here you have to come we have to take your uh your firearms
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:15.200]  now she has filed a complaint uh and uh the plaintiff they don't give her name she's listed as a
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:23.120]  mizdo she wants to keep the weapon for self-defense why because she has repeatedly been threatened
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.040]  well she's been repeatedly threatened uh with her ex-boyfriend and uh they say according to the
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.920]  complaint she's being actively threatened by her abusive ex-husband sorry not boyfriend but husband
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:42.320]  a convicted murderer who while on parole visited shocking violence on her including choking her
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.680]  into unconsciousness beating her so severely that she bled internally and threatening to kill her
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.200]  and her children should she and end their relationship so she's married to this guy
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:59.200]  he goes to jail for murder uh he gets out she doesn't want to have anything to do with him
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.800]  and then he chokes her into unconsciousness beats her so severely she had internal bleeding
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.320]  and threatens to kill her now the government that doesn't keep this murderer in prison
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:16.480]  who turns him out is also going to unleash him on her without giving her any means of protecting
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.880]  herself uh she wants to keep a weapon for self-defense but she's been threatened with eviction by
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.680]  both a housing agency and it's his executive director unless she can verify that she doesn't
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:31.600]  keep a firearm at home and her ex-husband was sent back to prison because of the assaults on her
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.320]  where he beat her until she was bleeding internally this murderer convicted murderer
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:43.360]  who got out on parole i don't understand that uh why isn't this guy still in prison he went back
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:48.320]  to prison because he beat her up but now he's out again and he has been threatening her again
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:55.120]  but the government that won't keep this guy in prison won't let her have a firearm to protect
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.920]  herself that's what the NRA is saying about in florida they're saying you're taking away guns from
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:07.360]  law-abiding citizens 18 to 21 and you're taking away guns from women who are 18 to 21 not going
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.400]  to allow them to protect themselves because uh you know you got to have a man in uniform around
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.800]  to protect you well the men in uniform aren't always there honest cops like sheriff clark
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.160]  will tell you he told his own people he said look uh we'll do everything we can to protect you
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.440]  and we'll get there as soon as we can but when you call the police understand that you're going
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:35.120]  to have to be able to protect yourself until we can get there and so he said get a firearm
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:40.960]  and learn how to use it responsibly and things are not going to get any better in florida the
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.640]  democrats voted unanimously to take away the guns uh from the 18 to 21 year olds and they're not going
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:52.320]  to stop there democrat representative deutch said the gun bill that florida signed is quote
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:28:00.000]  merely the beginning of the response to parkland yeah he wants to ban all the guns folks we've
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.320]  reported this many times you know that this is where they're headed they have talked about this
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:11.200]  multiple times we went to the gun control rally here in austin they had the mayor pro tem the
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:17.840]  number two guy in the city of austin get up there and they had one counter protester of all these
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.560]  people who are protesting our ability to protect ourselves one counter protester with a sign up
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:28.080]  there and we filmed that we were there reporting on it we filmed it they all got around him they
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:34.080]  started uh pushing him and shoving him and the mayor pro tem of austin said you hang on his
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:40.240]  sign said uh we're not going to allow you to confiscate and ban guns and he said you hang
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:45.200]  on to that sign because we're not talking about doing that now but we will be we will be and that's
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.920]  exactly what this florida democrat is saying as well now we're going to come for all the guns
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.480]  stay with us we'll be right back with christian saucer the sailor that president trump pardon
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:02.320]  yesterday they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.680]  that their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:13.600]  and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex president
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:20.400]  to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:27.360]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:33.760]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:40.560]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:48.480]  way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies

[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.240]  conference where sarah sanders announced his pardon here's sarah sanders another news today the
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:00.560]  president has pardoned christian saucer a navy submarine or mr saucer was 22 years old at the
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:06.320]  time of his offenses and has served out his 12 months since he has been recognized by his fellow
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:11.600]  service members for his dedication skill and patriotic spirit while serving he regularly
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.920]  mentored younger sailors and served as an instructor for new recruits the sentencing
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:21.520]  judge found that mr saucer's offense stands in contrast to his commendable military service
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.680]  it also stands in contrast to the way hillary clinton was allowed to get away
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:31.360]  this is what we're talking about folks when we talk about unequal treatment under the law
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:36.880]  the favoritism but i want to focus on the positive side here for at least a good while here and talk
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:43.280]  to christian saucer about what this means for his life welcome sir thank you for joining us thank
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.280]  you for having me on david oh we wanted to celebrate this with you because this is something
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.800]  to celebrate and it's long overdue glad to see this happening what does this mean for your life
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.360]  tell us uh you served a year in prison and you're out now what what has life been like after you
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:02.080]  got out of prison and how is this going to change it having a pardon well you know life's been pretty
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:06.720]  difficult we had a lot of legal debt as a result to be taken to a civilian court instead of tried
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:13.040]  in the military as i should have been um since i was active duty at the time um so you know we had
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:17.680]  a lot of debt and i went to prison for a year and i couldn't work um so you know my wife was to stay
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:23.280]  home on with our young child and her daughter so it's it's it's been pretty difficult um getting
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.880]  out of prison i went on house arrest i was allowed to work um and then i had to be home i had an
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.560]  ankle monitor and a curfew um and you know i applied to many jobs i have a pretty diverse
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.800]  skill set um as a result of my training in the navy operating nuclear power plants but
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:44.560]  nobody would hire me uh fortunately i was able to um find work with a local waste management company
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.640]  and um work as a trash collector so i'm grateful to them for hiring me and and giving me lots of
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.840]  hours so that i can you know pay make sure that my family's taken care of um that is really sad
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.800]  but this has been uh this has been a load of garbage maybe in some of the garbage that you
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:06.480]  were you were hauling there you could find some uh democrat servers or something but i'm glad to see
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.400]  that you've got a part now because that's going to change things it's going to allow you to have
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:16.240]  the opportunity to use your experience in the nuclear field to get a good job and i think
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.640]  it's going to make a difference for you even in terms of it's going to change your discharge from
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.000]  honorable uh dishonorable to an honorable uh discharge what it doesn't exactly do that so
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.720]  that's a whole another process we have to fight to get done um now that uh you know the that i
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.880]  have a pardon obviously it gives us some ground to stand on but the whole military side of it
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.360]  i still have another than honorable discharge so i still um i'm not able to receive any of
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:46.320]  my disability benefits or any veterans benefits for that matter oh as a result of my 11 years of
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.840]  service so that unfortunately hasn't changed um and it's you know like anything else it's it's a
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.600]  fight we're going to we're willing to go ahead and and go into um but it's going to take time but
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.200]  let's that's and let me give out that site that you've got here because it sounds like you still
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:06.240]  need some help uh and you've got a site there where people have uh been allowed to contribute
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.640]  to help you with your legal expenses but people need to understand they still need to keep up some
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.720]  pressure to make sure that you get that honorable discharge uh it's help chris saucer dot com and
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:27.920]  that's uh k r i s oh h e l p k r i s s a u c i e r dot com help chris saucer dot com uh so uh
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.880]  people can look there and uh see what they can do to help you but it is still a big help to have a
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.320]  pardon isn't oh absolutely i mean we're so grateful yeah i don't want to i don't want to seem like a
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.160]  downer here i mean this is one of the the few things in the past you know four or five years
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:49.040]  it's actually been a positive for my family i mean we've we've had so much loss and you know lost
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:56.560]  so many things and um just a lot and um this has just been a huge you know it's given us a lot more
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:01.200]  faith back in um you know at least one person in washington dc i don't know if the rest of them
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.240]  are going to do the right thing i can tell you president trump is and um you know and we've
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.880]  we've always supported him you know he's a busy guy he's had a lot of stuff going on um and for him
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:17.280]  to take the time to not only you know give us our lives back um by granting me the pardon but to
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:22.000]  take the time to call me and speak with me i mean we were just floored you know it was just
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.120]  what an amazing man and um we're just so fortunate to have him as our president i mean
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:32.640]  you know the guy he truly cares about the people you know he cares about the little people i mean
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.680]  that's what i am you know i i'm not politically connected like hillary clinton i'm not um you
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.280]  know even like joe arpaio i'm not somebody that's a well-known person like him uh i'm just an average
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.000]  guy who you know all i want to do is serve in the military and serve my country and and be a good
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.080]  citizen and and here he's reached out and he's touched the lives of somebody like me and my family
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.360]  and uh it's just amazing well you know your name is not a household name hasn't been before like
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:05.840]  sheriff arpaio but so many of us knew about your case because it was such a glaring double standard
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.040]  for what was happening with hillary clinton and i'm looking at the headline from the ap
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.640]  trump pardons navy sailor who became a conservative talking point well we were talking about the
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.040]  fact that hillary clinton wasn't being held to any kind of a standard and you were being held to an
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.320]  incredibly strict standard as you pointed out this is something that should have been looked at
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:30.480]  within the military you took a couple of pictures in the area that you worked at as a souvenir this
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:35.760]  was something that was as soon as you took those pictures they were born classified but at the
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.760]  lowest level confidential and we've heard over and over again that hillary clinton well you know
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.920]  she only had a dozen or so things that were classified that had the actual marking on it
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:49.120]  but we know that with hillary clinton talking to foreign heads of state that is born classified
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.680]  and it is a level that is higher than top secret and they want to pretend that that doesn't exist
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.880]  that's the double standard that we saw well absolutely and you know the fact well and what's
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.560]  most disgusting is is uh that they want you to believe that uh she didn't commit a crime because
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.600]  she lacked intent to cause national harm and i can tell you for a fact that was never a requirement
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.920]  in uh under the statute they charged me which is by the way the very same statute they could
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.000]  have charged her because i was not court marshaled i was not held to a higher standard because i was
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.880]  in the military i was tried in a civilian federal court by federal prosecutors from the doj obama's
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.640]  doj and i can tell you those same people when jim comey said there's no prosecutor that bring a
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.960]  case against her i can tell you that they brought a case against me for far less and there was never
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.760]  a requirement there was never any intention to cause national harm and they never argued that
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.880]  point um because they knew it knew it would have it would just been heinous um yeah there's no way
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:48.080]  that a class that a confidential classification of something is going to cause uh national harm
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.640]  and uh matter of fact a definition for confidential is will cause little to no harm if released to
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.240]  foreign adversaries you know whereas top secret will cause grievous harm to the national security
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.800]  so hillary clinton had top secret and top secret sci which is above top secret which is only supposed
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:10.720]  to be viewed in a sif um on her personal server uh it's a joke it's a joke that um you know james
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.920]  comey would even have the audacity to come out and tell the american people that well because she
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.760]  lacked intent um that she didn't cause that or that she didn't break the law i tell you that's
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.160]  not a requirement for that statue and anybody with a laptop or a phone can look that up and see
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:31.280]  that it's not a requirement and gross negligence is the only requirement for breaking that law
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.000]  you basically do what i did so the law was prosecuted under unlawful retention of national
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.960]  defense information which oh by the way is exactly what hillary clinton did means you have secure
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.600]  information on an unsecured device i wasn't not allowed to have those pictures i just wasn't
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.280]  allowed to have them on my cell phone which was an unsecured device because i possessed a secret
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.000]  clearance i was allowed to maintain secret information but i had them on an unsecured
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.160]  device so i broke the law and i accepted responsibility for it unlike hillary clinton
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.520]  i went to court i didn't go to trial i pled guilty i took my punishment i didn't speak out about it
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:08.480]  until i'd serve my time in prison and uh as i was serving my time in prison and watching
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:12.960]  somebody who should be in prison run for the highest office in this country president united
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.920]  states i was utterly disgusted and i said you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna wait until i get out
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.960]  and i'm gonna speak out about this because people should be upset you know it's it's bad enough you

[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:34.720]  to christian and christian as we'd seen back in january the second we had president trump
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:39.440]  tweeting out at that point in time saying cricket hillary's top aide huma avidan has been accused
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.320]  of disregarding basic security protocol she put classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.680]  no problem for any of that right he said remember the sailors picture on a submarine jail the deep
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:57.840]  state justice department must finally act also on comey and others so i personally i can't imagine
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.920]  how you felt because when i saw james comey do that it made my blood boil to say that she'd
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.680]  commit all these felonies but she was going to be let loose but don't you try this at home and then
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.120]  sending you to jail and you're that was about a month before your jail term began wasn't it yes
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.840]  yeah i'd already pled guilty except your responsibility and i was basically um just waiting
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:24.400]  to go to prison at that point uh and and i just was utterly disgusted i watched it live on television
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:31.120]  while i was wearing an ankle monitor you know out on a hundred thousand dollar bail um and i just i
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.080]  sat there with my wife and i i i didn't know i was speechless you know i i can't answer because i
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.120]  was speechless watching it with my wife and i wasn't on the threat of a jail term for a
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.400]  a very very minor charge compared to what hillary did yeah i mean and i i couldn't believe it you
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.320]  know it'd be one thing if this happened years apart from my case and they you know maybe forgot
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.800]  about it or something like that but it was happening at the exact same time these are the same federal
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:51:00.800]  prosecutors the same fbi the same people that went after me with the greatest of fervor destroyed my
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:07.440]  life destroyed my family's life bankrupted us and and you know they're given this person hillary
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:11.440]  clinton a benefit of the doubt somebody who's not not you know one of the most corrupt politicians
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:16.560]  in washington oh yeah um globally and somebody like me who's proudly served their country for 11
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:22.960]  years and has a stellar military record just demolished by these people and um i i couldn't
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.720]  believe it i i said this is people have got to be upset about this and i you know it's upsetting
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:34.240]  that the the left wants to protect her so much and and without even look taking a look at the facts
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:41.200]  you know i mean you know it it her and obama weaponized the department of justice against me
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:45.520]  um they used me as a scapegoat to say look we're hard on people that mishandle classified
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:49.600]  information unless you're of course you know politically connected uh elite that's you know
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:54.400]  the current president at that time says is the most uh you know the best person to be the next
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:59.520]  president um so it's very upsetting yeah that was a thing that made me so angry it was his
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:04.800]  basically uh she's too big to jail but don't you try this at home and then using you as the
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:10.160]  poster child for that that was just amazing oh yeah i mean you could go on and on about the tarmac
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:14.080]  meeting and everything like that all these things that should have pointed to a corrupt department
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:20.480]  of justice um and you know it just everybody just says well you know it's business as usual in dc
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.960]  and uh you know thank goodness we have trump there now because i mean president trump
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.840]  he's like a one-man wrecking crew destroying the establishment of corruption that's been
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:36.000]  in dc for so long and they hate it yeah and i just i love watching them do it i mean you know
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.440]  it's just and i love watching them squirm on cnn and all these other fake news networks and say
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:46.560]  well but but but he's done nearly everything that he promised he was going to do in such
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.920]  short order i mean mine is just one of the minor things you know my pardon and and restoring my
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.480]  good name is just one of the many things that he's done right so far yeah he promised he was going
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:03.280]  to do and they don't know how to respond to it and um you know it's it's sad i frankly because he
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:07.920]  doesn't get the credit he deserves he's an amazing man and after speaking to him on the phone i just
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:11.920]  reinforced everything i'd already believed about him from watching him well you know the further
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.200]  they go down this path the more they're just destroying themselves because the american
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.920]  people can see this they see uh what the difference between what cnn and others are telling us and
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:24.000]  the reality of what's going on but let's talk a little bit about uh your life now what are your
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.040]  plans going ahead uh you point out they uh essentially bankrupted you they made it so that
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.880]  you couldn't get a job now you'll be able to get a job with a pardon but tell us a little bit about
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.880]  your your life ahead of you now well i'm going to tell you i'm going to keep fighting um for what
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.840]  i believe is right i i think that this double standard justice needs to get exposed and as
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:48.560]  long as you guys will let me come on your show and and talk about it and i think we need to
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.920]  raise awareness because we shouldn't let this happen you know disappear into the abyss like so many
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:54:00.080]  other you know uh liberal conspiracies or whatever that have just kind of said well you know it's no
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.640]  big deal i think we should keep pushing the issue and i intend to do that i agree because i think
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.640]  that basically what should happen don't don't you agree christian that that what should happen is
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:12.720]  you served a year in jail i think that was excessive but i think what should happen is
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:17.680]  hillary should go to prison and then uh when she gets out he can partner so she can get an honest
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:25.760]  job somewhere yeah i don't know she knows what that word is anymore uh but i think yeah i absolutely
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:31.680]  i think that hillary clinton uh huma abadine sterile mills um james comey all the other people
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:37.760]  that were involved in this conspiracy loretta lynch and uh probably obama as well yeah should be
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.000]  put on trial and they should be tried and run through the same legal system that i was you
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.800]  know obviously they'll have a lot more funds to throw at legal defense than i did but i think
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:50.720]  they should be put through the same ringer because you know whether they get convicted or not or
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.960]  sent to prison or not there should be no reason that people in america believe that there's people
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.520]  in this country above the law it should now it should not exist she should be held to and we
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.160]  said this from the beginning she should be held to a higher standard because she was in a much
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:11.600]  higher office she had access to much higher classified material that was as you pointed out
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:16.240]  uh you know the very definition of confidential is that it isn't going to damage anything with
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:22.400]  national security if it gets out and uh i i had a job one at one point time as an intern when i was
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.080]  an engineering and it didn't take very much investigation for me to get a confidential
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:31.120]  jobs uh clear a classification so i could start that job it's a very minor thing uh something
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.440]  that is classified as confidential as i point out before you came on when we saw the uh house
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:39.440]  memo come out that had been classified as top secret there was nothing in there i mean they
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:44.560]  over classify things to the nth degree and yet hillary clinton was stuff that really did need
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:52.080]  to be classified that would really damage our country uh was out there carelessly if not deliberately
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:57.600]  putting this stuff out well and then you see the the fbi on you know andrew mccabe and peter
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:03.200]  strozik uh just you know with this cabal of ensuring that hillary clinton never went to
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:08.160]  any kind of uh went through any kind of a legal process at all you know she gets a special treatment
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:12.960]  by these guys the white glove treatment why why should anybody in this country be treated
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.440]  differently than anybody else we're all supposed to be protected under the law the same way um
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:22.240]  we're all supposed to receive equal protection under the constitutional law of this country um
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.120]  and those people the organizations like the fbi and the doj should be above reproach there should be
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.680]  no uh insider well we're going to do this or we're going to treat this person this way
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:37.120]  no it's it's it's shameful it's shameful that that was at the highest levels i agree and and
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:42.240]  there's another aspect of this christian and that is the fact that uh and it's something that i'm
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.960]  especially sensitive to as a journalist and that is the lack of transparency in our government
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.360]  everything like i mentioned the uh the memo that was eventually declassified even though it was top
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.360]  secret trump declassified that and you could see there was nothing in there that needed to be even
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:01.200]  confidential classification and and we see the government always hiding everything that it does
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.600]  from us under the well we can't tell you because it would damage national security it's just they're
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:11.360]  just protecting themselves and and hiding all transparency from us and doing it in the name
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.240]  of the national security state and then we see when it is real national security they don't care
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:19.920]  one bit and they won't punish anybody for it that's the thing that really bothers me
