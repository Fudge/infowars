[00:43.960 --> 00:51.040]  they're probing stare burrowing into the back of your head you turn around and
[00:51.040 --> 00:57.040]  like clockwork they could be staring at you with love hate or just curiosity
[00:57.040 --> 01:03.920]  you felt it both of you momentarily startled realize that your minds have
[01:03.920 --> 01:11.600]  just touched anyone who listens or watches on a regular basis knows that
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.440]  we're teleprompter free and info wars.com we don't follow outside talking
[01:17.440 --> 01:24.680]  points we research what's happening in the culture what's unfolding in the

[01:31.240 --> 01:36.480]  we don't engage in a lot of speculation either we're live ladies and gentlemen
[01:36.480 --> 01:42.720]  that is just the first minute from an impromptu 10-minute video special report
[01:42.720 --> 01:48.240]  that I shot last night that aired on info originally news titled something big
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.640]  is about to happen or you could have titled it something big is happening
[01:53.640 --> 01:59.160]  Ron Paul has talked about the big event coming the financial meltdown we're
[01:59.160 --> 02:04.840]  undoubtedly already seeing it in different parts of the world 35 million
[02:04.840 --> 02:12.120]  people a year the UN says starve the death and those numbers are only going
[02:12.120 --> 02:20.520]  up we have been pretty much insulated from that here we've been partially
[02:20.520 --> 02:28.360]  insulated from the horrors that are globalism but more and more that is
[02:28.360 --> 02:38.760]  changing and I could clear the decks today in fact last night when I was
[02:38.760 --> 02:43.640]  really just in my gut upset about the entire climate and trying to put my
[02:43.640 --> 02:50.640]  finger directly on it I said there was a good chance I would just cancel guest
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.480]  tomorrow and open the phones up for three hours to discuss basically the
[02:55.480 --> 03:04.440]  hundredth monkey phenomenon or syndrome but we do have Tucker Carlson coming on
[03:04.440 --> 03:11.280]  today always informative mark crusher pro-life America and dr. Ed group will
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.560]  be here in studio to open the phones up to ask dr. group your question about
[03:15.560 --> 03:19.960]  health supplements nutrition some of the great gains we're making and educating
[03:19.960 --> 03:28.480]  the public some of the big victory so we'll do that but undoubtedly sometime
[03:28.480 --> 03:38.160]  this week we will spend pretty much the entire broadcast just opening the phones
[03:38.160 --> 03:47.360]  up to ask are you feeling the feeling of anxiety and disquiet and concern like
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.320]  something bad is about to happen because I've been privately feeling this really
[03:51.320 --> 03:59.000]  intensely for about three weeks and my gut has never been wrong but I can't
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.480]  even guess or imagine what it is and separately other people been telling me
[04:05.480 --> 04:10.080]  about this people that aren't even listeners of the show or viewers and I've
[04:10.080 --> 04:13.280]  been talking to crew they have found members that aren't listeners that are
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.320]  just bringing up the same thing so when I put this video out last night if you go
[04:18.320 --> 04:25.600]  to info wars.com or if you go to YouTube the vast majority of people are
[04:25.600 --> 04:31.480]  really resonating with it and saying that they're basically saying the same
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.800]  thing so we need to take the concern of our subconscious mind and bring it to
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.360]  the conscious level and ask why is everybody so much on edge a lot of
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.560]  different reasons for that I'll talk some about it here today but when we come
[04:45.560 --> 04:51.880]  back there's just so much news that we're going to have to get to just wait

[09:52.360 --> 09:59.680]  the summer of rage before I go any further let me just give you some of the
[09:59.680 --> 10:05.200]  headlines here there's some good news there's some bad news supreme court
[10:05.200 --> 10:10.200]  strikes down Maryland income tax law saying it's unconstitutional that is a
[10:10.200 --> 10:16.680]  big big deal saying that you if you have state taxes and federal taxes the
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.480]  double tax they're unconstitutional simply amazing that's from courthouse
[10:21.480 --> 10:27.640]  news service another really positive piece of news federal judge says DC
[10:27.640 --> 10:33.800]  carry laws unconstitutional DC heller ruled this six years ago but they came
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.040]  out with new gun laws that were also unconstitutional so that's been stricken
[10:37.040 --> 10:44.480]  down we're gonna break that down also Texas legislators reduced penalty for
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.600]  guns at airports CHL holders were stopped by security will be allowed to
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.320]  put their guns in their vehicles or check it in their luggage yeah they're
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.880]  concealed carry holders they don't have a criminal record they make us safer if
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.360]  they were gonna bring a gun in illegally they would just do it so leave them
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.680]  alone let the pilots have guns you trust them to fly the plane let them have
[11:08.680 --> 11:17.040]  guns the answer is more guns less crime just super news so that's just some of
[11:17.040 --> 11:24.040]  the positive news here's some of the bad news and believe me there's plenty of
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.280]  it but also plenty of good news my point is there's not just evil in the
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.320]  world there's good in the world there's common sense in the world that's what
[11:32.320 --> 11:36.720]  the system sells mental illness and insanity and unstableness and in
[11:36.720 --> 11:43.320]  twisted art is to fundamentally confuse people
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.040]  Obama seeks to end immigration enforcement by local and state police
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.440]  that's right he's already ended it federally outside of law now he's moving
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.600]  with his black lives matter movement and the Justice Department stirring up
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.680]  destabilization to bait and switch and try to attach federal funds and withhold
[12:02.680 --> 12:09.480]  them if police basically arrest illegals for any reason you've seen the
[12:09.480 --> 12:12.840]  board patrol memos three months ago where they're called let them go for
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.400]  crimes let them go with guns let them go with drugs let them go if they're drunk
[12:17.400 --> 12:26.360]  just just let the illegals go because they want them here to drive down the
[12:26.360 --> 12:31.240]  wages and be a new political block with divide and conquer tower of Babel 2.0
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.600]  or none of us can communicate with each other but regardless this
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.120]  discrimination against citizens I don't care what color you are there's another
[12:40.120 --> 12:48.080]  special report out of ABC News agents under attack and it just goes into how
[12:48.080 --> 12:57.240]  hell is their job is so we'll be going over all of that and again these are
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.600]  just the top stories in each little stack I've got more than 15 stacks today
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.200]  where should I begin on these other stacks Iraq forces flee as ISIS gains
[13:11.200 --> 13:19.720]  control of Ramadi U.S. officials say and I was sitting there this morning
[13:19.720 --> 13:27.080]  watching the news while I was exercising and it shows ISIS driving around in
[13:27.080 --> 13:36.840]  their armored Humvees and you know we see the Iraqi security forces trained by
[13:36.840 --> 13:49.080]  our military fleeing what's really going on here Saudi Arabia has proxy armies
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.440]  funded by nature and others that have been trying to bring down Syria for five
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.160]  years they fly all kind of flags
[14:00.160 --> 14:08.760]  they're engaging in all these crimes and all they are is a proxy army being
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.560]  given a large portion of Iraq by the West and then our media acts like that
[14:13.560 --> 14:19.480]  they're an enemy and acts like our military can't do anything and then
[14:19.480 --> 14:23.320]  when ISIS ends up attacking the US because it's a real terror group they
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.960]  just been funded and protected by the West they will take our basic liberties
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.520]  and our freedoms in fact I rarely agree with Piers Morgan but the washed up
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.000]  talk show host because he came here to lecture Americans on getting rid of the
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.600]  Bill of Rights with his a snooty snooty fake accent it's a fake uptown you know
[14:44.600 --> 14:48.880]  Richie Riche British accent in his country it's fake the Brits have explained
[14:48.880 --> 14:55.440]  to me he's saying that there will be ISIS attacks in this country Piers
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.400]  Morgan calls for war claims with zero evidence terror group will launch big
[14:59.400 --> 15:02.720]  attacks in South America that's a curtain MO article I don't require my
[15:02.720 --> 15:05.840]  reporters to agree with me on everything I don't really agree with Kurt that
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.920]  there's zero evidence we've already had an ISIS attack we know they're coming
[15:10.920 --> 15:14.120]  across the border we know they're recruiting in the West it's different
[15:14.120 --> 15:18.960]  than the previous al Qaeda groups that were totally synthetic and led by
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.080]  Western intelligence agencies completely then they would have wind up toy useful
[15:24.080 --> 15:30.960]  idiots below them carry out some attacks that was a paper tiger ISIS has been
[15:30.960 --> 15:40.440]  given a major funding by Qatar Saudi Arabia Turkey some Israeli money other
[15:40.440 --> 15:44.760]  funding out of Europe out of England they've been allowed to recruit it is a
[15:44.760 --> 15:50.480]  real terror threat that doesn't mean give your rights up because it is
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.800]  happening because at the end of the day it was still created by the West as a
[15:54.800 --> 15:58.400]  pretext to menace us into giving up liberty giving up liberty does not
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.480]  protect us and we should not be held hostage and we should reverse the
[16:03.480 --> 16:07.080]  liberties that we've seen lost in the name of fighting terrorism even the head
[16:07.080 --> 16:11.040]  of Interpol said last year the answers arming citizens like in the US
[16:11.040 --> 16:15.840]  worldwide to fight back against radical jihadists when they attack shopping
[16:15.840 --> 16:22.680]  malls and colleges and community centers and schools and things like that the
[16:22.680 --> 16:28.560]  scum loved to attack innocent targets they love victim disarmament zones they
[16:28.560 --> 16:35.520]  love countries where the public's been disarmed I get Kurt's point about they're
[16:35.520 --> 16:39.000]  hyping the threat and at the end of the day it's synthetic but but not
[16:39.000 --> 16:46.000]  synthetic in the way Al Qaeda the granddaddy of Isis is Isis is a real army
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.680]  equipped and trained by the Saudi military and others who were trained
[16:52.680 --> 17:03.320]  at bases in the Middle East from Jordan to Turkey to Iraq and then that free
[17:03.320 --> 17:11.240]  Syrian army was handed over to Saudi run Wahhabist who fly the Saudi Arabian
[17:11.240 --> 17:17.240]  Wahhabist flag you know it is Al Qaeda it's just a Wahhabist flag it is the Al
[17:17.240 --> 17:20.640]  Qaeda flag but notice you never hear that we hear oh Al Qaeda is done we feel
[17:20.640 --> 17:25.240]  their leadership they're gone now here's Isis the new enemy just to confuse
[17:25.240 --> 17:28.960]  everybody but they don't really fight them they always wanted Iraq broken up
[17:28.960 --> 17:36.480]  the three parts that's what's now been done and they may just give again one
[17:36.480 --> 17:41.520]  area of the Kurds one area to the Al Qaeda folks the Isis people Islamic State
[17:41.520 --> 17:48.400]  part of Iraq in the West and part of Eastern Syria and that's been the goal
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.640]  and you're just seeing it our media just goes oh my gosh look at Isis they're so
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.920]  terrible oh my gosh we better get rid of our Bill of Rights and have the NSA spy
[17:56.920 --> 18:02.000]  on us and internet kill switches and you know checkpoints when the border is
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.720]  wide open it's all a total fraud here are the headlines Iraq forces flee as
[18:08.720 --> 18:14.080]  Isis games control of Ramadi US official says Iraq security forces were pushed
[18:14.080 --> 18:21.000]  out by a smaller Isis force they say it's pretty much over now the US military
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.560]  official told Fox News and now they're saying they may take the whole country
[18:24.560 --> 18:31.040]  no they will be allowed to get if you put up an Iraqi map on the wall the
[18:31.040 --> 18:39.320]  central western area right into the far western area in to the central eastern
[18:39.320 --> 18:46.120]  area and far eastern area of Syria that is Islamic State that is the new
[18:46.120 --> 18:51.840]  command base just like the US and England help create Israel as a land-based
[18:51.840 --> 18:58.640]  aircraft carrier in the Middle East Saudi Arabia will now have its own command
[18:58.640 --> 19:06.840]  base right in the middle of it and that's the plan to further balkanize the
[19:06.840 --> 19:11.160]  war against Isis and Iraq just took a dark term business insider admits that
[19:11.160 --> 19:17.840]  the whole country could fall to Saudi Arabia US
[19:17.840 --> 19:23.000]  meanwhile says oh we just can't beat him oh the Iraqis are turning and fleeing
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.840]  and that's because everything our government has done was to break down
[19:26.840 --> 19:30.760]  Iraq and make it be a failed state just like Libya now turned over to the very
[19:30.760 --> 19:36.280]  same jihadis so Saudi Arabia is just being given the keys the Middle East
[19:38.800 --> 19:43.320]  now we come back Pentagon admits that they're preparing for mass civil

[24:42.600 --> 24:43.680]  the program
[24:43.680 --> 24:46.960]  uh... costing millions of dollars truck tri-billions
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.360]  has been designed for the purpose
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.560]  immediate and long-term war fighting relevant insights development
[24:54.560 --> 24:56.480]  the pentagon explains the purpose
[24:56.480 --> 24:59.040]  is for senior officials and decision-makers
[24:59.040 --> 25:00.880]  in the defense policy community
[25:00.880 --> 25:05.240]  to form a contingency plan for the event of wide-scale civil unrest
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.080]  close quote
[25:07.080 --> 25:09.360]  and that's admitted in
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.680]  the washington post in the new york times and
[25:13.680 --> 25:22.320]  forms and army times and stars and stripes and then we just go all look
[25:22.320 --> 25:25.040]  they're having a big giant drill we should investigate it
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.440]  and the mainstream media acts like none of this exists
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.080]  that's how crazy it is
[25:33.080 --> 25:36.980]  meanwhile obama we're gonna cover this has come out and
[25:36.980 --> 25:40.000]  the london guardian has the story and is claiming that
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.040]  he's going to ban
[25:44.040 --> 25:48.960]  the the m sixteen's in the armored vehicles and uh... and the helicopters
[25:48.960 --> 25:52.080]  and all the rest of them from being given to local police
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.600]  when it's the feds that have been doing that all along
[25:55.600 --> 25:58.200]  and it is accelerated expanded
[25:58.200 --> 25:59.720]  ballooned
[25:59.720 --> 26:01.520]  under his tutelage
[26:01.520 --> 26:03.240]  and i predict
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.600]  some hard to predict it's very nebulous what he says
[26:06.600 --> 26:10.800]  this is all smoking mirrors and the opposite will be done
[26:10.800 --> 26:13.340]  obama to ban military gear
[26:13.340 --> 26:20.340]  that can alienate and intimidate
[26:22.400 --> 26:25.360]  the recently revealed documents add that the
[26:25.360 --> 26:26.440]  purpose
[26:26.440 --> 26:29.960]  is further to inform policy implemented by
[26:29.960 --> 26:32.040]  combatant commandos
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.760]  and commands
[26:33.760 --> 26:38.520]  this all started back in two thousand eight when the global banking crisis
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.280]  form the impetus for d o d
[26:42.280 --> 26:45.360]  and the manoeuvre research institute
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.520]  the d o d then decided to partner with universities in order to improve d o d
[26:49.520 --> 26:52.760]  is basic understanding of the social cultural behavioral
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.200]  and political forces that shape reasons the world
[26:55.200 --> 26:57.460]  of strategic importance to the u s
[26:57.460 --> 26:58.360]  and that's that
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.200]  mastering the human domain
[27:00.200 --> 27:03.000]  including domestically in the u s
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.280]  a special forces unit based in fort bragg north carolina
[27:06.280 --> 27:09.240]  is conducting joint exercises local police forces
[27:09.240 --> 27:11.560]  in the surrounding area of columbia
[27:11.560 --> 27:12.840]  south carolina
[27:12.840 --> 27:16.040]  the exercises which involve the third special forces group
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.240]  and the richmond county sheriff's department swat team
[27:19.240 --> 27:24.640]  will be taking place and are currently taking place so it's just ongoing
[27:24.640 --> 27:26.280]  and the pentagon comes out
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.280]  and makes the announcement
[27:30.280 --> 27:33.560]  out of one side of their mouth but on the other side says that we're basically
[27:33.560 --> 27:35.600]  making it up
[27:35.600 --> 27:36.940]  dot need to play
[27:36.940 --> 27:40.100]  sheriff's departments in indiana and washington state
[27:40.100 --> 27:44.900]  and in new york saying the m wraps are for veterans and gun owners
[27:44.900 --> 27:46.860]  because there's a coming war with us
[27:46.860 --> 27:48.520]  what do you have planned
[27:48.520 --> 27:50.000]  so horrible
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.460]  it's going to start a civil war
[27:53.460 --> 27:55.040]  we didn't have the
[27:55.040 --> 27:57.120]  the violence that we see today
[27:57.120 --> 27:59.560]  uh... the weaponry is totally different
[27:59.560 --> 28:02.840]  now that it wasn't in my the beginning of my career
[28:02.840 --> 28:05.560]  uh... plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that
[28:05.560 --> 28:07.800]  have the ability and the knowledge to
[28:07.800 --> 28:13.800]  to build aides and and to defeat law enforcement techniques
[28:13.800 --> 28:16.480]  this is california
[28:16.480 --> 28:19.120]  the riot police and military
[28:19.120 --> 28:21.960]  the army
[28:21.960 --> 28:32.600]  that's the key for the attack
[28:32.600 --> 28:34.400]  be launched
[28:34.400 --> 28:37.840]  so this is what's going on everywhere the southern property law center in eighty
[28:37.840 --> 28:40.040]  l basically quarterback it
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.120]  and they don't want us to have a national debate about it well we're going
[28:43.120 --> 28:46.840]  to have the debate about what you're building
[28:46.840 --> 28:49.440]  so that as you unveil it people know
[28:49.440 --> 28:54.120]  that it was premeditated you didn't just launch a total military takeover
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.920]  overnight that it was pre-planned pre-position
[28:57.920 --> 29:05.240]  prepared that the military was tested to see who would follow orders
[29:05.240 --> 29:07.520]  and then there's the bigger question again
[29:07.520 --> 29:09.960]  why is there this big build up
[29:09.960 --> 29:12.680]  and why are they saying gun owners and veterans are going to be attacking
[29:12.680 --> 29:13.640]  police
[29:13.640 --> 29:14.640]  and some will say
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.800]  all that cop that's what team commander in indiana
[29:18.800 --> 29:20.680]  talked about violence is worse today
[29:20.680 --> 29:24.240]  no gun violence is down fifty plus percent
[29:24.240 --> 29:25.880]  sixty according to uh...
[29:25.880 --> 29:27.200]  professor lot
[29:27.200 --> 29:30.360]  well i crunched the numbers of the just department is fifty one
[29:30.360 --> 29:33.680]  and yeah you saw the big shootout up in uh... wake up
[29:33.680 --> 29:34.680]  nine people killed
[29:34.680 --> 29:36.320]  that's what gangs have always done
[29:36.320 --> 29:39.040]  gangs have always killed each other back in the days of al capone
[29:39.040 --> 29:42.080]  there were sometimes fifteen people killed a week in chicago
[29:42.080 --> 29:43.520]  it's nothing new in fact
[29:43.520 --> 29:45.760]  actual gang violence is down
[29:45.760 --> 29:48.120]  in the u.s.
[29:48.120 --> 29:49.520]  we're on the march

[43:22.760 --> 43:26.680]  she's got more girlfriends than al capone did i mean she's she's a monster
[43:27.560 --> 43:34.040]  and let me tell you she gets in office where you think obama's been bad and imagine oh don't
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.280]  talk bad about women you're just against women because you don't like hillary i'd vote for a
[43:38.280 --> 43:42.920]  woman in one second i'd vote for a black man in one second i care less what color you are
[43:42.920 --> 43:47.160]  what's between your legs as long as in your heart you love freedom and in your brain
[43:47.160 --> 43:54.360]  you understand what's happening in this world but you wonder why every movie now is about
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.160]  how men are inherently bad and how great feminist are and how you know the new mad max all the men
[43:59.160 --> 44:05.320]  are killed at the end and a utopia is created that's called the end of humanity this is sick
[44:05.320 --> 44:10.440]  and it's all to grease this kids for hillary the establishment is behind her as they try to force
[44:10.440 --> 44:18.680]  feed us rotten vomit that she's spewed up all the crimes she's committed all the abortions she's
[44:18.680 --> 44:24.440]  pushed all the all the all the souls in her rotten gut she vomits it up we're supposed to just
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.720]  beg her like it's mana from heaven but here's the good news people are waking up under obama
[44:29.720 --> 44:33.640]  we've seen the m wraps in the in the machine i don't care if the cops have fully auto or
[44:33.640 --> 44:37.160]  in big cities they have armored vehicles because you may need them sometimes what i don't like
[44:37.160 --> 44:45.320]  is that they're directed against the veterans and gun owners but notice now under 7277 we told
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.480]  us this was coming in my film police day 2000 made 99 that they would then foment civil war with
[44:51.480 --> 44:56.680]  the police after they set them up had them do things like acid formative seizure and things
[44:56.680 --> 45:01.160]  the feds taught them how to do to demonize them then they bring in federalism and globalism
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.920]  and disarm the police obama to ban police military gear that can alienate and intimidate
[45:06.920 --> 45:14.280]  here's the clip then we're going to cleveland to talk to jacari jackson and joe biggs or we're
[45:14.280 --> 45:21.000]  waiting for another verdict oh by the way they're protesting there's photos online in ferguson at
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.560]  the different george soros compounds demanding their pay claiming they didn't get paid their
[45:25.560 --> 45:31.080]  next paycheck for demonstrating i guess 33 million was all soros spent they wanted more
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.800]  so so now they're demonstrating outside the different soros uh justice department front
[45:35.800 --> 45:41.160]  grips i mean just talk about astro turf this is it the opposite of grass roots let's go to this
[45:41.160 --> 45:46.920]  obama club here at s today we're also releasing new policies on the military style equipment
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.480]  that the federal government uh has in the past provided the state and local law enforcement
[45:51.480 --> 45:58.760]  agencies you know we've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like
[46:00.520 --> 46:04.040]  there's an occupying force as opposed to a force that's part of the community
[46:04.040 --> 46:08.840]  that's protecting them and serving them can alienate and intimidate local residents and
[46:08.840 --> 46:14.440]  send the wrong message so we're going to prohibit some equipment made for the battlefield
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.920]  that is not appropriate for local police departments you know there is other equipment
[46:18.920 --> 46:24.440]  that may be needed in certain cases but only with proper training let's stop right there so we're
[46:24.440 --> 46:28.280]  going to show they're going to give them all the armored vehicles and everything but they've got
[46:28.280 --> 46:35.640]  to be federalized just like al sharpon said we have that al sharpon clip remember and and we
[46:35.640 --> 46:42.440]  told you that's what all of this was about obama to ban police military gear that can alienate
[46:42.440 --> 46:47.160]  and intimidate but then you hear what he says oh no we're still going to give it to you you've just
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.120]  got to be federal and and and then they'll use it a lot nicer uh let's go ahead and go to that clip
[46:52.120 --> 46:57.320]  they've been fighting them all over the country which is why we're going to do this march from here
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.040]  to uh washington we need the justice department to step down and take over the police in this
[47:02.040 --> 47:07.240]  country in the 20th century they had to fight states rights and to get the right to vote we
[47:07.240 --> 47:13.720]  got to fight states rights in terms of closing down police cases police must be held accountable
[47:13.720 --> 47:18.040]  i don't think all police are bad i don't even think most of that but those that are need to be held
[47:18.040 --> 47:25.800]  accountable and by federalizing them we'll all be safe now we go to cleveland ohio where jacari
[47:25.800 --> 47:29.960]  jackson is reporting he's been talking to folks about the federalization that they think it's a
[47:29.960 --> 47:34.920]  good idea uh he's been watching the demonstrations the streets getting blocked jacari update us on
[47:34.920 --> 47:39.960]  what you've seen so far and tell us about this case and why folks are so upset and what you're
[47:39.960 --> 47:45.160]  expecting to see happening uh after you've stuck your toe in the water and measured the climate out
[47:45.160 --> 47:51.400]  there jacari jackson reporting live from cleveland ohio right outside the justice department they
[47:51.400 --> 47:56.120]  had a i guess he was called a demonstration yesterday nothing on the grand scale we've seen
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.920]  in cities like baltimore and ferguson but you know it's a very quiet scene out here right now
[48:00.920 --> 48:05.160]  not only are there not large crowds there also isn't a large police presence you don't see the
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.960]  swat teams in the national guard like we've seen in other cities so thus far everybody's keeping
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.240]  a really cool head i'm sure they are ready to mobilize should some incident occur and is what
[48:15.240 --> 48:20.200]  you were talking about earlier alex uh the clip obama and i guess sharp and through and his two
[48:20.200 --> 48:25.160]  cents as well this idea that we need to federalize the police and to anybody out there who thinks
[48:25.160 --> 48:29.160]  all this stuff is going to disappear the m-wraps and the grenade launchers once they get these guys
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.160]  federalized that is not going to happen they're still going to have it just like you said they
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.880]  just want to have it under under a federal banner so i don't think that's going to help anything
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.040]  now particularly with this case it's officer brello who was involved in the shooting as well as
[48:42.040 --> 48:47.240]  several other officers but he's the guy who's on the line right now back in 2012 they were pursuing
[48:47.240 --> 48:52.280]  some suspect suspects unarmed suspects i might add brello decided to jump on the hood of a car
[48:52.280 --> 48:58.040]  fired multiple rounds five of which were considered fatal and now he's on charts or on trial the
[48:58.040 --> 49:05.880]  charge being manslaughter so it's a very it was a completely just ridiculous scenario to think
[49:05.880 --> 49:10.360]  that you'd have to jump on a hood of a car and fire multiple times at two people who are of no
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.600]  threat to you because if i was involved in some type of incident and i really thought somebody
[49:14.600 --> 49:18.760]  was armed in a threat to my personal safety i wouldn't jump on the hood of a car in front of
[49:18.760 --> 49:23.160]  windshield where they had a clear view of me but that's my personal opinion so right now
[49:23.160 --> 49:27.560]  everybody we've met has been pretty calm pretty peaceful uh haven't had any issues with the police
[49:27.560 --> 49:33.960]  no major road closures that i've seen thus far but we'll continue to monitor the situation out here
[49:33.960 --> 49:39.480]  and see if anything develops that's right and they're talking about uh you know other charges
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.520]  down the road depending on how this court case goes jacari jackson again reporting from cleveland
[49:44.520 --> 49:51.480]  ohio i just clicked you're in the hometown of obama phone lady so i want you guys today to give her

[56:26.840 --> 56:32.360]  let's now get a quick update ahead of the verdict do we know when this verdict set to come out we
[56:32.360 --> 56:39.480]  thought it'd be yesterday today uh what's the word joe biggs joe biggs info wars dot com i'm
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.880]  actually standing outside of the cleveland police headquarters and the justice department where this
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.440]  is all going down uh today is supposed to be the earliest they're going to come out with us now the
[56:48.440 --> 56:53.560]  problem with that is like uh ferguson in november they kept dragging it on remember how they say
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.400]  it's going to be released tomorrow it's going to be released the next day and all that did was give
[56:57.400 --> 57:02.360]  time for these outside agitators that come in get prepared get set up and that's how the city
[57:02.360 --> 57:07.400]  burnt down the best way that they can handle this is to go on ahead pull the band aid off quick get it
[57:07.400 --> 57:13.160]  done get it over with and just move on because if they keep waiting more people are going to come in
[57:13.160 --> 57:18.840]  from la from new york from revcom in chicago and this place is going to get set up and it'll be 10
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.400]  times worse and that's what a lot of people are worried about you know you can't go into a restaurant
[57:23.400 --> 57:29.080]  or an area not hear someone talking about this and for much reason i got intel earlier um from
[57:29.080 --> 57:35.080]  due about how the police department here has told the officers that they're not allowed to take leave
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.080]  or anything like that it's all been canceled all leave all vacations have been canceled
[57:39.080 --> 57:43.160]  it looks like it's on purpose again remember how they ordered to stand down in baltimore and the
[57:43.160 --> 57:47.320]  justice department was running that are there any indicators that this is being justice department
[57:47.320 --> 57:54.440]  handled um at this point in time i'm not sure but i have intel as well that there are people
[57:54.440 --> 58:00.200]  outsiders being bused in uh and they're staying at a holiday in an area called west park it's a
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.840]  suburb outside southeast of clean let's go document that that that's huge news we that's huge news
[58:06.840 --> 58:11.080]  yeah if i can catch the buses and who they're who they're bringing now the police department here
[58:11.080 --> 58:15.480]  the officers here are 100 aware of it i asked them if they knew about this intel they said
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.640]  they're well aware of it but there's nothing being done at this point in time and the word on the
[58:19.640 --> 58:24.440]  street is around three three thirty this afternoon something is going to happen regardless of what
[58:24.440 --> 58:29.080]  comes out with a verdict or anything if it does today something will happen i'll stay there we're
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.800]  back in 60 seconds man you got a lot of information i want to hear more on this and get your take on

[58:52.280 --> 58:56.840]  that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[58:56.840 --> 59:02.600]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus all of our children
[59:02.600 --> 59:08.680]  are hit with modern mind control television music fast food gmo's sugars you name it young humans
[59:08.680 --> 59:14.200]  have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[59:14.200 --> 59:19.320]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[59:19.320 --> 59:23.960]  working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that
[59:23.960 --> 59:28.200]  children would actually like and take we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional

[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:34.360]  shooting of two unarmed black males fatally they set to come out anytime now uh they're busing in
[1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:37.640]  demonstrators i have the article here in fact i meant to give it to you guys to print it's on my
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:42.920]  iPhone from this morning where they're up in uh ferguson protesting the george soros funded group
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:47.320]  at their offices because they quote haven't paid the demonstrators their final payment
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:53.960]  so this is total astroturf joe bigs was getting into that a nice listener just walked up and offered
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:01:00.280]  to get the guy's lunch so we've got listeners right there in cleveland uh ohio uh joe does the
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:08.760]  listener want to say hi to us or is she uh shy of that yeah she's shy she kind of she's carried
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:14.760]  off when we uh mentioned that oh oh so the flyway didn't want to be on tv yeah she didn't want to
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:19.560]  be on tv i mean actually there's a lot of people i went out uh last night to a couple places and
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:23.640]  i just wanted to get the feel of the uh the environment and the the emotion of people about
[1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:28.760]  what's going on and you'd be surprised there were a lot of listeners i mean i went to one bar and i
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:35.000]  was completely bombarded by about 15 people in one area listen four years ago at boulder burger three
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.040]  years ago in england i went out to the bridge whatever it's not london bridge it's the modern
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:47.240]  bridge that goes right across towards big bend and every other person for like 30 minutes with a live
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:52.680]  feed was like alec shones alec shones alec shones and they were british they were scott they were
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:57.800]  irish they were australian basically none of them were americans there's video of this
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:03.320]  half of them were listeners and viewers and we're not bragging that just shows how popular freedom
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:10.440]  is uh joe yeah exactly i mean i sat down and i was ordering a drink and this girl goes hold on
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:15.000]  she goes you work with info wars don't you know i went yeah she goes you're joe biggs and i said
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.800]  yeah she goes man i've been listening to info war since 2010 and she was just telling me all the
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:31.240]  stuff did you behave yourself yeah it's always all right anyways what else did you say so what
[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:35.400]  we're going to try to find out what the news is about what the women were saying let's let's just
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:42.360]  go back i'm joking yeah so the interesting thing is is if we can find out if people are being bused
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:48.840]  in and someone's paying for that then you know that you know this is all another part of the game
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:53.240]  what they're trying to do to escalate this entire thing and one of the things i'm very fearful for
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:58.680]  for cleveland is right now the playoffs begin tomorrow the nba playoffs or whatever the uh
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:05.080]  the east and the western or whatever that is and they start playing atlanta tomorrow in atlanta but
[1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:11.720]  next week they will be back here in town so that'll be tons of people who are in the downtown area
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:17.000]  so if they wait and they push this until next week it could get very bad because it it reminds me of
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.640]  what happened in st louis people going outside of the ballpark uh harassing all the people so
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:26.360]  that's one thing they need to avoid it all costs like i said pull the band-aid off and get it over
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:35.320]  with quickly now the jury have they come to their decision yet or are they holding it
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:40.680]  because i've heard they come to their decision what's what's the details on that that's what
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:45.080]  i've heard so far too that they already pretty much know that's why they uh went on ahead and
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:50.120]  notified the national guard ahead of time just so they could get people in place for whenever
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:54.920]  they're ready to come out and give the information but like i said the longer and longer they play
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:59.880]  the waiting game the more outside agitators come in and then the same thing will happen in ferguson
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:07.000]  it'll just all go to hell well the good news is people are waking up and uh i mean are most the
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.680]  fans uh in the inner city area are most the fans in business districts or is are the listeners
[1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:18.920]  kind of a cross section of society there in cleveland um from the you have different divisions
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.160]  like you have like cleveland heights that area there's a lot of people who watched uh they came
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:27.880]  out last night because they knew were in town uh people from the west side of cleveland as well
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.840]  so people from all over people downtown i mean this whole area people are they watch the show
[1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:37.800]  they're pretty awake to what's going on well you and jacari doing a great job be safe out there
[1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:41.480]  you may end up being by yourself we may have to have josh come relieve jacari because
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:47.400]  he's got to lead that black lives matter for real demonstration against the abortuary
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:52.120]  up there at the death camp up there at uh planned parenthood in south austin right down the road
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:56.920]  from our office thank you joe biggs we'll be watching the live streams then four wars dot com
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:04.360]  it's being called the largest gunfight in weco city history on sunday a biker braw left nine
[1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:09.080]  dead and more than 160 arrested members from five different motorcycle gangs have been charged with
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:13.880]  engaging in organized crime the brawl started in the bathroom of the twin peaks restaurant
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:19.080]  just off i-35 in weco witnesses said it quickly escalated into the bar and then out into the
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.480]  parking lot and that's where shots began to be fired interestingly police were on the scene in
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:28.280]  seconds why well they had the restaurant under surveillance in fact new york daily news reports
[1:05:28.280 --> 1:05:32.840]  that several law enforcement agencies including uniform weco police officers were already outside
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:36.840]  the restaurant as hundreds of gang members converged despite their presence the shootout
[1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:40.920]  ignited with officers returning fire amid the pandemonium sergeant patrick swanton informed
[1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:45.160]  the press that off-duty cops were also on the scene and jumped into help during the fight
[1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:49.320]  aside from the whole story sounding fishy this proves that we need our second amendment more
[1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:53.720]  than ever because even a preemptive massive police presence failed to stop guns from being drawn

[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:27.080]  joining us for the next 25 minutes is tucker carlson a person who needs an introduction
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:32.840]  he of course is a host on fox television in an investigative journalist and pundit
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:38.520]  libertarian i wanted to get him on a few weeks ago we finally have him to talk about just this
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:46.120]  summer of rage the justice department transparently stirring it up george soros and now it's perfect
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:51.000]  timing that he's here today because obama has come out and said we're gonna stop giving military
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  equipment to the police unless they get trained by us well they've been trained by you it's the feds
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:03.720]  both political parties that have helped militarize the police the whole phony drug war all of it so
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:11.720]  it's just more talk from obama then we've got the implosion of hillary we've got the republican
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:19.160]  leadership blocking uh real reform i want to get tucker carlson's take on the climate in this country
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:29.640]  today and how he thinks uh obama will try to basically spend his last year and a half in
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:35.160]  office because everyone's concerned we've seen such lawlessness on the borders such lawlessness
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:41.400]  on the energy lawlessness on all these military operations outside of congress so much is happening
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:46.760]  i think the world is getting a lot crazier right now the economy's slowing massively
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:53.880]  tucker carlson i just threw out a constellation of things but they all kind of orbit together
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:10:00.280]  what do you want to hit on first well first thanks for having me alex it's great it's great to be on
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:05.400]  and um i agree with everything you said and i think you're absolutely right that this is the
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:13.240]  beginning of a of a long ugly season i mean it is like axiomatic among anyone who's around law
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:19.400]  enforcement can tell you that civil disturbances increase as the weather temperatures rise you
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:25.640]  almost never see rioting and cold weather you're telling me that we're going to get through july
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:30.360]  in august i mean hopefully well i hate that's pretty terrible for america but you're not going to see
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:36.360]  another ball tomorrow worse no you likely are and i also agree with you that the president has done
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:41.640]  virtually nothing to make the situation better i think he benefits from it politically i think
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:48.840]  his sympathies are with the looters that seems pretty clear from listening to him and i think it's
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:57.000]  just it's a really really scary mix of of anger and hopelessness and disorganization on the side
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:03.560]  of the cops i will say the one part where i do um i do sort of differ for maybe a lot of conservatives
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:07.080]  is that as i think that there is abuse by the police i don't think most of it is racial
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:11.320]  i don't think most cops are racist at all but i do think some of them are abusive i used to
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:16.520]  cover them i've been hassled by the cops personally and i and i think it's worth reminding law
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:20.440]  enforcement i respect law enforcement i'm on their side fundamentally but i do think it's
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:27.080]  important to remind them from time to time that they are citizens they work for us and that
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:32.040]  politeness and respect are not optional they're required when you deal with the public sorry
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:36.440]  those are the rules tucker carlson of course also founded and heads up the super successful daily
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:41.800]  caller daily caller dot com well absolutely i'm the guy that made four police state films wrote
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:47.320]  a book on the subject because i didn't want to see us degenerate into a third world banana republic
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:53.720]  that said exactly the arrogance of government rolls downhill the militarization of police the
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:59.880]  acid forbiture seizure it's super bad news and i agree the best way to support the police is to
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:07.560]  not just worship them and choose a side but choose the constitution uh but the the the soros people
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:13.080]  are betting it seems everything on social unrest because all they've delivered to inner city poor
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:19.960]  people is double unemployment what blacks had seven years ago and so it's just crazy to see a u.s
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:28.760]  president betting everything on class warfare divide and conquer and it's surreal though to see
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:35.880]  see them trying to sell a federalization of police uh really a new soft civil war in al
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:41.320]  sharpton's new words you know it's just crazy it's it's crazy why do you think they're betting
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:48.520]  so much on this because ethnic politics identity politics work really well it's the fastest way
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:53.800]  to get people out to vote it's the fastest way to divert their attention from your own policy
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:58.760]  failures it's also really dangerous i mean i've been to a lot of countries and the one thing they
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:07.560]  mostly have in common is really really deep ethnic divide which are permanent and dangerous and
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:13.400]  flare up into violence from time to time the thing about a political debate is that it can be resolved
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:17.240]  if you and i disagree on an issue you may convince me or i convince you or the issue goes away and
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:22.200]  we can be friends again if we're divided by ethnicity that's not resolvable that's permanent
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.720]  we're born that way we're never going to change and so we're always going to hate each other and
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:29.880]  our children will hate one another and their children will do the same and you know you see
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:37.000]  how civil wars happen and so the problem with the administration's position which is they want to spend
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.440]  yeah you know violence is bad but i kind of see their point is it's in effect making excuses for
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:47.880]  and therefore encouraging that kind of behavior it's scary i mean they categorize people by race
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:53.000]  in a way that you know you can't even imagine 30 years ago you would have said wait a second
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:58.840]  that's like nazi stuff like they've taken they've taken martin luther king and and and the republicans
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:05.480]  and folks that gave us the civil rights act and they've now inverted it into as you said total
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:12.360]  identity racial politics and now video games almost every movie the new road warrior they kill
[1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:18.920]  every man at the end to create a utopia and it's not surreal they're serious it's not satire
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:26.040]  uh so so now they're really getting more intense on just saying men are bad period this is an
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:31.240]  establishment that is simply trying to balkanize the country and i don't understand what the
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:36.520]  establishment's doing because all it does is fundamentally make the country fail if the
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:42.520]  establishment is already dominating the country and milking it tucker carlsson of dailycaller.com
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:49.960]  why then in your opinion would they be trying to fundamentally destabilize the country well i mean
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:53.800]  because for a couple reasons first of all i don't think they see it that way i don't think the
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:58.200]  president wakes up and says every morning i'm going to destabilize the country but i think there's a
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:05.480]  deep well of resentment there on the left about america you know that america is not as good as
[1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:12.440]  it's been it's as it's proclaimed itself to be they're deeply suspicious of america as an enterprise
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:16.920]  i think it's fair to say so they're smoking their own they're smoking their own leftist dope
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:22.360]  yeah they that's totally right that's totally right and i but i also think again that it's useful
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:27.960]  like when you i mean that's how they campaign and it's also how they govern they divide the country
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:33.720]  into demographic groups and they appeal to each one separately so the idea that you have this
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.560]  melting pot a bunch of people from different places and backgrounds and religions and they all kind of
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:42.200]  come together as americans sharing a common culture that's not the way they see the world that's not
[1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:45.400]  the way they run their campaigns and it's not the way they run the government when they win
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:50.440]  at all they see it as you know the gays and the blacks and hispanics and the women and the men
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:56.120]  and the whites and the you know whatever they see each group as distinct with distinct needs to be
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:16:02.040]  pandered to distinctly and what they don't fully understand is that is fireman you should not play
[1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:07.640]  with that at all that stuff again does not go away it's really dangerous to act that way you should
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:12.760]  de-emphasize differences between groups because those differences are real they're absolutely real
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:18.040]  and that's why you should not accentuate them you should not take it to scale i agree with you
[1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:23.320]  tucker carlson's our guest then where does this go looking at the sociology the history of the
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:29.960]  anthropology of culture i mean undoubtedly i see this backfiring on the establishment i don't know
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:34.600]  what the end result's going to be but i don't see it going the way they want it seems like
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:41.800]  everything they touch is unraveling people aren't buying it anymore uh case in point hillary do you
[1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:47.480]  think she's imploded or is she on the verge of imploding or will she rise like a phoenix from
[1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:52.440]  the ashes because you've got the whole democratic party machine behind her even though they're sick
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:58.440]  of her as well are they really arrogant enough to try to force feed hillary clinton to us well
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:02.120]  the democratic primary is like a soviet grocery store you know you get one choice and you're
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:06.360]  going to like it and you're not going to complain about it that's not allowed i do think there's
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:11.240]  potentially a problem with the establishment on the democratic side hoisting hillary on democratic
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.240]  voters we just don't agree with her on a lot of stuff they're way more to the left than she is an
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:20.280]  economic they're anti-establishment she is the establishment i think in the end you could see
[1:17:20.280 --> 1:17:24.360]  a problem there but for now look i know what they're thinking that i just talked to one of
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:28.760]  the guys who's running the campaign and he said to me really clearly it's about identity politics
[1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:34.360]  she's a woman she's been done wrong by men the majority of voters in america are female and
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:41.240]  all she needs to do is win you know the democratic base and then a few women from the center or maybe
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:45.480]  even republicans who look at her and say you know what i identify her husband she did honor
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:52.120]  she stuck with her she ran against obama she lost but she served him dutifully anyway it's her turn
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:59.000]  and she'll survive having a string of girlfriends and all the corruption and and all the dead bodies
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.840]  and all the cattle gate and and and mcdougal i mean she'll survive the the hundreds of scandals
[1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:09.480]  that have already come well they they're i mean i don't know the answer to that question and i'd
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:15.000]  like to think we live in a fact-based society where you know data actually matter where you
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:20.280]  know like the details about the way someone's lives his or her life are determined how well
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:25.880]  that person does you know what i mean like i don't want i want to just succeed in the wicked to be
[1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:31.480]  punished i mean just like everybody but i suspect that we have been trained as a society not just
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:36.360]  the left but also the rest of us either world in terms of identity politics so it's not really
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:41.240]  hillary quinton she's a woman therefore she stands in for all of them i mean i dare you to
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:46.120]  criticize hillary in public and you get attacked as a sexist i mean i have three daughters and a wife
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:50.200]  i i like women better but still you're guilty you're a man inherently so you're bad and and so
[1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:54.600]  we're talking about identity politics earlier we go to another subject it goes back to that
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:19:02.520]  they have dumbed it down and so this is the triumph of just mindlessness the triumph of of
[1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:10.040]  tribalism of of gangsterism exactly uh and exactly right now now here's the one way hillary loses
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:14.920]  is as you just pointed out there is such deep resentment for the establishment on both sides
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:20.440]  because honestly the establishment is the people who run america are not that impressive that's
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:24.360]  what we've learned they're not they're greedy they're all about themselves they're not actually
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:30.360]  vested in america as an idea this is a generalization there are some some they're not noble
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:37.000]  they're not noble and they're not they're not get all altruistic it's all about them
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.160]  and their advancement and by the way they see themselves as citizens of the world as people
[1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:46.120]  you know if america implode they'll go to stock like they have that's right they want to graduate
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:53.560]  to the global level exactly so but i think but i mean in the end these are contests that are
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:59.160]  determined by the majority like you know actual voters and i think there's so much resentment
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:03.800]  toward the establishment right now you never know what could happen this is the one year that
[1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:08.040]  something totally strange could happen where average voters on both sides say you know what i'm
[1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:12.920]  not you can put the dog you can run a marketing campaign on the dog food and you can dress it up
[1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:17.560]  all you want but i'm not eating the dog food because i just don't like it and that's gonna happen i think
[1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:23.000]  you're absolutely right and i hope the establishment is smart enough that that is the
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:27.880]  different groups in it that are radicalizing things to understand it's a very dangerous path
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:31.720]  but i think you have to know on the head there's a london guardian articles new york times articles
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:38.760]  about elites buying armored redoubts in new zealand uh in luxenberg and monnie carlo in switzerland
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:45.880]  they're globalists they've got huge private jets that they you know fund off of donations to Haitian
[1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:52.920]  kids i.e. hillary and they just have gotten away with so much so long maria and twanette may have
[1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:57.080]  been you know killed when they stormed the Bastille but if she'd had a helicopter on the roof she'd
[1:20:57.080 --> 1:21:02.280]  have been okay and i think that's what this comes down to exactly right exactly the maria and twanette's
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:07.720]  problem was she was stuck in france she couldn't split for the caiman you know she couldn't go to
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:14.680]  namibia and that's the difference between the people so like if you were a monarch in the renaissance
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:19.720]  right or the middle ages or at any time you're basically stuck with the country you presided
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:24.360]  over that you did a bad job you could be overturned and you would be killed like that happened and so
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:28.920]  even you know there was always that backstop that limit where you would be held accountable
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:33.960]  because it was your country and you couldn't leave it now the people in charge not again not all of
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:38.840]  them but i even know people on the right i have a friend who's a conservative is quite affluent
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:42.760]  who was telling me the other day well i'm getting citizenship in a foreign country really you're
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:47.400]  just a very patriotic person like well why are you doing that well so i can punch out if necessary
[1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:52.440]  it's like i don't know where's the stay in fight mentality well that's why i'm always criticizing
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:58.680]  the fbi or the cia or government and then i meet these people there is a wake as i am and they're
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:02.600]  like dude you better get out of the country and i'm like wait a minute i'm not giving up on this
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:08.520]  republic and that's what's sick is we've just like given into the corruption and just decided it can't
[1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:15.480]  be defeated i mean there's nowhere to run long term it's all coming down because because the same
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.400]  globalism where they can escape responsibility same thing that the liberals do at the grassroots
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:28.200]  is allowing them to escape reality just like q e unlimited allows us to escape reality on the
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:35.240]  debts tucker but only so long how long can it go tucker carlson well it's magic alex and you know
[1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:40.920]  that i mean they've suspended the laws of physics if i said i mean there's no reason for there ever
[1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:47.640]  to be a final accounting because you know econ 101 is no longer valid we found a way out and
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:52.120]  that's just print more money and they'll never be a day of reckoning it leaves the calculation and
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:56.760]  you know exactly as well as i with the calculation the people making these decisions figure well i'll
[1:22:56.760 --> 1:23:01.880]  get out with mine or i'll be dead by then or some other generation will deal with it i mean i don't
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:07.640]  know the answer how long but i can tell you i mean read the piece in the new yorker this week
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:12.280]  kind of a crummy magazine it's a good piece though by ted's friend on mark endreason and all the
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:19.000]  tech gurus on sandhill road in around palo Alto the people funding the tech revolution you read
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:26.200]  that and you come away thinking this is so overheated this sector is so over capitalized
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:31.000]  that it's going to crash we're going to see another 2000 the question is when but probably sooner
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:34.760]  rather than later i mean this is just not sustainable it's built on air some of these
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:38.040]  companies are real companies a lot of them aren't and they're still getting a billion
[1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:43.000]  dollar market cap like that that can't go on forever it's it's the herbstein's laws i know
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  you're familiar with if something can't go on forever it won't and that is true daily caller
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:54.440]  dot com tucker carlson it's great to see daily caller out there in drudge report dot com and
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:58.840]  world net daily uh covering a lot of the same issues we cover doing a better job in many cases
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:03.960]  we do a better job and some i'm not in competition i want to save this country i want to have a
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:09.400]  future for my three children i'm not leaving the country i'm not getting an escape plan i am
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:14.840]  doubling down putting everything on the table and then committing to this uh and then if it all
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:20.200]  collapses then maybe if i can get out i will but i don't think that's the case history shows that
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:25.320]  when you really take action and have leadership uh that that you can fix things or at least make
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:29.960]  them better and we are seeing a really big awakening and i think the awakening is going to
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:34.760]  manifest sometimes in strange ways and that's where i wanted to go next with tucker carlson tucker
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:40.920]  everybody knows that i've covered the police state and i've covered military drills and katrina
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:47.000]  gun confiscation you're a newshound i've seen it in the daily caller the military's training and
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.160]  saying yes we've been given orders under obama that the tea party and veterans are the number one
[1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:56.440]  threat that's been in the associated press it's been in forbs we can put the article on screen
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:01.960]  how the pentagon would crush a tea party rebellion all we did was say look at this 10 state training
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:08.280]  drill it lists these every conservative area or libertarian area as hostile and it says they're
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:13.240]  going to be simulating illegal activities with the police and they're doing door-to-door gun raids
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:19.640]  i mean that's happening in other cities right now before jade helm and i've never 10 10 times the
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:24.840]  attacks i've ever seen 10 times conservatively tucker we're talking 200 to 500 articles a day
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:30.600]  lying saying that i said an obama takeover was imminent this summer and he'd take our guns
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:37.320]  i've never seen cbs nbc fox to a certain extent they didn't completely lie they just you know said
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:42.040]  that i was a kook and stuff the point is they're saying why are the senators listening why is the
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:47.400]  governor listening msnbc all of it as a media expert you've worked at you know so many big
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:52.680]  networks launch your own media operation you're i'm gonna call you an insider but you're a libertarian
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:26:00.040]  on the inside it's kind of creepy to see such a wall of coverage i know they say just spell my name
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:05.480]  right but a selfish question what do you think's going on with this level of attack and then what's
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:12.840]  your take on jade helm well because they're look i mean you know as well as i there's nobody in the
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:19.240]  press who is culturally on the same page as you are or i am for that matter there's nobody owned
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:25.960]  the gun nobody goes to church nobody's pro-life i mean you're just looking at a solid wall of
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:31.880]  culture that's different i mean and they just you know they think that anybody who has a gun is
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:37.960]  suspect anybody who you know believes in the second amendment is probably a danger to the rest of us
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:43.320]  i mean the bias on that specific subject that an abortion and religion those actually those three
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:48.600]  subjects it's so overwhelming that you're considered crazy just prime a spaceship or even bringing it
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:53.000]  up by the way you're totally right if they had if congress didn't exist and the way this could
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.760]  do whatever it wanted you wouldn't have a single firearm in your house they'd be complicated you'd
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:02.360]  be in jail for even having you know that they don't want you to have guns period um so i think
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:07.240]  you're right and they play this game where they go no one wants your guns and then you go to their
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:12.760]  violence policy center and they admit their goal is the abolition of civilian ownership well of course
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:18.200]  of course uh there i mean that's not it's beyond debate but let me ask you why do you think they
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:23.880]  flipped out over just our mild coverage of this and misrepresented i mean what does that signify
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:29.560]  and then what do you think of the militarization of police well i think i'm i've always been on
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:35.480]  your side completely with that i think it's ominous i don't you know i have always fundamentally
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:40.840]  been on the cop side you know i believe in order and stability and i i have poor violence but you
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:45.400]  know one of the reasons i've always loved america is that it's not like latin america and that you
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:50.280]  know you walk down the street you don't see people in fatigue with machine guns it's a pretty peaceful
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:56.840]  country you don't need the cops don't need howitzers and tanks and infrared you know attachments on
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:02.440]  their ar-15s and and all the rest like i'm kind of happy to live in a country where the cops carry
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:08.600]  you know snub nose 38 you don't want to live north korea really really don't and i don't think i'm a
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:13.720]  paranoid crap at all and i don't think i'm irrational i just i think it's overkill and i think it
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:18.680]  whips people into a state of fear and it's just absolutely silly what was your dad who ran voice
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:23.560]  of america back when it actually promoted american values what was your dad today think about all this
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:32.600]  uh hey my views on almost everything come directly from him he was the first conservative i ever knew
[1:28:32.600 --> 1:28:36.600]  to say you know what i'm not into having the police of like delta force i don't like that it makes me
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:41.400]  uncomfortable he was also the first person 20 years ago to say you know i don't really like
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:47.240]  this mindless wealth accumulation these people are greedhead and i'm all for the market i'm all
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:51.080]  for capitalism and everything but there's something gross about these finance people who's the first
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:29:00.520]  conservative well that was we just lost tucker carlson um i want to get him back on for five
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:04.360]  minutes to finish this because it's interesting to hear him talk about that yeah and the greedheads
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:11.000]  got their money through derivatives and scams signed us on to it and are now financing civil unrest
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.840]  so we can only have a revolution while they all helicopter off while we kill each other
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:22.120]  i mean it's scorched earth it's like bank robbers setting fire to something you know
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:26.760]  across town while they rob the bank i mean i mean that's all this is and i get the police have
[1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:31.960]  problems and there's serious issues the point is the bad guys are trying to get us fighting with
[1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:35.800]  each other uh these are good interviews with tucker carlson because you can actually you know get
[1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:40.120]  his ideas out and not just be kept down to two minutes on fox news but pretty powerful interview

[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:44.600]  soros and the globalist are taking isolated sad militarized police stories where cops kill
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:52.760]  real innocent people and are turning it into race war fodder it's clearly being done to federalize
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:58.040]  police and to make the feds the saviors and to make everything about racial division and not
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:10.600]  about black unemployment numbers doubling from 7% to over 14% since 2008 highest unemployment
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:21.400]  rate in the country leaked list shows ferguson protesters paid by soros front group hashtag
[1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:27.400]  black lives matter is a phony astroturf movement funded by the establishment paul joseph watson
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:33.720]  just broke at info wars dot com they're now protesting today in front of the soros front
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:39.560]  group in missouri saying soros didn't pay him all the money he only spent 33 million getting it going
[1:34:41.400 --> 1:34:44.440]  this is the guy that wants your guns this is the guy that wants to get rid of the sovereignty
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:49.800]  of the country this is the guy that it got lost past to exempt him from taxes while he and warren
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:57.080]  buffett lobby to get middle class taxes raised because they get banker bailout money just search
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:07.240]  the term mclatchy ap warren buffett was the biggest recipient of bailout money and he wants abortion
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:13.160]  he wants your guns whatever their agenda is it's anti-freedom now we're going to have a
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:18.520]  demonstration in front of the main planned parenthood facility off of ben white in south austin
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:22.200]  we're going to put the address on screen for tv viewers i'll give it out for radio listeners
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:26.920]  and jacari jackson is going to lead it we're going to have a live feed here on the radio
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:32.200]  thursday we'll be checking in with them in the first second and third hour because regardless
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:37.480]  of what your view is on abortion the facts are margaret sanger got awards from hitler
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:43.480]  and gave awards to hitler we have the colgate foundation letter she wrote calling them black
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:48.680]  weeds that had to be exterminated the clan was her biggest supporter planned parenthood is on
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:56.280]  record getting huge donations to target blacks it is set up to kill black people over half the
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:04.600]  black people in this country since roe v wade are not born and we have mark crutcher on the
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:10.360]  broadcast he's american pro-life activist and author he's a founder and president of life
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:16.760]  dynamics and the creator of the documentary motha 21 that gets into the targeting of black people
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:23.880]  for extermination he's from dentin texas he's involved in just absolutely energizing the
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:28.520]  pro-life movement and humanizing these babies whether they be hispanic black white asian
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:33.240]  they're all equal in god's eyes and they've got they need to have a chance to be in the world
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:37.800]  notice the left that's against the death penalty and by the way i don't trust the death penalty
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:42.040]  you can't trust the federal government but i'm fundamentally for the death penalty in the spirit
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:46.600]  of it just not in the letter of it because you can't trust the system i don't trust north korea
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:53.080]  to carry it out but i digress we're going to our guest but then the very same people say it's a
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:58.200]  choice and and i i get it you could argue first trimester i'm against it but you could argue it
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:06.120]  no no no the feminist groups last week called it inhumane not to kill eight to nine month babies
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:10.120]  that could be adopted they don't even tell these women there are foundations that will give them
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:15.400]  30 to 50 thousand dollars for that baby not to kill it that'll put them up in a house while
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:22.760]  they're pregnant get them a job after you go in they counsel you to kill the baby and i get the
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:26.840]  arguments these are poorer people what about their future well if you say everybody's trash
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:32.520]  since we did this what's happened in the black community 15% illegitimacy to over 80% prison
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:37.480]  population has exploded when you write off people and say their garbage they begin to act like that
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:43.400]  now i want to get mark crutcher on to give some of the background on this but
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:47.880]  jacari jackson's going to be out there and i'm asking all pro-life groups to be out there because
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:53.320]  we're going from another angle we're going to have black lives matter signs and point out hey
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:59.720]  george soros over a few dozen black men getting killed every year suspiciously wants you to go
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:05.800]  out in a riot to divert things and then that'll bring in a bigger police state we don't want that
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:11.240]  how about you go and demonstrate and educate black folks on not killing their kids because
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:16.600]  blacks are 13% of the population they're what is it half the abortions of the country i mean it's
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:22.680]  crazy well i guess there's been 55 million abortions 17 million are blacks but in certain years i
[1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:30.520]  know it's half mark crutcher is the expert prolifeamerica.com prolifeamerica.com and remember
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:38.440]  he's got the poll numbers america was brainwashing the 70s and 5050 pro abortion now it's flipped
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:42.680]  it's flipped the other way it's very exciting to give us all the facts is mark crutcher god bless
[1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:47.160]  you we really appreciate you coming on and what do you think of our idea of hijacking the meme
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:53.800]  black lives matter to expose abortion well it's a it's a brilliant idea and i can tell you that
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:01.000]  recently a group of blacks in north carolina did something very similar with tremendous results
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:08.600]  at a black college there and so they've had some tremendous results in this and the black community
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:15.000]  has been lied to and been deceived by you know we're you people like you and i are always called
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.480]  the christian right and i don't have a problem with that as long as we make sure the other side
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:26.360]  is known as the godless left but the godless left has has become the new plantation anyway you look
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:32.920]  at it and you know when you start looking at the numbers you're talking about police departments
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:38.200]  and they go i did some very preliminary figures the other day and i used very conservative numbers
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:42.920]  so what i'm going to tell you is is uh could be actually a lot worse than what i'm going to tell you
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:47.480]  every 17 hours you're talking about police departments
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:53.240]  killing innocent people and no one wants to see that happen i can assure you no one wants to see
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:58.760]  that happen um and i think that the police departments around this country uh do need to have
[1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:04.280]  some some uh more scrutiny put on to them and more oversight put on to them to what is currently
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:12.040]  going on but the fact is if you add up all of the blacks that are killed in a given year by every
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:17.640]  police department in the united states combined you add them all together that's fewer blacks
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:23.640]  than are killed by Planned Parenthood in less than 17 hours every 17 hours Planned Parenthood kills
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:30.280]  more than every police department in this country combined kills in an entire year and yet these
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:37.240]  godless left like Soros and and Buffett and the rest of them and they're and by the way they are pure
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:43.960]  100 ugenesis um i'm writing a new book right now i'm gonna have a chapter in there about what these
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:51.320]  people are doing and it is an absolute obscenity what is going on with people like George Soros and
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:59.960]  and Warren Buffett but blacks need to be paying attention to the fact that they're a big enemy
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:05.240]  even in the situation where you have these rogue police departments that are that are
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:11.560]  not being run properly that's not their biggest enemy their biggest enemy is Buffett and Obama
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:17.320]  and Soros openly pushing targeting blacks and so of course they're acting like their buddies
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:22.840]  saying oh yeah look the cops are bad i'm your friend just just those numbers are so incredible
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:29.480]  well let me give you a real-world example of this and and you always wonder where are the
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:40.120]  race bumps like Jesse Jackson and and uh all the others that are so quick to jump into one of these
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:45.480]  situations Al Sharpton and these guys jump into these situations when they think there's some
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:52.840]  political advantage for them but let me give you a real-world example in 2012 a 28-year-old
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:42:00.200]  african-american young lady goes into a Planned Parenthood facility in in Chicago Illinois
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.200]  now this facility had had some problems with botched abortions and they were very sensitive to
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:10.760]  the fact that when ambulances start pulling up out in the front and the prolifers are out there
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:16.120]  they take photographs of this and and start publicizing the fact that these people are
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:22.120]  botching these abortions this 28-year-old girl named Tonya Reeves goes to this Chicago Planned
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:28.760]  Parenthood they perforate her uterus in the performance of this abortion now perforated
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:34.360]  uterus can be very dangerous but in most cases if medical attention is sought quickly enough
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:40.200]  it can be sutured and no harm will come to the girl other than to perforated uterus
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:44.760]  but because they were sensitive about the fact that they'd already had ambulances pulled up
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:49.320]  out here in the front and there was a PR nightmare to have another one when they perforated Tonya's
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:54.920]  uterus they just rolled her out into the hallway and packed we did what's called a pack off packed
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:43:03.480]  off packed her off to absorb the blood that she she was hemorrhaging they left her there for five
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:13.640]  and a half hours before they called emergency care for her she bled to death 28 years old she bled to
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:21.640]  death if you read the Illinois statute on what's called depraved indifference murder it reads like
[1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:28.040]  it was written for that particular case and yet we call them the Chicago authorities to at least
[1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:32.600]  investigate them for depraved indifference murder they would never even do that well that's what
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:39.880]  i've noticed the abortuaries are are so above the law and i've protested them scores of times and
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:47.000]  i've in different cities and i've never seen police act as aggressive as they do when you're
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:52.760]  peacefully out there protesting them and and that's because the system puts so much pressure on them
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:59.000]  but what about separately four years ago when we got the documents that a major bioethics group
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.960]  in a medical journal said kill kids up to age three now they're saying up to age five now they're
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:09.880]  saying put the veterans uh on do not treat list now we learned that the Watson computers by the
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:14.280]  famous eugenicists who created the Nazi computers that's why the jews had those numbers on them was
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:19.560]  for that computer for those that don't know the hollerith machine now we see what you and others
[1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:25.880]  warned of now it's not just the unborn now it's up to age five now it's the old people now it's
[1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:31.320]  the veterans i mean this is insane what we do to the least of us we do to all of us right
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:37.880]  exactly but here let me ask you this question alex let's imagine that instead of this situation
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:42.440]  with tanya reese they murdered her don't make any mistake about this was not an accident this was
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:46.360]  not medical malpractice they let her sit out there and bleed to death they let her bleed to death
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:50.760]  this would depraved indifference murder they should have been indicted and the and the abortionist
[1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:56.680]  the killer was a white female now let me ask you this question let's say that instead of the
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:03.240]  tanya reese situation a 28-year-old black male had been shot by the chicago police department
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:07.880]  and instead of calling an ambulance for him they allowed him to lie in the street for five and a
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:13.320]  half hours and bleed out the country would burn when george soros and the media hyped it up
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:19.400]  absolutely and this is in the hometown with jesse jackson and jesse jackson has never said
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:26.600]  jesse jackson has never said one solitary word about his buddies at plan parenthood
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:33.400]  murdering tanya reese well you know reverend children's uh and he's coming on demara and he's
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:41.000]  documented a lot of this uh and i brought it up to him being around the pro-abortion community
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.520]  that's led by a lot of black folks or democrats they have said to me many times nobody wants
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:49.960]  these black people these are bad people let's get rid of them we've seen other abortionists
[1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:56.200]  say who are minorities hey nobody wants these ugly black babies this is a statement they make
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:02.760]  how this is the big dirty secret is you have these black managers who actually hate black people
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:07.240]  and are presiding over their execution and then i brought up to children and he goes of course
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:12.200]  that's all i've heard my whole life that's standard so so so they'll call somebody like
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:17.080]  children's and uncle tom because he doesn't want to kill black people when the real uncle tom's
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:23.640]  are the people managing this well that's what i say it's the new plantation you know after the end
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:28.360]  of the of the civil war plantation it was not uncommon for plantation owners to call over
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:33.960]  their slaves together and say okay now you're free you can leave if you want to but um you can't
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:40.040]  really do anything you can't go anywhere you can't get a job in other words you can't make it without
[1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:46.280]  me so if you want to stay around we'll work on shares sharecroppers and um they weren't any
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:50.280]  better off as sharecroppers than they were as slaves and sometimes they weren't as well off
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:54.120]  as they were as slaves not to not to defend slaves the media says we're defending it it's
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:59.160]  historical fact that it was worse in some cases some cases it was worse for sharecroppers and
[1:46:59.720 --> 1:47:05.960]  and what was done to african-american people is a a black eye in american history it's
[1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:11.080]  something we should all be ashamed of and should all try to rectify but to suggest that people
[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:18.040]  like al sharpen and jesse jackson and all these other race pimps have that is their is their goal
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:27.240]  is preposterous they have a goal of making sure that blacks are told that they can't make it without
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:32.360]  the jesse jackson's now sharpens of the world and that's why i call it the new plantation there are
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:37.080]  no al sharpen and jesse jackson are no different than the plantation owners who told blacks they
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:42.200]  couldn't make it without them absolutely i want to put on screen for tv viewers i'll read it out
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:48.600]  for radio listeners when this event is it's this thursday 11 a.m to 2 p.m it's when the show is live
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:54.040]  i'm going to be here in studio directing the live feeds down there so all of you around the country
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:48:03.240]  the world can see it but if you are just pro-life and don't want to see half the black people in
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:11.480]  the country not born then come out there and stand up for reality and point out that they're covering
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:23.960]  up the real genocide 201 east ben white 78704 and again 290 is called ben white that turns into
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:30.840]  71 it's out in east austin but you can't miss it it's just in south austin right off i-35 we're
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:36.760]  just gonna be out on the sidewalk with our signs call the media if they ignore most pro-life stuff
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:41.000]  this is the type of thing they may bite on and then we can take all the soros white house
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:46.120]  just department divide and conquer and bring people together to really save black lives but
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:53.320]  shifting gears mark crutcher of prolife america dot com is with us he syndicates his radio show
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:57.880]  his tv show tell your stations locally to pick it up it reaches millions of people
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:01.560]  i want to talk about some positive things and come back in the next segment let you cover
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:05.640]  whatever you want as a wild card so to me asking the questions but can you talk about some of the
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:12.120]  numbers correct me if i'm wrong we're starting to turn the tide mentally spiritually with america
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:18.200]  especially with young people against uh the the the modern human sacrifice that is abortion aren't
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:23.320]  we absolutely that every and let me tell you something it's not just you and me that are
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:28.600]  recognizing this i can show you quotes from a lot of people in the abortion lobby who are out here
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:34.280]  saying that they're in a crisis situation right now they're in a meltdown situation the public
[1:49:34.280 --> 1:49:38.920]  companion polls are showing the the public is starting to have serious second thoughts about
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:44.840]  legalized abortion more people now label themselves pro-life than pro-choice and i remember going
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:50.680]  through years when sometimes these polls would show three and four five and five times as many people
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:55.320]  telling claiming to be pro-choice than pro-life so we went through the bad times we're now winning
[1:49:55.320 --> 1:50:02.280]  this deal um when i started life dynamics in 1992 uh alex i think i've talked about this on your show
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:08.120]  before there were 2126 freestanding abortion clinics on the day that i started life dynamics
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:14.680]  in 92 today there's about 570 we have closed down two-thirds of the abortion clinics in this country
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:22.440]  permanently during that length of time now that you have a lot of people say well that doesn't
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:27.480]  mean much because what happens is when the abortion train closes women just go to the next clinic
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:32.760]  and that is absolutely completely been proven untrue the united states government has even
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:38.280]  done studies on that showing that that's not true sure if it's 200 miles away it massively cuts the
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:42.680]  facts they're gonna do it and they make it a sacrament a woman's right women that have had
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:47.720]  uh you know are guilty so they defend it the point is abortion is being directed for population
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:53.880]  control and eugenics and adolf hitler was for it people need to understand that we're going to come
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:51:00.760]  back in the final segment for the head of life dynamics communist china freely allows the sale

[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.800]  trouble they're aborting babies up to nine months by the tens of thousands they're coming out in
[1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:28.760]  bioethics journals and pediatric journals saying yeah kill even healthy kids up to age five
[1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:40.760]  this is sick prolifeamerica.com mark crutchers our guests ahead of life dynamics
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:45.320]  undoubtedly this guy and his family and the folks that have supported him have saved millions of
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:52.120]  lives and it's true that as people get older they become more pro-life because they realize it's a
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:57.000]  life they're dealing with it's come out the states are trying to ban the 3d ultrasounds at the malls
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.920]  not because they're dangerous but because they know if you see a 3d you're not going to kill your
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:05.160]  kid that's why when you go in to have a child the main line medical facilities won't show you real
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:11.000]  3d most of them because if there's something quote wrong they want to tell you to abort the baby
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:16.040]  this is all about a medical tyranny trying to manage us they want to force us to take dangerous
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:21.720]  inoculations claim more anti science if we're concerned about some of them but then oh kill
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:26.440]  the baby before it's born though now mark crutcher i want to give you the floor of the last five
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:31.080]  minutes for any other areas that you want to update people on or let people know about
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:36.520]  well again i just want people to be you know you're looking at all this stuff and and it
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:41.640]  it all it is all depressing and sometimes it looks overwhelming but the fact is we're winning this
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:48.680]  battle now as somebody who works in this 24-7 i can tell you the the evidence of this is overwhelming
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:53.080]  and even if you're pro-life and you don't believe that i guarantee you your enemies believe it they
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:56:01.080]  know that we're winning and the technology is favoring us um the uh the american people are
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:07.960]  starting to have real second thoughts about this but the but one of the neatest things is the largest
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:13.160]  and fastest growing segment of pro-life sentiment in this country is among the very young and this
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:19.960]  is what is scaring the the devil out of the of the abortion industry because they realize
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:24.920]  if you have somebody that's 15 in pro-life they're going to be around a lot longer than somebody who's
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:31.080]  80 and pro-abortion so the fact that young people are flocking into the pro-life movement
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:38.040]  in numbers that we've never seen before is um scaring them death what's doing it i mean is
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:43.000]  it just that they are rejecting a whole false paradigm and now they've been lied to or is it
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:48.280]  god touching their heart or is it both it's a combination of a whole bunch of things one of
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:55.240]  them is you got to remember something um alex these kids grew up with sonograms we we've got
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:57:01.080]  people now who are old enough to vote in this country who can go home and and pull out a vhs tape
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:07.560]  or a dvd of themselves as an unborn child so they're having empathy the the humanity hasn't been
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:13.080]  driven from them not yet not yet and it's like when you go on college campuses you know we're
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:18.760]  here in dentinwood university in north texas if you you go on most college campuses and you
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:26.040]  perceive them as a hotbed of ultra leftist ideology marxist ideology but if you if you
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:32.040]  start breaking it down what you see is that it's the professors that have this ideology not the
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:35.800]  kids and the young people know they're under it in the last minute we have some certain
[1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:41.880]  a backfire do you agree with me it's backfiring it is backfiring and my daughter is uh getting
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:47.320]  her masters at north texas and and uh she and her roommate both graduated from there is undergraduates

[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:37.480]  funds the abortion industry they're all part of that same eugenics group uh they tell you
[2:00:37.480 --> 2:00:42.040]  you can drink it it's not true uh that's being removed all over the world that's a big victory
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:46.120]  people are waking up to vaccines and saying no that's a big victory people are waking up all
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:51.640]  over the world saying no to abortion that's a big victory uh it's not a choice because there's a
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:58.360]  person inside of you and they use the argument of rape and stuff like that uh you know the one
[2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:04.280]  in a million to to to distract or the life of a mother if there's a medical procedure to save
[2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:08.360]  the mother and the baby doesn't make it it's not called abortion so they just change all these
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:14.280]  definitions around mark crutcher of pro-life america dot com and the next four or five minutes we
[2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:20.680]  have thanks for staying with us how do you expect the death mill the death culture the eugenicists
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:26.360]  because they're losing the culture war to common sense how do you expect them to fire back i mean
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:32.280]  we see them tripling down on propaganda but that seems to be making people uh basically revolt where
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:40.360]  do you see this fight going well they're already in that fight back mode because they they are sensing
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:44.520]  that they've lost the cultural war they're losing that war and they don't know how to turn it around
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:50.760]  but what they're doing now is looking more toward coercion you're seeing situations where
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:57.800]  states are now taking up legislation california just took it up to require for example crisis
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:03.160]  pregnancy centers to give abortion referrals they won't have any choice so you'll have somebody
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:07.480]  that a crisis a pro-life or a crisis pregnancy center that then has to give her an a referral
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:13.720]  for abortion if the if the woman says that's what she wants um you're seeing now them working in
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:19.000]  medical schools to force medical students to to do abortions if you take a rotation at the local
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:23.640]  planned parenthood death camp or you don't graduate from medical school we're already seeing that happen
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:28.440]  so they're trying to make you join the cult kind of like gangsters will go out and have to rob an
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:33.240]  old lady to become made members or kill a you know convenience store clerk now you've got to go out
[2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:40.040]  and cap some kids if you want to be able to get your full degree exactly and you're seeing uh for
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:44.680]  you know just the issue of government funding of abortion it wasn't that many years ago that the
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:49.000]  abortion lobby was out here lying through their teeth saying look we understand if you don't want
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:53.480]  to pay for uh abortion that you shouldn't have to do that but then you can't tell me i can't have an
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:57.400]  abortion if i'm willing to pay for it so as long as you're not paying for it it's none of your business
[2:02:57.960 --> 2:03:03.560]  now they're saying that we have an obligation that you and i have an obligation to purchase an
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:09.160]  abortion for someone else hey i live in travis county where they take part of the property tax
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:15.800]  and pay for abortions yeah you've got austin texas you know and of course austin has been
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:20.040]  an embarrassment for the state of texas for many many years it's the moscow and the brazos down there
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:27.160]  but um where the city council was at one point was i don't know if this is still true but they
[2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:32.760]  were the only city council in united states that was using city money to pay for abortion yes yes
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:37.320]  and the county does it too yeah the county does it too but there may be others around the country
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:42.040]  that are doing it now i don't know but there was a point and just a few years ago when when austin
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:46.920]  texas was the only city in the united states paying for elective i remember i know it's sick
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:51.400]  so so that's how they're going to strike back is just ordering it through fraudulent law
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:57.000]  and and using taxpayer money through coercion what i mean look at the history of the world
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:05.160]  since since world war two um alex what have communists or marxists done in any country that
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:09.880]  they could not take over internally they took over they took it over through force and through
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:15.640]  violence that's right that's the way these people operate and you know one of the things
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:20.840]  that's interesting about that is i'm not saying this would happen in this situation but it certainly
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:25.960]  could because these people worship death so much but if you look at countries that have fallen to
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:31.160]  communism over the years they always had internal people helping them the communists called them
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:38.120]  um useful idiots that would help them take over a country and what did the communists always do
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:45.720]  the second they took over a country they executed all those people that's right these people love
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:50.840]  death and they use death as a weapon and i've always said that the closer we get to victory
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:55.400]  the more violent our enemies are going to become that's right the evidence of that all over the
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:02.360]  country mark god bless you great job thank you sir here are some stories breaking now on info wars

[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:53.880]  you the source of these articles look at what just came out in the last few weeks us lowers
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:58.120]  fluoride levels and drinking water for a first time in 50 years cutting it in half
[2:09:58.680 --> 2:10:04.520]  citing the cancer the tooth decay brain damage it does everything they say it stops
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:11.000]  that's london guardian bermuda suspends glyphosate ridden monsanto roundup bunch of other countries
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:17.640]  have done it as well the last week usda develops new gmo free certification and label for foods ap
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:24.360]  why gmo labeling may finally win voters approval in colorado and oregon she couldn't get the states
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:30.520]  to do it so now they're having to cave in at the federal level continuing roundup weed killer has
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:36.120]  probable carcinogen u n says they now have human studies folks they test on rats because rats have
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:45.000]  the same nervous systems as we do rats are pigs and that's why they've used them for over a hundred
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:53.320]  years they know that it kills rats it kills us okay continuing the supreme court won't stop them from
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:57.880]  suing farmers but more and more monsanto for the first time is losing in court before they were
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:04.760]  undefeated we've got a move though with them counter striking with forced inoculations but
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:10.920]  that's getting beaten back in many areas of the country so the battle is joined and a lot of really
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:17.000]  good things are happening a lot of bad things are happening but we're on the march the empire is on
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:25.960]  the run and we see every week or every couple days actually a major from chipotle to mcdonald's
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:34.840]  to tyson chicken to drier's ice cream just every couple days huge fortune 500 companies
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:39.880]  the big cereal makers coming out saying we're getting rid of the addams we're getting rid of
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:42.920]  the dyes we're getting rid of the genome os we're getting rid of the hormones we're getting rid of
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:49.800]  the growth hormone doctor group what's happening right now is this the tipping point and what do
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:55.160]  you expect the enemy to do to strike back it is the tipping point because we're watching it every
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:12:01.480]  single day and it's because everybody is educating themselves i mean it's it's becoming mainstream
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:06.280]  from everything that you're out there saying uh even some mainstream news agencies are reporting
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:14.280]  on it now it's in major newspapers uh moms at schools there's a fight because nobody's getting
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:19.240]  better they're understanding they're looking at the childhood disorders adhd adhd they're linking
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:25.160]  them to chemicals food dies they're seeing the negative effects the cancers that are being caused
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:29.080]  from all the chemicals the glyphosates the herbicides the so extremists don't like having
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:33.480]  brain damage their dead kids and people don't like dying or being debilitated and they can now
[2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:37.240]  read the thousands of studies and discover what happened yes like mass consciousness everybody's
[2:12:37.240 --> 2:12:41.800]  starting to wake up i mean that's the good news that we could sit here and actually report
[2:12:42.520 --> 2:12:48.440]  that the u.s government is actually lowering fluoride that the government is is now requiring
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:53.720]  labeling on gmo's that glyphosate people have signed thousands upon thousands of people have
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:59.800]  signed petitions to ban glyphosate so it's it's the people it's everybody out there that's actually
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:04.360]  standing up once and for all is what we've been talking about i mean i probably signed four or
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:11.240]  five petitions a week uh but now it's got to the point with social media the internet people
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:16.200]  sharing these things that the and not just saying hey these things are bad but actually
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:21.160]  sharing the proof the clinical trial the problem is they're striking back internet kill switches
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:28.040]  censorship black op disinformation they're coming after you me the food babe everybody else
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:32.600]  but that's only making people realize how real the fight is and they're only intensifying their
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:38.840]  actions so it's beautiful and i feel so honored to be even involved and i don't feel worthy to
[2:13:38.840 --> 2:13:43.880]  have a platform this big but all the praise goes to god i just ask god to lead god and direct me
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:50.440]  this is an epic time a legendary time dr group to be alive what do you expect to happen next now
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:57.000]  that clearly we're reaching the tipping point well you can actually see them firing back i mean with
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:02.680]  the mandatory vaccinations that are happening um they don't want to lose this control they don't
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:07.480]  want to lose the the chemicals people aren't buying but i but that only validates what we say when
[2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:11.960]  they're forced to take the right out when they're forced to try to force inoculate i mean that's
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:17.480]  that's really waking people up right i mean there was thousands of people in california lined up
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:23.160]  outside of the building for sb 277 and now in texas there's a big fight for all the forced
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:29.160]  mandatory vaccinations and that's just one issue but it all comes down to people are actually standing
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:34.680]  up and people are realizing the dangerous effects of all of these chemicals and we're learning that
[2:14:34.680 --> 2:14:40.760]  when we fight it's fun we get stronger the enemy gets weaker because when you have the moral spiritual
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:45.960]  high ground as dr martin luther king said justice the universe bends towards justice
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:52.040]  and people are understanding that the in this even goes into the pharmaceuticals i mean people
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:58.840]  every single day are actually getting themselves off of pharmaceuticals because they feel horrible
[2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:02.760]  every time they go to the doctor the doctor wants to put them on another one or two or three
[2:15:02.760 --> 2:15:08.200]  pharmaceuticals from the symptoms that the ones they're on have caused and i get calls all the time
[2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:14.680]  with people are just like i'm sick and tired of being sick what can i do to get off these pharmaceuticals
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:19.720]  i'm not getting better i'm only getting worse and all it's contaminating my liver which these
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:25.560]  pharmaceuticals do most farm and then because of the mental illness that they that the pharmaceuticals
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:30.040]  caused because of the fluoride and everything else in there they're going to the psychiatrist's
[2:15:30.040 --> 2:15:34.120]  office and getting on anti depressants or anti anxiety or anti psychotic yeah i've talked to
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:36.840]  medical doctors and others on air that have broken the standard remember you were the first
[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:39.960]  tell me about this like six seven years ago i was well i was reading an article on your website
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:47.800]  about it that they know that the glyphosate goes in as a pesticide kills the good bacteria the
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:53.800]  bad ones can still live in the toxic environment and then you don't produce the melatonin other
[2:15:53.800 --> 2:15:59.480]  things uh that and and the serotonin that you need and you're totally depressed right i've
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:03.560]  done extensive research into the gut health obviously because that's the first exposure
[2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:08.280]  point to all the toxins that actually cause every single symptom in disease including
[2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:14.920]  i call it mental illness but really if you look into it there is no such thing as mental illness
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:19.720]  the dsm was created by psychiatry and the pharmaceutical companies just to sell you
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:25.960]  more medications and if you look at the root cause of disease which is what our job is the root
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:34.760]  cause of all depression anxiety bipolar any type of brain dysfunction is not a chemical imbalance
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:40.280]  in the brain it's a chemical it's chemicals that you're taking in through the food and the
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:45.640]  beverages and everything else that are altering well more and more they admit that most schizophrenics
[2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:50.040]  actually when they test their blood have high lead and mercury which they knew 200 years ago
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:54.360]  this one was going crazy they say you're mad as a hatter because people that worked in the
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:59.080]  hatteries it was done with lead and mercury they were crazy right right so all these toxins and
[2:16:59.080 --> 2:17:03.320]  chemicals that are entering through the intestinal lining 80 percent of your immune system is in
[2:17:03.320 --> 2:17:08.520]  your gut destroy the gut leak into the bloodstream is very simple i mean that's the root cause of
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:14.680]  all disease uh and and as well it's the root cause of all mental conditions as well where they can
[2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:18.920]  come on the back end with no definitive diagnosis that's why there's never any blood tests for
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:25.240]  depression or anxiety never any urinalysis tests they can't determine any type of mental illness
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:33.320]  from x-rays or CAT scans although now they want to diagnose mental illness in the womb using
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:37.240]  certain type they actually first said that in the british government about eight years ago it's in my
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:42.600]  film in game and people don't believe it they say they want to start drugging children in the womb
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:49.240]  claiming that the parents are predisposed to be mentally ill right and and giving females that
[2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:55.080]  are pregnant not only flu shots but which which contain mercury which alter the brain the heavy
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:18:00.920]  levels of aluminum that people are consuming every single day p bpa estrogen endocrine
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:06.920]  disrupting chemicals i mean it's just a slew but the good news is it's actually fun to report good
[2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:11.800]  news i mean you know how many times we said oh my gosh and you can look in the news and actually
[2:18:11.800 --> 2:18:17.960]  see some of these things changing i mean this is the best time but it's also a time where they
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:23.640]  understand that you know the the globalists understand what's going on and there's more
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:27.240]  chemtrails in the air and there's and they realize we're not backing down and their own
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:31.000]  minions that were compartmentalized are now researching what we say and finding out they're
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:35.640]  being screwed over as well i think there's really an awakening now a lot of people i talked to
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:40.120]  were going to come back and go to calls dr group those say they are feeling a lot of anxiety they
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:44.360]  feel like something bad's about to happen i've been feeling that and past times in my life when
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:49.880]  i feel like that something big does happen uh but i wasn't really sharing this other people
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:54.200]  were sharing it with me people that don't listen to the show were sharing it i put a video out
[2:18:54.200 --> 2:19:01.480]  yesterday that's gone viral uh you know something you know big is about to happen is it just anxiety
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:06.200]  that i'm feeling as other people wake up because they're scared you know there's a six sense connection
[2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:11.720]  uh or is it because we're picking up on all the wars how much danger we're in what is it
[2:19:13.320 --> 2:19:18.680]  i think it's kind of the collective consciousness it's it's funny you you say that because a lot of
[2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:23.000]  even a lot of the comments on your video are saying you know we've been feeling the same thing too
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:28.040]  and i actually told anthony when i came in today i said it's really weird i've been having like
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:32.520]  anxiety in the middle of the night just waking up with anxiety i mean like something's about to
[2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:36.520]  happen and i didn't even know that i was talking about no i didn't even know i didn't even know
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:41.480]  you didn't know people people at restaurants i hear people talking they're like something's wrong
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:46.200]  something's wrong yeah you can feel it what do you think it is i i don't know i mean i don't know
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:51.880]  what it is but you get the state of like something big is about that and we we've got this i mean

[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:27.480]  something repeatedly you just told me during the break well i was i was actually down in
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:32.280]  mexico for the last week on a vacation with a little bit of work but i was i was looking and
[2:24:32.280 --> 2:24:36.760]  meeting with and studying the mayan culture and looking for medicinal herbs down there that could
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:43.000]  grow here in texas and uh so i was kind of relaxing and doing some research at the same time and it
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:47.240]  started about a week and a half ago to where i just i've been having this feeling and kind of this
[2:24:47.240 --> 2:24:51.800]  anxiety i'll just wake up in the middle of the night started about three weeks ago for me everybody's
[2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:55.640]  in the last two to three weeks yeah last two or three weeks and then this morning when i pulled
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:24:59.640]  up anthony was outside and i got out of my car and i was like you wouldn't believe what happened to me
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:05.400]  i had this weird night and i woke up two or three times and i just had this anxiety that
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:11.080]  something's gonna happen and he goes really i did too and then we got in and i was sitting down in
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:16.920]  his office and buckley came in and buckley says something out wow that video alex did is is gone
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:24.040]  viral and i was like what video did alex do and then he said well he did a video that he just had
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:27.640]  this feeling that something's gonna happen with the earth and i said oh that's wild that's what
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:31.880]  happened that's what's been going on with me it's almost like there's gonna something's gonna happen
[2:25:31.880 --> 2:25:37.880]  with the earth or uh there's gonna be this major change or or something that's gonna happen but
[2:25:37.880 --> 2:25:41.240]  well i mean we're having record earthquakes a ring of fire is going crazy something like
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:45.480]  15 four volcanoes are going off right now and i mean i've had this feeling before
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:52.840]  and i get mugged you know in an hour uh or i've had this feeling before and then a car
[2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:58.520]  runs a red light and hits me you know 10 minutes later this is way more intense it's sustained
[2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:03.400]  it's almost like a uh and i'm a pretty calm person and i meditate but it's almost like a
[2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:09.080]  sustained it's like an anxiety that goes it's almost like a wave form or something that's coming
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:15.320]  in exactly this is like oh oh and i could but the reason i started talking about it is i hear
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:23.240]  other people talking about it yeah they don't even listeners right i i know it's it's you know i i
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:26.680]  take you know they might have turned on something with harp right they should that can manipulate
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:31.640]  them oh who knows what the stuff they're doing ah it's a mystery i can tell you this the the amount
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:36.440]  of rain that the the belt that's been going down around huntsville and living in lake Livingston
[2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:41.480]  and stuff like that 500 year floodplain our farm is over there we have a biodynamic farm and it's
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:49.320]  the it's so high over there it's the the harm in some of the creeks and the river's over there 40
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:53.880]  feet above normal i mean this is something they've never seen before so i mean i think there's
[2:26:53.880 --> 2:26:59.000]  definitely some weather modification there's really weird stuff going on in texas right now
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:05.560]  now with the force vaccination stuff with the with the shootings that are happening with jade
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:11.880]  helm i mean it's almost like there's this weird energy bubble or something that's going over texas
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:16.600]  i even got these weird for the school where my kids go to school sent home these weird government
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:22.440]  forms saying that we need to have all your school your kids vaccination records sent in by the 15th
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:28.040]  of next month or something like that it was like some weird organization on their bold print the
[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:33.160]  school sent them home to us they said you have 15 days to submit all these to us i know this happening
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:38.520]  because i talked to doctors no i know it's crazy and everything's just coming out in the open now
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:45.560]  too right so is it earth changes you know rats again pick it up the day before earthquake and get
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:51.880]  all excited having excited that's been proven or is it uh the these wars are trying to start is the
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:58.520]  hadron collider is it something harps doing is there something in the food uh i mean what is it
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:02.840]  i don't know is it the mass awakening and we're just feeling the public's anxiety
[2:28:05.400 --> 2:28:09.560]  i guess we'll have to wait and see i mean it's it's it's definitely something whenever i feel
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:17.080]  like this has only been a few times i felt like this before 9 11 i did too i told people about
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:21.000]  that before it happened yeah and so i said call the white house they're gonna blow up the world
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:25.640]  trade center but i mean your new list or this video on youtube folks is i'm not joking there
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:31.720]  really is like a high negative energy and there's a high positive energy that's colliding it's
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:36.040]  like a battle that's it's like a battle it's just like i'm not even scared i'm more like ah like
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:40.120]  like it's like you've been waiting for this to happen almost like it's like this is finally
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:45.880]  happening who's gonna win the the the negative or the or the positive i think that's what's
[2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:51.160]  happening is evil's coming out of the gates and the goods rising against it definitely
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:56.600]  goods riding against it i mean more and more people are when you're healthy inside and you
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:29:02.680]  start decalcifying your pineal gland and you start waking up because really we're the most awake
[2:29:02.680 --> 2:29:09.400]  like the garden of eden adam and eve where they were some completely pure pure water pure food
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:17.800]  detox bodies you become awake your pineal becomes you know active again the more and more people
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:21.800]  that are turning you know it's like the hundredth monkey phenomenon once you get to a certain point

[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:35.560]  we feel the overall pain that's going on and it's been proven just like in a room when you
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:39.080]  know somebody's looking at yet you turn around sure enough they're looking at you and you don't

[2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:47.880]  your minds just touched and it's exciting when you realize that that's going on well there there's a
[2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:54.920]  lot unseen happening and now is the time to be awake to be vigilant no one should be bored right
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:59.800]  now dr ebbard groups are guests here i'm alex jones your host we're gonna antoine zach
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:04.840]  rose michael anthony and others antoine in california you're on the air for your questions
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:10.840]  for dr ebbard group go ahead yeah hi alex you how you doing good sir go ahead
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:16.680]  yeah i was looking at allergic reactions to iodine and it says some people have higher
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:22.440]  first sensitivity to iodine and i was wondering because i'm allergic to shellfish and that day
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:28.360]  and that's in a lot of seafood i was wondering if i had an allergic reaction to it or do you
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:32.840]  know anything about uh if people can have an allergic reaction well i want him to answer that
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:38.280]  but that's why we say consult your physician uh before taking it we haven't gotten any reports of
[2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:43.400]  that uh that we uh know we have a folder for each supplement if we do get reports but we
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:49.320]  haven't gotten any reports uh with any of the products of allergic reaction but is it iodine
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:54.920]  in fish that makes people have a reaction or shellfish dr group that's a controversial subject
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:35:01.400]  i believe with working with thousands upon thousands of patients that it's not the iodine
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:06.840]  that is causing the allergic reaction it's actually other constituents in the shellfish
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:12.360]  now with that being said again like alex said uh always consult with your health care practitioner
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:17.560]  but there's a difference also in the different types of iodine that are out there there's potassium
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:23.960]  iodide i mean iodine in itself coming from the earth is a toxic compound what i recommend people
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:29.080]  do in that case um from the people that i've worked with is you can you start off with just a
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:35.880]  drop but make sure that you're using a good detoxified form of iodine like the x2 you can
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:39.800]  start off with a drop on your skin see if you have a reaction you know you might want to make
[2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:43.880]  sure that you're by a hospital or something like that that's and you're not saying you consult your
[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:48.280]  health care provider first but yeah that's what you do first you would just uh test it on the skin
[2:35:48.280 --> 2:35:52.840]  exactly then a little bit under the tongue maybe one drop under the tongue and personally i haven't
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:57.400]  had anybody that's had a reaction that's not to say you know everybody's different everybody's
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:02.760]  biochemistry is different that doesn't mean you might not have a reaction but what i have seen
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:08.520]  is people that avoid shellfish are extremely deficient in iodine and that's and that's an
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:15.560]  issue that uh they start having other problems because they're told that iodine's a natural
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:19.560]  compound i mean it's very hard for the body to be allergic to something like that explain the
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:24.280]  different types though and how ours is different well you have the raw iodine from the earth and
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:28.520]  that's the crystalline form which will out gas and then you have the potassium iodide and you
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:34.360]  have different types of iodine salts and the difference is the processing that it goes through
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:40.200]  to make it into a usable form inside the body so your body doesn't have to break it down and
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:45.640]  utilize it and so it can utilize it why does why does our iodine that you help secure and develop
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:50.840]  turn bright blue electric blue other iodine's turn red or black but then in the periodic table
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:56.760]  in the books true iodine is purple blue right well because we're the only one that are is that's
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:01.880]  using the pure iodine crystals we're not taking it from kelp which is damaged by Fukushima and with
[2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:06.840]  all the radiation so it's contaminated with all the plasticizers and everything else in seawater
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:11.320]  you know those other chemicals when you take that from the kelp which most people take the iodine
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:15.640]  from you have a a slew of other chemicals in there and they're not processed we have the lab
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:19.960]  test the iodine has nothing in it it's it's completely clean i mean this is about as clean as
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:29.480]  you can get this is 99. you when you buy iodine you can buy 96 percent 97 98.5 98.8 usp british
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:35.880]  pharmacopia and then you can get a high high high grade iodine which is the 99.9 percent and that
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:42.360]  just means that it might if it's 99.6 you have a 0.4 percent contaminants in there no one is going
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:47.560]  to clean that stuff out of there and that's that might lead to some sort of reaction and that's why
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:52.200]  some people with shellfish allergies that have taken over the calendar iodine might have we're
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:57.720]  going to jump the next person thank you antwan hope that helps you out let's go ahead and talk to
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:04.520]  rose in illinois you're on the air with dr group go ahead rose hi i had a question for
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:12.280]  dr group and i also had a story about vaccine brainwash um so my question is i've chronically had
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:21.640]  a block sinus um since i can remember and i went to the doctor but the doctor didn't find anything
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:30.200]  hello yes ma'am yes okay so for block sinuses that could be a couple of different things it could
[2:38:30.200 --> 2:38:36.360]  be that you're you're having an allergic reaction to maybe you know secreting extra mucus up in there
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:42.520]  a lot of times though with chronic block sinuses you have these ethmoid bones that move out of
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:46.600]  position and there's actually a procedure where they'll insert a little balloon up into your
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:51.560]  sinuses and blow it up and they'll readjust those bones it's one of the best things i can't
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:55.320]  remember what the procedure is called but you could probably type in joe rogan's done and others
[2:38:55.320 --> 2:39:03.400]  if you especially uh say that again i believe it's called balloon sinusoplasty balloon sinusoplasty
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:08.520]  and joe they removed like a huge scar tissue growth his voice changed he quit stirring
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:12.040]  breath better some of the folks in the office have had it done and they say we've had your
[2:39:12.040 --> 2:39:17.640]  nose broken in car accidents or whatever most people have that all smashed yeah it's an amazing
[2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:22.120]  it's amazing procedure we were doing some research probably three years ago or so on it and talking
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:26.920]  to some people and they all had great success and not only does it correct the sinuses they
[2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:32.120]  notice increased memory from it because there's pressure on the brain you know because usually
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:36.600]  when those bones move out of position you also have the tendency to catch more flus and you're
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:41.400]  sick and it's the neurological system in your face gets a little bit sure so man what specifically
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:47.480]  was your question rose um yeah so my question was what to do about that however i do know someone
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:51.720]  who had a balloon sinusoplasty and they had a horrible experience and it didn't help well
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:54.840]  sure we've just heard positive and those are medical doctors you know we're not we're not
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:58.600]  selling that it's just that the folks i know that have done it really really liked it but i'm sorry
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:06.120]  they had a horrible experience um what was your a vaccine story oh so i was speaking to a friend
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:11.480]  the other day and i was trying to inform her about the mmr vaccine about some of the data that came
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:18.680]  out about it and how dr andrew wicksfield's partner was exonerated and she told me that
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:24.840]  even if vaccines were linked to autism she would rather her child have autism than get the measles
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:30.200]  off which hasn't killed one person in 20 years in the united states so as this person said i'd
[2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:35.720]  rather my daughter or my child or son have autism and be in diapers when they're 30 then
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:42.520]  get some red spots on them in a fever for one day that's i mean you know that's just the uneducation
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:50.280]  of people out there i it doesn't take long when i tell people listen don't believe me go do your
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:56.440]  own research i mean you can type in vaccine danger and pull up a massive list of documented
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:01.640]  scientific facts for that matter you can go to the cdc and uh website and it talks about the dangers
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:05.480]  of the ingredient but then they go on the news and say never hurt anybody there's no side effects
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:09.480]  they have a secret court to cover it up what did you say to this person when they said this to you
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:16.760]  i was just in shock and i said you know the measles isn't really a deadly disease for young
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:22.600]  children and she said no i'd still rather my child have autism yeah well that's a person that submits
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:26.840]  to the system so much that it's their god and if they told her to sacrifice her child a molex
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:30.520]  she might do it thank you for the call it's it's there's always been people like that throughout
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:35.400]  history uh you you you had one of your patients or friends or something to call you with a story
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:39.480]  last week and i think we have their number so so we're going to call them a pretty interesting
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:43.640]  story about medical tyranny so let's get that personal line we'll introduce them next after
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:50.520]  we've talked to zack uh in north carolina zack you're on the air go ahead hey uh how's it going um
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.240]  i originally wanted to call in and talk about like tooth fillings with the mercury amalgam
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:42:00.600]  and the bpa and what are some good alternatives but um actually it's funny that y'all started
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:04.920]  talking before the break about you know all this anxiety and stuff going on and um yeah because
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:09.720]  i'm somebody that doesn't have anxiety when there's riot police in new york beating people in front
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:14.840]  of me and i go to jail i mean i don't sit around having anxiety and when i start having anxiety
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:19.560]  you better believe something's about to happen yeah um my buddy sent me a text over the weekend and he
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:26.360]  was like look up you know september 23rd 2015 prophecies and man i did and you know i didn't
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:31.880]  get freaked you know worried about y2k or 2012 or anything but um you know with with this jade
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:36.360]  helm stuff going on it's just you know i looked at like the first video on youtube about the
[2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:41.080]  about that date and i've read a few more things about it and it's just i don't know
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:46.120]  have you have you heard about is some video out there it's like the french some french
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:51.400]  minister with with john carrey said we have 500 days to avoid climate chaos and that was like
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:56.840]  you know exactly till september 23rd they got the stern stuff in switzerland and jade helm
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:00.680]  going on i've always said they can launch the secretary of defense cohen said they have
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:04.760]  weather weapons and tectonic weapons they're partially declassified they can launch weather
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:10.040]  weapons say is from global warming to pass the global carbon tax and out of that global crisis
[2:43:10.040 --> 2:43:15.320]  build their world government yeah i mean i've actually been sent multiple videos about september
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:21.880]  23rd and september 24th about yeah anything from the rapture to meteors um it's it's very
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:26.120]  interesting stuff actually i was i was looking at some of the videos on there and there's people
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:32.280]  that have actually broken it down with biblical but i'll say this in my experience whatever
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:37.880]  the when i have six cents before it doesn't tell you what it is yeah and so i'm very suspect of
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:42.040]  people who have absolute specifics and then they say oh we said this was gonna happen it didn't
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:47.000]  happen all i know is i'm sitting around restaurants the gym wherever in the office and somebody's
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.920]  like yeah my uncle's real freaked out never has been i think something big's about to happen and
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:54.520]  you know another guy comes in and goes mad i'll have these really bad dreams i know i've known
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:44:00.040]  this guy for 10 years welden he said something big's gonna happen uh i mean i just you walked in
[2:44:00.040 --> 2:44:04.440]  saying it today i mean i'm something i mean i've never seen anything like it i mean you know i was
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:08.600]  just telling alex this is something you know i i think something's gonna happen probably within
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:12.440]  the next three weeks or so is kind of what i'm feeling that might change i don't know but i also
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:17.480]  said you know from now until the first week of to the end of the first week of october
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:22.840]  is uh something might happen again but yeah regarding your dental uh it could just be earth
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:26.680]  changes though because we have these magnetic cells in our brain that pick up magnetic lines
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:31.320]  they've proven that maybe something good it's gonna happen i mean who knows i mean i mean the
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:35.880]  but the earth tectonically is moving a lot there's earthquakes all over the world now
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:41.880]  including in the middle of the us so we're picking that up it's just we our brain picks it up and then
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:47.400]  but we but it's like a sensor we don't know why we're getting upset well somebody said they drew
[2:44:47.400 --> 2:44:52.520]  a straight lines from the volcano that went off in chili exactly to the place where the earthquake
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:57.400]  was in napal did you hear about that i did i saw the map something like that i mean who knows what's
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:02.360]  going to be thank you so much zack uh let's talk to i i think your friend who is is this a list
[2:45:03.560 --> 2:45:08.280]  actually you guys are sponsoring him he's been a long time info wars fan and he just called me
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:14.680]  for some health advice lately and i was uh in shock with his story and and basically you told him
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:22.840]  what to do so his name is tele blackwood he was a wrestler oh i know him by us sponsoring him uh he
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:27.880]  said i didn't know who you were getting on uh he's a famous actor and also a famous wrestler
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:32.520]  and then he also got his video banned uh for criticizing michael more but it got restored
[2:45:32.520 --> 2:45:37.720]  when i had like four or five million views wherever it was and so uh he went through a medical
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:42.280]  attorney so so i know who this is yeah and by sponsor he says he loves the products but he
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:47.480]  hasn't become a spokesman yet for him he has lost a bunch of weight uh so tele blackwood is on whether
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:51.400]  she's been able to call in i just think you had somebody with a testimony tell us about the medical
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:58.840]  tyranny uh sir well the medical tyranny here we go well last thursday well not by decision i came
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:05.800]  down with tonsillitis and stroke throat luckily and i went to the hospital and he did the test

[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:48.760]  is an endocrine disrupting chemical so it breaks down the product so so basically it's concentrated

[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:49.480]  talk to you guys i have a question for alex and one for dr group as well if i could sure brother
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:59.160]  first for alex uh i did buy your male and female vitality yesterday ironically and i use bitcoin
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:06.600]  wondering how you've been enjoying uh bitcoin in the store uh people like it it's an open
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:12.040]  cryptocurrency so i support it i don't endorse its longevity uh you know and say that i think
[2:55:12.040 --> 2:55:16.360]  it's perfect but i think it's a good experimental uh alternative currency and i think it's a lot
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:21.480]  better than the private federal reserve system and it's what we need as they try to end cash
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:26.520]  and force us onto one controlled digital currency we need competing digital currencies
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:32.120]  so this has been working well for you at the store though we've had some people using it
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:35.960]  uh you know i've not been following it i just know they tell me it's working
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:44.440]  okay great um dr group i have been for about three years suffering from gravest disease
[2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:52.360]  and they radiated me and uh i've since then i've been bouncing back and forth between hyper and hypo
[2:55:53.160 --> 2:56:00.120]  thyroidism and i didn't know whether i've been cautious about using some of your products because
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:06.920]  i'm not sure whether i should or shouldn't use them i went ahead and ordered um the male vitality
[2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:12.040]  yesterday anyway and it's great that i got in today to talk to you and thank you for any comments
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:16.680]  you have on on that yeah you're not alone uh what we're seeing right now is pretty much a
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:22.760]  thyroid epidemic across the nation and it it is i mean and you have the you have hypothyroidism
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:29.320]  hyperthyroidism uh and a combination of both which is Hashimoto's and the why is it hitting
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:37.160]  women even worse well because of the estrogen dominance and because of the amount of women are
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:42.280]  just very sensitive women's thyroids are like four times as big as as men's thyroids so they have
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:48.120]  an affinity to suck in too much of the chlorine the fluoride the bromine i think a lot of it also
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:53.080]  has to do with everything they're spraying in the air i mean the the fact is the thyroid glands and
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:58.360]  everybody are taking a beating right now and it's all due to the chemicals seeping through the
[2:56:58.360 --> 2:57:02.920]  intestine but the good iodine fills it up and displaces the toxins that's that's one of the
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:07.880]  best solutions for thyroid disorders is iodine because when you're having thyroid dysfunction
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:14.280]  the liver can be congested but it's really the the amount of halogens that are being stored up
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:17.960]  in the body let me ask you when i started getting on x2 two years ago three years ago
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:23.000]  never was one of those experimental i mean i literally got high off of it energy-wise now
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:26.760]  but on it's so long i just i just take it twice a day and that's the way it is but some people
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:31.080]  say well you take too much of that it can burn your thyroid out how much should i be taking
[2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:38.840]  well everybody's different but what i do is i take probably about two thousand to ten thousand
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:43.640]  micrograms every single day one drop is around six six hundred and something microgram six
[2:57:43.640 --> 2:57:47.720]  how are you energy wise do you have as much energy as you have when you were in the special forces
[2:57:47.720 --> 2:57:53.400]  i i do have actually a lot of energy but i also keep my intestines clean i keep my liver clean i
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:58.840]  take the oxy powder on a regular basis i take the super male vitality i mean i think every guy
[2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:03.960]  that's over the age of let's say 35 when your hormones start to decline should be on the
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:08.760]  super male vitality i mean it's amazing what it does it's you will you will notice you further
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:14.280]  reviews the next day there's millions of products out there that are male enhancement products and
[2:58:14.280 --> 2:58:18.600]  all that this isn't that this what this does it just does it body you're supposed to be like that
[2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:24.760]  naturally produce and regulate your your own hormone levels so yes one of the best things
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:29.800]  you could do for your thyroid is to eliminate the source of chlorine fluoride and bromine and
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:34.680]  all those chemicals and toxins coming in clean your body and get on a good iodine supplement
[2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:38.520]  because you'll die without iodine thank you so much we're gonna go a little bit overdrive

[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:57.160]  years since my allergies hit about three four years after i lived in austin because it's just so
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:03.000]  many different types of plants i have been off of it pretty much for a year maybe i take it once a
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:08.920]  month used to i took it like three or four months out of the year all the time uh and maybe irritable
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:13.960]  cloudy because it's just speed basically in the long term makes you dumb now i don't take it hardly
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:21.640]  ever i i take the lung cleanse i just drink more water and a lot of other things like that but
[3:01:21.640 --> 3:01:29.880]  absolutely i have been taking herbs i've not been taking it so the reason i called is my mother-in-law
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:36.920]  i've talked and the medicine they give her just actually making her worse and worse and worse
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:42.280]  what can i do for her well let me throw this into dr group again look it up parkinson's and brain
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:47.480]  neurological disorders are off the charts what's going on well what's going on is the aluminum
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:51.960]  and the mercury and the and the metals that are accumulating in the brain if you look at what happens
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:58.120]  when you put mercury and aluminum in a petri dish together you have a violent neurological reaction
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:03.800]  one of the reasons you're seeing a lot of excess aluminum up in the brain is because practically
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:10.520]  everything food aluminum aluminum deodorant aluminum cans and i digress us in the limited time
[3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:14.520]  obviously we can't give advice to him or his mother-in-law right now or mother his phone was
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:20.440]  breaking up some but what are some of the things you've seen that have helped folks well what's
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:25.480]  helped people the most with cleaning out the metals from the brain is any type of chelation
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:30.760]  therapy that you might go through cilantro as a matter of fact we're going to be launching a new
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:35.880]  product for you here coming out soon which is called deep cleanse which is designed to not only
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:40.680]  cleanse the brain but the lymphatic system and almost work as a full-body cleanse it's about
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:46.840]  pulling those chemicals and heavy metals out of the brain and it can be a long process to go through
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:51.320]  but there's what about the good fat diets more of the good fat that helps right well that yeah
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:57.560]  that always helps i mean avocado oil olive oil just eating avocados is really about coconut
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:03.080]  coconut oil is incredible for parkinson's and all timers i mean it's yeah i mean my uncle was in
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:07.720]  a motorcycle accident my dad's brother and not my mom's brother the died last year and they told him
[3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:11.800]  like 20 years into it they see that when he was like 16 they said start eating you know the coconut
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:17.800]  oil that was like 20 years ago and it cut his seizures back by like 80 percent i mean boom
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:24.280]  just imagine well another thing you want to do too i mean if possible is to slowly start clean
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:28.200]  looking at her environment what she's eating what she's drinking and stuff like that and try to
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:33.880]  illuminate any excess coming in she might have if she's older she's probably got a lot of mercury
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:39.320]  amalgams and at the older you get the more mercury vapor and the more mercury gas goes into the brain
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:43.720]  and that accelerates parkinson so you know you want to get rid of the root you always want to look
[3:03:43.720 --> 3:03:48.440]  at the root cause of why you have things all right eliminate those anthony thank you for the

[3:08:06.040 --> 3:08:13.560]  hi i'm dr. group filling in for alex jones on this overdrive segment and what we're doing now
[3:08:13.560 --> 3:08:19.480]  is taking health questions we had delana on the phone delana go ahead and finish your question
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:29.080]  please yeah i just wanted to know um i have had uh plenty of um issues with my ovaries again i just
[3:08:29.080 --> 3:08:36.600]  said my ovary my left ovary removed in september i see my obu in probably about every two weeks
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:43.480]  due to the fact that my right ovary is uh normally in between four to ten times bigger than it should
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:50.600]  be um i have had surgery about every six months to have it drained to have this drained uh to have
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:58.200]  three miscarriages i take the female vitality i take the silver i um i think i'm pretty healthy
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:05.960]  you know otherwise besides having these issues i have pcls so um the only symptoms of my pcls
[3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:11.800]  is the ovary problem that i have so my question to you is do you have any recommendations on
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:19.320]  what could help me um because i you know i don't work i haven't had a job since 2011 i see a pain
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:24.920]  management specialist to control the severe pain that i go through every day so well any time that
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:30.360]  you have a situation with a cyst because that's really what it is i mean one of the main things
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:35.400]  that we've found is that it's an iodine deficiency and i don't know have you been taking any of the
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:45.400]  x2 i don't think so okay so what we used to do and we used to see a lot of individuals that were
[3:09:45.400 --> 3:09:49.480]  trying to get pregnant they wanted to have a kid and it was either the male or it was the female
[3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:56.200]  but a lot of ovarian cysts pcos and what we would do is go ahead and and take two steps back because
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:10:00.760]  what does the root cause of pcos why do you have cysts i mean that's what you really have to know
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:06.440]  and your doctors probably have not explained that to you the reason why you have pcos is because
[3:10:06.440 --> 3:10:11.720]  your endocrine system is not working function and functioning properly because it's toxic and that
[3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:17.640]  could be uh a comb it usually is a combination of chemicals and toxins coming from the air that you
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:23.720]  breathe the food that you eat the beverages that you drink so what we do is take two steps backwards
[3:10:23.720 --> 3:10:29.880]  and then start cleansing the body start off with an intestinal cleanse using the oxy powder then
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:35.560]  go into liver and gallbladder cleansing then go into you know maybe multiple liver and gallbladder
[3:10:35.560 --> 3:10:41.480]  cleansing because usually what we found is before you get cysts in your ovaries or cysts anywhere
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:47.080]  in your body your liver is contaminated so you're really going to need to do a liver cleanse and
[3:10:47.080 --> 3:10:53.160]  then cleansing your body and supplementing with iodine and usually within 90 days of of you doing
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:58.200]  a good chemical and heavy metal cleanse deep body cleanser there's multiple ones available online
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:03.960]  with the products that we're using here you're you're doing the superfemale vitality which is great
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:11.880]  the only addition i would add to that would be the x2 survival shield and uh that alone if you
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:18.920]  look online you'll see you can just type in iodine and pcos iodine and cysts and you'll see a direct
[3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:25.560]  link between cysts in the body and iodine deficiency so hope that helps um next we're
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:36.280]  going to go to uh we're going to go to chris in florida chris are you there yes i am um here
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:42.920]  how are you dr i'm i'm doing great what's your question okay yes a few years ago i was in a
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:50.840]  motorcycle accident um uh and they put me on uh hydrocodone for a couple of months and then they
[3:11:50.840 --> 3:11:57.400]  put me on oxycodone for a couple of months and then they put me on tramadol for two years and um
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:04.680]  then i went back and there was a different doctor i saw a different doctor in the same office and uh
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:11.160]  she took me off and put me on a gab of pitton and whenever i got the i always read the
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:17.240]  list of you know side effects and the you know the thing that you get when you go to the pharmacy
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:23.480]  uh and it was uh epilepsy drug and i called them up and i said hey look you know i don't have
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:27.320]  epilepsy i think they're maybe you gave me the wrong prescription or something you know it didn't
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:32.680]  look the prescription that i took in there but uh and they told me they said uh no that's they
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:36.440]  double checked and they said no that's exactly what you were prescribed and blah blah blah and i said
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:40.520]  but i don't have epilepsy and they said oh well you our record showed that you were on tramadol
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:47.560]  for you know a couple of years so you will you know and i'm like what they said you will have
[3:12:47.560 --> 3:12:52.600]  you know because of the effects of tramadol and chris let me ask you a question are you in pain
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:13:02.440]  right now uh actually it comes and goes i am constantly in pain i had uh two or a few surgeons uh
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:10.520]  examine me and take look at my x-rays i have eight slip discs in my back so here's what you know
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:17.000]  obviously people are finding out all the time that the medical profession only treats the symptoms
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:23.560]  and not the root cause yes you were in an accident but you have to remember there's only two options
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:31.320]  for you if you go the medical route there is surgery or medication does surgery fix the
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:36.760]  problem most of the time i mean i'm not bashing medical doctors you know in an emergency situation
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:41.640]  we have the best medical system in the world you get in a car accident motorcycle accident break
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:47.080]  your bones well they'll put you back together but that still means that you need to fix the
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:52.120]  problem or correct it internally and it's really hard for people like you especially
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:57.880]  there's so many people out there that suffer in pain every single day a few of the things that i've
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:05.240]  used is unfortunately you you're not going to be getting better over a period of time when you
[3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:08.840]  especially when they start giving you more medications and more medications and more
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:14.920]  medications that's not addressing all that does is just you know put you coma toast on the couch
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:20.040]  and you can't even get up and you're the pain is still there it's just you can't feel it so natural
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:25.320]  remedies i mean one of the best things and talk to you know find a good natural health care practitioner
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:28.920]  in your area that might be able to work with you but some of the things that we've used are
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:35.560]  inversion tables for back you know whenever you have slip discs in your back or and me being
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:43.320]  a chiropractor which is another really good way to help eliminate or help repair some spinal
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:51.240]  injuries through chiropractic deep tissue massage acupuncture some essential oils work to help control
[3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:56.760]  pain uh inversion table it sounds simple when you hang upside down but that was the whole
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:02.440]  philosophy behind yoga hanging upside down actually stretches your spine and what that
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:09.320]  does there's actually spinal decompression machines now too these are natural ways to actually decompress
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:15.880]  the spine and suck some of those discs back in if they're slipped or if you have herniated discs
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:23.800]  to a certain degree natural ways can be used to help deal with the pain and some of those conditions
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:28.760]  also what's going to happen with you taking all those pain medications is you're probably
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:34.120]  going to be chronically constipated because pain medications destroy the stomach and they also
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:41.080]  destroy the gut lining so it's a good idea for you to you know take a proactive approach have hope
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:46.840]  because listen i mean i've had people with devastating health conditions cancer that in
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:52.040]  the medical profession just doesn't give you any hope out there i'm telling everybody there is
[3:15:52.040 --> 3:15:59.160]  always hope i've seen every single condition reversed as a matter of fact hundreds of thousands
[3:15:59.160 --> 3:16:07.080]  of conditions reversed using natural remedies and just having the mindset that you can heal yourself
[3:16:07.080 --> 3:16:12.760]  you can get better if you want you can contact me at my office or something i can get a little bit
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:18.280]  contact somebody here at info wars and we can find maybe a regimen of the info wars life products
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:24.280]  it that you can take that'll actually help with the healing process itself you know there's always
[3:16:24.280 --> 3:16:32.120]  natural ways to do things so my my advice to you is take what i said you know find a natural

[3:17:53.720 --> 3:17:59.800]  supplements that info wars life i help produce these and my level of standard is through the roof
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:05.480]  i mean there's thousands of reviews on the website about that i highly encourage everybody go and
[3:18:05.480 --> 3:18:11.400]  read on info wars life dot com because you can see we're not allowed to say all these things on the
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:19.640]  air i mean unfortunately we're not allowed to say and give people success stories so i highly
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:26.280]  encourage you to go over there and the best part about it is it funds the operation it funds alex's
[3:18:26.280 --> 3:18:32.280]  operation and not only that you can wake up and you can become a healthier person so i think we
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:39.640]  might have time to squeeze one more in uh let's go to frances who's been holding for quite a while
[3:18:39.640 --> 3:18:44.840]  he has a question about colloidal silver frances are you there yes i am how are you doctor group
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:49.880]  i'm doing great what's your question i have a quick question for you regarding uh colloidal
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:56.600]  so is it true that that actually cures gum disease or am i incorrect well you know there's
[3:18:56.600 --> 3:19:02.760]  been a lot of research on on silver over the years i mean i personally think that silver is one of the
[3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:10.280]  best things that you can possibly do for a multitude of health conditions again you want to i always
[3:19:10.280 --> 3:19:15.080]  go back to let's look at the root cause of the problem why do you have gum disease either you're
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:20.600]  eating too much sugar or you're having uh an overgrowth of certain bacteria in your mouth you're
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:26.360]  having chemical reactions in your mouth because you're doing certain things um you know yes if
[3:19:26.360 --> 3:19:32.120]  you look at the studies that the department of defense did silver is one of the most effective
[3:19:32.120 --> 3:19:36.440]  agents that's why it's being used in all the hospitals now and is being used in band aids and
[3:19:36.440 --> 3:19:44.760]  everything else because it controls microbes and it limits microbial growth so when i take silver
[3:19:44.760 --> 3:19:48.440]  i you know soak it around in my mouth for a little while and then swallow it i do the same
[3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:54.360]  thing with iodine uh i think iodine is really effective for strengthening the gums and the
[3:19:54.360 --> 3:19:58.600]  teeth so everybody out there thanks for listening today
