[00:00.000 --> 00:24.560]  from the info wars dot com news center deep behind enemy lines in occupied texas broadcasting
[00:24.560 --> 00:30.560]  worldwide you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.560 --> 00:58.560]  technocracy takeover you're listening to alex jones
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.320]  and we are live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this wednesday
[01:02.320 --> 01:08.640]  the sixth day of july 2016 i do want to try to take a lot of phone calls today and i just
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.800]  sit on top of the calls or let individual callers go too long i really want to give
[01:13.600 --> 01:19.040]  longtime listeners who don't want to sit on hold and who want to just quickly sound off on hillary
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.720]  setting the precedent that there is a ruling class that is the new royalty and is above the law
[01:26.720 --> 01:34.960]  and you can welcome to sound off on obama calling her diligent and the best person to be the president
[01:34.960 --> 01:40.880]  ever hours after the fbi director talked about how horrible she is and how negligent she is
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.400]  the fbi director looked like a deer in the headlights yesterday i went back and watched
[01:46.400 --> 01:53.920]  the 15 minute speech he gave and he looked scared to death absolutely scared to death
[01:53.920 --> 02:03.680]  and then gave a really bipolar statement where he comes out she's absolutely horrible and
[02:03.680 --> 02:09.760]  lied about everything but prosecutors wouldn't indict her for this or wouldn't go to the grand jury
[02:09.760 --> 02:18.880]  with us what the lying to federal officers alone there's there's like 15 cases of that the
[02:18.880 --> 02:25.360]  the ordering her girlfriend to cut the top off and other staff of the stuff that said top secret
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.960]  the secret i mean you have her just tampering with those documents is a freaking felony
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.280]  and then it hit me when i was watching the nightly news last night from home
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.280]  with uh it was leon and david night doing a segment we're gonna play a clip of it coming up
[02:43.280 --> 02:51.360]  where they talk about the fact that and this is the one thing i haven't covered and it's the biggest
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.160]  issue out of all of this and every time i think i've covered every angle i realize i haven't covered
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.520]  half of them because i thought of a few more after i saw david talk about this and leon
[03:01.840 --> 03:07.040]  they have persecuted whistleblowers and the press unlike anyone in history
[03:07.040 --> 03:14.240]  i mean we've covered that but not the fact that they use the handling of secret documents
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.840]  and the handling of national security documents and national security information
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.120]  as the main way to persecute people when it's not violating national security to expose illegal
[03:25.120 --> 03:33.360]  spying or parallel construction by the dea or informants framing people uh or a fox news reporter
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.560]  talking to an undersecretary of state about do you believe north korea really has multiple
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.880]  atomic bombs you should be able to say yes we believe they have it of course they have it
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.760]  so you've got just the absolute misuse of it to persecute free speech and whistleblowers
[03:49.760 --> 03:57.760]  and then you've got hillary engaged in spades a royal flush of corruption and nothing's being
[03:57.760 --> 04:07.280]  done here so that's one angle i haven't hammered and it just i did get nauseous i mean i don't
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.240]  just say that everyone i know said they got a bad feeling in their stomach yesterday and i
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.800]  really went from being really happy yesterday morning long weekend with the family out at the
[04:14.800 --> 04:22.640]  lake with friends rob do and his wife and kids my cousin buckley and his wife pat riley was up
[04:22.640 --> 04:30.400]  there with us with his wife and friends we had a great time out on his boat out on neighbor's dock
[04:30.400 --> 04:38.320]  but i tell you then i just started really realizing this is actually the feat for the globalists
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.640]  because they're having to really show how corrupt they are and even liberal media is turning against
[04:42.640 --> 04:47.120]  them now and and really just going this is sick in fact this is something that finally has some
[04:47.120 --> 04:53.360]  of the zombo left going what look at all the people they've prosecuted for far less not just
[04:53.360 --> 04:57.840]  betray us i think they jumped the shark on this one we're going to come back get into all the news
[04:57.840 --> 05:06.880]  play some powerful flips is hillary clinton too big to jail in a shocking announcement regarding
[05:06.880 --> 05:13.280]  hillary's email scandal fbi director james comey said that there is no legal precedent to support
[05:13.280 --> 05:18.320]  criminal charges against clinton either he must believe that the american public is a bunch of
[05:18.320 --> 05:24.720]  drooling morons or he has simply become comfortable with telling us a bold face lie less than one
[05:24.720 --> 05:32.400]  year ago the fbi itself charged brian nishimera with unauthorized removal and retention of classified
[05:32.400 --> 05:38.160]  materials without malicious intent to which he pled guilty that level of gross negligence is
[05:38.160 --> 05:45.120]  precisely what the fbi alleges hillary did section seven ninety three subsection f of the us code
[05:45.120 --> 05:50.880]  makes clear that intent is not a key factor when pursuing charges in these kinds of cases
[05:50.880 --> 05:56.400]  this is yet another huge precedent detailing the miscarriage of justice in america this is
[05:56.400 --> 06:10.400]  ashlie beckford stay tuned for more special reports at info wars dot com more than two years ago info
[06:10.400 --> 06:09.040]  wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy and told you

[06:14.320 --> 06:19.680]  government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of
[06:19.680 --> 06:25.200]  the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and
[06:25.200 --> 06:30.400]  when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today i was there telling you how to

[06:47.760 --> 06:52.640]  deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health

[08:41.040 --> 08:46.320]  we've got the enemy in our sights the global fight against the private corporate world
[08:46.320 --> 08:55.600]  wide tyranny known as the new world order is going extremely extremely well time is running out for
[08:55.600 --> 09:02.320]  the globalists their entire program is being exposed not just their plan to take control
[09:02.320 --> 09:10.000]  of the planet its resources and populations but their end game their final solution their eugenics
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.960]  planetary program is now beginning to go mainstream and i sit back with extreme pleasure
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.400]  seeing our talking points against the globalists and our research against the globalist coming out
[09:26.400 --> 09:36.080]  in literature in fiction in nonfiction in media in sports in culture in news i love hearing
[09:36.080 --> 09:43.760]  terms that i coined being used by the mainline conservative talk show host i love hearing the
[09:43.760 --> 09:54.960]  even controlled left adopting my vernacular and it's not just my world view it's the globalist
[09:54.960 --> 09:59.680]  world view but from a perspective of someone against it so i want to just say something
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.320]  out of the gates before we get into all this news today it was disheartening not to see
[10:04.320 --> 10:10.320]  hillary clinton get indicted she certainly deserves it they've persecuted the press using these
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.480]  secrecy laws that's one of the biggest reasons i think she should get in trouble and one of the
[10:14.480 --> 10:18.880]  biggest reasons one of the biggest points that hasn't really been covered properly there's an
[10:18.880 --> 10:24.880]  article out today that actually gets into that from wane madson in full wars dot com reporter
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.360]  he'll be joining us at the start of the third hour joe biggs will join us from the border with
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.520]  breaking news there and pastor mannings with us in the second hour grab open phones with pastor
[10:33.520 --> 10:42.320]  manning as well but i want to say something the only way the globalist can win is by divide and
[10:42.320 --> 10:50.480]  conquer now if you are a black person who has been discriminated against or been harassed or
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.440]  or been pulled over for driving while black or whatever you have some real issues and real
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.160]  reasons to have a tip on your shoulder and there's reasons white people have to have
[11:00.160 --> 11:07.280]  chips on their shoulders and there's reason hispanics have all the rest of it but all of these
[11:07.280 --> 11:14.880]  issues are played up to be much bigger than they really are so the larger world can be basically
[11:14.880 --> 11:18.640]  obscured while we're down here in the smoke fighting with each other and i know you know that
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.120]  but we know they have bots and we know they have hired technicians and they have operatives that
[11:25.120 --> 11:32.240]  cause a snowball effect on message boards and comment boards and in the culture to push a narrative
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.880]  of everyone fighting with each other then the central government comes in and plays the part
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.880]  of the organizer the the referee to stop that in fight i'm going to just say this and i'm going to
[11:42.880 --> 11:50.240]  move on to the news i don't care what color you are or where you live in the world or what your
[11:50.240 --> 11:56.720]  religious background is when it comes to this question the globalist are targeting you whether
[11:56.720 --> 12:01.600]  you're a jew whether you're a christian whether you're a muslim whether you're a hindu whether
[12:01.600 --> 12:09.520]  you're a buddhist whether you are a zoroastrian whether you are a devil worshipper whether you
[12:09.520 --> 12:17.440]  are an animist whether you are a rosa crucian whatever you supposedly think your worldview is
[12:17.440 --> 12:24.960]  the globalist have a plan for you and they've been testing weaponized media weaponized food
[12:24.960 --> 12:31.760]  weaponized medicine weaponized water weaponized air and it's declassified a lot of it isn't but
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.400]  just what is declassified is so mountainous the secret testing that's been declassified
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.640]  in every country of the world it's crazy and again they use divide and conquer to control this
[12:44.640 --> 12:49.040]  because almost every time they come out and announce that they tested weaponized polio or
[12:49.040 --> 12:58.880]  weaponized syphilis or weaponized bird flu or weaponized zika or weaponized limes
[13:01.600 --> 13:08.320]  or sterilants in the tetanus shots they always end up announcing that they got caught doing it in
[13:08.320 --> 13:15.520]  africa or in some central asian country or south america and then it's just kind of in the news
[13:15.520 --> 13:30.160]  oh we apologize for injecting the tibetans or we apologize for injecting the folks in say chile
[13:30.960 --> 13:37.440]  or or hillary was two years ago she came out and apologized to peru for injecting the population
[13:37.440 --> 13:43.280]  she didn't do it but earlier people did she apologize as the state department had for our
[13:43.280 --> 13:53.600]  government secretly injecting peruvian llama herders not hurting anybody with syphilis
[13:55.600 --> 13:59.120]  it was the women that trusted the government would go into the clinics and get the shots
[13:59.120 --> 14:05.040]  i mean what type of freak evil people pull crap like that do you have any idea how painful syphilis
[14:05.040 --> 14:10.800]  is how degenerative it is basically microscopic worms that start eating your brain and other organs
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.200]  that's what limes disease is is weaponized tick-borne syphilis
[14:23.200 --> 14:27.840]  that's another little treat they gave everybody but let me give you a little newsflash then the
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.320]  really declassified stuff you can pull up they tested on white communities hispanic communities
[14:32.320 --> 14:38.480]  make they tested on everybody folks but when they announce it usually or declassify it it's always
[14:38.480 --> 14:45.280]  how they're doing it to the pakistanis or the peruvians to kind of play to the scientific
[14:45.280 --> 14:52.880]  elitism that's in the left of oh we're just controlling population wink wink i can't tell you
[14:53.840 --> 15:00.080]  how many times i've had leftist go okay yeah we saw your film in game yes there's some covert
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.640]  population control going on there's too many people what are you going to do mr jones and
[15:04.640 --> 15:08.880]  i'm like well you should go out and blow your stinking head off yourself or switch your wrist
[15:08.880 --> 15:17.760]  in the bathtub oh no no no you've got to oversee the playing god and poisoning everybody and the
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.080]  truth is they're like a cat playing with a mouse they're not really reducing population the globalist
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.920]  in the royal commission brought in worldwide policies in the 1950s this is all declassified
[15:27.920 --> 15:33.840]  to cause a ballooning population because they wanted that to actually threaten the west
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.720]  and later be able to cause global conflict to bring in the current world government we are
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.200]  seeing forming then they said they will mop everybody up everything you've seen so far
[15:45.200 --> 15:55.360]  is testing on people and getting ready so i want to tell the white racists the tribalists the black
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.800]  races the hispanic races the asian races all the little cult tribal groups okay let me explain
[16:00.800 --> 16:06.640]  something to you when you play along with your little race game whether the left is controlling
[16:06.640 --> 16:10.640]  it or the right is controlling it and god it's hard not to because the whole political systems
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.680]  like this you've got to address it so you you play into it whether you want to or not but but when
[16:15.680 --> 16:23.840]  you consciously play into it because you think you're winning because you're in your your group
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.080]  and you think that's what's going to empower you you've let the globalists win because all
[16:28.080 --> 16:32.720]  of humanity is under attack by the new world order for all intents and purposes according
[16:32.720 --> 16:42.000]  to the kissinger group there are 6 000 global minions that work for less than 20 families
[16:44.880 --> 16:48.720]  and i again had roth cop head of the kissinger group on during the break he goes you're one of
[16:48.720 --> 16:54.960]  the six thousand we're ready for you to join us right now fly to new york next week but it's
[16:54.960 --> 16:58.560]  going to be off record i said john harman you just hear that right now this guy's trying to
[16:59.520 --> 17:03.280]  this guy's trying to buy me off oh now come on alex i agreed to come on here i thought you'd
[17:03.280 --> 17:06.400]  be smart enough come on let's come on have a friendly to you know i'm gonna i'm gonna leave
[17:06.400 --> 17:09.680]  i'm gonna get off here have you already been on about 30 minutes i said no no come back roth cop
[17:09.680 --> 17:14.160]  but that's just one case i can tell you about because the guy didn't say up front this is off
[17:14.160 --> 17:22.400]  record until he wanted me to go to new york off record and i said no it's not off record you screwed
[17:22.400 --> 17:28.400]  up buddy this is a journalist if somebody tells me off something off record if it's not a criminal
[17:28.400 --> 17:36.000]  activity i can't ever talk about it or i blow my entire capability to get information off record
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.360]  be like if i was a cop a detective and i was just exposing who constant top confidential
[17:43.360 --> 17:45.760]  informants were all day i wouldn't get any information very very quickly
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.520]  and most people are so flattered to have the elite try to get them to join them
[17:51.520 --> 17:57.120]  you know i was just talking to a uh justy pechenik last week and most of the talk was off record
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.640]  this part of the talk wasn't off record
[18:01.040 --> 18:04.960]  and he was breaking down a bunch of different angles of stuff and talking about cia penetration
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.800]  of the army and how they're trying to deal with that and the rest of it and i think i talked with
[18:08.800 --> 18:15.360]  you know that wasn't off record but he just said listen alex you don't have to worry about them
[18:15.360 --> 18:19.200]  coming after you for the time being because there's so many people in the power structure
[18:19.200 --> 18:24.480]  that aren't part of this larger anti you know prosperity takeover who appreciate what you're
[18:24.480 --> 18:28.000]  doing and you are seen and what was weird is i've been told this by a bunch of other people
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.240]  you are seen as america like like you're an archetype of america and a piece on the chessboard now
[18:36.800 --> 18:42.800]  as a player you're now part of the establishment you're just a good part of the establishment
[18:43.360 --> 18:46.720]  and i'm not up here bragging saying oh look i'm part of the establishment because you're not the
[18:46.720 --> 18:50.640]  only person who's told me that didn't understand doesn't mean i sold out to the establishment
[18:51.360 --> 18:57.280]  you as our listeners and supporters are really alex jones i'm just a symbol of focal point of
[18:57.280 --> 19:01.360]  that like ron paul talked about it wasn't ron paul it was the movement he was just a focal point
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.240]  just like pat bucanon was or a or a donald trump today
[19:08.640 --> 19:16.720]  because we aren't selling out we will become the establishment if we start winning so many
[19:16.720 --> 19:21.280]  patriots think oh we're just going to lose and hide in our basements and wait for a civil war
[19:21.280 --> 19:26.880]  and oh my gosh we don't have any power no if we act like winners have the truth promote prosperity
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.440]  promote free market promote true unity there are a lot of people across the political spectrum that
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.520]  really don't want to have a civil war don't want to have war with the russians and don't want to
[19:35.520 --> 19:42.560]  be a bunch of scumbags and so all i'm telling people is i never compromised and sold out because
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.680]  i knew history i wanted to really change things and really be a good person in my life and so far
[19:47.680 --> 19:55.360]  in 21 years of fighting we have broken through as the info war and are now recognized as one of the

[24:20.080 --> 24:27.200]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central we're here live back weeknight seven
[24:27.200 --> 24:30.800]  o'clock central i'm gonna get into all the hillary stuff in the clips in the next segment and take
[24:30.800 --> 24:34.800]  your phone calls i want to get back to what i was talking about in the last segment right now
[24:34.800 --> 24:42.080]  just to illustrate the fact that everything the mainstream media does is to try to act like
[24:42.080 --> 24:46.560]  people that are aware of world government aware of the globalist plan are a bunch of fringe
[24:46.560 --> 24:52.720]  nut cooks that think flying saucers are going to end their backyard any minute and that just
[24:52.720 --> 25:00.080]  doesn't work anymore because the truth is we are facing a private world corporate government
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.160]  that's unelected taking over and we're going to force that debate no matter how much internet
[25:04.160 --> 25:08.480]  control there is no matter how many people they try to lock up that genie's out of the bottle so
[25:08.480 --> 25:14.400]  i'm just trying to announce to listeners that info wars and our small organization has already
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.360]  caused the world government plan massive problems because of you the tens of millions of listeners
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.240]  that are out there spreading the word and taking action and so i'm not going to let it demoralize me
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.880]  to look at that witch hillary and all the crimes she's committed the persecution of the
[25:30.880 --> 25:36.400]  christians and funding isis and al-qaeda and ben gazi and obama and the fast and furious and
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.360]  just the you know obama care and the scams and all the rest of it and and knowing how racist the
[25:43.360 --> 25:54.400]  clintons are and just knowing how phony they are the fact that democrats didn't support her the fact
[25:54.400 --> 25:58.960]  that the grass roots didn't support the fact that we couldn't hardly find any hillary supporters
[25:58.960 --> 26:07.040]  even in la on on primary day it was like eight out of ten were for sanders at the polling places
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.600]  most of them were for sanders but she still won because she stole the super delegates it came
[26:11.600 --> 26:18.080]  out in the news that that cnn and ap it had a meeting the day before at a at a home with the
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.760]  wealthy super delegates who were just appointed by the party and that they decided hillary was
[26:23.760 --> 26:31.840]  going to win california and that was on the news the next day oh we had a meeting we decided you
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.800]  go ahead and go vote you're like well that shows we're under horrible tyranny but at least it's
[26:36.800 --> 26:44.080]  out in the open now they've never had to sit there and openly ignore the popular vote and openly
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.800]  admit they're ignoring it it's so naked they can't hide it anymore that they're having to openly steal
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.720]  stuff at high noon they're having to have hillary be above the law and have the fbi director come
[26:56.720 --> 27:04.800]  out and fall on a sword for her and for loretta lynch so there's no way this can just go on
[27:04.800 --> 27:11.440]  and on and on because her own people don't support her yeah they'll get all whipped up into fervor
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.920]  and again democrat versus republican pepsi versus coke divide and conquer tribalism same
[27:17.920 --> 27:25.360]  stuff we talked about earlier sure they'll do that it'll work for a while but it's not going to work
[27:25.360 --> 27:31.440]  forever ladies and gentlemen and so that's the positive news i'm trying to get out here is that
[27:31.440 --> 27:38.960]  that as an average person out there who's just working hard and trying to take care of their
[27:38.960 --> 27:44.480]  family and trying to have a decent life trying to be a good person you may feel demoralized
[27:44.480 --> 27:50.560]  sometimes seeing all this bad stuff going on but i'm telling you i'm somebody who's on a lot of
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.040]  radio stations and tv stations and i'm somebody that's demonized all over mainstream media and
[27:55.040 --> 27:59.840]  i'm somebody that reaches 20 plus million people conservatively it's like 26 27 million people
[27:59.840 --> 28:05.840]  every week half of that in the u.s and all i get is my dinner bought for me and all i get is
[28:05.840 --> 28:11.520]  pats on the back and all i get is even trendies and and people from foreign countries and every
[28:11.520 --> 28:20.080]  race color and creed supporting me i wear obnoxious make america great trump hats downtown and and
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.320]  liberals laugh and love it i've seen a few that get mad by it and i just wear it to to practice
[28:26.320 --> 28:31.760]  not caring what people think and and to really test things but as a public figure and someone
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.760]  who's been successful in breaking through the into the political discourse i can tell you that
[28:37.760 --> 28:43.040]  freedom is the most popular thing in the world right now and liberty is rising and the quote
[28:43.040 --> 28:50.080]  conspiracy culture of not believing known liars and studying how the world really works that is
[28:50.080 --> 28:58.240]  growing you know they created like a quasi racist weird kooky in fighting government manipulated
[28:58.240 --> 29:01.920]  conspiracy culture when the internet started really getting big 20 years ago that was pretty
[29:01.920 --> 29:07.040]  much government run about half of it but the internet got so big and so many people listen
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.000]  to me this is this is key got online with blogs and their own videos and articles that the feds
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.920]  couldn't get them all to infight anymore and so we basically transcended that the last five years
[29:17.920 --> 29:21.840]  the trolling and the infighting to a great extent probably 90 percent of it's been transcended
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.720]  and now there's just mass awakening happening it's beautiful it's very very beautiful we've
[29:26.720 --> 29:31.520]  taken the internet over we're winning the info war as hillary said they're losing and it's a
[29:31.520 --> 29:35.760]  wonderful time to be alive so let me just give you the good news and i'm not doing a pep talk
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.480]  here i kind of got down about the hillary thing though i really in retrospect have thought about
[29:38.480 --> 29:43.520]  it we're making a tyrant act like a tyrant so congratulations to all of you out there all
[29:43.520 --> 29:49.280]  of us human beings wanting justice wanting liberty unified in our love of human empowerment
[29:49.280 --> 29:56.560]  and open free culture and our red blood we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the
[29:56.560 --> 30:07.120]  gcn radio network oh snap you've heard of the thought police but how about the food police
[30:07.120 --> 30:13.440]  corrupt regulators and the government are choosing winners and losers once again by snap i mean food
[30:13.440 --> 30:19.040]  stamps formerly known as the supplemental nutritional assistance program the wall street
[30:19.040 --> 30:25.680]  journal reports that authoritarian new rules from the usda mandate that retailers must now
[30:25.680 --> 30:33.600]  stock a list of 168 items on their shelves at all times while corporate grocers and big box
[30:33.600 --> 30:39.360]  retailers already have the infrastructure and distribution channels to conform to the strict
[30:39.360 --> 30:47.120]  new standards as many as 195 000 small retailers will undoubtedly suffer a significant gut punch
[30:47.120 --> 30:53.040]  to their bottom line tens of millions of food stamps recipients will have far fewer options
[30:53.040 --> 30:59.200]  thus expanding the phenomenon of food deserts i'm ashley beckford for info wars dot com stay

[33:30.480 --> 33:34.560]  cover some news take your calls we have several guests joining us i probably should get larry
[33:34.560 --> 33:40.000]  nickles to pop back in the day too because he was on friday and he said hillary will not be
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.280]  indicted and cummy is going to come out and say there is enough evidence to do it and exactly what
[33:45.280 --> 33:50.240]  he said happened and he also told me off record that a high level government official told him
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.280]  of the next big bank that was going to be announced to go down this week when he told me that off air
[33:55.280 --> 34:01.440]  i went and googled it and it was not in the news it is in the news today so i've got kit daniels
[34:01.440 --> 34:07.040]  who just notified me of it uh get putting the article for me right now so i tell you uh larry
[34:07.040 --> 34:12.160]  nickles is dialed in folks he is certainly dialed in he's right about 95 of the time
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.600]  and he says they're getting ready for a total financial collapse they're just trying to push
[34:19.600 --> 34:23.840]  it off until trump gets in to blame him but i mean if trump gets in a month later the whole
[34:23.840 --> 34:30.400]  economy collapses is the public that dumb to actually think trump did it i don't know 1929
[34:30.400 --> 34:34.000]  they had some nationalists get in that were doing better trade deals for the us and then they
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.800]  imploded the stock market and blamed them so you know this has been done before and history
[34:38.800 --> 34:45.680]  certainly repeats it certainly rhymes finishing up with what i was covering earlier and cj made the
[34:45.680 --> 34:52.320]  point the the real trolls aren't successful causing all the infighting anymore and turning
[34:52.320 --> 34:58.720]  the culture of questioning government into just a big mindless infight but the the bots are out
[34:58.720 --> 35:03.280]  there spewing racism spewing divide and conquer from all sides and and people need to just be
[35:03.280 --> 35:08.640]  aware of that and move forward with reaching out to other people warning them about globalism
[35:08.640 --> 35:14.800]  and talking about the alternatives of a true free market society capitalism and open free
[35:14.800 --> 35:21.920]  market creates the thousands of choices the hundreds of different designs of automobiles
[35:21.920 --> 35:25.280]  many of them affordable the incredible housing the incredible medicine
[35:28.160 --> 35:34.080]  corruption comes in and then tries to consolidate control and tries to have government pick winners
[35:34.080 --> 35:41.360]  and losers crony capitalism which uses grassroots socialism to keep the public stagnant and
[35:41.360 --> 35:46.800]  domesticated and they admit that the Bilderberg group came out this year in a public press release
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.200]  boy i thought it didn't exist new york times just eight nine years ago said i was insane it
[35:51.200 --> 35:57.680]  didn't exist actually said i was insane didn't exist they said i was in a parking lot in virginia
[35:58.240 --> 36:04.480]  stumbling around having a full schizophrenic meltdown it said believing men in black cars
[36:04.480 --> 36:11.760]  with black sunglasses were following me this was a film review of a film crew following us
[36:11.760 --> 36:23.840]  where they had armored car secret service marines they were aiming mp5 hk's at us on video this is
[36:23.840 --> 36:36.960]  in the film and then new york times said that i was having a schizophrenic meltdown that'd be
[36:36.960 --> 36:41.440]  like if you were at the super bowl and the good year blimp was above you with a coca-cola ad and
[36:41.440 --> 36:47.760]  everyone sees it and then the news just says no you didn't see a blimp that's the level
[36:47.760 --> 36:57.120]  of stuff they're engaged in i would get on elevators at the hotel we were staying at
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.600]  five miles away and they would have giant marine corps officers the later on there were marines
[37:01.600 --> 37:08.800]  get on the elevator with me and basically start threatening me we had to come over to our dinner
[37:08.800 --> 37:13.520]  tables and and say hey alex let's attack the state department tomorrow i guess that'll give them some
[37:13.520 --> 37:18.560]  jurisdiction to come after us i'd be like oh oh really and then we had these we had these
[37:18.560 --> 37:23.600]  journalists with us and they're like hey i think those guys are cops i go oh really you think they're
[37:23.600 --> 37:34.560]  cops because i was sitting there eating my hamburger laughing at them uh oh my god it's
[37:34.560 --> 37:40.960]  just so ridiculous it's so ridiculous that all we were doing was showing the secret meeting that
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.160]  nobody went hillary and obama went into it after she was there the the next day she comes out and
[37:46.160 --> 37:49.280]  says she's not going to seek the nomination anymore remember all that and the media for a
[37:49.280 --> 37:54.080]  day's like where's hillary where's obama they've disappeared we were there because you know we're
[37:54.080 --> 38:00.960]  delusional the new york times said so imagine again how it preys on its audience on its readers

[40:48.320 --> 40:55.520]  think about what's unfolding now silicon valley elites buying huge amounts of land for secret
[40:55.520 --> 41:05.920]  compounds we have the nouveau riche preparing to seclude themselves from the general public
[41:05.920 --> 41:13.040]  with double walls floodlights security compounds bunkers and of course guardhouses
[41:16.160 --> 41:21.360]  and by the way those are just their staging grounds outside major populated areas to their
[41:21.360 --> 41:28.560]  escape zones where they have underground armored redoubts luxury compounds on top and
[41:28.560 --> 41:38.160]  airfields able to take wide body aircraft and of course helicopter pads you think zuckerberg and
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.960]  the folks at google and apple and everywhere else not just facebook you think they're you
[41:42.960 --> 41:47.920]  think the technocrats are doing all this because they just feel like doing it no they are setting
[41:47.920 --> 41:54.400]  up a worldwide meltdown of control according to silicon valley insider the nouveau riche are buying
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.080]  up yeah this is in mainstream news but Paul's writing about it up huge amounts of land so
[41:58.080 --> 42:02.640]  they can build private compounds to seclude themselves away from the general public and then
[42:02.640 --> 42:09.680]  it goes on with one in telegraph reporting on it yeah Paul might want to add a few of my videos
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.280]  that article where i've been breaking it down and warning people briefly and i'm gonna play a few
[42:15.280 --> 42:22.160]  of these hillary eclipses right here phone calls uh briefly we are extending the sale of 20 to 40

[42:43.120 --> 42:48.160]  long time since x2 sold out we tried to stockpile it but people are really taking advantage of this
[42:48.160 --> 42:53.360]  sale in fact they're taking more advantage of that than they are the food that's a close second uh so
[42:53.360 --> 42:57.520]  i thought i'd be in the sale because of the uh food producers having trouble keeping up with the
[42:57.520 --> 43:01.040]  man but they're not they're they're doing fine this ships out like days after you order it totally
[43:01.040 --> 43:05.360]  fresh but no the survival shield nason i9 x2 looks like it will sell out the next week might be a
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.080]  month or more until we get more that's unfortunate but we're gonna keep the sale going until it's
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.760]  just a little bit left and i'll try to keep some back at the regular price until more comes in but

[43:45.600 --> 43:51.680]  the most we can do in some cases we're making like 10% on these seeds and i'm not complaining i
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.640]  love to have some lost leaders like when we sold the hillary for prison shirts at $5 i think we made
[43:56.640 --> 44:04.000]  a dollar on shipping on those after we calculated out the labor and everything so i mean we're
[44:04.000 --> 44:09.200]  selling them at 1995 right now to fund putting aircraft over the dnc and rnc saying hillary for

[44:30.160 --> 44:33.600]  from exposing Hillary clinton to fighting for the constitution second amendment you name it

[44:37.920 --> 44:42.320]  we are forced to take them down and yeah i mean if it keeps selling like this i'll have to take
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.200]  down the x2 because we have people that sign up for auto ship and they get 10% off additional for
[44:47.200 --> 44:53.760]  that i should add and you get free shipping on orders of $50 or more i forgot that part uh so
[44:53.760 --> 44:57.920]  we have to always hold we're not all we don't sell out of stuff now we always hold back enough
[44:57.920 --> 45:02.400]  to fulfill auto ship and to fulfill new people to sign up for auto ship uh so i will have to pull

[45:07.600 --> 45:12.560]  happening we've gone from it being a possibility you need storable food and water filtration and
[45:12.560 --> 45:20.400]  preparation to a probability to a virtual certainty i mean i hope that there's a way to have a soft
[45:20.400 --> 45:25.120]  landing the whole world's melting down right now we're kind of like one of the last guys standing
[45:25.120 --> 45:29.840]  we got big problems here growth rates of 0.8 percent with cook numbers all the other crazy
[45:29.840 --> 45:33.200]  stuff crime rates are starting to go back up despite the second amendment that held it down
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.760]  for a while as gun proliferation expanded the last 20 years crime went way down starting to
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.720]  tick up because you know criminals and other people together they get hungry stuff's going to happen

[47:06.560 --> 47:11.280]  right through with pastor manning joining us in the next uh hour we're also a powerful clip from
[47:11.280 --> 47:15.920]  the nightly news last night prosecutor explains how clinton got off uh hillary above the law
[47:15.920 --> 47:20.240]  john bound report is extremely powerful we're going to try to air that later uh obama turns
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.880]  into a stuttering mess again while talking about trump in north carolina uh hillary clinton versus
[47:24.880 --> 47:32.480]  james cumming email scandal supercut let's let's play that one first just to show how they're
[47:32.480 --> 47:36.480]  contradicting each other hillary you know said that she never even got hacked even though it was
[47:36.480 --> 47:44.000]  admitted over a year ago so stuff like that here it is he called hillary clinton and her aides handling
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.160]  of these email servers extremely careless and said in that news conference possible hostile actors
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.520]  may have gained access to those emails basically this was a political indictment of the way she
[47:55.520 --> 48:00.960]  handles her email it is an indictment of a source without a criminal charge that is a severe severe
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.520]  slap at the way hillary clinton was running that server but still a lot of difficult details for
[48:05.520 --> 48:09.680]  her team to grapple with today i think this is a very hard day for hillary clinton it was
[48:09.680 --> 48:15.280]  extraordinary there was in his words an extremely careless uh culture and attitude within the state
[48:15.280 --> 48:20.160]  department uh that is not good for hillary clinton that has been secretary clinton's main line of
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.400]  defense that she never sent anything that was marked classified at the time and of course as you
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.600]  point out director combi said that's just not the case today they found that hostile actors likely
[48:29.600 --> 48:34.240]  gained access for her emails in some ways that was in some ways the most chilling one of the most
[48:34.240 --> 48:39.360]  chilling parts of the press conference she has been saying for more than a year now that she never
[48:39.360 --> 48:44.800]  sent or received anything that was classified at the time and his analysis uh completely disputes
[48:44.800 --> 48:51.520]  that this is quite a reprimand of her and the way she has handled this by the fb it discounts all of
[48:51.520 --> 48:57.760]  her explanations that she has made for the course of more than a year as to the security of this
[48:57.760 --> 49:02.320]  email system says i think that's a key lingering question about the judgment for trustworthy
[49:02.320 --> 49:07.440]  Nancy does not have a clean political bill of power this cloud is not going anywhere and that's
[49:07.440 --> 49:12.400]  even her own former minions these are democrats all contradicting each other there let's go out
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.960]  to break with this clip this is media stretch Hillary Clinton after fbi report on email conduct
[49:16.960 --> 49:21.600]  see they're already imploding for defending this so long they now figure out they've got to go with
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.400]  the the huge awakening that's happening so even their own controlled media isn't going with this
[49:26.400 --> 49:36.240]  it's so dirty here it is i did not email any um classified material to anyone there is no classified
[49:36.240 --> 49:44.400]  material 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain
[49:44.400 --> 49:51.600]  classified information at the time they were sent or received i provided all my emails that could
[49:51.600 --> 49:58.480]  possibly be work related several thousand work related emails that were not among the group of
[49:58.480 --> 50:04.880]  30 000 emails returned by secretary clinton i thought using one device would be simpler she also used
[50:04.880 --> 50:12.240]  numerous mobile devices to send and to read email there were no security breaches it is possible
[50:12.240 --> 50:17.520]  that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton's personal email account it was my practice
[50:17.520 --> 50:23.680]  to communicate with state department and other government officials on their dot gov accounts
[50:23.680 --> 50:29.040]  hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom
[50:29.040 --> 50:35.200]  secretary clinton was in regular contact from her personal account um no doubt that we've done exactly
[50:35.200 --> 50:40.400]  what we should have done they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive
[50:40.400 --> 50:46.400]  highly classified information people will be able to judge for themselves we cannot find a case
[50:46.400 --> 50:51.840]  that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts thank you thank you thank you very much
[50:52.720 --> 50:58.240]  to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in
[50:58.240 --> 51:05.600]  this activity would face no consequences americans will find that you know interesting and i look
[51:05.600 --> 51:13.840]  forward to having a discussion about that all right let's be clear we set up our country we won
[51:13.840 --> 51:19.040]  major wars against the british and other empires without sending journalists to prison for quote
[51:19.040 --> 51:27.040]  leaking secrets and with simple codes that were painted person to person so much of this national
[51:27.040 --> 51:32.000]  security state claiming that it's keeping things secret for our security is about keeping the
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.400]  criminal activity secret we've had a shadow government since 1947 and the fact that they've
[51:38.400 --> 51:45.520]  persecuted whistleblowers and the press using these different secrecy acts and the fact that the
[51:45.520 --> 51:50.000]  media has gone along with this even as they've been persecuted really shows you how much trouble
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.480]  we've gotten into but now to have her 180 in the face of all this and claim it's okay what she did
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.240]  when she violated the law openly again has really opened a lot of people's eyes and that is exciting
[52:03.920 --> 52:11.120]  now there's another angle to this and that's that this is a diversion from larger issues of the dollar
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.800]  being printed like it's going out of style uh the chinese preparing for war against the united
[52:16.800 --> 52:22.000]  states nato is trying to start war with the russians the west funding isis and al qaeda
[52:23.280 --> 52:28.720]  attacks on the press uh expanded spying domestically the national debt being run up
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.760]  accelerated deindustrialization more more regulations to shut down what's left of us industry
[52:35.520 --> 52:40.160]  the dumbing down of our children the border is being open unlimited people with different
[52:40.960 --> 52:45.920]  immune drug resistant diseases coming across the border the government admitting it's been
[52:45.920 --> 52:50.400]  ordered by the lord and savior barack obama to quote jamie fox i've been ordered to let them in
[52:51.600 --> 52:55.920]  a crime against the immigrants themselves we've already dehumanized americans and we're supposed
[52:55.920 --> 52:59.840]  to pay for everything and do everything but what about the people coming in with tb and
[53:00.400 --> 53:06.640]  skabies and bubonic plague for heaven's sakes and the norovirus and everything else i mean this is really
[53:06.640 --> 53:16.800]  a vandalization of the country an attempt to bring it down an attempt to bankrupt us
[53:17.520 --> 53:21.040]  you've got to ask why are the globals doing that i'm going to go to your phone calls now lamar
[53:21.040 --> 53:28.640]  and shon and daniel and morris and quarry and many others let's talk to lamar thank you for
[53:28.640 --> 53:35.120]  holding lamar says the former dea analyst uh on classified info give us give us your take on this
[53:35.120 --> 53:42.080]  then hey alex uh yeah i mean this this whole thing is just rigged i mean it's pretty obvious
[53:42.080 --> 53:48.720]  you know that she broke the law and for us little people you know simple analysts like myself uh we
[53:48.720 --> 53:54.800]  would be in jail uh i had a situation where um some people were killed and wore as some some of
[53:54.800 --> 54:00.320]  the listeners may remember a consulate employee and her husband were murdered in front of their
[54:00.320 --> 54:06.080]  children and then a third person that was separate from them was also murdered oh that's a famous case
[54:06.080 --> 54:12.640]  that's a famous case and the dea really responded right and killed them as the cartel well yeah i mean
[54:12.640 --> 54:18.400]  they kind of did after the fact but it was you know too little too late at that point um and and i
[54:18.400 --> 54:23.360]  would you know i knew through uh certain involvement that i was in that it could have all been prevented
[54:23.360 --> 54:33.040]  in the first place and when i raised those concern go ahead of you there that was really weird
[54:34.720 --> 54:39.840]  he was driving a truck call back lamar are you still there yeah can you hear me yeah your phone
[54:39.840 --> 54:45.120]  cut out for about five seconds start over go ahead yeah i mean the dea responded uh too little too
[54:45.120 --> 54:50.400]  late you know um and when i raised concerns that it could have all been prevented uh you know through
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.560]  some of the resources that we had um instead of my chain of command dealing with that and addressing
[54:56.560 --> 55:03.520]  those issues they proceeded to just harass me and you know kind of you know harass me out of a job
[55:03.520 --> 55:09.440]  so the the irony in the whole thing is my last week i was placed on administrative leave
[55:09.440 --> 55:16.640]  because uh i copied my unclassified contact out of microsoft outlet to take with me
[55:16.640 --> 55:22.960]  wow so you took the unclassified contacts but they still came after you i've got the case
[55:22.960 --> 55:29.600]  up was this the case it was in 2010 yeah that's right and uh yeah and so they put me on the full
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.480]  pay and everything like that to finish out my last week at that time bradley manning was really big
[55:34.480 --> 55:39.840]  and i joked around they you know they must think i'm the next bradley manning or something but you
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.920]  know now i'm saying that instead of those resources being used to illegally spy on me for no reason
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.600]  maybe they should have been watching hillary clinton uh you know email top secret sdi material
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.480]  from her bathroom uh at her house well sure i mean take colonel schaefer he exposed the fact
[55:56.480 --> 56:00.000]  with stratos ivy and abledanger he was running the army unit that could have killed bin laden
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.440]  twice was ordered to stand down they tried to go after him criminally for using his colonel cell
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.160]  phone as was in a colonel cell phone to call his wife with something like 60 dollars when he was
[56:10.160 --> 56:15.280]  authorized to do it i mean that's like saying he was stealing pencils or something this is the games
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.480]  they play but look at hillary well i mean separately separately it's been all over the news they
[56:20.480 --> 56:26.320]  persecute the press and government whistleblowers for exactly what you're talking about so so that's
[56:26.320 --> 56:30.640]  the point i was making is they use this to persecute people that are innocent they use
[56:30.640 --> 56:37.120]  the secrecy to to to to keep corruption in place uh and to cover things up and then when hillary
[56:37.120 --> 56:43.920]  though openly engages and what i think is espionage it's supposedly okay that's the only true purpose
[56:43.920 --> 56:50.400]  for the whole security state right now is to you know uh compartmentalize the globalization that's
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.880]  going on so that the patriotic people still in the government don't really know what they're
[56:54.880 --> 57:01.440]  working toward and and should they uh step over the line you always can be caught in some kind
[57:01.440 --> 57:06.960]  of silly violation that they can use against you if they want to my opinion is she's still going to
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.760]  be held accountable and uh i believe they're trying to slip in bernie sanders i know that
[57:11.760 --> 57:17.760]  sounds crazy but that's i i think she's still she's going to be just such a a marred candidate that
[57:17.760 --> 57:24.480]  you might be right because he hasn't completely stood down yet separately though looking at this
[57:24.480 --> 57:31.040]  um and and and the whole history of this in my experience though this type of persecution of
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.600]  people in the government has only gone to wake them up i used to support body cams on cops till
[57:35.600 --> 57:40.800]  i figured out wait i would want to be surveilled like that plus they'll just use it to nitpick the
[57:40.800 --> 57:45.200]  good people and then defend the bad ones that's what i mean because as soon as the globalist
[57:45.200 --> 57:51.920]  and george soros wanted body cams for cops i was against them well that's a whole separate issue
[57:51.920 --> 57:58.000]  but the the use of classified material to persecute people like in my case when i said i'm going to go
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.320]  to the eoc and file a complaint uh they said okay well here's a list of the stuff that you cannot
[58:04.320 --> 58:13.200]  mention in your complaint so they took out every phone cut out again they took out the go-ahead
[58:13.200 --> 58:26.240]  lamar lamar i don't want to get lamar your your phone's cut out again can you hear me he died uh
[58:26.240 --> 58:30.240]  lamar uh if you are who you're saying you are you sound credible send us an email info i don't
[58:30.240 --> 58:33.200]  want to know anything secret about the dea but they'd be interested to talk about that case because

[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.760]  persecuted all i know is that's in mainstream news they persecuted the dea the fbi the cia all these
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:54.160]  agencies the upper controllers have much of the nsa and other spy grids pointed at the government
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.720]  to make sure the compartmentalization continues to carry out the globalization that's what the
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.560]  whistleblower was saying the compartmentalization is used to keep good people from knowing what's
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:11.120]  going on to advance globalization it is a technotronic takeover system we're taking your phone
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:17.440]  calls about this right now that a pastor banding joining us and more news shon in utah you're on
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:24.960]  the air worldwide and melvin costa rica and others welcome hi thanks for having me on i got a comment
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:32.080]  i have a question my comment is uh five years in the navy and now working for a contractor
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.000]  all the classified information handling training that i've received i've always been taught that
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.120]  it doesn't matter your intent when you're handling classified information if you miss handle it you
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:50.960]  miss handle it and you're in the wrong so in my mind that she's wrong hillary's wrong she
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.280]  mishandled classified information and she should be punished for that and that's my law says and
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.800]  that's what the law says yeah and that's what we've always been taught but five years in the navy
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.480]  and now working for a government contractor when we handle classified information there
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:14.800]  there doesn't you don't have to prove intent if it's mishandled it was mishandled and by the way
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.240]  especially when you're military you can tell folks about that training that's not a secret
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.120]  if there's people even in you know uh at your office or on a ship or whatever trying to get in
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.840]  to get the material you've got to destroy it or fight to the death to keep them from getting it
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.280]  so it goes beyond you're not just supposed to mishandle it or sell it you're supposed to defend it
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:46.720]  yes and with deadly force it's necessary well all i know is they use the secrecy 95% of stuff
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.320]  according to all the experts i've talked to in my own research does not need to be classified
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.360]  they classify basic procedures they classify the news stories they classify all sorts of stuff to
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.920]  keep from the public or to not let the military itself talk about it i mean in washington post
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.240]  articles get quote classified you know by the cia there's millions of them reportedly different
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.000]  articles been classified so they can say don't talk about this or don't allow this to be shared on
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.600]  computer systems but then separately oh hillary clinton you know she can meet with the communist
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.720]  chinese hundreds of times when she was co-president with bill and give them all sorts of secrets
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.400]  i mean she should be beyond prison and again i don't wish any harm against hillary clinton
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.640]  she's a horrible creature uh but i mean at a certain point if you or i got caught doing that
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:37.680]  stuff we'd be given the death penalty uh sean yeah and and very the bare minimum sent 11 worth
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.040]  well let me tell you you know foreign governments are on your illegal server you're using it as a
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.720]  dropbox she's not stupid okay that's espionage and everybody's missing the boat i'm telling you
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.560]  she do for years she's not stupid she was putting all the secret stuff on there selectively knowing
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.840]  a bunch of governments were on there there's two reasons it was a secret program to leak disinformation
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:07.120]  or hillary clinton was selling data now i hate to float a cover story for him to say oh it was a
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.840]  secret you know dis info thing but you know they do stuff like that that's why during world war two
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.600]  they broke the code for three years but wouldn't tell you know the you know wouldn't let us win
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.040]  most battles because they didn't want the germans to know we broke on the code so we could win the
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:24.800]  you know key battles and that's a really evil mackie valiant thing to do but uh that's what they
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:33.840]  did and i guess it worked but uh what's your view on that uh yeah she could have been selling it she
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:41.520]  could have been doing whatever with that information but i'm wondering how much of this uh fbi
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:47.440]  caught me coming out with what he said is a distraction from what obama might be trying to
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.840]  do his last few months in office i agree he's coming out with the guns he's still got the
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.960]  borders open he is jacking with the currencies he's starting a bunch of wars yeah we gotta be
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.960]  watching obama already diverted well you know with his hillary is hillary clinton too big to jail
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.960]  in a shocking announcement regarding hillary's email scandal fbi director james comey said that
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:16.240]  there is no legal precedent to support criminal charges against clinton either he must believe
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.760]  that the american public is a bunch of drooling morons or he has simply become comfortable with
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:28.800]  telling us a bold face lie less than one year ago the fbi itself charged brian nishimara with
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.960]  unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials without malicious intent to which he
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:41.520]  pled guilty that level of gross negligence is precisely what the fbi alleges hillary did section
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:49.280]  793 subsection f of the us code makes clear that intent is not a key factor when pursuing charges
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.120]  in these kinds of cases this is yet another huge precedent detailing the miscarriage of justice

[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.760]  elites are building big armored compounds mainly the technocrats of google and microsoft and twitter
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:08.320]  and facebook and uh the headline is the wolves of silicon valley how megalomaniacs and hoodies become
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:16.400]  tech's answer to wall street and paul watson reports on that on info wars dot com how they're
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:22.320]  getting armored redoubt storable food you name it because they are hanchoing for the
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.960]  governments the incremental collapse they're able to predict the future with mass movements
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:34.560]  they're able to trigger revolutions that's in the news today with mainline tech experts coming out
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:40.560]  and political scientists saying with multi-billion members the biggest country on earth is facebook
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:48.480]  its dictator is mark zuckerberg that's a cnbc she had lined from a month ago and he can throw the
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:56.640]  election because a large portion of the public are trendies and they will do whatever they think is
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.400]  cool and whatever the bots whatever the fake friends and most of their friends on facebook
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.360]  the little isolated folks that they have 10 or 15 real friends and then 10 or 15 fake friends they
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:15.200]  don't even know we're fake it's the next level of the nigerian scam where you send $500 to prince
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.880]  oboe but he gives you $10,000 give him $5,000 he gives you you know a million but the million never
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:27.040]  comes well now you just have fantasy friends just like actually madison i told folks years ago i said
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:35.760]  that almost all that stuff is fake bots i've seen guys literally go look at this hot girl she wants
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.520]  to go out and i'm like yeah but that's a bot that is the craziest stuff and it's it's just a total
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.400]  culture of fraud so there's those of us that are somewhat immune somewhat awake to the scams the
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.200]  manipulation the great delusion but then there's a lot of folks that aren't especially young people
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.760]  raised up in it young folks are either really awake right now or they're really dumb we're
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.680]  seeing a major split here so we're gonna talk about that with pastor manning we're gonna talk about
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:07.520]  what's happening in the economy uh dutch bank is plunging right now eurozone rocked by british
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.400]  exit now george soros bets 100 million on german bank collapse you think layman brothers was big
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.400]  this is gonna be huge we're gonna be talking about that we've got the former nsa whistleblower
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.480]  and info wars dot com reporter wane madson joining us to talk about all this and so much more
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.200]  but here's hillary clinton and obama persecuting the press and members of the government
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.240]  for blowing the whistle on corruption using the very same laws hillary now says he's exempt from
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.080]  and the fbi director coming out looking like he was scared looking like he was a deer in the
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.000]  headlights i've watched a lot of his press conferences he he didn't normally looks at the
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.720]  crowd he was kind of looking up and looked and first he indicted her and how horrible she was
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:52.800]  and how you know he inept and then but she's not going to get in trouble but you will if you do this
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:59.360]  wow don't try this at home kids this was unbelievable so he's always got a very interesting angle
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.720]  and i'm not saying this patronizing we have a lot of guests on that are really astute that's why
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.320]  we're they're on a lot we'll just have a bunch of people and we have people that i found to be very
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.960]  accurate very astute you know on target manning always has angles i didn't think of that turn out
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.320]  to be game changer so we'll see with this plethora because i don't talk to him before the show i just
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.800]  throw this stuff out there we'll see where he wants to go first he's with otla a successful church
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.760]  fighting tyranny uh for the last three decades there in harlem he successfully helped a boycott
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.920]  and began to shut down of the dawn of that area al sharpton but i'm not going to go over his
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.120]  laurels here today just that you should visit his website that we have on screen of your tv viewer
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:48.560]  radio listeners just go to otla dot o r g a t l a h dot o r g i'm alex jones with info wars dot com
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.720]  so pastor manning i've thrown out in the last five minutes a lot of topics what would you
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.880]  like to tackle first or you got a curveball for us no james call me director of the fbi actually
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:06.560]  actually will be hillary's private state department and what i mean by that alex is that she set up
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.800]  her own private email server meaning that all communications to her from any other source
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.720]  around the world what it was about about ices about putin about the uk or about muslims whoever
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.400]  had to first come to her server now that was not the appropriate protocol we all know the
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.640]  appropriate protocol protocol was for all information to come into the government server
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.960]  and then she disseminate that information to the appropriate person whether it be the pentagon
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:41.360]  or whether it be the illegal president obama or others so what hillary effectively did you got to
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:50.080]  give a credit for being as shrewd as a rattlesnake on this one uh she now controls information over
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:57.440]  the past four years around secretary of state tenure that the government does not have privilege to
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.600]  and when it was discovered that she had this and a lot of stink was made about it she deleted a
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.320]  ton of emails and then scrambled all the others in other words hillary had her own private state
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.320]  department she only allowed the pentagon she allowed only allowed obama and others in her
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:24.240]  information that she deemed them worthy or had a need to know and that's the thing that call me
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.920]  did not discuss on yesterday wow that's why i love having you clearly she was using it as i've said
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:36.640]  is a drop box 33 33 000 are missing absolutely but the spy is hillary because she's the one
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.760]  getting the data to then broker it out regardless and absolutely it's all the missing emails it's
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.920]  that she bypassed the state department itself hijacking the department of state wow absolutely
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:56.400]  that's exactly what she did and who knows what information she has who knows whether the world
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.040]  would be in a much different state now and we know the clintons have always been blackmailing people
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:08.560]  off the stuff they got 20 years ago oh my gosh wow it's even worse than i thought yeah and and and
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.560]  so the fact that she was able to do this get away with it who knows what information we could have
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.440]  been privileged to who knows uh how many lies i mean i'm not just kissing your butt it's true
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:26.800]  nobody else is bringing this up except you and what an angle that is that's it she had her own
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.920]  state department absolutely and then where's the missing emails she stole data yeah and and you know
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.640]  and the other thing alice is that call me sit on yesterday that were at least uh they were able to
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:47.360]  piece together during their reconstruction of the emails that were dumped trash or deleted that 110 of
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:55.120]  them had been classified a certain amount top secret classified etc but but there were 33 000
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:02.240]  emails that went through her system now just in general 33 000 emails when you think about it
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:11.920]  coming to the secretary of state and only 110 of them 110 ratio to 33 000 that were considered
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.760]  top secret or those were the ones that they were privileged to and in that that none of those were
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.520]  alleged to have been violated the other insult that he gave us on yesterday was that those she
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:30.160]  were had created her own state department her own pentagon her own source of power her own presidency
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:38.480]  that her email server was never hacked i mean come on and anybody she said you're an email you and
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.520]  her may have been conversing about something that you were aware of a Wayne Matson or Paul Watson
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.040]  may have been aware of and you were communicating about it and you thought that your communication
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:55.200]  with her was tight with the government still upon it and and and but but you were never hacked as
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:00.800]  well it was ridiculous the things we heard on yesterday regarding how the whitewash in fact
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.080]  whitewash would be a nice word for what they did for hillary to say to her you got the power
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:11.360]  or you ran the united states in a certain way obama ran it another way and we're not gonna
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.520]  trouble you we're not gonna make you force up the information that you know and when that really
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.880]  is what's happening whether it's bill clinton or whether it's obama she just attaches herself
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:26.080]  onto a presidency and then operates she did that under clinton she ran her own white house separate
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:31.760]  kind of like dick cheney did with a bush this is a absolutely yeah that's exactly what she did
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:39.920]  exactly what she did and he was he had to alex obama had to bring her on either as vice president
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:46.240]  which he was not going to do or as secretary of state because if you go back to the the feeling
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:52.320]  during those days when he finally won the election and every last one of us knew that they took it
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.720]  from her they took the state of florida they took the state of michigan from her they bamboozled
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.400]  the american people the media absolutely stay there the pastor man we're gonna ride back on the other side

[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:57.840]  that was part of Ted Cruz's campaign pastor mannings our guest is a short segment long
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.080]  segment coming up with more news and your calls Mel, Daniel, Maurice, Corey, Greg and others
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:10.480]  uh piercing angles on that uh pastor manning let me expand on that in this question why do you
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.640]  think the FBI director did that looking at the different power structure we know the clintons
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:20.240]  and the obamas don't like each other hillary's come out and said now she wants a loretta lynch
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.800]  to continue on uh why would clinton force his way on her plane in that in that james bond villain
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.800]  meeting on the tarmac i mean it's like they're trying to rub our face in it or they just don't
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:40.320]  care what's going on uh well they absolutely don't care that's for sure uh but comey had to do that
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:47.040]  to protect the integrity of all the other people going all the way back to the uh supreme court
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:54.880]  decision regarding obama care and lieutenant justice roberts finding a loophole to uh to to
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:01.280]  cement an illegal program against the american people and obama care but also uh you know there's
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:07.600]  no proverb oh what a tangle web we weave when first we practice to deceive and quite frankly
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.160]  james comey in order to hold the position that he holds now must play ball with everybody else
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:20.640]  that is to say we've been tangling a weave of course politics has always been toxic going back
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:26.400]  to woodrow wilson back in the days of trying to establish the league of nations but since obama
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:33.520]  alex we have seen an uptick in fact a tsunami of political corruption like we've never seen before
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.840]  and quite frankly anybody who's in politics right now is a part of the corrupt system
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.800]  and protecting the the the interest of the corruptors but right now i'm ready to go out on a on a
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.800]  limb now and say what donald trump is saying in one regard that hillary is the most crooked
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:57.360]  politician to ever run for office he's absolutely right and we need to think about it in this regard
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:05.600]  there has nobody been as corrupt as hillary is right now and she's holding the the the power
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.920]  over all people including james comey so in order for him to maintain his position whatever that might
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:18.480]  be he had to do what he did but we can look at bengasi there's no people but obama got a lot
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.480]  we were a lot of stuff you and i talked about that eight years ago alex about obama the birth
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:30.000]  certificate the whole issue you know but nobody has gotten away with the kind of illegal things
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.200]  going all the way back to white war and past remaining going back to julia cesar 2000 plus years
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:41.520]  ago 2050 some years ago he wrote about corruption people don't get it they start corrupting on
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.400]  purpose to get others involved so now they control the whole system and it looks like they're finally
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.760]  hitting that critical mass where the whole top of the structure is corrupt right everybody has been
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.680]  manipulated into it in the belief they're keeping america going too big to fail but in truth they've
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.960]  let the globalist take over by allowing the corruption to get to this level and that's the
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:11.120]  other thing what the globalist how the globalists are playing into this process and and who and
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.960]  people are told listen you want to eat bread you want to live in this nation you want to avoid
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.400]  going to jail or going to prison listen alex if the fbi decided right now to investigate me on
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:28.000]  anything they could put me in jail they could if they wanted to do it i they could and and then i'd
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.360]  have to prove that i'm innocent yeah they can indict a ham sandwich i mean they could just
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.640]  say you gave a false statement absolutely so it's a matter of whether or not you want to play ball
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.320]  and and and americas still americas are still eating you know we're still fairly sure but
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.080]  hillary now knows she can go for broke what do you expect her to do we're going to break in a
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.880]  minute and a half if she gets in what did she do it is going to be chaos like you've never seen
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.000]  before uh she holds the power over a lot of people i think the first person you're going to see
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:04.800]  fall and expose is going to be obama and if not if he's not first alex the first the group that
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:11.840]  will fall will be the african-american or the black people she hates them they kicked her
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.920]  in the teeth and she has now i when i look at her and i see her interacting with black lives matter

[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:06.240]  gcn radio network let's face it most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones but recent
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.680]  studies link cell phone use to major health issues including brain cancer experts say parents and
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:17.440]  expecting mothers need to be extra careful doctors say the infant brain even while in the womb is
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.800]  especially vulnerable so keep the phone away from your abdomen especially toward the end of pregnancy
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:28.320]  and for men using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.200]  lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult this is
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:36.960]  one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants and for those of us who use our cell
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:41.680]  phones before bed know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms this causes
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:47.200]  insomnia and slow some metabolism hello weight gain generally speaking when cell phones are on
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.680]  they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation so keep your phone in airplane mode
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:56.240]  when you can keep the phone at least two feet away from your body use headphones and when you're
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.040]  not on your phone keep it as far away from you as possible lian mackadoo with your info wars tip of
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.640]  the week last week we pointed out the globalists have declared open season on three individuals
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.400]  and nations worldwide when the british left the euro the globalists decided to go into high gear
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:16.400]  they've now announced that hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.320]  it's time for us to take our matters into our own hands the globalist warfare model
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:24.800]  is siege it wants to make us dependent it wants to cut off our economies it wants to be able to

[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:52.000]  the next hour because he predicted last week that Hillary would not be indicted I don't even
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.080]  know I should even play the clip I mean everybody heard it we're gonna hear from him briefly what's
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:04.400]  what's coming up next by the way Nico one of our producers had producer just asked me hey you didn't
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.600]  cover Nigel Farage resigning yesterday or play his his resignation speech and I meant to he's really
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.360]  the leader of free Europe like you you can say that the United States used to be the
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.640]  leadership of the free world the president was the leader of the free world I mean we weren't
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:24.880]  perfect but we stood against you know communism and total corruption and had due process
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.720]  and the little people have the same rights as the big people but he was asking why I haven't
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:36.320]  talked about Nigel Farage leaving I it just felt through the cracks I hope he's just taken a rest
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.920]  but I remember when he used to come on as a guest I talked to him during the breaks and he would
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.520]  just say I'm so sick of all this he wasn't a complainer he just wanted to go back to private
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:48.560]  business he didn't like what he had to do he just didn't like EU bureaucrats coming in and
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.640]  shutting down London businesses and things that's why he got involved this is a businessman who never
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.240]  been in politics 23 years ago and I think we need more Nigel Farage is to stand up and take action
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:04.720]  but kind of like George Washington after he served his terms just left I just don't think Farage's
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:10.080]  job is done but I understand why he went ahead and bowed out because it's tough battling globalists
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.600]  believe me I think about doing it all the time but the problem is they're not going to go away
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.760]  unless we beat them so we're going back to Pastor Manning here in just a moment and your phone

[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.040]  some calls here sir and see what their questions or comments are for you and myself but other
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.880]  points that you'd like to make about what you expect to happen in the future and other things
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:46.560]  that you're looking at right now I'd like to respond to your Nigel Farage in terms of his
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:53.680]  stepping away from the leadership of the UK at this present time and what I want to say is
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:01.200]  whether or not we want to track or the the last time the UK has been hit with a major terrorist
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:07.520]  attack when you right across the English Channel you've got several attacks both in Paris and in
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:16.000]  Brussels and was Farage and I consider him to be a noble person he was defeated by a Muslim as
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.400]  mayor of London but and this is a question I certainly don't mean to cast the sparriages on
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:28.480]  him in any way but I you know the ISIS boys are could have said we'll let England go free of
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.920]  terrorist attacks for two or three years if you do not lead an opposition movement against
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.080]  the try to get well I know he almost died in a plane crash I mean I know he doesn't talk about
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.640]  it he gets mega death threats and I yeah I mean there's actually an article about that that they
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:50.400]  are threatening to kill him right now and that his family did he did he did he did he get something
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:56.000]  such as be noble we will not bring any terrorist attack to London soil if you'll step away from
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:03.520]  opposing us you know the at the the the bombing in in Istanbul at the airport and a Muslim nation
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.760]  wonder would wonder why are Muslims bombing Muslims was the same thing in Baghdad with the
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.240]  Shiites and the Sunnis I was about to say we saw ISIS attack five different targets over the weekend
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:18.320]  and mainstream media would not even say Islamic right Obama Obama will say that and Donald Trump
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:24.160]  said last night Obama will say ISIL either uh ISIS rather he says ISIL but you know what's
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.880]  happening is that the ISIS and Muslims are saying listen we want control we want control of Turkey
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.640]  you imagine nation you're right here on the coast of of Europe we want you under our authority
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:40.320]  and our power don't do it we're going to bring horrific events uh to your citizens here make
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:45.920]  them bow down uh make make France bow down have you seen how the new Muslim mayor of London is
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.800]  already saying we can't have any women in bathing suits on government buses uh advertising and he's
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.400]  now saying he's going to go out for folks who criticize Muslims they litter he says he may
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.440]  try to break away from England too and take London over and make it London stand I mean look I didn't
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:03.360]  use a sitter and bash the Muslims but give me a break once they get to a concentrated level
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.360]  the radical Muslims the the orthodox Muslims whatever you want to call it they get they get
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.080]  radical and they start taking over that is their plan to overthrow our free societies
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.400]  why is the left bringing them in for that reason they while the why is the left bringing them in
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:26.080]  because the left if you will are being told that uh if they don't do it if they do do it first of
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.440]  all they will be greatly rewarded if they do do so uh they'll be protected they'll have the mega
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:36.320]  incomes and mega positions of authority but if they don't do it they get absolutely nothing in
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:41.840]  fact they get the kiss of death so for them the choice is let it happen and perhaps somehow
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.200]  I was about to say a lot of experts I've talked to say that's why the left does growled Islam
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.720]  they're afraid of it whereas Christians and conservatives libertarians we're so nice and
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:53.360]  friendly we let them push us around we let the biggest wimps on earth push us around
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.880]  while they roll a red carpet out the people that throw homosexuals off buildings yeah well you know
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:07.360]  I I think that every religion has Alex at his at his basic premise world domination I mean it
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:14.800]  doesn't always have to be an evil malicious violent one uh but everywhere every religion
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:20.560]  wants to be the number one religion it wants to dominate the world and it wants all people on
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.960]  planet earth to be adherent and that's it the left are collaborators by instinct they collaborate
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.320]  with the communists now they collaborate with the Muslims and that's just they're they're horrible
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:35.920]  people yeah so I you know we have to realize that this is what's happening right now Christians
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.560]  are wimpy as they come I mean I don't know if I want to call them Christians so we've invited
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:45.440]  this Christian persecution the UN admits double the last eight years uh Christians are the most
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.560]  persecuted group on earth times everybody else and we won't stand up for ourselves so we've asked for
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:57.360]  it you know I think there's been a dumbing down and the media has played a major role
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:06.160]  in the dumbing down of the Christian faith and uh and as a result of that America has lost his
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.480]  his fighting forces and last time we were on I think you asked a question about how you're
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.400]  going to wake up these people that the people that need to be awakened the Christians the people that
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:22.960]  that are looking at what Donald Trump is doing is we need men all over America to speak as Donald
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.080]  Trump has spoken to confront the powers that be to confront the globalist ideologies we've got to
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.200]  realize how much I mean imagine the threats you and I've gone through if you imagine for Trump it
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:38.800]  must be a hundred times yeah to be sure but when we get men you you get if we could get a hundred
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:45.200]  thousand men to stand up in various states across America with the same kind of Cajones
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:51.600]  that Trump is demonstrating we could take this nation back but we're not doing that they're
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.240]  being dumbed down they're being told by their families they're being told by the media uh
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:01.040]  that we need to be more tolerant we need to accept other religions I don't know if you're aware
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:05.600]  what's happening in in in a real sense what's happening religiously in in the UK forget about
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:12.800]  the European Union I mean Muslims Islam is is taking over everywhere you go there there's signs
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:20.240]  there's the smell of Islamic food there's a Islamic dress and pretty soon in in London you will not
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.560]  be able to wear a swimsuit or demonstrate or say anything negative against a London against a Muslim
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.560]  in London well let me tell you I've been to London quite a bit over the years and man it's changed
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.200]  just the last 10 and the Muslims are aggressive and they are in your face now the minute I start
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.760]  yelling back at them they back off they think I'm some European you know they tell me not to film
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:43.760]  and I'm filming not even then they run over at my face I go look let's go I bet you know at a
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.680]  certain point I'm getting sick of it let's take a couple calls for Pastor Manning he's absolutely
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:53.440]  on target Maurice in Virginia you're on the air go ahead yes um how you doing I'm Pastor Manning
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.840]  and Alex first time caller listening all the time and I'll follow up for you on our YouTube
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:06.240]  thank you so um I think Pastor Manning hit on um this ascension between um uh Obama and uh Hillary
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:11.920]  first I want to go to my first point is um call me and Lynch Lynch came out and said um that she
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.720]  was going to review this statement before it was uh said before it was released but then call me
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.120]  comes out yesterday said nobody's reviewed my statement that's a complete contradiction did you
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.480]  both catch that I did in fact he said nobody knew I was going to do this yeah exactly yeah yeah
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:31.280]  yeah we heard that how do you do small that you don't know you know I mean that's the first question
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:37.520]  second question is we have to be careful um not zero or being uh tunnel vision with uh by I mean with
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:44.080]  uh with Obama and uh Hillary because I think Hillary doesn't trust him um I don't think Obama
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.800]  trusts Hillary to further his legacy I really don't I think they're going to after the convention
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:53.280]  they're going to swap Hillary out for Obama she's going to be the sacrificial lamb I honestly
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.720]  believe that because he doesn't trust Sanders because he used anti-trade and um he doesn't
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.640]  trust Hillary as Pastor Manning brought up because there's there's that's a good thing we got going
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:07.440]  for us these people don't hate each other those are great points Marisa uh Pastor Manning well yeah
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:14.160]  you know I the way Obama was praising Hillary and Charlotte on yesterday she he said she's the best
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:22.080]  person ever for president I've never heard any any president praise a candidate the way Obama was
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.240]  praising Hillary so there are a couple of things what is it you might be right that she could become
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.240]  a sacrificial lamb she didn't look much like a lamb on yesterday she looked more like a rhinoceros
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.440]  and Obama looked like a lamb now and that could be a matter of deception because you never know what
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:43.760]  the hell these people are thinking about because they're so deceitful but on the other hand uh the
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:51.280]  Hillary has the potential of having information about Obama that was given to her from a number
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.160]  of patriotic sources around America and she's got them on the email server oh she's got them there
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.440]  and I saw a very weak person I saw a very weak Obama on yesterday I could have been deception
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  but who knows well the Clintons know where all the bodies are buried and they've got the real power
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.880]  structure behind them uh so we're all got front row seats this very exciting to be a very exciting
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.400]  time to be alive Maurice thanks for the great points I'm going to go to Mel and Daniel and Greg
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.680]  and Margaret and everybody but I want to play this clip of Larry Nichols last Friday live with us on
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:24.000]  air and we're going to briefly have him respond to it uh when he's been saying this for over a year
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.720]  that they will not indict Hillary the fix is in and he's got the context I know some of the similar
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.440]  context uh doesn't mean his contacts are always 100 right or the Clintons may not change course but
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:41.120]  this is what Larry Nichols had to say last Friday there's what they're doing she's not going to be
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:48.720]  in that it's over it's over she's not going to be in that so that's the decision there so they're
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:55.120]  rubbing our noses in it squatting in our face letting us know and if anyone what that meeting
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.600]  was about or those career prosecutors she's not going to be indicted but there's going to be all
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:07.040]  kind of searching and talking to these prosecutors that have worked on the case and if any one of them
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.280]  dare to open their mouth and to say that they were coerced into backing off an indictment
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:20.800]  she now has something to hand them two of I'm just giving two just two two of the federal
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:29.920]  prosecutors working on this case one of them is a pedophile one of them has a male lover and he's
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:35.360]  a male all right let's stop right there queer don't mean much anymore but okay so that full
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.600]  club's about five minutes long it's up on infowars.com let's bring him in to co-host with myself
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:44.160]  and Pastor Manning continue on with your phone calls after the break uh Larry you called it
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:53.040]  give us the aftermath what you're seeing today is well actually what you saw in his press conference
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:49:00.640]  Comey's you saw the result Comey was mad I think you could tell it Alex he look at his entire
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:05.200]  he looked freaked out and he looked freaked he didn't know what he normally does no and so what
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:12.960]  happened if you look at the text of his statement all the way through all the way through all the
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:21.200]  way through Alex it's saying we're gonna recommend her to be prosecuted but then at the very end at
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:27.200]  the last minute boom here it is he says we can't get prosecutors to do it kind of telling us they've
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:35.680]  been blackmailed exactly so what happened to Mr. Comey as he gets out there and that Friday meeting
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:43.040]  worked you know they went in and explained to Lynch and then Lynch took it and explained it to Comey
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:50.560]  and the prosecutors and at the last minute he had to take out recommendation to prosecute
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:58.080]  that's why he was mad that's why he looked so weird and that's why his text of his statement
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:05.040]  was so so odd you know even everybody even liberal media people are saying it'd be weird
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.920]  that he talked all the way through and everybody thought he was going to indict
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:15.760]  or recommend recommend an indictment but he didn't so he wanted to have his cake and eat it too
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.840]  go ahead and say she is horrible she should be indicted but we can't find prosecutors that'll
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.240]  do it which is pretty wow I tell you that is dead on that makes a lot of sense now do you have that
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:31.840]  from your sources or from working with the Clintons well both actually both now I'm gonna skip this
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.520]  network right I'm gonna skip this break this is too important our whole country's in jeopardy
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.920]  folks but just support the broadcast uh pastor Manning's here he can pop at any time he likes
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.240]  Manning's been of course on the front lines of taking on the Clinton's and Obama uh but Larry
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.240]  Nichols continuing on here consulate Clinton insider uh other points well you know Alex if I
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.520]  can just Larry I don't want to interrupt no no please jump in now no you know Donald Trump
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:01.840]  had said Hillary's the most crooked most corrupt politician to ever run for office he's absolutely
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:09.120]  right nobody has a history of corruption of corruption as as long standing and replete as
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:15.280]  Hillary going all the way back to whitewater in Arkansas in the Rose Law firm to Vince Foster
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:19.040]  to presently where she is I mean there's just nobody with that kind of a pedigree you're absolutely
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:25.280]  absolutely nobody of that corrupt and I think that that that statement that Donald was making
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:30.640]  needs to be looked at a lot deeper than most people are taking it as a as a verse of comedy a
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:37.120]  statement of comedy we're looking at a person and if she is the most most corrupt then my question
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:43.600]  would be um if she's more corrupt than any other person that's ever sought this office is she more
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:51.920]  skilled uh at handling corruption than anybody else and I stated earlier today that Bill Clinton
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:57.360]  perhaps would not be as corrupt as he is if he had not been inspired I was about to say
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.880]  more and more experts that were there said that Hillary was really the president and that she
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:05.200]  ran the show and that she would actually this is confirmed come in and beat the hell out of him
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:10.560]  and he was scared of her yeah I mean and and so she has she been running the show for quite some
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:16.960]  time uh we're looking at a very serious issue with with an out nation well let me ask let me
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:20.880]  ask Larry Nichols this because he's on record helping put him in power in the whole nine yards
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.840]  until they started murdering kids and he had to stand up and say no to it if you're a new
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.960]  listener he's behind the Clinton Chronicles everything that we know originally about the
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:32.080]  Clintons uh who is wearing the pants in this relationship I mean Bill looks like he's a corpse
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:42.720]  now yeah Alex faster listen don't even think any other way Hillary is the pants in that family
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:51.520]  Hillary is the power look all Bill Clinton wanted to be in president for being governor
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:59.680]  he just wanted to perks he never wanted to run he didn't want to do the job he just wanted to
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:06.880]  perks chasing women being a rock star the whole nine-yard Hillary pulls all of the streams
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:17.120]  anybody around her today knows that she pulls the streams Bill's nothing Bill Clinton is
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:23.600]  absolutely nothing Hillary is the power and pastor you were talking about going back to the Rose
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:33.120]  Walter I don't think people remember Hillary was actually fired from working on the staff
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:41.120]  that was doing the impeachment work on Richard Nixon she dumbed up evidence she dumbed up yeah
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:48.240]  because she was so deceitful and the you know and the guy that was doing it had literally fired her
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:54.800]  so she's got a real good pedigree she's a true demon so so so is she a sociopath a psychopath
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:54:01.840]  what would you say she is Larry god now Alex that's the damage question I've ever
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.760]  excused me faster didn't mean to say damn this but that's the damage question I've heard because
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:14.480]  I don't know how you answer that she is she is a sociopath she is now let me expand on this
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.440]  what is this the question for Pastor Manning and you first Manning where do you think they go next
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:25.040]  is she emboldened by the arrogance it really seems even wake up the leftist media so what does this
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.240]  signify I mean how does this calculus come together Manning and then I want to go to Nichols
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:37.200]  she she she she has to take the presidency at all calls and she has to fail forward then
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.000]  yeah she's got she's got to she's got to take the presidency she's absolutely positive to
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:49.680]  got to do that uh and then from there she will begin to get revenge I mean they're yeah she and
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.120]  and it's what she's a psychopath a sociopath she certainly is Dinglin possessed and this is certainly
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:03.360]  not a swipe at women certainly not but she principally like most women will seek revenge
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:08.240]  once the power has been stored to now I'm not against women all the women don't start hating me
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.400]  but it's well known that that's the stereotype of women is the vengefulness and the and what to
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:19.120]  but you know and and and and so as a as a woman woman president she's gonna get she's gonna seek
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:24.480]  vengeance she she can't resist it she will not be able to resist it all I know is I was nothing
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.840]  when they were in and the Clintons really gave me some problems they got me fired they had me
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:33.360]  attacked physically attacked so yeah Manning what do you expect to happen if she gets into me
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:38.480]  I mean I mean I mean I mean we know they bombed Oklahoma City to blame Limbaugh so maybe they'll
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:44.240]  just do a full flag and blame it on me this is very serious advice do not have what any
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:50.800]  tax liabilities have nothing where they can approach you from a taxable point of view absolutely
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:58.960]  and prosecute you make sure your properties are not having any tax liabilities uh that's
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.440]  gonna be the first line of defense for every patriot once Hillary well my little they did the
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:07.280]  Christians and with Obama they say absolutely let me ask Nichols that question what do you
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.200]  expect to happen my friend to yourself you're one of their I mean drudge they're foaming at the
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.800]  mouth to go out to drudge they're admitting they want to go out the democratic platform says
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:20.960]  arrest climate change deniers I mean this is like malice or something yeah you know Alex let me
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:29.360]  tell you yesterday yesterday when I saw it go down where she's not getting a recommendation to
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:34.320]  prosecute and then Obama started kissing her butt when he doesn't like her that shows he's
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.960]  scared of her now he knows which way the cabbage I'm sorry go ahead let me tell you now I'm scared
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.880]  to say this for because it was something Vince Foster said but I'm gonna tell you when she
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:53.200]  got off from the email thing now remember she had just gotten off from the Republicans on
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:57:00.960]  the Benghazi they rolled over so now Alex think about it this is what I thought about the minute
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.760]  that happened yesterday do you realize I'm the only thing between her and the presidency
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:13.040]  me I mean yeah you got Trump no but I know you were there you know where the bodies are buried
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:20.240]  in Clinton said the New York Times he fears you so you see that was a pretty awesome feeling I had
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:29.440]  thinking oh my god I'm there I'm the one in between them and I'm gonna tell you revenge
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:40.000]  Hillary Clinton has all of Washington DC shaking to their knees right now she has the FBI I'm
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:49.520]  sorry very very powerful I'm sorry go ahead well she has the raw FBI personnel files on all of
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:56.880]  on all the congressmen senators their staffers the media she's got it all we're gonna have the
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:05.040]  Jezebel demon princess as our queen that's right you're right pastor man can you do five more
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:09.280]  minutes with myself and Nichols you got to go yeah yeah I can well we'll take us out to break
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.840]  60 seconds take us out to break man and you're chomping to the bed I am to go ahead
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:22.960]  uh the Jezebel of modern of modern times is now before us on television running for president
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.600]  and most likely is going to take it hook or crook and so when you said Jezebel that is the
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:36.160]  act that is how she ought to be identified and when we look at the kind of power and the corruption
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:41.040]  and the pain that Jezebel brought to the people of Samaria and the people of Israel in the northern
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:44.720]  kingdom we need to get ready here in America that's right we're this country is going under

[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:20.160]  paging war waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:26.640]  of the info war the bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:32.080]  law religious center against it and mathematics and quantum mechanics shows that for every action
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:38.640]  there's an opposite and equal reaction Newtonian physics but i've seen that now in my 42 plus years
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.760]  on earth as i get a little bit older a little bit wiser i just see that things actually work in
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:49.520]  patterns there's rules the universe and trump's not perfect he's a nationalist he wants prosperity
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:53.280]  he's become more of a christian i don't people that know him well he's a listener i'm gonna just
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:59.040]  stop right there don't give the press weapons they want but trump's dialed in folks and so
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:04.880]  we this great evil's rising up god's giving us an opportunity do we take it or do we leave it
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:12.720]  and i'm telling you that i know in my heart of hillary's elected she's gonna cause a world war
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:18.240]  and destroy this country i just know i know it's the most certainty in my life that if we let her
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:24.720]  steal the election whatever we're done this is it this is the death of our country and probably
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:29.360]  other countries i mean i'm just telling you i'm sure of it i've never talked like this that's why
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.960]  i'm just all in everything against her pastor manning closing comments from you then i'm gonna
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:37.840]  get closing comments here from layer nickels i'm gonna come back and take calls and go to our next
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.680]  guest but this has been an epic last hour people can't say the shows just get one more powerful
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:45.600]  less because it's reality this isn't a game it's an entertainment you've been visited i've been
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:51.440]  visited i've been i mean this isn't this isn't a game but we understand that if we lose this we
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:56.720]  lose everything so there's nothing to lose but laying down we fight we win
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:05.600]  alex you are both historically scripturally and according to physics you're dead on for the action
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:12.240]  the reaction historically and scripturally uh when joseph ells take place so when the enemy
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:18.400]  comes in like a flood god does raise up a standard that is the opposite reaction and hillary is going
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:26.000]  to perhaps bring america back to its census again and raise up the standard against her as was in the
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.240]  days of ahab in jezebel when all 850 prophets were eating at our table god brought in one prophet
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:38.240]  by the name of elijah who called for no doom nor rain for a period of three years to bring down the
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:42.640]  power of the kingdom so you're right on three points and all you have to do is just follow those
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:48.240]  three points and i've always taught that if you want to know how to do something and how to succeed
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:54.000]  at it no matter what might be your religious uh of spiritual beliefs if you do it the way the bible
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.920]  does or the way god does you'll always have great success so i think for your looking back to jezebel
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:06.160]  and ahab and looking at what happened in physics in terms of reaction you're dead on and we can take
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:11.520]  comfort in that though it might look dark and gloomy now we can take comfort in the fact that
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:18.880]  even hillary herself is not greater than the truth of physics she can't be physics atla.org the spirit
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.200]  of lord is strong with this one thank you pastor manning thank you uh going back to larry nickles

[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:38.400]  grocers and big box retailers already have the infrastructure and distribution channels to conform
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:46.160]  to the strict new standards as many as 195 000 small retailers will undoubtedly suffer a significant
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:52.000]  gut punch to their bottom line tens of millions of food stamps recipients will have far fewer

[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:32.560]  got all that craziness we've got bizarre left-wing it's not even left-wing it's suicidal behavior
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.400]  i'm not a right-winger wane madson used to be called a liberal but you know he's been
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.760]  supporting trump castley because hillary's so evil i mean i'm not against muslims our government
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:46.240]  goes stirs them up puts the radicals in charge and now they have the the the swedish party
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:52.000]  government minister saying you know when the muslims rape it's okay because it's their culture
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.360]  now left-wing german politician who was raped by migrants lied and said it was germans because
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.200]  she didn't want to say it was muslims i mean and then she wears a hood over her head to like
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:06.960]  sympathize with him at stockholm syndrome i just i as a classical liberal i'm getting really pissed
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.280]  off man and hillary persecuting the press for stuff they and whistleblowers and then she gets away
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.760]  with stuff 10 000 times worse i know wane madson's written articles about this i think hillary's
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:22.240]  mainly a chinese government agent i know israel's involved in some of the soddies but he's written
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.360]  an article and i respect this guy at info wars dot com it's at wane madson report dot com as well
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:33.600]  israel pressured fbi to clear hillary if israel was spying via hillary servers that would explain
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.840]  why fbi is backing off well well yeah that's what i've said day one she's not an idiot she's always
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:43.680]  sold access and data you put it on there you have plausible deniability boom and so he's got an
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:48.960]  article saying israel was using as a clearinghouse that makes sense because as bad as our government
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:53.840]  is would they really let the chinese do this i mean anybody does if it's treason so he's got the
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:13:00.240]  sources let me tell you he's i'm not kissing his butt it's true he is the original snow snowed
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:03.840]  is a great god and great things notice he's attacking hillary he knows who the evil is
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.720]  notice so wiki leaks is as well that are the evil is i mean these are evil people folks
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:13.680]  all the real liberals but by liberal i mean pro freedom are against hillary i just it's not the
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:18.720]  trump's perfect but my god this one was bad i'm ranting here wane because it's just over the top
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:22.320]  where do you want to start first with what happened yesterday i mean it's just i mean
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.760]  it's like i'm a tennis player they got a ball machine shooting balls every second here i can't
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:32.960]  hit them all yeah well yesterday was very interesting the list of the fbi director comey uh you know the
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:40.720]  fbi never misses a chance to go after quote unquote russian and chinese hackers i mean they
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:48.480]  almost have a like a franchise on this um but yesterday i was listening to comey very closely
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:56.080]  and he did admit that hillary clinton's private servers remember we were told it was one server
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:02.240]  in chopper quote that was the other revelation comey said there were multiple servers and some
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.800]  had been taken offline and it was like trying to but get all these emails together was like trying
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:13.600]  to put together a giant jigsaw puzzle now if that doesn't show criminal intent i don't know what does
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:22.000]  but uh let's get back let's get back to this uh a foreign intelligence agents he said we know
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:29.040]  that foreign intelligence agencies took advantage of the lack of security on hillary clinton's servers
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:37.920]  to penetrate and obtain classified information which he included as sensitive compartment
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:43.760]  and that's what you did at the nsa you headed up a major division program trying to stop people
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.320]  leaking info isn't this a classic deal to put it on some server and claim you don't know it's
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:53.680]  penetrated i mean she she knew she's a famous spy been cia since college she knew full well what
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:59.520]  she was doing well she doesn't know all the people around her certainly knew and sydney blumenthal
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  who was working with her on these private servers to help bring down qaddafi and libyan what a
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:13.120]  wonderful result we've seen there from that uh very poor decision and the Benghazi stuff was all
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:18.000]  being transmitted by these private servers but when i heard comey say foreign intelligence
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:27.040]  agencies he didn't he didn't refer to china and or russia that is always code because the israelis
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:33.280]  are involved you cannot be an fbi director or a career prosecutor uh in the justice department
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:38.400]  and even be thought that you're investigating israelan and if you did look at it you're certainly
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:45.840]  not going to mention uh you know anything about mosad and and then i heard the same guy some um
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:52.960]  uh a cyber security expert on both fox news and an interview with politico neither one of them are
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:01.920]  are i mean their fox is generally pro israel as is i believe politico and he this guy said
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:11.440]  that um the countries involved he said china russia and israel and he said that on fox news
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:17.040]  and he said it in an interview with politico after hearing comey and then hearing this guy who would
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:23.760]  apparently had worked uh insecurity for alcatel lucent and sisco systems he seemed to know what
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:27.760]  he was talking about clearly it's being reported israel was in there obviously israel's penetrated
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:32.000]  the u.s more than anybody and let's be clear i don't hate israel it's different power blocks
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  but at the same time israel puts people in prison that admit they have a nuclear program
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.200]  that's been around 45 years it's not right you're not allowed to come in here and get our secrets
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:44.960]  and by the way then sell them to china because israel does that they love to sell our stuff to
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:49.600]  china but the fbi never complains about that look i you know yeah i've been in israel
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:55.520]  two times and i every time i was over there i had very good discussions with israel he said how
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:00.480]  about about how bad their government is and it's worse now than ever has been that yahoo
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:07.760]  is completely off the rails he's now um he's now in africa uh kibbutz thing with two of the worst
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:15.280]  dictators in african history uh must have any of uganda and kagami or rwanda but you know
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:20.400]  exactly by the way we put it on screen where politico is saying israel so this is unprecedented
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:24.560]  for them to even mention israel or whatever factions controlling this let me ask you the
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.320]  bottom line from your sources your smart guy you don't like to speculate what do you think hillary
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:32.640]  was really doing i mean i'm not a rocket scientist but i've got a good instinct wasn't she really just
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:38.400]  selling data and putting it on the server i he was i don't think she was selling it but it was this
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:44.560]  you know it's just paid a play thing that that even uh her and her husband and chelsea's uh
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:49.280]  clinton global initiative global clinton foundation was involved with see there was this
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:55.600]  triangle between hillary at state and this uh private company that bill was involved with
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:18:01.200]  and also whom abedin was involved with while she was a state department employee called tenio up in
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:09.200]  new york and then bill clinton's uh uh clinton foundation this was like a big uh uh menage
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:17.680]  a twa corporate menage a twa that was selling our that or trading let's you know let's use
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.920]  you know i don't know they were selling this stuff but at least they were trading
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:29.120]  for services all this information and the reason i believe she had the private servers
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:37.040]  and chopa quatt the clinton residents was to evade uh not only the uh national archives
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:42.400]  and records administration act which would make all those part of the record but she was also trying
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:48.480]  to um evade any leaks by people within state department sure wasn't she making her own
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:53.760]  compartment at state department yeah i see it was her own what she established was her own
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:19:00.880]  parallel uh communication system within the state department and remember what she said when you did
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.600]  that at the nsa wouldn't it be called espionage i'd still be in jail and i wouldn't be seeing
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:10.400]  the light of day for the rest of my life you know chelsea manning who now is reported to have
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:17.040]  tried to commit suicide today and let chelsea manning go i mean you cannot keep anybody in
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:24.240]  jail while hillary goes free well she got there he got 35 years before uh he had the sex change uh
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:30.240]  but you know 35 years no wonder he tried to commit suicide he just he got hammered because
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:37.360]  of the uh state department cable leaks the wiki leaks uh he got 35 years in leavenworth
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:43.680]  and here uh hillary clinton gets a pass from uh the fbi so no wonder that very next day hey
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:49.600]  she thinks she's a man he thinks he's a woman let's put him in the same jail cell i think it's fair
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:53.920]  let them be bunkmates she can be the husband or rachel maddow put her in jail with manning
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:57.680]  he'd be the guy and then mannings girl and believe that i believe it hey we'll be back

[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:13.040]  it's your own personal justice department and here's what the FBI director had to say about
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:19.680]  hillary being hacked she told our reporter she was never hacked with respect to potential computer
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:25.840]  intrusion by hostile actors we did not find direct evidence that secretary clinton's personal email
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:33.040]  domain in its various configurations since 2009 was hacked successfully but given the nature of the
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.960]  system and of the actors potentially involved we assess we would be unlikely to see such direct
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:46.480]  evidence we do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:52.480]  of people with whom secretary clinton was in regular contact from her personal account we also
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.920]  assess that secretary clinton's use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:03.840]  people and readily apparent she also used her personal email extensively while outside the
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:10.480]  united states including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:17.600]  adversaries given that combination of factors we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:22.240]  access to secretary clinton's personal it is possible the sun came up this morning and that
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:34.000]  water is wet look the important point here is that he keeps saying that it's possible because
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.560]  obviously when somebody gets in there they're not going to leave a trail ladies and gentlemen
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:45.680]  it's in wiki leaks it's in the russian leaks it's everywhere hillary's emails so we know that went on
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.040]  we're going to go to break this is sort of seven come back and talk to mel korean sees her finally
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.440]  and margaret with our guests and then joe begs one is from the border but am i wrong i mean you
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:58.320]  ran security did a lot of security stuff at the nsa this is what you watched for as a real expert
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:03.760]  on this way and what are we looking at well first of all that if he's talking about sophisticated
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:13.200]  act hostile actors and i would argue with i would argue with komi whether um some of these
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:20.240]  countries are you know hostile as they were during the cold war i mean china's are largest trading
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:28.000]  partner russia the reason they're doing anything uh uh opposed to us is because we've got them
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:36.960]  backed up against the wall with now nato troops uh on on the Baltic borders with russia uh so i don't
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:43.520]  blame them uh but it's very clear that when you get sophisticated attacks they're coming in and
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:48.320]  they're not leaving a trail they're pulling they're they're in they they take what they need and then
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:54.800]  they cover up the fact that they were there i i i think maybe the nsa has the capability to detect
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:00.000]  that but i think it would be even hard for them and the us cyber command because every other
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  country now is trying to see us and raise us in the area of cyber security and uh don't count the
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:14.160]  the russians and and and chinese it's certainly not the israelis out on their sophistication
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:22.480]  other cyber attacks well let's go further let's go further than your gut hillary or trump who's
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:27.600]  going to win just just just first approximation and then what happens under a hillary administration
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:36.800]  uh you know every time uh i hear about polls in certain states and then we have this issue with
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:43.520]  this uh trump sending out this tweet that he's being hammered on about the uh hillary photograph
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:52.080]  and the star david you know you know two steps forward and four steps back um i i think uh right
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:58.880]  now the right it's going to be very hard for him to win the battleground states of florida and nevada
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:08.880]  and um uh virginia and north carolina uh now oddly enough we're seeing a a lot closer of a race in
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:17.120]  normal democrat pickup states of michigan and um uh uh ohio which is either or it can go either way
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:21.760]  it's a bellwether state sure how could she win in the russ belt we've got eight years of obama
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:27.680]  screwing everybody and then and then and then she's like running on his record right and pennsylvania is
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:34.080]  in play uh that's very interesting too because that's always been a uh a sure democratic state and
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.600]  most of the last few what's your gut tell you though the establishment wants hillary i think
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:42.960]  there's gonna be elections i look at all the neocons that are bolting for uh hillary that
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:50.320]  these so-called republicans these chameleons you know they were they were um lbj democrats then
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.920]  they were scoop jackson democrats and when jimmy carter became president they left the democratic
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:03.120]  party uh and they became reagan republicans and then they stuck they got in with the bush family
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:08.400]  and now look what they're doing they're going back to the democrats under anybody that supports
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.560]  hillary ought to be ashamed of themselves you couldn't be with a more rancid establishment whore
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:19.920]  oh absolutely uh and look the the other thing look at the series of events we had this meeting
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:26.800]  on the on the attorney general lynch's private aircraft the sky harbor international and
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.520]  phoenix on in the private area of the airport and clinton says oh i just wanted to go on and
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:39.840]  discuss uh my golf game and my grandkids and janet reno uh you know what the fbi ordered the media
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:44.000]  to not film it we'll be back with wane madson your phone calls in three minutes we're on
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.240]  right to mel cory and ceasar the real troopers holding in margaret stay with us i'm alan
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:53.520]  shones with info wars dot com please don't take the side for granted we're on the march the empires
[02:29:53.520 --> 02:30:04.640]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network let's face it most of us are totally addicted
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:09.440]  to our cell phones but recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues including
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:14.800]  brain cancer experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful doctors say
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:19.600]  the infant brain even while in the womb is especially vulnerable so keep the phone away
[02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:24.640]  from your abdomen especially toward the end of pregnancy and for men using a cell phone for as
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:30.240]  little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm lowering sperm count levels so much
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:34.720]  that conceiving a child could be difficult this is one of those times you want to keep it out of

[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:36.000]  enemies but now we face global corporate rule and hillary clinton is one of the most disgusting
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  expressions of hubris and sadistic evil i've i've ever heard of in history not just my lifetime
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:47.360]  i want to go to our loaded phone calls for about 10 minutes to go to joe begs on the border but
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:53.600]  uh have a few minutes left here with wane madson uh very briefly wane i've got articles on the
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:58.800]  london telegraph today with the top silicon valley people all of building armored redoubts moving
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:03.920]  the middle of nowhere saying they think collapse is coming they've set up a system where they collapse
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:08.720]  things to get control but then it makes the money they've created worthless it's like
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:14.720]  they can't help themselves because they have no good will towards people they like screwing people
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:20.320]  over but they screw themselves corrupting the civilization that allowed them to even hatch
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:27.600]  i just i don't understand it it's almost like the old syndico anarchist uh political philosophy
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:33.600]  which i believe soros sort george soros practices every day i mean how he's now
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:41.440]  shorting the uh the euro uh he did the same thing uh after brexit with the pound uh he thrives on
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:47.440]  chaos they bet on every number and then just create chaos yeah yeah and he finds profit
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:52.960]  can be made in chaos and i i see that all the time with the stuff that he gets his hands around
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:35:01.120]  but uh and i i believe our uh election here is uh no different because what we're seeing what
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:07.600]  all over the world we have political dysfunctionality taking place right now you know there's probably
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:14.800]  going to be a hung parliament in australia no no party there got the uh the majority to form
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:22.400]  the next government uh spain is in a similar situation uh we have uh even the germans now
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:28.240]  germany's talking about leaving the european union i mean that it's the engine for the
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:32.880]  e you and but we see parties there they're opposed what about the islamic love affair
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:37.200]  with radical islam well what's up with these german women getting raped even even ministers
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:42.960]  and then covering it up i you know i think it it grows out of their world war two experience
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:49.200]  they don't want to be seen as um um xenophobic they hate themselves so they ally with who
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:54.160]  their grandfather's allied with to come rape them yeah yeah essentially i mean the same thing in
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:36:00.080]  sweden uh i mean and we have but they're allying with the people that sided with the nazis and
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:05.360]  they hate america what's your problem yeah i think they're they're confused about their own
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:11.760]  history uh in in some of these countries i mean we we had this judge that sentenced this uh
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:20.640]  syrian uh migrant uh to just like a few months in prison because he raped a a boy in a swimming
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:26.000]  pool because he said he was you know he hadn't had sex for a while i mean like that's an excuse but
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:31.440]  apparently the judge felt sorry for him no wonder austria uh they now know that their
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:36.720]  presidential election was fixed and the and the austrian court has ruled that they have to have
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:42.000]  another election in october sure here's another article on that uh german author banned from
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.440]  facebook for sharing book on migrant crime info wars dot com i mean where do they just it's crazy
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.160]  authoritarianism right i i think we're seeing the same thing happening in this country i i i
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.520]  said from the very beginning i thought donald trump was absolutely on message with this uh
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:05.600]  anti-political correctness nonsense you know there was there's a state representative from
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:12.400]  philadelphia in harrisburg pennsylvania who says they she's opposed to the confederate flag being
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:18.560]  used for civil war reenactments i mean can you imagine how how foolish and moronic that is oh
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:22.800]  she wants to ban symbols she's a complete i mean what you want to use the imperial japanese war
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:28.800]  flag at civil war reenactments that's like france banning nazi memorabilia from even like being
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:33.520]  sold well who cares it i mean it's it's memorabilia it did happen it's history it's like if i have a
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:38.640]  japanese sword from 500 years ago which i don't i can't afford one they're awesome it doesn't mean
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:44.400]  i support imperial japan or the shoguns i mean it's the most crazy crap i've ever heard i mean
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.720]  if i could afford one i have one of those ss daggers they're awesome doesn't mean i like the ss

[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:17.120]  hillary clinton and we're all distracted with mr trump there is the antichrist of the new world
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:21.760]  daughter who just got elected in the philippines that you guys need to pay very very close attention
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:26.560]  to i mean this guy says he's like the right wing messiah and he's swat teaming everybody and
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:31.360]  killing hundreds of quote drug dealers that guy yeah he just came on tv yesterday and he said
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:37.520]  uh he mentioned five names of five star generals and he said don't leave the country
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.200]  you're going to be called called in for questioning they already know that they're guilty said
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:46.080]  this guy is going to start hanging people in public squares one of the reporters asked them why
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:51.440]  don't you use the electric chair he said i don't want to waste any money on electricity okay no no
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:57.200]  man i see this new kind of flamboyant type guy what do you make of him lane oh well you know his
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:05.040]  name is duterte and they call him duterte duterte harry dirty harry uh look but the problem is is
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:12.720]  that obama uh has pledged us military support to the philippines uh in obama's pivot to asia which
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:20.240]  is nothing more than his desire to take on china militarily uh so obama has this wonderful ally
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:26.240]  and this guy rodrigo duterte who who you know he he just said the other day he's only been president
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:34.480]  for a week and a half or so and he's he proudly proclaimed that he's uh extra judicially killed
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:39.280]  five uh drug dealers i think it's like 30 now he also said he will kill members of the press
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.080]  he said i don't like you i will kill you oh yeah yeah journalists are under the gun there too and
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:50.720]  but look this is obama's new uh ally in his uh planned war well it's okay because obama's liberal

[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:17.840]  costa rica ceasar go ahead thanks a lot thanks a lot for alex uh i had i had a comment uh here
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:23.520]  how we see i've been working in the education system here for about seven years now eight years
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:30.000]  and uh one reason i think you know i strongly believe that why people don't do anything you
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.800]  know even though like what happened with clinton yesterday hillary clinton where you know it's
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.440]  just crazy what's going on and people it seems that they're just sitting back and doing nothing and
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:44.640]  one reason why i see this we all see it and one reason why is because you know the dumbing down
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:48.240]  of of the population even not even want to hear in mexico you know it's it's happening all over
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:54.480]  the world and and one way i see is this is that we have uh professional development uh events
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:03.360]  every year and each year it seems like we are getting taught trained to uh apply activities
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:10.400]  and in the classroom they're like game oriented it's called gamification it's a cool strategy but
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:16.160]  the same time it makes it makes like an even young adult like at the universitarian age
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:21.920]  they're constantly asking in the class teach your game let's play a game and it shows you how like
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:27.120]  their mentality this was admitted in the sixties that they don't want you in the real world so they
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:32.400]  want you to do simulated competition games where you're never involved in the real world it's kind
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:38.320]  of like the you know the romans with with gladiator events and horse races to divert the public from
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:42.640]  what was really going on in the world it's a distraction so that we sleep while they live
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:47.200]  and they also try to make you know regular learning as boring as possible and every
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:50.720]  people how it really works how how the world really works is that you might actually be
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:55.840]  effective everything is about teaching you not to be effective and and you try to tell folks
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:00.240]  they're obsessed with gamification that hey this is a system to control you they get mad
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:05.360]  with a pavlovian response like you're trying to destroy their world because their world is a
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:10.960]  fantasy world i'm not against games but there's so much real stuff in the world games are only
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:14.160]  trying to copy the real world but here's the definition since you mentioned it we'll put it
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:21.840]  back on screen for tv viewers it's the application of typical elements of gameplay point scoring
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:26.320]  competition with others rules to play to other areas of activity typically is an online marketing
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:32.400]  technique to encourage engagement with a product or service so yes this is this is what gamification
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:37.600]  is and people are mad who live in like fantasy land they're obsessed with their fantasy shows
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:41.520]  or their video games and i'm like hey i get it i like some fantasy shows like some video games
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:46.320]  but it can't be your world and you can tell they get a glaze in their eyes they're now
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:51.600]  intellectually in that fantasy world and see you as someone almost trying to wake them up
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:56.960]  on saturday morning at six a.m they want to go back to wonderland back to the matrix great points
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:02.480]  thank you cesar or hold on for one more comment uh wane madson your comment on that well you know
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:08.400]  i i i think the i've talked to people who are educators and it's it's awful now and and some
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:14.240]  of these school systems they they don't even teach in some of these school systems cursive
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:21.200]  handwriting you know because everybody's getting so used to the you know texting and the keyboards
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:29.520]  and all the digital stuff uh you know it's the same complaint i have about kindle um look you
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:34.560]  know i i've i've got a lot of real books and i'm going to keep my real books i'm not going to put
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:38.960]  any of my books if i can help and it's not that you're afraid of something new if they admit
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:44.160]  the screens hurt your eyes it can digitally be changed the book is physical it's very important
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:50.720]  to have physical copies right and and and can any book that's electronic can be altered they've
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:57.200]  already been doing it just like i believe the 28 missing pages are the still classified pages
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:01.520]  when john brennan the cia director said oh there's nothing in there that implicates
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:06.560]  saudi arabia 9 11 the only reason he would say that after others have come out and said of course
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:11.360]  that implicates saudi arabia is that he's going in and altered well he said he said a week after
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:17.120]  he said he was he might release it he said an altered he said a redacted version yeah it really
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:22.240]  it's he's altered it if he says there's nothing in there that implicates saudi arabia all these
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:26.080]  senators all these house members have seen it it's in there he says it's not there you're right
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:34.080]  right and and that can be done with charles dickens novels herman melville's novels uh the bible you
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:38.160]  name it whatever you haven't heard they're already releasing classics now politically correct style
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:44.160]  oh absolutely of course well we already had the they don't want tom soyer's saying it's racist
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:49.760]  right the state representative from mark twain was anti-racist but he put the stuff that was
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:55.040]  going on in the book it's not racist historically show something in a novel well i guess a state
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:01.040]  representative from philadelphia she she wants to remove all references to the confederacy
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:07.040]  if she wants to remove the confederate flag from re reenactments uh of course she represents i
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:13.520]  got to point out that she represents an area west of west philadelphia where kids graduating from
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:19.680]  high school there excel in only carjackings and uh shoplifting that's incredible well those that
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:24.240]  control history control the past and the present the future wane madson wane madson report dot com

[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.040]  friend thank you so much you bet thanks alex thank you we're going to go to more cause cesar
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:37.520]  closing comments sorry go ahead another another quick comment question more like okay i've been
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:43.120]  recently investigating about mk ultra mind control and i've been saying that uh that in the 60s you
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:47.280]  mentioned actually that where they have been you know the government officials have been putting
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:54.320]  you know tests people with lsd uh in secret but it do you see that happening now but like absolutely
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:58.320]  they're testing all sorts of weird designer drugs at ut that i always hear from people and i'm not
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:02.240]  even into the drug cults or by the people that you know talk about and tell me about oh there's
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.160]  this really incredible drug they're handing out downtown it comes from somewhere at ut and then
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:10.400]  and then you you you investigate it and it's connected to some government program you know
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:15.600]  just testing stuff on people absolutely the government put lsd out on the streets in america
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:19.520]  and again when you say government criminal elements not the cops down the street and there's
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:24.000]  just all sorts of weird black budget social engineering crap going on
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:30.880]  exactly thanks a lot alex thank you so much my friend yeah and look look i don't like the drug
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.120]  culture and i don't like drugs and all other stuff i mean that is illegal drugs i drink coffee
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.320]  that's a drug for heaven's sake you know i took a nasal spray this morning that was a
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:43.040]  prescription steroid so we say i don't do drugs that's an accurate comment i take some drugs
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:47.280]  you know i'm not as you know perfect as trump who don't even take aspirin i take ad vile sometimes
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:51.920]  i take you know whatever but the drug culture i can't stand it but they made the culture dirty
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.400]  and weird and sick because you make it illegal then criminal elements come in and then it puts
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:01.520]  all the money into it that's why i'm for decriminalization of drugs all right now let's shift years
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:05.040]  down to the texas border not sure where he is right now he's been a lot of different places
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:12.000]  we may not even say for security issues uh but uh joe biggs with our crew uh including ali and
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.160]  of course Zimmerman are down there right now uh covering a lot of stuff some of the reports are
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.160]  already on infowars.com we've got some hidden cameras down there to get some of the border
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:24.400]  crossings biggs of course got the footage with others of the drug dealers coming across famously
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:29.120]  with the big pounds of drugs that trump covered so what have you learned in the last 24 hours and
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:35.040]  what's coming up joe biggs well last night we got into mcallin texas and we were able to make our
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:41.600]  way down to the Rio Grande river at the us-mexico border and what we saw within a matter of minutes
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:46.720]  was a group of i believe seven individuals from Honduras and then we ran into another group of
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:52.080]  about five or six people you know that happened in seconds you know i've been covering the border
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:57.120]  in this area for quite some time for about two years now since i've been at infowars and it used
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.680]  to be you know maybe once out of a week you might see something like this but it's now at a point
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:06.160]  where our reporters last week within a matter of minutes of getting there in the evening time
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:11.280]  we're able to catch and the border patrol says that major uptick and when obama invites these people
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:15.520]  up who are mainly teenagers a lot of them are getting raped and killed by the coyotes and we're
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:20.720]  not talking about dogs so it's from the the smugglers well last the the last group we encountered
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.600]  last night what the women were in tears they were crying so i don't know what they encountered
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.320]  before they made it across the river but they seem kind of traumatized a bit so there's no telling
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:34.400]  what could have happened like you said as far as rape or something like that you know but they did
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:39.200]  say they had just come over the the river they were in dry clothes so i'm assuming they had a boat
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:43.040]  it was kind of hard to make out but when you get out there in that area you can hear engines and
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:48.080]  you can see smoke blooms coming up from behind the trees in that river area so there's definitely
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:53.120]  boats out there we were just down there earlier ago about an hour hour and a half ago and we're
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:58.080]  able to go back take some of the chips out of the cameras that we set up last night we didn't
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:02.400]  see a whole lot after sundown you know because we got there and got those cameras set up right
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:07.200]  before it got super dark so it looks like most of the activity is the you know three hours
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:10.400]  sure usually they came in at night now they can just come in there in the day because nobody's
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:14.560]  stopping them and again these are human beings we don't hate them the issue is the third world's
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:18.720]  collapsing they're being brought in to be used as a political weapon i'll say this the last few years
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:23.440]  you went down they claimed it was mainly kids and teenagers it wasn't now because of advertising and
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:28.000]  it seems like with the last two crews we've sent down it is mainly teenagers and children so it
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.200]  looks like they've made that a real prophecy by advertising well the interesting thing about it
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:38.960]  alex is we were down there trading out the uh sd cards and the cameras relocating cameras in other
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:44.640]  strategic locations where we thought we might be able to pick up more uh you know pictures and video
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:49.200]  of people coming up from the river and as we were doing that we decided to leave and go to another
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:54.560]  area now we encountered a board patrol agent a female she had no issue with us being there alex
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:00.800]  but as we were driving to go out to head uh to head to a park to go film to actually do the show
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:06.800]  we were chased out by texas state police we were told we cannot be there by them but the federal
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:11.600]  agents the board of patrol had no issue with us being there and now the state police so
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:15.840]  wait i wish we got video did you get video of that oh i have i have video let's put it up the
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:19.920]  state police here's a headline state police don't want don't want reporters on the border what did
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.400]  they say to you uh they said we couldn't be there we were trespassing if we were there but there
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:29.440]  were no signs where we came in at and they'll be real grand they're saying the real grand on the
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:34.160]  us side you're not a citizen can't be there yep but so now we're in hidalgo texas we're down from
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:39.360]  here where there's actually someone of a wall but when you go back into mcallin there's no wall

[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:51.920]  folks down there and i'm just upset with the state police i don't have some bone to pick with the
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:57.440]  state police but man but some of the texas state police just because i've been down there myself
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:01.440]  or even at the capitol outside would just do an interview little runovers were screaming at you
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:05.520]  they used to be like that they have a real first amendment issue when you have the footage he's
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:08.640]  going to upload the rest of it where they actually confront them when they pull them over but if
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:12.960]  you're a tv viewer you can see it we're going to roll it behind biggs talking that's amazing your
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:18.880]  reporters down there covering in mcallum on the border the illegals are just walking across everywhere
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:23.680]  and they told you you're trespassing when when you're not trespassing that i mean what do they
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:28.240]  say when you said we're members of the press i they really didn't seem to care whatsoever i mean
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:33.120]  but who's trespassing let's look at that the illegals who came across the border illegally
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:38.400]  not coming in and doing immigration the proper way which is what we have an issue those people
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:43.120]  are left alone meanwhile the people encounter last night since they're from Honduras what's
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:48.080]  going to happen they'll go into a detention center for maybe a few hours be processed uh be given
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:52.800]  sure but i'm asking the state police a question that they know whose car it is they know it's
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:56.960]  they know who we are they pull you over i know that footage is going to be coming out soon
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:01.280]  and i mean what do they say to you i mean what's the deal here we're americans leave us alone
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:04.960]  they the guy stopped us and basically said hey you can't be here you're trespassing
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:08.000]  you know and if we come back we'd probably be arrested you know somewhere along the lines
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:12.240]  of that so that's the the ridiculous thing is my point is is we have what did you say to him
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:17.200]  what did you say to him we just said okay you know whatever thinks and we started driving off
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:21.600]  and as we started driving off that's when i started filming from back in the in the backseat
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:25.920]  because ali had the camera filming Zimmerman talking to the police from the driver's side window
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:32.880]  the the guy as soon as we passed he sped around made a little u-turn and then just sped up behind
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:38.240]  us completely like at a high rate of speed got right up on our tail in i'm assuming to get our
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:43.200]  license plate number and then as we went off down left down the road away from them to go back
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:47.040]  onto the main road he reached out of the window looked like he was filming us or something like
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:52.080]  that maybe to get more license plate information to try to run our plates and find out who we are
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:57.680]  let me just tell the state police since they can't figure this out the globalists are dissolving
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:02.640]  the border and the border patrol is working with us trying to get the information out to
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:08.720]  save the country and then we're down there covering the border wide open so we need to explain the bad
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:14.080]  guy you're looking for is named barack obama and the globalists and hillary clinton not us okay
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:18.640]  so that's that's who opened the border up not us go ahead job well they they saw it us out we
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.960]  didn't bother them we were in an island area last night when the uh board patrol finally
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:27.840]  showed up when we were talking to the uh illegal immigrants they they rolled up they started doing
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:33.520]  their thing uh processing the individuals taking their belongings and the board patrol had no problem
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:38.240]  they said just don't stand behind us stand off to the side now sure it has zero issue the state
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:42.320]  police are the ones that want to hinder us the reason i brought this up this happens like every
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:47.440]  time i go down there the state police do this i don't understand it is it was it the problem
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:52.400]  that we're americans i don't understand yeah i mean americans do not have the right to move freely in
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:56.240]  america meanwhile if you're illegal you have the right to do whatever you want well i'm glad the
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:59.440]  governor put more people down there i just want to know why this is like the fifth time the state
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:03.520]  police have done this to us when we're like in major cities on the border filming stuff it's like
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:08.560]  i guess they don't want citizens down there because it's quote dangerous well the point is
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:14.000]  we're doing our job exposing the open border we're gonna keep doing it period so leave our reporters
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:18.480]  alone i'm not looking for trouble but i'm just not gonna have people harass because that's what
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:23.200]  i heard from you earlier like almost ran into you basically yeah the guys just sped up right
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:27.120]  behind us and was chasing us it was ridiculous if we would have hit a bump and had to slow down that
[02:58:27.120 --> 02:58:30.160]  guy would have rear ended us and then i'm sure we would have been blamed for it somehow all right

[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:36.000]  we're the ones that exposed it and put so much pressure on it the governor sent thousands

[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:51.600]  job as the real press as the paul reveres raise the alarm here i'm not going on with some jag about
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:55.280]  the texas state police they're pretty good overall a lot of respects but man they have
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:00:58.160]  i just sort of click when he was talking every time our reporters are down there it's the state
[03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:04.240]  police man pulling them over in their face bugging their eyes out it's like uh board patrols usually
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:08.880]  pretty good of any agency i've been around i'll tell you it's not good as the federal armed park
[03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:13.040]  rangers i don't care if it's on the border or somewhere else they treat citizens like crap
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:19.680]  people that are nice to them i treat them like crap i'm done i am done with arrogant out of
[03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:24.880]  control government i don't care what level it is especially when people get in the way of us
[03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:29.600]  trying to expose what's happening but i'm digressing and i apologize david night's coming up and i'm
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:32.880]  going to state that we get these calls out of the way there's a lot of news haven't got too
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:39.760]  yet out of david's about to cover it quarry in ohio you're on the air go ahead yeah as it pertains
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:44.960]  to uh james comey i want to know if you thought maybe he was coerced by payment or maybe he was
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:50.480]  showing video of what might have happened event fostered to change his decision uh i i think uh
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:54.480]  the guy that predicted all this actually is right i think that it came out that it was it
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:02:00.240]  israel was involved in the it's been in the news that israel was involved even mainstream news
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:04.400]  in the server so they didn't want to start a whole investigation of israel and this is an espionage
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:11.280]  investigation it's so embarrassing uh and got so much bigger uh that uh he basically admitted she
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:15.200]  was a horrible per he i was kind of mad at him yesterday i was really mad but now i kind of
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:18.320]  see what happened something big went on behind the scenes so he came out and said she's horrible
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:22.880]  she's guilty but no prosecutor will go after telling everybody that basically threats were
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:27.440]  issued to prosecutors i mean i think you pretty much spelled it out and i think way and i think
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:33.520]  wane madson but especially uh our earlier guest uh broke it down um that was larry nickles
[03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:40.480]  yeah i just i couldn't tell the difference on the space between guilt or maybe it was fear
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:46.480]  i didn't know i couldn't tell um nickle said he was angry and all it was that is what comey
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:51.440]  usually looks like uh so he did look freaked out i'll just say this he was animated he was
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:56.960]  his heart was racing and it was all supposedly un pretty much unscripted and wasn't going to
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:01.120]  be announced it was just sudden a lot of weird stuff going on and i think we're going to find
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:05.680]  out exactly what's going on but i think the best source on that probably is the guest we had on
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:10.800]  earlier i mean did you hear him did you hear what he had to say oh yeah what do you think was a great
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:17.120]  yeah i mean i honestly i think it's i think it's just coercion i think he was i think he was told
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:21.600]  if he didn't step down change his decision then he was going to face the fate of many others
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:26.480]  of space yeah i got from that that he was going to indict her it was like a speech he had ready
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:31.280]  for an indictment or a call for indictment and then just stay out at the end but now we can't do
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:36.880]  that and now that makes sense that nickle said that that's why it was so two-sided it's like 90
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:41.760]  percent of it's let's indict her and then oh but we can't do that almost a cry for help i tell you
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:47.520]  that i all i know is hillary clinton is bad news thank you quarry we're going to come back and talk
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:51.280]  to bob and a few others and then we're going to margaret who's been holding i guess they went to
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:54.400]  her went back margaret's been holding the longest i'm going to margaret when we come back then i'm
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:59.280]  going to go to bob mike and joe and then we're going to uh hand the uh mike over to david night but
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:08.160]  it is mind boggling mind boggling that they can persecute all these members of the press and
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:14.320]  whistleblowers that exposed corruption and bad stuff and were sent to jail or lost their jobs
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:21.680]  or both or got prosecuted in some cases found not guilty for exposing corruption
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:26.480]  and then now hillary has a server that she knew foreign governments were on
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:34.720]  and she gets away with it it really makes me wonder what are they going to get away with the
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:38.960]  future because this is the situation where they get away with more and more over the years this
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:43.680]  gets worse and worse and worse than i asked where are we going next they're already starting war
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:49.280]  with russia they're already funding al-qaeda and isis they're already giving weapons to our enemies
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:54.800]  our borders are wide open they're bankrupting the nation they're they're raping the american people
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:05:00.800]  with obama care they're just out to get us that's not rhetoric i mean they are out to get us
[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:07.680]  yes is hillary clinton too big to jail in a shocking announcement regarding hillary's email
[03:05:07.680 --> 03:05:14.080]  scandal fbi director james comey said that there is no legal precedent to support criminal charges
[03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:19.600]  against clinton either he must believe that the american public is a bunch of drooling morons or
[03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:26.000]  he has simply become comfortable with telling us a bold face lie less than one year ago the fbi
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:32.800]  itself charged brian nishimura with unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:38.800]  without malicious intent to which he pled guilty that level of gross negligence is precisely what
[03:05:38.800 --> 03:05:46.880]  the fbi alleges hillary did section 793 subsection f of the u.s code makes clear that intent is not a
[03:05:46.880 --> 03:05:52.800]  key factor when pursuing charges in these kinds of cases this is yet another huge precedent

[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:04.480]  through some more of the calls that have been patiently holding but first off an article
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:10.640]  out of the london telegraph we break it down an info wars dot com the wolves of silicon valley
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:17.840]  how the megalomaniacs and hoodies became tex answered a wall street and then it just gets
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:24.000]  in to how they're building armored redoubt silicon valley elites buying up huge amounts of land for
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:29.760]  secret compounds new vorice preparing to seclude themselves from the general public and it just
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:34.240]  ties into all the different preparations for collapse that are taking place as they prepare
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:42.960]  to create a breakaway civilization from we the people just want to add that global financial
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:50.560]  meltdown i have articles right here on it have has gone from a possibility to a probability to a
[03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:55.440]  virtual or near certainty but i've explained this many times your tv viewer i'm going to draw this
[03:09:55.440 --> 03:10:02.800]  out again don't describe it from radio listeners let's say here is sea level okay let's say sea level
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:10.160]  is at whatever hypothetical point okay this is the level of tyranny and you've got islands
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:18.160]  that are not floating uh as a member of congress from georgia says that capsize uh no no they're
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:23.360]  i know i'm a conspiracy theorist but they're really just mountains okay they're really just mountains
[03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:29.520]  and so what happens is as the water rises most the third world is already under collapse
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:34.480]  they're already in food riots they're already in cannibalism just insane stuff going on the
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:37.920]  global submit they're orchestrating a lot of this to bring in total control and consolidation
[03:10:37.920 --> 03:10:43.920]  and they called the imf riot in 2002 documents that got leaked and so we don't think we're really
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:47.680]  aware of this but if you're you know really poor you start to feel it more if you're here in the
[03:10:47.680 --> 03:10:51.520]  west or as things get worse you know your blue collar but things aren't as good as they used
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:56.160]  to be things are rough and tough middle class things are getting a little bit worse upper middle
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:01.040]  class oh my gosh you're underwater and as it goes up you know if you're up here on the top of the
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:07.600]  mountain say like george soros and the globalists and hillary and people in in in your own segregated
[03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:13.040]  bubbles you you don't think you're in a depression because you're up here on top of the mountain but
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:18.960]  depending on how high the political waters rise you're in a depression so we're in a
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:23.840]  depression worldwide it's just not equally distributed as i've always said just like
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:26.800]  certain cities are doing better than other cities most cities in the u.s are in trouble
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:31.680]  many areas of mexico have collapsed but there's some areas that are controlled they're doing great
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:36.400]  there's some areas of mexico have lower crime rate than osa texas but on average they got the
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:42.400]  highest crime rate in the world for a country not as a city chicago has that so that's what's
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:50.480]  happening but there are events taking place where the water is only going up and where the
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:56.640]  establishment doesn't understand is historically they can always think they can go to higher
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:01.600]  ground politically a lot of times actually on top physical hills like in brazil but at a certain
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:05.920]  point the water will go over you that's why peter thiel and others are looking at floating cities
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:13.280]  to get away from the population so this is where the metaphor becomes reality floating cities
[03:12:13.280 --> 03:12:19.680]  as the as the actual landmass goes under the zombie apocalypse of collapsing you know a society
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:25.360]  run by trendies and almost no one's self-sufficient a bunch of spoil brats it's almost like a
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:33.040]  collapse needs to happen to you know get order brought back into perspective of being self-sufficient
[03:12:33.040 --> 03:12:36.960]  the problem is the globalists are everything they can to make things self-sufficient
[03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:39.600]  they're on their little ship
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:48.160]  so they're the ones helping push this to a great extent because i guess it's easy just to make
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:53.520]  things worse you can solidate control so try and like fix things but the truth is you're never
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:13:02.320]  going to get away on a ship or anything else the water is going up and so i'm spending 70 percent
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:07.520]  of my time trying to politically change this and turn this around and 30 percent now getting ready
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:12.800]  now just a few years ago it was i spent 90 percent of my time fighting to stop it and 10 percent
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:20.640]  getting ready and there's kind of a doomsday clock in my own brain i'm gonna be quite honest
[03:13:20.640 --> 03:13:26.080]  i'm i'm pushing as hard as i can politically right now i'm all in money wise but more and more
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:34.080]  i'm starting to shift to where i might go 40 preparation 60 fight back then i might go 50
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:39.040]  and at a certain point there's no point anymore you just go 100 get ready
[03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:46.320]  it's called a lost cause and the establishment's already thrown the towel in that you know the
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:51.200]  they've done most of this but they understand how dangerous it is and now kind of figure out oh we're
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:56.160]  not going to ride this tiger to greater power we better just take all our stolen loot you rationalize
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:13:59.840]  yourselves you were having global collapse that you control to get power the truth is you now know
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:04.800]  it's going to be a hellhole by the way you're not going to get out of it if any of you want to come
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:08.720]  out in the establishment start fighting this and trying to fix things then you might get a reprieve
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:13.200]  but don't think you're going to get out of starting all these wars and have global collapses and all
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:19.920]  the rest of stuff you need you need to stop it now instead of all running to your escape pods
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:25.440]  you should be trying to fix things now like we're doing instead of just trying to have a getaway plan
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:33.600]  because the getaway plans i've got are out of total desperation they're not because i think
[03:14:33.600 --> 03:14:39.520]  those are a good move that those are those are emergency backup plans but i talked to establishment
[03:14:39.520 --> 03:14:44.320]  people off record i talked to billionaires on record years ago off record too and they just
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:52.480]  don't think it's fixable because the public is so servile so dumb so evil so lazy on average
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:57.440]  there's a lot of hard-working people hold the system up but man when things go belly up with the
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:04.800]  general public with a hundred million people on some form of ebt card good god it is going to be
[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:10.800]  the zombie apocalypse and now we've gone from this being a possibility in many countries
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:17.120]  to it being a current reality so we are running 20 to 40 off and it's a win-win yeah absolutely
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:20.480]  i'm trying to scare people to sell products the funder operation trying to stop this
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:26.640]  see how that works i think this is a real probability we're trying to stop it and we're
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:33.040]  saying get ready 30 70% fight back that's my view maybe you disagree a lot of you got ready before
[03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:37.760]  we did people can see this coming a far off i've been an optimist thinking we could turn this around

[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:57.680]  the next two weeks and he told me the name of the bank and i went and looked and he's hitting
[03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:03.680]  about the bank at the time but now it started so heard that from old nickles again so i'm not
[03:17:03.680 --> 03:17:08.880]  saying this is coming i hope it didn't come in i want to push it off or stop it but i feel real

[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:44.800]  the year go ahead yeah alex i just want to know if you think that hillary clinton has been uh
[03:17:44.800 --> 03:17:49.040]  victor vindicated after all this and do you think the first thing she's going to do when she's
[03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:55.280]  elected is probably throw you and larry nickles in a fema camp is this a are you trolling i mean
[03:17:55.280 --> 03:18:00.400]  vindicated it'd be like if hitler was his own judge at nirenberg no she hasn't been vindicated
[03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:05.280]  even mainstream media says this is a travesty overall i think it just shows outrageous collusion
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:09.920]  and corruption and blackmail and um that they'd medley have fema camps they say they're going
[03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:15.200]  to reeducate patriots at them that's an official army manuals i can't believe they put it officially
[03:18:15.200 --> 03:18:19.280]  and call it reeducation camp but this just it's all over the top uh but i'm not really worried
[03:18:19.280 --> 03:18:25.120]  about me i'm a man i don't do stuff for me personally i do it for my children in the community
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:27.280]  because that's what men do so i'm not worried about myself
[03:18:30.480 --> 03:18:37.200]  this is anything else bob yeah uh do you think that the patriots are going to be more demonized
[03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:42.720]  under hillary yes i think that bears use the bathroom in the woods
[03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:46.640]  and goldfish or orange absolutely absolutely bob
[03:18:52.080 --> 03:18:56.560]  and there goes there goes bob i think that's like some fantasy things that oh my gosh

[03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:28.560]  going to come after you you know the you know they kill people really i but see that's from
[03:19:28.560 --> 03:19:33.200]  the mindset of folks that think like that that well you know you know the civilization is
[03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:37.600]  going to totally collapse we don't stand against this you know they're selling babies parts everywhere
[03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:42.160]  you know they're dehumanizing us you know they're cross species you know the planet's dying right

[03:24:09.200 --> 03:24:14.880]  show i'm david night and we're going to take a look at hillary clinton's email scandals which
[03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:18.000]  we've been looking at the last several days we're going to talk to some of our callers as well
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:24.240]  and i want to catch up on what's going on politically with the veep steppes a veep steppes of course we've
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:32.000]  had uh newt gingrich speaking with donald trump today we had joanie urnst and governor pence meet
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:39.520]  with him over the weekend and today we had joanie urnst say that she has a lot more to do in the
[03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:45.600]  senate and quite frankly i think that's good news as long as she can't do what she wants to do
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:51.680]  because as i tweeted out over the weekend as donald trump was talking about the meeting
[03:24:51.680 --> 03:24:57.200]  with her i tweeted out something she put out a year ago senator joanie urnst who is a brand
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:05.520]  new senator at the time said i am pleased that tpa is one step closer to implementation tpa of course
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:12.480]  is the trade promotion authority and understand it's not simply about the tpp or the ttip the
[03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:17.120]  transatlantic the trans-pacific quote-unquote partnerships they're really treaties folks
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:24.320]  and i cannot believe that a senator doesn't know that these are treaties doesn't know and doesn't
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:30.240]  care that there is a process for ratifying treaties in the constitution but of course the
[03:25:30.240 --> 03:25:37.040]  majority of senators virtually all of them and the vast majority of the house the majority of
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:44.160]  republicans in both houses voted to ignore the constitutional process that they are bound to
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:48.720]  follow and said we're not going to follow that we're not going to have two-thirds of the senators
[03:25:48.720 --> 03:25:52.800]  vote on these trade treaties instead what we're going to do is negotiate them in secret with
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:56.880]  corporate lawyers and then we're going to put it up to a majority vote in both houses we're not
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:26:01.760]  going to allow any amendments we're not going to allow any debates we are not going to allow any
[03:26:01.760 --> 03:26:07.440]  uh fellow busters it's going to come to a vote in 20 hours uh so you can't change what we do you
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:11.520]  can't talk about it you can't delay it we're just going to run this thing through and we're going to
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:17.120]  let the president then sign it okay that's the process that she was pleased was one step closer
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:22.800]  to implementation what a lot of people call obama trade i just call it flat out treason
[03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:28.880]  because if you openly say we're going to just ignore the constitution on the process of treaty
[03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:34.080]  ratification what else are you going to ignore it on well quite frankly everything right just
[03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:39.520]  like they do it uh day to day on the bill of rights now she met with donald trump over the weekend
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:42.720]  and then she comes back and she said well i made it very clear to him that i've got a lot more to
[03:26:42.720 --> 03:26:48.160]  do in the senate i'm focused on iowa blah blah blah okay uh that's kind of like saying you can't
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:55.600]  fire me i quit now hopefully when they got together donald trump realized that joni Ernst was
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:27:02.960]  diametrically opposed to what he's basing his campaign on and that is uh she wants to have
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:10.320]  the tpp the trade partnership when she talked to uh the iowa farmer today back in march of this year
[03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:14.960]  they said what are the top issues for you right now she talked about four of them one of them was
[03:27:14.960 --> 03:27:18.800]  the trans-pacific partnerships she said it's a trade agreement it's being discussed i do think
[03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:23.600]  we'll get a chance to vote on it i tend to be supportive of that bill well donald trump has
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:27.200]  said uh for the last 30 some odd years he doesn't like nafta he doesn't like the trade deals we're
[03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:33.200]  getting and this is getting far far worse with this this is not even a a trade deal this is a
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:41.120]  loss of sovereignty the management of our economy by an offshore cartel that is unaccountable to any
[03:27:41.120 --> 03:27:46.640]  nation state okay there's no democratic process involved in this senator sessions who's been the
[03:27:46.640 --> 03:27:54.000]  close advisor to donald trump has explained this to him since last august joni Ernst is thoroughly
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:58.560]  in the tank for that's whenever top four priorities she said just back in march then she talked about
[03:27:58.560 --> 03:28:03.440]  something else that donald trump hasn't talked too much about but certainly i don't like and
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:11.040]  because she sees herself as the face of big agra uh she wants to push through uh a geomobile the
[03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:17.840]  dark act as we call it which will basically shut down any state legislatures from saying we
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:22.560]  want to have our food labeled to know if it's got gmo in it exactly what you would expect
[03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:27.600]  from somebody coming from iowa where which is a big corn producing state which is where
[03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:32.880]  so much of the gmo products is coming from they don't want you to know what you're eating they
[03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:38.000]  don't want this label there they're ashamed of it they're embarrassed by it they want to lie to you
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:45.360]  just as hillary clinton does and so it's a good thing i think that there's been a not a meeting
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:50.400]  of the minds hopefully we're going to have the same type of thing happening with some of these
[03:28:50.400 --> 03:28:56.480]  other candidates i'm very concerned to see newt gingrich cozying up so much to donald trump
[03:28:56.480 --> 03:29:03.600]  because newt gingrich is a thorough globalist also in news we see that congress is going to
[03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:10.960]  summon the fbi director to explain why there's not going to be any charges brought before clinton
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:16.000]  okay and understand this when we talked to lionel yesterday leon macadoo and i interviewed him on
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:20.960]  the nightly news and he made a very good point as a former prosecutor we said uh oh you know he
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:25.360]  said um no reasonable prosecutor will bring charges uh well here's a reasonable prosecutor
[03:29:25.360 --> 03:29:29.920]  lionel because he actually believes in the rule of law even though he didn't want to see hillary
[03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:34.720]  clinton go to jail even though he is supportive of some of the liberal issues he has criticized
[03:29:34.720 --> 03:29:39.440]  scottis and criticized this decision he said look i used to be a prosecutor this is like a police
[03:29:39.440 --> 03:29:45.840]  chief holding a press conference and saying uh district attorney don't you dare indict this person
[03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:49.520]  that's not the job of the police chief he's supposed to be an investigator stay with us
[03:29:49.520 --> 03:30:02.000]  to be right back with your calls we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:08.240]  oh snap you've heard of the thought police but how about the food police corrupt regulators and
[03:30:08.240 --> 03:30:14.960]  the government are choosing winners and losers once again by snap i mean food stamps formally known
[03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:20.080]  as the supplemental nutritional assistance program the wall street journal reports that
[03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:29.200]  authoritarian new rules from the usda mandate that retailers must now stock a list of 168 items on
[03:30:29.200 --> 03:30:35.200]  their shelves at all times while corporate grocers and big box retailers already have the
[03:30:35.200 --> 03:30:42.880]  infrastructure and distribution channels to conform to the strict news standards as many as 195 000
[03:30:42.880 --> 03:30:49.120]  small retailers will undoubtedly suffer a significant gut punch to their bottom line tens of millions
[03:30:49.120 --> 03:30:55.120]  of food stamps recipients will have far fewer options thus expanding the phenomenon of food
[03:30:55.120 --> 03:31:02.320]  desert i'm ashley beckford for info wars dot com stay tuned for more special reports not a group

[03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:25.600]  moment i want to finish up with what i was about to say about hillary clinton and fbi director
[03:34:25.600 --> 03:34:32.320]  comey he has been told that the congress would like to talk to him tomorrow they'd like to have
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:40.160]  a sit down and say please explain to us the not only the double talk but the double think behind
[03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:47.040]  saying that hillary clinton committed all these felonies okay 110 emails were classified he admits
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:51.280]  that were sent and received as classified and then of course there were thousands more they say
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:56.880]  we're classified later and we've talked about that how if she has a conversation with another
[03:34:56.880 --> 03:35:03.280]  head of state another uh state department official in another country those are born classified
[03:35:03.280 --> 03:35:07.920]  now she can start sending out emails about that right away before somebody in the state department
[03:35:07.920 --> 03:35:13.120]  takes a look at the content and says wait a minute that should be secret top secret above top secret
[03:35:13.760 --> 03:35:18.320]  and that's the prevarication that she was allowed to get away with but at the very least he said
[03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:23.120]  look there's 110 of these things okay and then when i heard this i told my wife i said i said
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:29.200]  i can't believe it he's gonna indict her but then he lays out the criminal charges and says
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:34.400]  never mind but don't you try this at home because we'll send you to jail and we talked a little bit
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:40.640]  about some of the really egregious prosecutions that have happened with this but they said today
[03:35:40.640 --> 03:35:46.880]  that they want fbi director james comey to go before congress tomorrow to explain his decision
[03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:53.120]  that he's not recommending criminal charges and again as lionel pointed out yesterday a former
[03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:59.680]  prosecutor why would the investigator tell the prosecutors the judges what to do and he pointed
[03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:05.120]  out he says look he's giving political cover to loretta lynch he's saying nobody in the right
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:09.200]  mind would do it so of course loretta lynch won't do it they're covering for each other folks
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:15.760]  it's just disgusting to see this and one of the things that was interesting was even paul ryan
[03:36:15.760 --> 03:36:21.520]  got in on this and said that mrs clinton should be barred from receiving classified information
[03:36:22.320 --> 03:36:27.200]  now all of you who are shaking your heads in derision and poo pooing this on the left let me
[03:36:27.200 --> 03:36:36.640]  just remind you when this happened to uh george um i'm sorry to uh deutch john deutch okay he was
[03:36:36.640 --> 03:36:44.800]  the cia director under bill clinton and this was uh like 20 years ago right so 1995 to 96
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:52.720]  when he left in 96 they found that he had taken documents home to his residents to his office he
[03:36:52.720 --> 03:36:57.760]  had them on a computer that was not secure and they came after him very hard and one of the
[03:36:57.760 --> 03:37:02.000]  things that they did was they suspended his clearance washington post reported this back in
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:07.680]  august of 1999 and he didn't have a problem with it doigt said the time he said while serving as
[03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:13.280]  director of central intelligence i aired and using cia issued computers that were not configured
[03:37:13.280 --> 03:37:18.480]  for classified work to compose classified documents and memoranda he said while it was
[03:37:18.480 --> 03:37:23.680]  absolutely necessary for me to work at home and while on travel in hindsight it's clear that i
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:28.080]  should have insisted that i'd be provided the means of accomplishing this work in a manner
[03:37:28.080 --> 03:37:34.800]  fully consistent with security rules this is bill clinton's cia director who he subsequently
[03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:41.200]  had to pardon to keep the guy from going to jail so clearly they know this and so it's not out of
[03:37:41.200 --> 03:37:47.440]  line at all for paul ryan and others to say hillary clinton should be barred from handling
[03:37:47.440 --> 03:37:54.240]  classified information because she's extremely careless with it i would say grossly negligent
[03:37:54.240 --> 03:37:58.480]  because that's basically the two of those things are indistinguishable from each other
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:03.280]  okay that's a distinction without a difference to say that she's grossly negligent or extremely
[03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:08.480]  careless and understand that when the inspector general was looking at doigt and investigating
[03:38:08.480 --> 03:38:15.440]  him he said he criticized cia officials because he said they didn't submit the reports on a timely
[03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:20.640]  basis so there's reasonable basis to believe that doigt's mishandling of classified information
[03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:25.600]  violated the standards prescribed and that it had the result of delaying a prompt and thorough
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:33.360]  investigation delayed he was charged within 10 days they didn't go in and say to his lawyers
[03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:38.720]  would you please review his personal effects and tell us which ones were going to be allowed to
[03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:42.560]  see and which ones were not going to be allowed to see as they did with hillary clinton they didn't
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:50.880]  allow doigt former cia director to have his lawyers delete in a way that can't be recovered
[03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:55.040]  information on his computer no they didn't do that they afforded that protection however to
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:39:01.040]  hillary clinton just absolutely amazing and real quickly i want to play this clip because last
[03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:06.160]  august i talked to thomas drake and i think his case is one of the most egregious because he was
[03:39:06.160 --> 03:39:10.880]  a whistleblower one of the whistleblowers but he was the one that they tried to put away tried to
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:18.640]  put in jail one of the people who came after him said to him uh you're screwed mr drake we have
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:23.760]  enough evidence to put you away from most of the rest of your natural life and drake said they'd
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:29.120]  made me into an enemy of the state just by saying that i was one because he was a whistleblower
[03:39:29.120 --> 03:39:36.080]  because he had told the american public that the nsa was spying on us without a search warrant
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:40.960]  they were doing dragnet surveillance of the american public he believed the constitution
[03:39:40.960 --> 03:39:45.600]  and he believed the american people should be informed when their government violates that
[03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:51.360]  constitution and he went through a lot of channels uh to do it properly and congress wasn't interested
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:57.360]  in isn't that interesting the congress didn't care okay information eventually got out they came
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:40:03.280]  after him and he said this he said my public defenders filed a motion showing just how far
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:09.280]  and he said uh uh bill lennard had never seen such egregious violation of the classification
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:16.000]  standards that he used to lead okay so here's a guy who's defending him who used to set up these
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  standards and he said uh all of the charging documents that they they tried to send him to
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:28.480]  jail for 35 years all of the documents they used to charge him to indict him he said all of those
[03:40:28.480 --> 03:40:34.480]  all of those were unclassified but the government had pre-textually determined for their own convenience
[03:40:34.480 --> 03:40:39.760]  that they were highly classified here's a couple of examples what a success it was a document
[03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:44.480]  that was a subject of the first count there's four documents i believe it was classified as
[03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:50.720]  secret on the day they found it in his house it wasn't classified as secret before okay but
[03:40:50.720 --> 03:40:55.760]  they indicted him for that that was a document that was not transmitted or received as a classified
[03:40:55.760 --> 03:41:01.040]  document but they wanted to hang him because he was a whistleblower just like they've come after
[03:41:01.040 --> 03:41:07.840]  journalists just like obama has come after more people combined under the 1917 espionage act than
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:14.640]  all the previous presidents in this 100 years so you've got an administration that has been more
[03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:20.240]  aggressive about this than any other administration yet they let hillary clinton go and here's one
[03:41:20.240 --> 03:41:24.480]  of the other documents that he had there this was another one that was marked unclassified
[03:41:24.480 --> 03:41:31.840]  and it was a schedule of meetings about a project called turbulence didn't say anything about the
[03:41:32.480 --> 03:41:37.840]  project itself it was a list of meetings that they'd had and this project was finished okay
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:44.400]  they also posted it on the nsa's internal website the government argued that the schedule should
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:49.840]  have been classified so it's marked unclassified and they said this should have been classified
[03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:54.720]  and drake you should have known this should have been classified so they don't say to hillary clinton
[03:41:54.720 --> 03:41:59.280]  you should have known these conversations with other heads of state should have been classified
[03:41:59.280 --> 03:42:04.160]  they don't say that to her but they say that to him about a schedule of meetings they said
[03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:09.600]  this marked unclassified they say you should have known this is classified and uh we're
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:14.720]  going to put you away for the rest of your life i want to play a quick quick excerpt from uh the
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:20.720]  interview i had with thomas drake last august and so they came after me with everything they had
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:27.040]  and uh ironically enough it's the very documents that in a whole or apart i'd given to government
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:34.160]  investigators looking at thin thread uh trailblazer and that and 9 11 intelligence and they're all
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:41.200]  unclassified and so ultimately you know they took them they forced you know forced classification
[03:42:41.200 --> 03:42:45.920]  review decided they were a super top secret that uh many of them would cause exceptionally great
[03:42:45.920 --> 03:42:50.720]  damage to the united states of america decide naskier united states if it was disclosed and then
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:58.000]  it took them uh from november 2007 all the way until april of 2010 now under obama not under
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:06.560]  bush but under obama to find a way to uh indict me and they indicted me under the 1917 world war
[03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:11.360]  one air espionage act and that's of course been a favorite of the abomb administration he's
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:15.440]  indicted more people under that act than all the previous presidents for the past hundred years
[03:43:15.440 --> 03:43:20.800]  combined uh lanny lanny brewer was the one who oversaw your prosecution of course he was the one
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:24.880]  who let the banks uh who were doing money laundering for drug cartels and terrorists he let them go
[03:43:24.880 --> 03:43:31.280]  saying they were too big to jail yeah that's a patriot right there folks thomas drake he put
[03:43:31.280 --> 03:43:36.160]  everything on the line he lost everything he lost his job his pension uh paid the financial
[03:43:36.160 --> 03:43:43.280]  price almost went to jail for 35 years and look at again documents that were marked unclassified
[03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:46.880]  and they said you should have known they should have been secret and we're going to say that's the
[03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:50.800]  case uh it should have been secret should have been higher more highly classified and you should
[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:55.200]  have known that another one that wasn't marked classified at all and then they classified that
[03:43:55.200 --> 03:44:01.520]  day and then they unclassified it uh three months later and as this trial came to uh the day that
[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:06.160]  it was supposed to begin they dropped all the cases the charges against him because it had become
[03:44:06.160 --> 03:44:13.120]  public let's go to uh joe and fema joe you want to weigh in on this go ahead fema too watching
[03:44:14.640 --> 03:44:22.160]  watching alex talk to ron paul uh trying to bring him over to trumps i guess support or
[03:44:22.160 --> 03:44:28.640]  momentum i noticed something about ron paul that was a little bit disturbing i've been supporting
[03:44:28.640 --> 03:44:34.960]  him for years and i'm a firm believer in austrian economics and i've also been to libertarian
[03:44:34.960 --> 03:44:41.760]  meetings up here in new york and i won't digress on that but anyway when alex hit
[03:44:42.960 --> 03:44:50.400]  ron paul point blank with uh supporting trump i noticed i really noticed ron paul going to a rant
[03:44:51.040 --> 03:44:54.960]  always going over the place you never know what it's gonna say flip flops he changes his mind
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:45:00.160]  almost sounded like a woman i don't mean that disrespectfully but uh i kind of think that
[03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:05.440]  it might be a good idea if you can get those two in a room together perhaps because it's imperative
[03:45:07.280 --> 03:45:13.440]  support of ron paul's imperative and i don't know what's going on with ron paul i mean i
[03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:19.520]  diligently supported him watched him get shot down watched the media laughing his face watched
[03:45:19.520 --> 03:45:24.880]  the man the mainstream media laughing his son's face watched everybody degrade him to pour him
[03:45:25.520 --> 03:45:29.920]  and now here's a situation where i know i understand it's a little bit different than the
[03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:36.000]  former of austrian economics and uh the uh let's say schooling that ron paul had but
[03:45:36.720 --> 03:45:41.840]  donald trump it happens to be somebody that can really help us i don't necessarily agree with
[03:45:41.840 --> 03:45:46.880]  everything that he does well i agree i i think that uh you know when you look at the candidates
[03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:51.600]  you're not going to find somebody that agrees with you on all points never okay and i understand
[03:45:51.600 --> 03:45:56.240]  there's a lot of points of disagreement between ron paul between libertarians and between donald
[03:45:56.240 --> 03:46:00.400]  trump i have those points of disagreement as well but you have to also understand and i would hope
[03:46:00.400 --> 03:46:05.600]  that ron paul would understand the vital issue before us right now where we do have a choice
[03:46:05.600 --> 03:46:11.120]  and it may be a hobson's choice but it is still a choice it's a clear choice and that is globalism
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:16.560]  versus nationalism as i've said before as decisions are taken away from the individual
[03:46:16.560 --> 03:46:20.880]  and given to the local community as they move from the local community to the state leveled
[03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:26.000]  then from there to the national level every time you go up another level every time those
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:31.520]  decisions get more distant from the individual it's harder and harder to get those things back
[03:46:31.520 --> 03:46:36.240]  we're at the point right now where we've had so much of our decisions on our lives being made
[03:46:36.240 --> 03:46:41.680]  at the national level they've intruded themselves into every aspect of our lives and i have to say
[03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:46.720]  that if we now go from the national level to the international level if we give up and
[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:52.240]  surrender our sovereignty and ron paul knows that nafta isn't free trade i mean we can have a debate
[03:46:52.240 --> 03:46:58.400]  about the uh the abstract issues of free trade and austrian economics and so forth
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:02.800]  but it's not free trade and ron paul has said that nafta is not free trade he said you don't need
[03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:08.080]  a thousand page agreement to have free trade you just have free trade right you take down the barriers
[03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:12.560]  but what it is is managed trade and now what we're seeing is something that is many times
[03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:17.680]  larger than that and it's not even economically based but just if you look at the economics i mean
[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:22.720]  of course it controls our internet freedoms and other issues but even if you look at the economics
[03:47:22.720 --> 03:47:27.840]  these decisions are going to be made economically they're going to control our economy it's going
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:32.960]  to be made by an organization that is not accountable to us and senator sessions has
[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:39.200]  pointed out it will be a living document which means that whatever the five thousand pages
[03:47:39.200 --> 03:47:47.040]  initially say they can change it just like that okay no input or questioning or control from us
[03:47:47.040 --> 03:47:52.240]  and so i would think that that would be a big issue to me that's a key reason to vote for
[03:47:52.240 --> 03:47:56.800]  donald trump even though i disagree with him on things like uh tear uh torture and so forth
[03:47:56.800 --> 03:48:02.480]  and how they would prosecute the war on terror but i there are reasons strong reasons to vote
[03:48:02.480 --> 03:48:07.680]  against globalism i mean that is crony capitalism that we will never get back i mean do you agree
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:13.920]  yes i do i do but i i also think it's imperative that these two get together somehow because
[03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:19.280]  they're fighting for the same thing it might not be spelled out the same way but meanwhile
[03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:25.600]  it's their camp divided right now and donald trump needs the momentum that ron paul could afford him
[03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:31.520]  if he just says okay you know i understand this guy's not really my cup of tea but it's better
[03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:37.520]  than what hillary i mean it's much better yeah and they do we can get them into a room together
[03:48:37.520 --> 03:48:42.640]  somehow like i don't know two disputing couples or something i don't know well i don't know and i
[03:48:42.640 --> 03:48:46.480]  don't i don't know what's going on the libertarian party either i mean i'm looking at this article
[03:48:46.480 --> 03:48:50.880]  gary johnson says hillary is no criminal and gary johnson comes out says i'm not a stone throw
[03:48:50.880 --> 03:48:54.320]  when it comes to hillary clinton their emails or server i don't think there's been any criminal
[03:48:54.320 --> 03:48:58.880]  intent on hillary clinton's part i don't see an indictment it's like really i mean gary johnson
[03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:04.640]  has become a stalking horse for hillary clinton since when does the rule of law not matter since
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:10.080]  when does the constitution not matter since when do we have double standards for the big guys and
[03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:15.840]  the little guys okay why is that not an issue for libertarian that was a core issue when i was
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:20.240]  involved in libertarian party we really did care about the rule of law and it was interesting in
[03:49:20.240 --> 03:49:25.040]  this article it was from the libertarian republic they talk about a cnn town hall and they did a
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:31.520]  word association game with gary johnson and william weld who's running with him and they threw out
[03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:37.280]  it said hillary clinton and johnson comes back and says a wonderful public servant really i mean
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:44.080]  who else who else would say this absolutely amazing bill dwell says old friend and then says
[03:49:44.080 --> 03:49:50.960]  we have a lifelong bond okay then they throw out obama's name and johnson says good guy weld says
[03:49:50.960 --> 03:49:56.960]  statesman like you know what i think i think the real word association would be when they throw out
[03:49:56.960 --> 03:50:03.440]  names like hillary clinton and obama it would be goldman sacks kaching kaching here's where my payoff
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:08.240]  comes here's why i get the money from the coke brothers and goldman sacks here's where i get my
[03:50:08.240 --> 03:50:14.400]  government subsidy if i get above five percent i am really disgusted with the libertarian party
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:19.600]  and i gotta say that at the same time i've seen the green party with whom i agree with virtually
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:27.200]  nothing have the integrity to come out uh this is jill stein says uh that the uh that hillary clinton
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:31.440]  should be prosecuted she said all the elements necessary to prove felony violation were found
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:37.120]  by the fbi investigation and then listed by comey she said her staff has said secretary clinton
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:40.800]  stated she will use her private email system because she didn't want her personal emails
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:45.680]  become accessible she said this is damning on two counts jill stein said that she intended to
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:50.560]  disregard the protection of security information and that she had personal business to conceal look
[03:50:51.520 --> 03:50:56.080]  i totally disagree with her there's much that i would agree with on policy with the libertarian
[03:50:56.080 --> 03:51:01.120]  party not necessarily gary johnson but we've got to start with integrity if the people are crooks
[03:51:01.120 --> 03:51:05.920]  we don't have anything stay with us we'll be right back my name is don whiskin and at 42 years old

[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:23.600]  of callers who called in about Goose for evidently there's some reports online we haven't been able
[03:54:23.600 --> 03:54:31.280]  to verify those yet that Goose for died in jail of course Goose for was the hacker who broke in I
[03:54:31.280 --> 03:54:35.440]  actually I think it was one of the the first indications of Hillary Clinton's private emails
[03:54:35.440 --> 03:54:42.160]  but he also got Bush calling Powell Tony Blair talking about the Bohemian Grove and so forth
[03:54:42.160 --> 03:54:48.720]  and so on he's not even an engineer software engineer this is a guy who just made educated
[03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:54.320]  guesses at passwords and worked his way in and got these emails it really does underscore
[03:54:55.120 --> 03:55:02.080]  just how vulnerable Hillary Clinton's emails were and it underscores why we should not have
[03:55:02.080 --> 03:55:07.120]  this double standard folks everything that our government has done for the last 15 years has
[03:55:07.120 --> 03:55:12.000]  been in the name of the security state and they have eviscerated the rule of law they have eviscerated
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:18.240]  the Constitution in the name of the security state to keep us safe and yet she has information
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:24.160]  that is above top secret information that not only gives private conversations about people but
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:31.360]  also puts people in the field puts their lives directly at risk and she walks how can they with
[03:55:31.360 --> 03:55:37.520]  a straight face anymore continue to violate our Constitution okay they can't even make the weak
[03:55:37.520 --> 03:55:43.200]  case that they made before real quickly just want to remind you we have 20 off survival shield x2
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:48.800]  all Alexa peer water filters all Alexa peer air filters that's an extension of the July 4th

[03:55:55.760 --> 03:56:00.160]  the callers about goose for a mic into Mexico go ahead Mike what do you know about this and what's
[03:56:00.160 --> 03:56:05.360]  your source I was going Dave um I just heard about that last night and I was trying to figure
[03:56:05.360 --> 03:56:10.000]  away to talk to you guys but uh I don't know if it's true or not but I haven't seen anything
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:14.720]  really just proving it but it said something along the lines of uh he was missing and then
[03:56:14.720 --> 03:56:18.480]  he they found him and he had committed suicide and I just thought I would hear Alex president
[03:56:18.480 --> 03:56:23.680]  Raven about it was was he uh what did he was he lifting weights so he dropped like a dumbbell
[03:56:23.680 --> 03:56:27.600]  on his neck or something like that you an ambassador that was going to embarrass Hillary
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:32.240]  Clinton I mean we've got it's you know it is believable that something like this could happen
[03:56:32.240 --> 03:56:37.760]  because he was at the center of all of this but uh I can't verify that it has yet go ahead yeah I
[03:56:37.760 --> 03:56:42.000]  just wanted to tell everyone to do it but you guys haven't tried the products yet you don't know
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:47.200]  what you're missing I tried them uh three years ago started with that Nathan iodine uh now I'm

[03:57:09.440 --> 03:57:13.360]  I tell you what I do it and it works for me and there's the limit as to what I can say but I
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:18.560]  certainly uh it is something we do our best to offer you the best quality products and that's
[03:57:18.560 --> 03:57:22.800]  the way we fund our operations what keeps us independent so we're not at the mercy of someone
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:27.680]  who can pull the rug out from under us if they don't like a report that we did so that's the way
[03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:32.240]  you keep the information free that's the way you provide for your own health and that of your family

[03:57:38.160 --> 03:57:42.400]  you've been holding for a while go ahead we've only got a couple of minutes left real quick
[03:57:42.400 --> 03:57:50.400]  yeah hi david hey um my biggest thing is about all this and I haven't heard anybody really bringing
[03:57:50.400 --> 03:57:56.400]  up yet um there's a possibility of hillary actually getting into the lighthouse becomes
[03:57:56.400 --> 03:58:03.440]  um more and more of a likelihood people are you know myself and every everybody in my next
[03:58:03.440 --> 03:58:09.040]  to the woods and we've got about 30 seconds and everything go quick um I'm people don't know what
[03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:14.000]  to do leave the country is definitely not an option for me I think state's discussion don't
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:19.040]  know what you said before about everything moving away from the individual I think the state's
[03:58:19.040 --> 03:58:22.880]  you know where we need to get our rights back first of all and that's right saying that I think
[03:58:22.880 --> 03:58:27.600]  the state I agree I think I think the play at this point is to try to stop it from getting
[03:58:27.600 --> 03:58:32.000]  more consolidated and then try to work at the grassroots level during nullification state
[03:58:32.000 --> 03:58:36.400]  nullification get our freedom back that way I agree join us tonight seven central apm eastern
