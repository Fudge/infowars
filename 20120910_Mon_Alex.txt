[00:45.640 --> 00:54.880]  that have been used to absolutely butcher and wreck our constitutional Republic and
[00:54.880 --> 01:01.240]  I will be covering a lot of false flag news and information tomorrow on the
[01:01.240 --> 01:07.400]  syndicated radio transmission we will also cover a ton of news today we've

[01:57.480 --> 02:01.760]  I'm not one of these talk show hosts it's actually a blessing and a curse who
[02:01.760 --> 02:06.480]  needs everything scripted and has to have everything highlighted and you know
[02:06.480 --> 02:13.200]  covers five stories in three hours I could talk for 20 hours straight on one
[02:13.200 --> 02:20.520]  subject that makes me angry the nanny state eugenics the fake drug war how
[02:20.520 --> 02:24.760]  we've been captured by private federal reserve now the gear up towards huge
[02:24.760 --> 02:31.120]  wars all of it I could talk about this one article that I'll get to at the

[02:36.040 --> 02:42.160]  Higgins former reporter Amber Lyon exposes massive censorship at CNN and
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.200]  it's a London Guardian article out on it but Alexander Higgins breaks down and
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.200]  does what I like he connects to other cases of this which not just one person
[02:51.200 --> 02:58.400]  but but but more full spectrum. CNN has been caught staging fake massacres
[02:58.400 --> 03:05.120]  actually carried out by Al Caeda and then blaming it on Libya blaming it on
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.640]  Syria so they can devolve and destroy the country not take out a bad guy put
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.520]  somebody good in which is immoral itself because it's offensive it always
[03:13.520 --> 03:16.640]  turns bad that's why the founders were against it that's how this road to
[03:16.640 --> 03:20.240]  empire starts oh we're spreading freedom yeah sure like our government putting
[03:20.240 --> 03:26.080]  Mao in in 49 our government helping fund Hitler I mean this is all on record
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.760]  our government along with the British government put Lenin in in 1917 1918 I
[03:31.760 --> 03:36.320]  mean this is all in congressional reports by the way when McCarthy found it
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.240]  all out they destroyed him in a matter of days in the media oh he's crazy he's
[03:40.240 --> 03:43.560]  a drunk that they were using McCarthy when he was just pushing a police state
[03:43.560 --> 03:48.640]  against file clerks and secretaries because hey fighting the Soviet Union you
[03:48.640 --> 03:52.480]  could turn into the Soviet Union the name of fighting tyranny but when he said
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.480]  hey the army runs the Soviets oh you're crazy you're you're out of here now it's
[03:56.480 --> 04:00.120]  all been declassified even the New York Times run headlines like McCarthy was
[04:00.120 --> 04:05.320]  right Russian archive show but it wasn't that the Russians were infiltrating us
[04:05.320 --> 04:10.480]  the bankers were funding authoritarianism everywhere and Bill Clinton's mentor at
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.160]  Georgetown wrote a 1400 page I kept saying 1100 because the version I had
[04:15.160 --> 04:19.360]  was that has been republished with the full bibliography of tragedy and hope we

[04:26.960 --> 04:31.160]  archives I was led into the council on farm relations archives and how they
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.320]  fund authoritarianism whatever flavor you want it's you know hot and cold
[04:35.320 --> 04:41.160]  running to the tyrants it doesn't matter centralized is the name anti-freedom

[08:49.080 --> 08:56.960]  up today fate of Eurozone rest in the hands of German judges well this is just
[08:56.960 --> 09:00.880]  all part of this bailout bailout that's really a tax transfer to the banksters
[09:00.880 --> 09:08.360]  we're gonna be going over that we're also going to get into the bond king says
[09:08.360 --> 09:14.680]  buy gold not bonds that's out of Bloomberg Bill Gross says that's where it
[09:14.680 --> 09:20.640]  set in the future double down the Vladimir Putin billions into gold in
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.560]  anticipation of global upheaval that's being reported on by AP Reuters you
[09:26.560 --> 09:33.120]  name it continuing judge says 10 rare gold coins worth 80 million belong to
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.080]  Uncle Sam now I saw this last Thursday and thought I knew what it was but I
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.760]  didn't have time to go research it until yesterday and I mentioned it on the
[09:40.760 --> 09:45.360]  Sunday show but never got to it I will cover the bottom of the next hour got a
[09:45.360 --> 09:48.760]  guest coming on about this it's so important when I saw this I thought
[09:48.760 --> 09:55.680]  wait that's a st. God in 1933 that's the executive order on confiscation but
[09:55.680 --> 09:59.880]  but the Associated Press ABC News they wouldn't explain it so I went to the
[09:59.880 --> 10:07.400]  case and did confirm that they confiscated it under a 1933 executive
[10:07.400 --> 10:11.520]  order and we've got a criminal government doesn't matter if it's your
[10:11.520 --> 10:19.560]  gold they say that 80 years ago you should have turned this in well my great
[10:19.560 --> 10:25.560]  grandfather my my grandfather's father he's saying my my grandmother's father
[10:25.560 --> 10:30.520]  my grandfather's father in Dallas he didn't turn his in that was just general
[10:30.520 --> 10:33.440]  gold they just had turned it in in fact they were even trying to get your
[10:33.440 --> 10:39.240]  jewelry and American people many of them lined up and went along with this so I
[10:39.240 --> 10:44.760]  want to explain just how criminal this government is and here's the deal if they
[10:44.760 --> 10:48.560]  say turn your gold in you've got to say no I mean if they say turn your kids over
[10:48.560 --> 10:51.800]  to me you've got to say no if they say jump off a cliff you've got to say no
[10:51.800 --> 10:56.840]  this is a group of criminals so we're going to be breaking all of that down
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.920]  coming up today and looking at what's happening a Walmart struggling to
[11:00.920 --> 11:07.000]  survive on only four billion on their second quarter isn't it funny they used
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.560]  to make you know ten times that some quarters but I guess you know globalism
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.280]  deindustrialization people don't have the jobs anymore to buy your goods made
[11:16.280 --> 11:21.400]  by Chinese slaves so it's it's it's following its inevitable end which is
[11:21.400 --> 11:26.200]  in a 21 the designed implosion and then Walmart will be more of a government
[11:26.200 --> 11:30.240]  reclamation center as it's already been planned kind of a relocation processing
[11:30.240 --> 11:33.600]  centers they admit they've been prepared for oh you didn't know that look it up
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.600]  George Thoros says that Germany should back growth or leave euro that means
[11:39.600 --> 11:45.400]  give more money to the bankers or get out pony up to the bankers or or get out
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.080]  well that don't worry they they probably will get out but then that'll just be
[11:49.080 --> 11:54.600]  into a bankruptcy under the mega banks continuing rising food prices need to
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.680]  climb with prices up 10% in July alone but there's no inflation because we've
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.600]  got all of these government numbers on inflation out there and they say it's
[12:04.600 --> 12:09.520]  quite low even though any of you out there know things cost more and that you
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.440]  get paid less on average with your jobs there's bad unemployment but the real
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.000]  thing is it's working poor with people working for seven eight nine ten
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.880]  dollars an hour which then if you're in the system and and try to actually pay
[12:23.880 --> 12:29.360]  for things you can't live on by yourself hardly much less with children but
[12:29.360 --> 12:32.760]  don't worry you don't have to pay for daycare now all over the country they're
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.080]  having government run heads start for two three four-year-olds so the state
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.920]  gets your children but see people with property taxes are paying for that as
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.600]  the economy goes under which is also part of the plan implode the economy
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.920]  while you consolidate it then poses the saviors agenda 21 so we're going to
[12:50.920 --> 12:54.600]  continue along that line another reporter of the economic collapse blog
[12:54.600 --> 12:57.280]  breaking down the numbers the real unemployment numbers are worse than
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.920]  you're being told that is just some of what is coming up inside GM vault the
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.000]  ugly math and low sales high-cost Reuters well yeah why aren't we talking
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.320]  about the fact that vaults built in China now or that your tax money paid to
[13:10.320 --> 13:16.600]  move it there again doing everything they can to wreck the economy because in a
[13:16.600 --> 13:23.800]  planned economy that is the name of the game so that is just some of the news
[13:23.800 --> 13:29.800]  that we have there now continuing here ladies and gentlemen with some of the
[13:29.800 --> 13:36.160]  news that we're going to be drilling into today up at info wars.com
[13:36.160 --> 13:43.240]  Rockefellers preside over creation of global journalist group to advance
[13:43.240 --> 13:46.720]  reporting on religion and the Rockefellers set up the World Council of
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.520]  churches that pays off the seminaries and the and the major denominations to
[13:51.520 --> 13:57.000]  promote global governance and a ecumenical merger of religion and that's
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.920]  what's happening there continuing Walmart struggling already broke that down
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.080]  to survive only on four billion man investigated by police for buying
[14:06.080 --> 14:09.480]  ammunition this is part of a wider trim we're going to be going over the
[14:09.480 --> 14:14.160]  declining West tragedy or comedy dr. Paul Craig Roberts again declining West
[14:14.160 --> 14:19.040]  tragedy or comedy president of Italy Supreme Court to refer 9-11 crimes
[14:19.040 --> 14:26.560]  international criminal court says that the government of the West staged it as
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.480]  a false flag similar to Operation Gladio and the strategy of tension in Italy
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.080]  that the Italian intelligence agency declassified more than a decade ago that
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.640]  with the US NATO in England as well as Germany through NATO hundreds of bombings
[14:42.640 --> 14:48.440]  mass shootings were staged at movie theaters mm-hmm oh by the way I sent
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.280]  that to a dawn over the weekend it's actually in Denver papers that it's now
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.920]  in court survivors with reports of multiple shooters in it being a staged
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.200]  event so that's now hit the mainstream we print me that I forgot to send that
[15:01.200 --> 15:05.000]  to the producers here only send it to a dawn just ask a dawn and they're asking
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.080]  to investigate it more to print me those articles thank you so we're gonna be a
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.160]  movie theaters shooting and bombing and blowing up buses shooting up schools
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.840]  it's what NATO would do in the right wing or left wing group I didn't care
[15:17.840 --> 15:20.880]  sort of actually trying to be nationalistic and didn't want NATO the
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.400]  narcotics trafficking bankers to control their country they would just shoot up a
[15:24.400 --> 15:28.720]  school and blame it on your group they would grab a patchy inject him into the
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.600]  frontal lobe with PCP that basically you know will make you completely insane
[15:33.600 --> 15:37.800]  and brain damage for several years on average and then tell the person that
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.760]  you'll stop torturing them if they remember that they did the shooting they
[15:41.760 --> 15:47.080]  also use electroconvulsive therapy and other little goodies and that's all
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.600]  declassified as well but we should just trust the government continuing here
[15:51.600 --> 15:57.360]  we'll be going over that on the broadcast today also Israel Israel's
[15:57.360 --> 16:03.200]  prime ministers discussing red lines with Iran and with the US but then
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.840]  Hillary responds by saying they're not setting deadlines for Iran Clinton says
[16:07.840 --> 16:15.520]  also continuing along that line we have reports coming out that the that they
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.560]  are preparing for a massive attack so we're going to be getting into that
[16:19.560 --> 16:28.640]  report we're also going to get into Obama who is basically well it's not
[16:28.640 --> 16:35.320]  basically this is Dick Morris calm Obama thugs rough up Gallup for polls they
[16:35.320 --> 16:42.480]  don't like and the truth is Gallup historically has polled ten points for
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.200]  Democrats that doesn't exist in fact I have a stack of articles here showing
[16:46.200 --> 16:54.040]  that Reagan was polling right up to the election in 1980 ten points behind the
[16:54.040 --> 17:01.720]  Democrats and similar numbers in 1984 and again this is just part of the
[17:01.720 --> 17:06.600]  skewing that goes on I mean I told you Nielsen ratings were fake and of course
[17:06.600 --> 17:09.920]  it's come out there fake and I even predicted it would be fake for MSNBC
[17:09.920 --> 17:15.280]  MSNBC doesn't even have the 800,000 viewers on their biggest show there's
[17:15.280 --> 17:18.800]  smaller shows in the middle of the day of maybe a couple hundred thousand and
[17:18.800 --> 17:25.920]  that's with cooked numbers that is pretty darn amazing when you finally
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.480]  actually realize that that that it's that big of a fraud but the sets are big
[17:30.480 --> 17:36.040]  the info babes are there it's all about they're the authority they decide they
[17:36.040 --> 17:41.120]  tell you a nine-month-old baby can be killed in the womb instead of delivered
[17:41.120 --> 17:48.720]  because they say it's a fetus and not a human they say the hydrophoceric you
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.040]  acid is good for you the same thing as calcium fluoride when it's not it's had
[17:54.040 --> 17:57.280]  what is it an electron removed I got to look that up again I was studying that
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.640]  just last week and it's highly toxic they play all these little games with
[18:01.640 --> 18:09.360]  people so we are going to be breaking all of that down today as well
[18:09.360 --> 18:16.080]  continuing here with the news we're going to be breaking down more on the
[18:16.080 --> 18:21.120]  hoax that's ongoing that it's only a hundred seventy four thousand bullets
[18:21.120 --> 18:25.640]  the government's bought and that those of us concerned about the 1.4 billion
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.960]  bullet purchase that we shouldn't be concerned because it's only a hundred
[18:29.960 --> 18:33.680]  seventy four thousand bullets now they don't address that and say hey it's a
[18:33.680 --> 18:37.440]  hundred seventy four thousand they just say hey what's the big controversy over
[18:37.440 --> 18:40.840]  a hundred seventy four thousand bullets they don't they don't even address the
[18:40.840 --> 18:45.200]  1.4 billion are the armored vehicles the pill boxes the checkpoints the army

[24:13.600 --> 24:22.040]  coming up there's more mainstream news reporting that trance England and others
[24:22.040 --> 24:28.040]  are going to openly find al-Qaeda in Syria they've been doing it for the last
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.280]  nine months since they started the sectarian war and trying to overthrow
[24:32.280 --> 24:36.440]  the government and put in groups sworn to kill all the Christians Jews and
[24:36.440 --> 24:46.000]  Muslim minorities just amazing crimes and that's what amber lion of CNN a
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.280]  reporter has quit and gone public with you've had a lot of other reporters quit
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.040]  and go public a New York Times it's turned out you know it's told what's
[24:54.040 --> 25:00.320]  new by the CIA people left NPR and been told they've been told to lie it's just
[25:00.320 --> 25:03.440]  amazing to know that they're taking fathers in Syria and saying we're going
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.200]  to kill you if you don't drive this truck in and blow up that police
[25:07.200 --> 25:12.400]  checkpoint we're going to kill your kids if you don't do it or tell people we're
[25:12.400 --> 25:14.960]  going to let you go now get in this truck and drive down the road and there's
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.640]  really bombs in it then they can say it's a suicide truck it's just it's just
[25:19.640 --> 25:24.920]  incredibly immoral I mean we know we have a corrupt government but it's so
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.040]  ridiculous that they're saying we've got to give our rights up because of al-Qaeda
[25:29.040 --> 25:35.760]  and hyping that all day and then al-Qaeda is literally hiding in in in in
[25:35.760 --> 25:43.880]  granny's granny panties or in your wife's brahm or in your son's pants or
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.320]  in your pants and now the TSA is randomly setting up checkpoints let's
[25:48.320 --> 25:51.560]  just see if someone's on this highway look look we're gonna search your car
[25:51.560 --> 25:54.520]  randomly because it might be al-Qaeda in there now they're like oh don't worry
[25:54.520 --> 26:00.360]  about al-Qaeda we're looking for guns but guns aren't illegal we're looking for
[26:00.360 --> 26:03.760]  drugs will you ship those in we're we're just here violating the Fourth
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.840]  Amendment I mean it's so ridiculous we've been proven right the world
[26:07.840 --> 26:10.880]  government's announced it they're announcing that the police states for
[26:10.880 --> 26:14.800]  us it's all happening I'm gonna go to your phone calls is a short segment but
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.560]  coming up we've got the video man investigated for buying a couple boxes
[26:19.560 --> 26:25.040]  of ammo and they said well a citizen spy in there you know just thought we
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.120]  might need to give you a call and this happened to Linda West out last week one
[26:30.120 --> 26:35.480]  of our reporters right there in front of John bound and others a guy in a suit
[26:35.480 --> 26:39.160]  said oh you want to do some interviews well I got somebody for you and then
[26:39.160 --> 26:43.080]  they're out on the sidewalk downtown and the police were called the police get
[26:43.080 --> 26:47.040]  there and like we're putting their hands out and the guy was waiting down the
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.720]  street taking photos of them and it was this power trip of the Stasi have you
[26:51.720 --> 26:55.440]  haven't studied the Stasi they were the worst of the communists in the way they
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.040]  surveilled and controlled they were hired as consultants ten years ago and
[26:59.040 --> 27:04.080]  that's why we're getting a modern Stasi system and there's all these people that
[27:04.080 --> 27:14.400]  are on these incredible power trips these amazing power trips that that their
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.760]  little secret agents in fact I meant to do this this morning and then I forgot
[27:18.760 --> 27:23.880]  and just gave the general number out and we've got TSA calling from FEMA region
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.400]  seven there's a lot of stuff I want to introduce today but after we take a few
[27:30.400 --> 27:36.400]  rounds of calls I want to open the phones up again after we clear the lines
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.600]  for snitches because again they always start with oh the FBI is having a local
[27:42.600 --> 27:46.760]  community meeting and we'd like to have you know people come in the rural area or
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.440]  in the city you've seen this in the niche to learn how to spot Muslim extremist
[27:51.440 --> 27:54.480]  or Al Qaeda and then you get to the meeting they have free coffee donuts
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.800]  it's two days at a hotel and they show you an Al Qaeda training video and then
[27:58.800 --> 28:02.880]  next it's is your neighbor spanking their kid do they smoke marijuana are they
[28:02.880 --> 28:06.720]  talking about about the government do they have guns and this has been even
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.760]  been the Associated Press where you know they've sat in on the meetings and by
[28:11.760 --> 28:15.880]  the second day it's don't trust that priest he might be a terrorist or that
[28:15.880 --> 28:20.080]  woman with a baby carriage just don't think that and by the way you know let's
[28:20.080 --> 28:23.640]  show some training videos where all the terrorists are white and no one is of
[28:23.640 --> 28:30.800]  another race or group so that's how I knew they were going to flip the script
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.600]  away from Al Qaeda because seven eight years ago it wasn't about Al Qaeda now
[28:34.600 --> 28:40.600]  it's none of it's about Al Qaeda it's all about do they talk about about
[28:40.600 --> 28:44.120]  government they talk about a new world order they have a Ron Paul sticker do
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.120]  they have an Aaron Russo video do they have an Alex Jones video do they talk
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.360]  about info wars.com and they get the cops in the briefing rooms we have video
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.320]  of it and actually badmouth George Washington I mean yeah you've heard
[28:56.320 --> 28:59.840]  cops calling ago yeah no they badmouth George Washington they have the feds
[28:59.840 --> 29:04.880]  committee what we I imagine a movie 20 years ago where the government starts
[29:04.880 --> 29:08.640]  saying George Washington is bad you'd expect the cops would go wow we've been
[29:08.640 --> 29:12.000]  taken over and there'd be a counter-revolution but now it's just yeah
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.840]  George Washington is bad and better not talk about him because we're the good
[29:15.840 --> 29:21.480]  guys and so it's gotten to the point where their little snitches actually are
[29:21.480 --> 29:25.080]  trying to intimidate people like our free speech bed hey let me explain
[29:25.080 --> 29:30.000]  something you're not gonna get to the point of intimidation people are lazy
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.600]  in America they're not scared on average so thank you for trying to
[29:33.600 --> 29:38.360]  intimidate people you're getting folks awake and mad to tell us to shut up
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.440]  tell us we don't have free speech threatened to arrest us all you're doing

[32:39.280 --> 32:43.160]  foods the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it
[32:43.160 --> 32:46.600]  stores for 25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising
[32:46.600 --> 32:52.480]  food cost don't wait call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foods direct.com forward slash
[32:52.480 --> 32:57.960]  Alex call 800-409-5633 or e-foods direct.com forward slash Alex you can
[32:57.960 --> 33:01.400]  get your life on e-foods direct
[33:03.000 --> 33:11.400]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving
[33:11.400 --> 33:16.280]  this transmission you are the resistance
[33:16.280 --> 33:27.480]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region six Austin Texas transmitting
[33:27.480 --> 33:32.400]  worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:32.400 --> 33:47.880]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live and I am gonna put a sock in it and go
[33:47.880 --> 33:53.400]  right to your phone calls then coming up we're gonna look at how agenda 21 UN
[33:53.400 --> 34:00.240]  governance is taking over not just big cities but small towns all over America
[34:00.240 --> 34:04.760]  including right outside Austin Texas in Elgin I'm coming to you from deep in the
[34:04.760 --> 34:09.720]  heart of Texas wherever you're listening in Australia or Germany or Sudan or
[34:09.720 --> 34:14.640]  Mexico and again I am your host Alex Jones then we will get into after we
[34:14.640 --> 34:19.800]  take some calls they're now trying to harass gun owners in a new way this has
[34:19.800 --> 34:25.320]  been going on for a while but now it's accelerating also this started getting
[34:25.320 --> 34:29.120]  attention last Friday but I've had time to look into it more the federal
[34:29.120 --> 34:33.560]  government's running multiple ad campaigns dealing with zombie apocalypse
[34:33.560 --> 34:40.760]  homeland security is and they're saying get ready basically for collapse and now
[34:40.760 --> 34:47.000]  zombies are an archetypal metaphor for basically welfare hordes not getting
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.120]  their checks and I described it as as a zombie like apocalypse for over a
[34:53.120 --> 34:59.600]  decade and now zombies are even more popular than vampires that it's in
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.720]  almost all advertising it is it is ubiquitous now with media that they're
[35:04.720 --> 35:13.320]  promoting zombies and death and that society is soon going to collapse there
[35:13.320 --> 35:16.920]  is a massive preparation for this being made and I'm going to be getting into
[35:16.920 --> 35:23.000]  that and it integrates them with Time magazine writers like Joel Stein coming
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.160]  out and saying hey I want to see a beauty pageant with dead babies I've
[35:27.160 --> 35:31.360]  learned you know watching the stupid right-winger pro-lifers with their signs
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.520]  which which dead babies are more attractive so it's just all part of
[35:35.520 --> 35:42.920]  searing your conscious mind preparing you acclimating you to accept death and
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.880]  destruction and not have empathy for your fellow humans Roman historians wrote
[35:46.880 --> 35:50.520]  about how they use gladiatorial events to to train people that it was
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.360]  entertaining to see a woman and her children torn apart by lions and even
[35:55.360 --> 36:00.360]  Romans who got in trouble politically would then be thrown to the lions later
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.520]  after Rome degenerated and it didn't matter if your neighbor was being killed
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.520]  this week or that would or that you would be dying next week it was a culture
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.320]  that cheered its own destruction and imminent collapse so I'll be getting into
[36:15.320 --> 36:18.840]  all of that again the toll-free number of the phones are loaded but if you want
[36:18.840 --> 36:23.360]  to join us after I go to this group of calls all additional calls that come in
[36:23.360 --> 36:30.080]  after these first few groups of phone calls I do want to hear from some of the
[36:30.080 --> 36:34.760]  snitches out there have you been recruited by InfraGuard have you been
[36:34.760 --> 36:40.240]  recruited by clergy response teams have you been recruited as a citizen spy have
[36:40.240 --> 36:45.320]  you finally woken up that you're a dupe you're a collaborator you're an idiot that
[36:45.320 --> 36:48.720]  you're being trained to spy on the American people and their constitutional
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.760]  rights in an attempt to create a Stasi secret police network we had preachers
[36:54.760 --> 36:58.880]  that were recruited for Homeland Security to spy on their flocks seven
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.080]  years ago exposed clergy response teams people didn't believe it at the time it
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.440]  was declassified three years later telling their flocks submit to corrupt
[37:07.440 --> 37:12.920]  government turn your guns in take shots go to the FEMA camp well now it's
[37:12.920 --> 37:16.600]  executives even at the level of McDonald's manager they call that an
[37:16.600 --> 37:22.880]  executive making you know $15 an hour they are now spying on everyone and
[37:22.880 --> 37:29.040]  it's not for terror it's just report back to us so it's extremely creepy what's
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.920]  happened so we'll take some calls on that front now I've given out I've given
[37:32.920 --> 37:38.200]  out calls on two different phone systems I see the Genesis phone system here so
[37:38.200 --> 37:42.800]  I'll go through those calls first and then I will get two callers on the other
[37:42.800 --> 37:52.240]  phone system Scott Info mom John Chuck Lionheart dead Blake and Chris one other
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.800]  thing I want to announce and please put it up on screen we go to each caller if
[37:56.800 --> 38:00.400]  you can at least part of the time I want to start because people are watching us
[38:00.400 --> 38:03.600]  on prison planet TV if you're a new radio listener we're not just doing
[38:03.600 --> 38:08.040]  radio here we're also screaming video at prison planet TV the sister side of
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.680]  prison planet dot com an info wars dot com I want to be able to now let people
[38:12.680 --> 38:16.960]  realize we're under 10 governors on the governor council we're under 10 Pentagon
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.120]  governors under the rural council there are 10 global regions under the UN
[38:21.120 --> 38:26.920]  program publicly look it up 10 mega regions under one control the EU there
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.360]  are 10 regions per country and under the John Warner defense authorization act
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.160]  and all preparations the states are already seen as bankrupt vestigial the
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.840]  federal government is a vestigial ceremonial arm we are fully captured by
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.400]  the foreign banks who brag they've captured us and are running us through
[38:44.400 --> 38:48.600]  emergency reorganization just like in Europe they now admit they're one step
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.520]  ahead of us and collapse by design that in Italy and in Spain and in Greece and
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.120]  other areas as well as Ireland they are now appointing the central bank heads
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.160]  the presidents and prime ministers the banks are and saying we've captured you
[39:04.160 --> 39:07.880]  but we don't owe them the money they put their people in and had us sign on to
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.120]  their derivatives so they had a sign on to their fraud instead of going to jail
[39:12.120 --> 39:16.080]  they're announcing that the troops are in the streets that we have no rights the
[39:16.080 --> 39:19.760]  citizen spies are there they think that intimidates us you know what it doesn't
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.040]  intimidate me scum we're gonna expose you so without further ado I'm gonna give
[39:24.040 --> 39:27.680]  each caller a minute and we're gonna go through the Genesis phone lines first
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.080]  after these calls are cleared it's time for the spies to call in I mean do you
[39:32.080 --> 39:34.720]  want to blow the whistle I mean we already know in for guards already
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.560]  admitted clergy response teams admitted you tried to recruit every dentist my
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.160]  dad knows I mean I talked to other executives they've all had the FBI
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.360]  visits they've had Department of Defense visits they're involved as well I mean
[39:47.360 --> 39:52.280]  this is a giant criminal network to shut down America and they've got their
[39:52.280 --> 39:55.160]  operatives everywhere as an intelligence gathering network when they try to
[39:55.160 --> 39:59.400]  trigger a civil war that's meant to destroy the existing infrastructure of
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.720]  the states so the globalist can move in about a year into the conflict we're
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.640]  here to defeat that we have more people than they have and we have right on our
[40:07.640 --> 40:12.120]  side and we're going to expose it do you want to repent or were you profiled as
[40:12.120 --> 40:14.920]  a little control freak and you're listening right now and can't wait for
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.560]  me to be arrested you actually think what you're hearing here is bad you think
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.800]  the First Amendment and due process is bad you think you're gonna be some big
[40:21.800 --> 40:25.720]  rock star when this comes in you're gonna be like you don't roam you don't
[40:25.720 --> 40:29.360]  roam you don't know who her own strome is you better look it up night of long
[40:29.360 --> 40:37.400]  knives 1933 all right let's go ahead and go to the phone calls here let's go to
[40:37.400 --> 40:43.960]  Diane in New York you're on the air worldwide hi Alex I was born in
[40:43.960 --> 40:50.800]  Venezuela and even though now and I am an American citizen I always call Obama
[40:50.800 --> 40:57.000]  the American Travis he is doing exactly what how Travis destroyed Venezuela and
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.320]  what you just described is what is happening over there number two it is
[41:02.320 --> 41:09.400]  something good at least I have a friend who traveled from Pennsylvania to
[41:09.400 --> 41:17.680]  California and he saw how gigantic billboards against Obama all over he was
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.880]  amazed that he had never seen that so my guess is that people people are very
[41:22.880 --> 41:30.680]  pissed off and and yes I knew this was gonna happen because I already lived it
[41:30.680 --> 41:36.240]  and no one here especially in this town believed me and by the way when we get
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.160]  rid of Obama and Romney tries to do the same thing we're gonna get rid of him
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.800]  listen it people are starting to wake up doesn't mean they have all the answers
[41:44.800 --> 41:48.280]  but they're they're knee deep in the water now they need to get all the way
[41:48.280 --> 41:52.640]  in and really see how deep it goes and again we shouldn't get mad at those
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.120]  that are ignorant they have been dumbed down they have been propagandized they
[41:56.120 --> 42:01.000]  have been chemically attacked we are going to wake them up now only a little
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.880]  bit they're not gonna wake up all the way but as things get worse the seeds are
[42:04.880 --> 42:11.000]  planted our victory will happen go ahead yes hopefully
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.760]  apparently in Venezuela there is a huge awakening but after 14 years of pain
[42:16.760 --> 42:23.320]  and destruction and all the money spent in other places that's right job as has
[42:23.320 --> 42:27.360]  totally wrecked the country by design and transferred it I mean I've got a
[42:27.360 --> 42:32.640]  fellow works for me does a great job at IT you know self-trained from Venezuela
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.720]  and he's done so good he's like the head of the one of the major IT departments
[42:37.720 --> 42:43.800]  but like five people under him and he talks about how they make the kids in
[42:43.800 --> 42:49.120]  school pray to Chavez to get to the school lunch program they say pray to
[42:49.120 --> 42:52.480]  Christ and then the food doesn't come they go now pray to Chavez this is to
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.800]  kindergartners and then they get the milk and the food I mean and then I went and
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.440]  looked it up and found it in Charlotte is a book that under the Soviets they did
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.760]  that and and so that's what this is all about the state is God I appreciate your
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.920]  call and it's thoroughly disgusting but then they've got right-wing flavors of
[43:08.920 --> 43:13.280]  total government as well and all of it is manipulated by the globalist let's go
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.240]  to Josh in North Carolina Josh you're on the air welcome Alex thank you long
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.200]  time listener I really appreciate you actually being a person wake me up with
[43:22.200 --> 43:29.440]  the Obama deception and I got some kind of scary information I'm actually an
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.360]  insurance broker for one of the global top 10 companies and and I actually work
[43:35.360 --> 43:41.800]  in the region of DC we actually get a bunch of sub-subcontracted private
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.680]  companies that are coming in one of the pieces of information that I got was
[43:45.680 --> 43:52.440]  actually from DARPA and it lists crossing the threshold as the actual
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.280]  name of the program what they say they're going to be able to do is actually
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.840]  be able to engage people and I tried sending some information and in regards
[44:01.840 --> 44:06.800]  to this about the Colorado incident where he woke up and you know had no
[44:06.800 --> 44:12.520]  idea where he was under this program they can actually use light-based
[44:12.520 --> 44:17.560]  systems to not only take over your perception what you see and hear and
[44:17.560 --> 44:23.360]  what you feel but also actually take over your entire body well now that's
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.600]  why DARPA bragged about that in there's literally hundreds of patents on this
[44:27.600 --> 44:31.080]  if I can get Dr. Baggachan he's great at listing them but anybody can look up
[44:31.080 --> 44:35.520]  these DARPA has bragged that's why in government buildings they're putting in
[44:35.520 --> 44:41.280]  the fluorescent lights under government regulations that quote communicate with
[44:41.280 --> 44:45.200]  your computers guys type in government buildings installing lights that
[44:45.200 --> 44:49.560]  communicate with computers it's associated press you name it and it it
[44:49.560 --> 44:55.120]  flickers and communicates with these new panels that are coming in show the
[44:55.120 --> 45:00.840]  internet is going without it being plugged in data over power line it goes
[45:00.840 --> 45:06.120]  through the light switches through the lights through the computer as it's
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.000]  two-sided the two systems communicate that's what they can do with it when the
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.040]  government can mandate what type of tech is put in and then it goes down the
[45:14.040 --> 45:19.120]  power line or it's picked up wirelessly by the wireless meter reader systems or
[45:19.120 --> 45:23.080]  the smart meter on your house all the new appliances coming out interface with it
[45:23.080 --> 45:28.160]  and I didn't know about this particular program you're talking about but yeah so
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.120]  much of what they're obsessed with at the University of Texas monkey facility
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.520]  they've got and other universities I've talked to insiders that is it's nothing
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.120]  but monkeys with wires in their brains with just flicker rates testing
[45:41.120 --> 45:45.200]  different different systems of carrier waves and yeah and they're coming out
[45:45.200 --> 45:50.320]  with vaccines that literally attack your brain so you're not human anymore you
[45:50.320 --> 45:54.440]  can't get upset they just call it an anti-stress vaccine you take it and
[45:54.440 --> 46:01.120]  you're now can still function but you you're a biological Android and and so
[46:01.120 --> 46:05.160]  that's why they've they've ratcheted up the autism the cancer everything else
[46:05.160 --> 46:08.200]  just where it's off the charts we're just used to everybody dying around us
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.040]  well soon it'll just be I don't know my husband came home and now he does
[46:12.040 --> 46:15.760]  whatever I tell him and he doesn't laugh anymore he doesn't cry he doesn't get
[46:15.760 --> 46:19.360]  upset anymore and boy I like him this way I mean it's the end of humanity
[46:19.360 --> 46:22.480]  we're now approaching it I mean that that's why they don't care that's why
[46:22.480 --> 46:26.680]  they openly run al-qaeda but you know I'm sorry now they can arrest you give you
[46:26.680 --> 46:30.440]  this shot you're gone the cops are all gonna be given it they'll be sprayed it
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.160]  if you know if they don't take the shot they're already making all the nurses
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.600]  take shots so they can't have their job it's here we're in such a deep level of
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.400]  this that's why I'm sorry I'm ranting so tell me is an insurance actuary person
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.360]  exactly what they were telling you now I'm actually a broker I mean I've
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.440]  actually come into multiple instances where I've had people through the
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.040]  infigard program that are being subcontracted out through the DHS and
[46:55.040 --> 46:58.800]  through BOD how to tell these people you know we actually get some
[46:58.800 --> 47:01.760]  information that's sent through us and obviously to do insurance you need to
[47:01.760 --> 47:06.440]  tell us what you're doing fortunately for me people have given a quite a bit of
[47:06.440 --> 47:09.600]  information and what they do is they actually watch local businesses they
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.760]  watch local people they have suspected terrorists and what they do is they'll
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.560]  give recommendations and obviously you know if they feel that they're out there
[47:18.560 --> 47:22.640]  spying on you and then that they need further information to be held into upon
[47:22.640 --> 47:28.760]  on you they'll put you through and under NDAA or NDAA they'll come in and
[47:28.760 --> 47:32.720]  obviously they can basically disappear if you want and that with this program
[47:32.720 --> 47:38.720]  another thing that's very very scary with this one of their their headlines is
[47:38.720 --> 47:42.080]  to break the thought barrier and fully exploit promote and develop
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.080]  intellectual capital which basically what that means is they can actually go
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.960]  through your thought process and well that came out last week now where they
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.800]  use light-based systems to extract data out of the brain because the the eyes
[47:54.800 --> 48:00.040]  are electrochemical stocks here is an article out of Slate Wired Magazine as
[48:00.040 --> 48:05.000]  well guys put this up on screen on my computer if you can DARPA scientists
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.600]  create super fast Wi-Fi that attaches information to light beams I mean that
[48:10.600 --> 48:13.760]  there will be no flesh spared if God doesn't intervene ladies and gentlemen
[48:13.760 --> 48:18.360]  and it says it gets into my house immediately news and group of scientists
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.840]  have created a new system for transmitting data using light to be 85,000
[48:22.840 --> 48:29.920]  times faster now notice they told slaves on grid about this in June but I
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.640]  actually saw it over 12 years ago in DARPA reports that I was just looking for
[48:33.640 --> 48:39.280]  and I found this new one I typed in DARPA light but again police departments in
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.560]  Minnesota Illinois Texas and others look this up have already put these light
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.160]  bulbs in and the cops don't even understand they're now in a mind control
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.360]  system where they can put them into a trance whenever they want and then have
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.440]  programming deliver different ways I mean we're talking about I mean folks
[48:57.440 --> 49:04.600]  we're here 2012 off the chart insane red level red level so so I mean this person
[49:04.600 --> 49:07.440]  telling you about this because see I don't just believe you I separately
[49:07.440 --> 49:10.880]  already know about it what were they saying that it was fun they could mind
[49:10.880 --> 49:16.400]  control people in mass now well see they actually sent over a list of everything
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.200]  and their their number one number one bullet point was to deal with insider
[49:21.200 --> 49:26.360]  and outsider threats to network security now they're gonna be using organic
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.840]  trust system so they can use actually they can manipulate rocks trees bushes
[49:30.840 --> 49:36.440]  anything that's actually organically made me you the squirrel another thing
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.680]  that they actually said is they believe that this process will actually allow
[49:40.680 --> 49:43.640]  the communication with animals so what's gonna happen a little bit down the road
[49:43.640 --> 49:46.880]  as you know obviously we'll be looking for the people in the black commerce but
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.160]  you know you won't be looking for the mountain lion that just stumbles across
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.080]  your your backyard and happens to mall you so this is another bullet point that
[49:55.080 --> 49:58.600]  they have on there that they said I don't last year within five years these
[49:58.600 --> 50:03.480]  will all be attainable so it's actually very scary and the company that they
[50:03.480 --> 50:06.960]  list that they have the subcontract subcontracted programs through our
[50:06.960 --> 50:12.000]  Johns Hopkins University Harvard Yale Boeing and MIT so these are all being
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.360]  done on Stanford Stanford's involved as well well they just showed the article
[50:16.360 --> 50:19.720]  that actually found one of the ones and again you notice it's police
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.640]  departments they put these in first and these cops have no idea you know they
[50:23.640 --> 50:28.360]  hire average blue-collar type guys who just you know don't really question and
[50:28.360 --> 50:33.160]  that you guys just put the article on screen we put that back on screen USA
[50:33.160 --> 50:38.400]  today like technology sends information via LEDs you should write us an article

[55:06.400 --> 55:12.480]  them everything and I was shown the unclassified areas accidentally there
[55:12.480 --> 55:18.760]  was some buttons punched up and I just saw some of them little monkeys but the

[55:37.640 --> 55:43.200]  map up where is FEMA region seven FEMA region seven is north of us that's
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.440]  Kansas and Missouri and places like that where are you calling from in the
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.120]  former United States of America now occupied by the scientific bank or

[56:18.880 --> 56:24.760]  tell us tell us what you've witnessed um what well what I've witnessed is a lot
[56:24.760 --> 56:31.320]  of the people that work there are really good people the problem is the
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.840]  management and the structure above them puts them the fight amongst each other
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.960]  and then they'll bring in the the odd the oddball here and there well yeah
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.120]  they're using it like a Stasi prison where most the prisoners are really
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.640]  agents they're there inside these infra guard systems getting you to fight with
[56:48.640 --> 56:52.200]  each other to actually find the real agents but that's another sad issue
[56:52.200 --> 56:57.640]  please continue so you'll get the oddball person and usually the oddball
[56:57.640 --> 57:02.600]  will be like a white male pedophile looking kind of guy and just like you
[57:02.600 --> 57:07.600]  always hit the ball on the head basically they'll pull the good-looking
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.160]  women out in the line and put them through the what they call the AIT machine
[57:11.160 --> 57:17.040]  to scan them and I just witnessed that a disgusted me oh so you are you are

[58:17.000 --> 58:21.360]  there or the other people that are in the beginning and they're good people

[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:14.280]  oh man uh the the last straw for me really was uh this kid came through um i think he was
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:21.480]  national guard he had his leg hurt and uh one of the agents made him walk through the metal
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.880]  detector like just he made him walk and he may have seen him make people get out of wheelchairs
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.880]  that can't walk and they make people hold them up and they scream at them i mean it's just it's
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:38.840]  pure dehumanization yeah and it's like i said it's not all the agents a lot of the agents are just
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:45.640]  stupid and brainwashed and they believe the whole 9 11 theory and i've been awake for a while i had
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:52.360]  to take the job because of the economy and uh it gave me a really good uh inside view of us to how
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:58.840]  uh big sister works but i hear they try to run people off though that don't like all this they do

[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:13.560]  smart enough to orchestrate any conspiracy plans oh no i agree they're just setting the precedent
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:19.880]  to have government put their hands on you i agree with that um you know to everybody out there
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:25.560]  alex jones knows what he's talking about you better listen you know um he's right
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.680]  take it from me to insider well thank you sir i wish that um i wish that i wasn't right about

[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:42.120]  we've got uh a bunch of whistleblowers on the line uh in fact we had some there that were
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.240]  saying that they were uh had been recruited by infragar but then that person hung up two of
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.160]  them did we want to hear from you eight hundred two five nine nine two three one i've got the

[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:09.880]  the other day he came home telling me that the teachers are teaching them the government owns
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.360]  everything the government runs everything and their job as citizens is to obey anything they're
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.760]  told no that's admitted they're told you'll be arrested if you talk about about the president
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.000]  i mean this is what's going on now my children went to private school two days a week and it
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.280]  was pretty good curriculum except they had they were accredited so they had to do stuff telling
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:39.560]  them that michelle obama loved them and that she knew best for what they should eat another thing
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:45.720]  we send homemade snacks which have way more nutrition than the fruit snacks and stuff that
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.880]  they approved and they but they won't let him eat them they send him back home oh yeah no that's
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.280]  already started in illinois other places you're not allowed to pack the lunch now you must buy and
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.840]  eat what the government says because your parents aren't good and they're not your parents and we're
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:04.840]  going to give you inoculations without asking them right right so you know now we're looking into
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.000]  homeschool as much as we can but what town do you live in i didn't know that was happening in colorada
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.680]  it was big news when illinois did it i mean i mean we're in conifer it's a small mountaintown

[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:53.560]  okay i saw uh an article on on info wars that the apple had patented technology
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:27:00.360]  where they could prevent your iphone from filming yes well i had actually experienced this because
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:06.360]  i went to uh the boneyard it was an air force uh active military base called boneyard they had
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:12.120]  all the decommissioned aircraft incredible footage all it's in a lot of films uh well i wish i could
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:18.200]  have gathered footage with my iphone but when i was on the bus uh my iphone was disabled it
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.760]  wouldn't it would allow me to go all the way to the camera setting and then when i would turn it
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:28.520]  to uh to film it wouldn't allow me to film i tried it three times no no they had the department of
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:34.920]  defense has that everything is backdoored and that was in that was in wired last week in fact in
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:41.800]  fact you can just type in apple patents disabler but they already have that and uh it's just a new
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:46.040]  patent but they've already been doing it where you go to a rock concert and suddenly all your
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.800]  phones are disabled that's why we've got to also save and we have saved all our old low tech cameras
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.800]  because now they can just give a general order when they swat team your house or whatever
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:02.120]  that any live streams or whatever are killed this is the whole new battle plan and i mean it's it's
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:09.880]  it's it's it now how are you sure they turned off your phone the fact that it was working perfectly
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:13.960]  before i got on the bus i was at the air force museum so i was looking at all the planes so i
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.000]  was filming around the museum and then i got on the bus i had to give them my id and then go on to
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.480]  the air force base but then when i was on the air force base i tried three times to open up my phone
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:29.320]  to film all the aircraft you know this is after the american government sold 34 f 16 siria you know
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:33.880]  84 of them are something i don't understand yeah all these foreign governments are good you're
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.840]  bad you're the ultimate enemy you think the globalist hate afghans because they won't only
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:45.720]  sell opium to them the globalist hate you so much because of who you are who your ancestors were
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:51.320]  you've been the big enemy that's why they florida our water gmo our food we are the big enemy
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.760]  they have us fight their wars while they're killing us with soft kill weapons they have our troops
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.800]  only military in the world that lets ground troops use du other than the israelis that all
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:09.160]  blows back on israel as well they hate our military and uh yeah no doubt that's the new system
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:15.000]  they admit where police hit one button and all the cell phones turn off not just the phones aren't
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.600]  going to work they do not want a record and that's why you've got to go with low-tech cameras do not
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:27.960]  throw away old cameras do not throw away old tech remember this i predict now that within five years

[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:52.120]  owners christians conservatives were all listed as terrorist publicly as you know returning
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:58.120]  veterans number one terrorist uh i want to go to uh quarry and connecticut active duty army
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:04.920]  what's your take on all this uh quarry hey how you doing alex pretty good my guess awesome
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:09.640]  my man no i one of the one of the things i just wanted to touch on uh which shocked me this weekend
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.360]  and up on the drill obviously we got to do our weekends do you have a big thing here any active
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.440]  duty military national guard reserve can i pass forward they have these uh things called family
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.440]  readiness groups that they've been pushing uh one of the pieces of training that we went
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.640]  through this weekend is uh one of the mandatory things that everybody has to do now our enforcers
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:34.120]  wide it's called mtbi mandatory training and what they're basically doing from what i understand
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:39.640]  here is uh yale and uconn health center uh they're pushing through a new study here in the state
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:47.160]  that children that are going through sports programs they have to have a tbi scan before the
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:53.880]  season and if there's any occurring uh concussions or tbis even at the children's level they have
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.600]  to have another one before they even start the soccer season or the football season and they're
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.240]  trying to push this year now through the family readiness groups to try and get to soldiers
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.120]  kids who might be either in the community or even on active duty posts but i find that kind of
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.400]  disturbing at the fact that they're making these kids now go through tax stands before they even
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:22.520]  play a sport now yeah let me explain sir this is a total mega tyranny cat scans deliver a lot more
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:30.200]  radiation than a old chest x-ray they miss calibrate them guys type in badly calibrated
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:36.680]  cat scans make hair fall out it's even new york times they've actually people died days after a
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:43.640]  high-powered cat scan and they are now this is the medicalized mafia hitler did it stalin did it
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:49.800]  and that's what i talked about this weekend i had people at barton springs and somebody at the
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.480]  grocery store run up to me going they're taking my neighbor's kid they're taking my sister's kid
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:01.880]  because they went in to have a baby and found thc or they found painkiller and in both cases they
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:07.080]  were my sister doesn't smoke marijuana or you know my neighbor doesn't use painkillers you know
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:11.240]  they're an executive and the point is they take your blood they don't tell you how you're coming
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.960]  into a law enforcement situation you have a right to remain silent they tell you how you're doing
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.960]  you got enough money at home they're putting it it's all predatory they're making the nurses take
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:25.720]  all the shots they're illegally injecting kids with shots all over the country sir four years ago
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:31.240]  all inserts for vaccines said do not take vaccines when you're pregnant it's been known forever
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.320]  to cause miscarriages autoimmune problems deformities death now they say women you need shots
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:42.520]  they're setting the precedent to give you shots and have the doctors and nurses follow orders
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.520]  and you talk to any nurse or doctor they'll go yeah they did say that until four years ago
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:53.320]  it's a they're just getting us ready they're just getting us used to and then it's so horrible and
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:58.200]  yes that's the medical tyranny where they're now saying you've got to wear an id bracelet if you
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.960]  want to be on the football team now it's now everybody has to wear it and department defense
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.440]  with ai computers watching the food you eat that's going on nationwide i mean we are in a
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.440]  it's like aliens took over and are in human form you know and this is a scientific takeover it might
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.640]  as well be that it's like body snatchers or something it's like the thing it might as well be
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.840]  something i mean it's that bad it is a tyranny that makes every other tyranny pale because it's
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:29.800]  creeping it's systematic it's psychological it test it's got people in stratus it is it's it's
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:34.120]  satan ladies and gentlemen i mean it there's i mean this is beyond human stuff that's why i say
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:40.520]  aliens it is so when you study it and see the master programming of it and it's so incredible
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.360]  and what's even more frustrating is the minions of it have no idea they're going to be destroyed
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.920]  and so yeah they now the military tells you how to take care of your family get ready all this stuff
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:55.560]  and cat scans for your children guys make a note that's going to be big news that's important
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.480]  because i'll guarantee you what the caller saying will end up you know being out there somewhere
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.440]  so we can verify this what else i mean i know there's lots of riot training going on right now
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.080]  well that's that's that's for certain i mean like i said that they're they're bringing in the
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.320]  shipments to left and right but they're also destroying all the old stuff before it even
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:17.880]  before it can even be put out for like an army or navy store just cutting it up i mean well you
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.080]  don't want the enemy to have it you know back when the government wasn't all bad they wanted
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:26.760]  the people to have it you want the enemy have that stuff are the men around you figuring out
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.800]  that there's a massive battle build up against the people they are and like i said even even my
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.360]  officers uh they're seeing because they're receiving uh these random notices from the uh
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:41.800]  office of the assistant secretary of defense and health affairs and uh they're stating uh with the
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.960]  kids and this is why we brought it up yesterday is the fact that hey if your child needs a cat scan
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.680]  before he could even play a sport they're sending out these letters now in the mail for uh research
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:56.200]  about altarum.org and they're trying to ask hey your child was picked for a random survey and i'm
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.200]  like noticing a random survey like now they're starting to see what the types of training that
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:05.320]  they want well also they've injected you with nanotech that's now been confirmed they call it
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:11.000]  viruses there it's not really a vaccine they go oh this specially designed virus will make you feel
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.640]  good or make you notice in the movie uh the newborn movie that's very accurate they give you a virus
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:23.560]  that eats parts of the brain so that you will be able to run further it cuts out your governor
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:31.480]  i've discovered declassified viral injection studies 20 years ago they did that movie's real
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.560]  so the troops have had everything tested on you when they're lining you up and not telling you
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.360]  what it is so they want cat scans of you and your family because it's multi-generational
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.720]  they want to see what mutations are in your children in 1968 when they released a bio weapon
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.040]  and killed a bunch of people in the new york subway the tales remain classified they had army
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:55.400]  doctors posing in all the local hospitals to track it and stayed and followed those families for
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:02.200]  decades you understand i mean it's so diabolical i appreciate your call sir god help us the pure
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.880]  the pure massive evil we face is just un un unendingly that's the problem in a trillion
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:12.600]  shows i couldn't tell you everything they're doing it's all beyond anything people can imagine
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.560]  people think oh you're fear mongering or exaggerating no i'm holding back okay it's worse than i'm
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:23.400]  even telling you all right it is it is beyond anything you can imagine it is a scientific
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:30.040]  technocracy that sees us as dumb animals and is testing everything on us they are testing
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:37.160]  super cancers on us so they can create cures for themselves while killing us while extracting all
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:43.080]  the money you save when you you know get cancer at 50 they inject you with cancers that are designed
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:50.200]  to activate in the viral plaques in the tissues when your hormone level goes down i've never been
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.640]  for hormone replacement because because it can cause cancer in the studies but now i've been
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:57.800]  seeing some studies that the reason people are living longer with hormone replacement is because
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.560]  it's blocking the sv-40 and other viral plaques that you've been injected with they're hitting us
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:09.960]  and hitting us hard on every level i'm sick of it idiots out there that serve the system you're
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:15.960]  dead too they've already soft killed you you moron there is no joining with this it's pure death
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:21.480]  you can't make a deal with it all right i'm gonna go to the other phone system here in about five
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:28.120]  minutes we're going to go to steve with friend of infregard we've got other infregard people

[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.800]  but that's just the genesis phone system i haven't gone to scott john chuck

[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.560]  but we'll just he's a good guy about libertarianism and freedom but we're light years
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.600]  into another dimension on this okay and only facing up to the true magnitude of what we're
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:57.880]  dealing with is going to stop this you understand this is how you act when you're aware of this
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:05.800]  information you've got to get moving you've got to get out of your trance man i that's why i welcome
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.200]  the tyranny because you'll know it's real folks when they are stomping you in a parking lot telling
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.160]  you not to talk about it or when they call up in death threat you and tell you what you were
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:19.000]  talking about you'll know it's real folks you'll know it's real you'll know it's real when you stare
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.600]  it right in the eyes and let me tell you it's real you can smell it your instinct knows it people
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.520]  that you talk about this they get upset at you because deep down they're afraid they know you're
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:34.200]  telling the truth deep down they know deep down they know and that's why they think you're the
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.680]  one causing the problem because you're bringing up you're you're pulling the scab off but we need
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:46.440]  to pull the scab off i wanted to shift gears because i saw this last week but i the abc news
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:57.560]  cbs news and others never said why the jury ruled but then i went and found another case uh in 2002
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:09.240]  where the family found one 1933 saint god and coin and sold it for 7.59 million and the jury found
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:15.640]  that they should get half the money now again they confiscated the gold in 1933 and these particular
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:22.280]  ones of that year were listed in the order again i can't believe our forebears were told by a crook
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:26.840]  government turn your gold in and they did i mean was there nothing you won't do they order you to
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:32.200]  you know give them your wife would you do it they ordered you to stick your baby in a meat grinder
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:37.080]  or stick their arm down a garbage disposal would you do it i guess i am crazy because i wouldn't
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.400]  do it and a lot of you i guess think that that's normal i just don't understand it i understand
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.720]  being servile because i'm nobody special but let me tell you i found out about a total attack on me
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:55.640]  and my family i get hopping mad here's the headline abc news uh judge says 10 rare coins worth 80
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:01.480]  million belong to uncle sam i wanted to bring ted anderson up here to explain this these people
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:09.160]  got this out of a safety deposit box that had been willed to them uh and there were 10 of them
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:17.320]  and it says the king of saudi arabia uh you know had sold one king ferruc no that was king of ferruc
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:26.520]  of egypt for 20 million and so well they went to you know show them to the government and get
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:31.160]  them appraised and the governments took them people dig up dinosaur bones of their own property
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.240]  in the government comes and takes them even though common law and law says you own it they're just
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.080]  crooks folks you figured that out yet and uh ted anderson's the expert on this to explain what's
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:46.520]  confiscatable what is it confiscatable if you care to get stuff they claim they can't confiscate look
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:51.880]  i got whatever i want and you're not taking it you filthy murdering scum it's time to pull down
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:56.600]  these tyrants and say what they are ted anderson tell us in because you've been in over 30 years
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.640]  in golden silver 15 years with mitis resources ink where i get my golden silver and yeah this is a
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:07.400]  golden silver pitch mixed in with news uh because gold is up 50 something bucks in the last week
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.120]  and uh i've got a big stack of news on that i'll get to in a moment but ted anderson what's going
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:18.520]  on with this uh where they're taking people's gold well the first thing i want to say alex
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:23.400]  is if you find some coins in a safety deposit box one of the last places you want to take it to
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:28.200]  is the us mint or to the government for that matter i mean they are not your friend they're
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.360]  never going to be your friend anytime you do that they're going to think that it's theirs
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.920]  you know that's that's that's just simple these people made a big mistake but yeah indeed these
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:42.600]  are the coins that sold for seven and a half million dollars each this family has 80 million
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.480]  dollars with the coins they bring it down to the us meant to see if they're authentic the us meant
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:53.960]  to size to confiscate them from them because of the executive order of 1933 which you got to remember
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:59.240]  frankly do you rules of ill pass this executive order right after inauguration people that he
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:05.080]  shut the bankstone on a friday and called in the gold on a monday and all of a sudden gold became
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:09.720]  a ten thousand dollar fine and or ten years imprisonment if you own gold you know every now
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.280]  and then i get trouble emails and people send me little hate mails are you talking about gold
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:21.080]  confiscation well guess what it did happen and here it is extended all the way into the year 2012
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:25.640]  that people are getting their gold confiscated from them because of the executive order and
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:31.720]  in the past the government would split it with you which is robbery but now now and again let's
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.680]  explain this ladies and gentlemen they took the gold and in the next few years it doubled in price
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:42.200]  it was all shipped to the Rothschilds and others this is mainline news and again i'm proud of the
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:47.560]  fact my great grandfather in Dallas he didn't turn his hand but i mean so many people lined up and
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:52.200]  turn their gold in this is why it's important to get gold and silver people like why they might
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:57.320]  confiscate it because they're going to devalue the dollar if things keep going in this direction
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.720]  and at least you'll have something that is worth something is the point you know it's like saying
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.000]  why have kids they might get run over by a car that's just giving up on life the best move
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.440]  from my view and my research is golden silver ted it has been and as a matter of fact twenty
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:19.320]  dollars and sixty seven cents is what they confiscated gold back in 1933 right after the
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:25.320]  executive order they raised that the very year after the thirty six dollars an ounce so all the
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.400]  gold that they took from the people and then they put it in their coffers they devaluate the
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:35.000]  currency so now the gold goes up to thirty six dollars an ounce i mean it's just highway robbery
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.640]  these people again alex they're not your friends if you think the government's out here to help you
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:44.760]  think again and this family out here in pennsylvania found that out real fast well they sure helped
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:49.320]  them in katrina ripen the women and taking the guns i mean that was nice yeah that's i mean that's
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:54.280]  the whole deal so but in ken gold confiscation happened again of course it can if the federal
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:58.760]  reserve system decides that they need to have the gold they're going to go straight to the secretary
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.400]  of treasury straight to the president of the united states and you're going to hear things about
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:08.600]  martial law and so on and so forth just like we had one bush was leaving office and we needed tarp
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:14.200]  so bad here's the deal though i guarantee you the people aren't turning their gold and silver in
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:20.040]  it's not going to happen people are wise now they know what's happening ladies and gentlemen
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:24.760]  and again they already are stealing your paper money by devaluing it and they can digitally
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:30.360]  manipulate you that's why the elites i've got the articles here today the king of the bond market

[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:28.120]  gifts i'm still holding it at 63 dollars alex but silver has gone up well beyond that numbers oh

[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:51.720]  small quantity and we're going to have to switch to the american to the to the dishonest money book
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:56.120]  because that book is definitely shorter you might get one or the other but i would suggest that you
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:59.720]  get moving if you want i was about to say that deal had to change by tomorrow and i guess we're
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:03.880]  already behind the eight ball we got to change the ad on info wars dot com this last weekend i mean
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.320]  alex the orders blew up we're you know things are quiet before the supplies were lasting now it's
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:13.560]  just like they're flying out the door so we're doing the best we can to get everybody what they
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.960]  ordered but if you if if you can't get the american dream video we're going to go to dishonest money
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:25.160]  which is also very relevant to what's going on right now absolutely 800 686 2 to 3 7 the elites
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:30.440]  are all getting in the golden silver the silver dollar deal ted just mentioned no one can be okay
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:37.720]  that is insane literally 800 686 2 to 3 7 he gave you a few of the alex jones specials that are left
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:43.640]  to get the lowest price below it's even on the internet at minus resources dot com call them and
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:50.680]  say i want the alex jones special those are the best deals offered by minus resources 800 686
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:57.800]  2 to 3 7 ted anderson there you go gold confiscation in america you've got documents government
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.240]  documents you'll send them a free report generally it's the collector coins that they can't go after
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:08.360]  correct but government u.s government issued bullion is what they claim they can try to grab
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:13.720]  correct ed yeah yeah it's typically the bullion coins are what are going to be taken and uh so
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:19.160]  if you're interested in having something diversify your portfolio a bit look at the older 20s or even
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.600]  the the more modern commemoratives because in 1926 they had the two and a half dollars sesquicentennial
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  coin and in 1933 they couldn't take that coin because the u.s meant exactly and ted you've even
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:36.920]  for a long time been selling uh bullion price coins that are really numismatic and semi numismatic so
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:41.560]  a lot of the coins i think it's very important that people get a lot of gold and a lot of silver
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.360]  for their money i think that's very important because the way the economy is playing out here
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:51.560]  you need to have something that is going to be tradable and easily liquidated but i can tell you
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.880]  there are a few little little flaws and some of the things that are out there where you have to have
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:01.160]  the 6045 revenue ruling reporting there's cash reporting that goes on there's a few little
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:06.200]  details that you need to know what to avoid and how to buy and and and tennanerson will tell you
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:09.960]  a lot of the other companies won't tell you i'm not saying they're bad it's just that ted's the
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:17.640]  man the patriot 800 686 237 thank you for that report yeah thanks a lot alex okay we got tom
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.440]  woods coming up i got loaded phone lines with whistleblowers i've got to get to scott john

[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.440]  been asked to be a whistleblower you know you've said this now a couple times over the last few
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.160]  years it's time to have him on the air so we can actually you know you just saying something like
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:58.120]  that isn't good enough hey wait a minute wait a minute oh wait a minute let me put him on hold

[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.080]  well a few years ago i'd talked about infregard to a neighbor who claimed to have worked for a
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:55.080]  racy onion in the fbi and then he proudly showed me his infregard card he turned out to be a busy
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:01.800]  body a stalker not just a torts myself but another neighbor's and about keeping calm as well um he
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:06.280]  liked to call yummy you heard me profile him and that's exactly what my dad was saying he said
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:10.920]  he's run into several of these now they're well i'm not supposed to get into it all but the point
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:17.560]  is go ahead well you also like to call police with false accusations uh apparently felt powerful
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:24.840]  by his infregard card maybe everyone should carry one sort of as a kma you know as a erudruso's
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:29.880]  talking about uh nicholas rockerfeller's thing that you only have a kma chip uh kiss my you know
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:36.360]  what ship unfortunately he died of infasema due to his um irresistible smoking habit um and i guess
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:41.560]  i could bring up another issue that i i called about uh there's a locally based radio talk
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:45.800]  network radio network that carries your showed can talk network uh here in the tampa bay area on
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:53.080]  1340 a.m. and 1350 a.m. and uh 880 a.m. a little rock arkansas at the 50 000 watt transmitter
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:59.320]  who now accepts the local new community currency called clearwater hours i want to get the owner
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:03.960]  of that system on i know they got us on a bunch of great affiliates god bless them spread the word
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:08.920]  here is my dad david jones now that was probably infregard calling in because you notice they
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.480]  wouldn't admit infregard or any of it exists it was i want to hear your dad it didn't true
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:18.520]  as if we don't know this country's going to hell in a handbasket then and uh they admit the veterans
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:24.200]  are the number one enemy and they got spy networks that's all admitted they're harassing veterans you
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:28.440]  name it but oh it doesn't exist dad i know you don't you didn't want to tell me the whole story
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.560]  because it's patient you know dr privilege but you're allowed to say as a dentist what happened
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:38.600]  is it true that this person that's been your patient for a very long time wanted to hire you
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.760]  to be a minion and then you went and talked to other dentists and found out they'd been visited
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.800]  by other groups let me explain i i had actually was doing consulting in dallas at the time and i
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:54.520]  was passing through weco and i heard a local police liaison and weco talking about how
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:04:01.480]  well that people could volunteer and it could be a career path toward really good employment
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:07.000]  for kids in high school and people in their neighborhoods and all different levels and
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:13.480]  it was literally about becoming a volunteer part of an intelligence gathering keep your
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:19.960]  neighborhoods safe volunteer type program and it was going on and it was real interesting to me
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:25.720]  because about that same time someone had to pre-approach dr king and his neighborhood about
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:31.160]  being involved in uh and doing that sorry i can never see something say something keep your
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:37.720]  neighbors but tell us what happened to you i basically was just approached by a a patient
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:44.520]  that was involved in law enforcement that had said that you know they would like for me to be
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:52.760]  involved in uh basically just being aware of what was going on and to talk to other doctors and
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:58.200]  things in our organization that we were in a good position to hey now that we've started this we got

[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.160]  for two hours and i'm doing a lot better than i normally do and it's been pretty powerful
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:37.160]  hearing whistleblowers about infraguard spying on people and things and we opened up our internal
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:43.480]  phone lines as well and never got to that phone bank scott chuck lion heart blank i'm going to get
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:47.080]  to you guys with tom woods because you've you've been patient if not you can hang up i know we
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:54.120]  got loaded phone lines over here we've got whistleblowers on infraguard pouring in i this is crazy
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:09:00.040]  i mean this subject is big now infraguard guys type it into google and show people or start page dot
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:05.480]  com just type in infraguard the fbi admits they have it they have clergy response teams we covered
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.840]  it when it was still secret and it's it's getting preachers a spy on their flocks to try to influence
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.240]  them to accept gun confiscation you name it i played newscast where they admit it
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:24.760]  and then this caller calls in and says i disagree uh you know i want to hear your dad say that he
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:30.040]  got approached uh to be part of the see something say something and invited to meetings and things
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.640]  and then my dad talked to other dentists if i'm not they've been visited by other groups at home
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:39.880]  and this is on record they count on you being ignorant they'll have these community fbi meetings
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.760]  you go to them it's not about al-qaeda it's about the veteran next door that's in the news
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:49.800]  so my point is this is a year and a half ago now my dad ended up calling into the back line and
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:56.040]  getting on is that is that my dad suddenly heard ads on the radio about it dentists he knew what
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:01.800]  happened to and then it happened to him he can't tell the whole story because of patient doctor
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.520]  privilege my dad's a dentist but dad i gotta go to our guest here and i appreciate you listening
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:10.840]  to the show i didn't know you were listening when the guy called in so just briefly um
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:16.280]  you know the guy was implying and i was making this up you know the tsa and sticking their hands
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:23.400]  down our pants either uh break down your concern and what went on without violating uh the uh
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:27.480]  in fact just tell the stories of the other doctors that's that the getting visited at home that's
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:32.760]  basically it was all a cumulative effect from having heard things on the radio mentioning it to
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:38.760]  people and then just out of the blue someone who'd been a patient for a long time it was a fairly
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:45.640]  senior person involved in um the administration and law enforcement had said we're organizing
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:51.560]  community level things whereby people are volunteering to go out in their neighborhoods
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:58.040]  and see what are happening and uh what we found that teachers and doctors and sort of other people
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:02.920]  bankers have key positions where they can see and understand things that are going on that we need
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:09.800]  to know and um you know i could use your help and on administrative level and uh we're creating
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:15.240]  career paths for a lot of people at all different ages young people people in high school people in
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:21.480]  college and people that are senior people in their professions and uh right now it's so i don't
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:27.480]  organizational state but it could develop into something uh much more involved yeah and now dad
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.000]  i think you're conflating you're conflating several stories there because i know you don't
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.880]  listen all the time uh but but uh there was also the other individual and i know you can't that
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:44.200]  also came in flashes a little badge and things and uh was talking about something else well i've had
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:48.360]  several people approached me over time i didn't know which incident you were talking about this
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.960]  was about the time after i had been i'd gone to that through weco and picked hard up a very similar
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:12:00.200]  community uh a program but uh yeah there was one guy wanted you to watch your patience as well
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:05.400]  well this was the whole thing is that that's the whole point is that if you you you're in a situation
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.480]  of interviewing people and talking to people and being in positions of trust and things like that
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:17.080]  but i think more than anything they were interested in me um basically doing some monitoring of
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:22.920]  charting issues and things on a on a on a general basis but it didn't get so so so detailed because
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:28.680]  i was not interested in it so it kind of uh but then you found out that other dentists were getting
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:34.600]  visits at home yes i found out that a very high percentage of them were okay so there you go all
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:38.200]  right dad thank you so much just briefly while you're here in tom woods is patiently holding
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:43.320]  best selling author uh i keep meaning to get you on air because i want to promote things you know i
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:47.800]  wasn't promoting the longevity insurance cards because i just wasn't sure about them hadn't
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:51.720]  used them i've now gotten a few prescriptions the last year took that long to actually get a few
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:56.360]  prescriptions i don't you know get them a lot as you know uh the nasal spray and then some stuff for
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:02.600]  my kids we save over 30 each time with them they're totally free you can just put in basically whatever
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:07.640]  name you want and it accesses the discount you though have given out thousands of these now
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:13.160]  you know you manage 14 dental offices what type of responses were the info wars rx since the
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.760]  guy called in and said we were making this up now that we have you on air about this let's do
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:22.040]  a evil capitalism plug i will just say that i have even started having patients that have
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:29.720]  insurance use them for example i have a patient who uses a a prescription for um let's just say
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:37.080]  creating a younger skin it's uh basically retinoic acid and uh the um she was able to get the meds
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:42.760]  cheaper using the discount card than it would be on her insurance yeah so again it's an expensive
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.400]  item again you've been now the last six months using it i was never going to promote it because
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:51.640]  i couldn't understand it it sounded too good to be true and then you were telling me hey this is
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:57.000]  what's really hot uh because you you know bought a bunch of great value i just basically give them
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.880]  away for uh for for free and people anybody and i first i was saying use this if you don't have
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:07.080]  insurance but people were telling me in fact i heard one of your pharmacy people online talking
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.440]  about how sometimes that you can buy stuff generic cheaper without using insurance than you do with
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:18.680]  it because the volume pricing is so low if you're buying this say for three months six months for
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:24.200]  your supply rather than paying the copay but this doesn't even access uh you know generic stuff for
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:29.400]  bolt buying this is across the board find out at info wars rx.com dad thank you for joining us
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:35.160]  all right have a great day there he goes okay punk good try calling in implying that isn't going on
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:41.880]  counting on listeners being ignorant not knowing infregard is real there you go okay now i apologize
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:46.600]  to our guest we are going to shift gears now joining us via video skype if you're a prison

[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:58.920]  fellow at the lucid von mis institute and created the tom woods uh liberty classroom oh that sounds
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.240]  evil right there he probably had infregard watch him he holds a bachelor's degree in history from
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:10.120]  harvard and his masters uh is and it just goes on and a phd from columbia university he is the
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:14.920]  author of 11 books most recently rollback repealing big government before the coming financial
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:19.480]  collapse nullification how to resist federal tyranny in his way for a century woods has been
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:26.440]  edited and written the introduction to five additional books and uh i just always enjoy
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:32.520]  hearing him when he's a guest on the radio or on tv tom woods dot com and uh thank you for
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:37.800]  holding the last five minutes while my dad was on uh what is your take briefly of the stasi state
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.680]  the infregard the clergy response teams homeland security saying veterans are the number one terror
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:48.440]  threat well it's really something i mean of course you know we had the case of somebody being uh
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:53.880]  incarcerated because of some facebook posts for heaven's sake and i mean we seems to me we cannot
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:58.520]  hit this hard enough now on the other hand there there are two things that i know about all this
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:04.760]  on the one hand technology is being exploited by the bad guys to go after the rest of us but on
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.880]  the other hand there are ways in which we can use technology to fight back against them and one
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:14.920]  silver lining as we're watching this sort of police state develop is that today you know people
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:21.800]  have got smartphones and they can record these incidents with the police very easily and discreetly
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:25.960]  and before you know what they're all over youtube and things that the authorities might have been able
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:31.720]  to get away with in the past suddenly they're on the defensive so i'm still cautiously optimistic
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:37.320]  we've still got some weapons in our arsenal here but now the feds want to be able to hit a code
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:43.880]  city wide and kill all the cameras on the iphone's androids did you see that i didn't see that i'm
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:49.960]  hopeful that there's got to be some some entrepreneur somewhere who figures out a way around that in
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:54.200]  the same way that you know they try to they try to do the same thing to uh radar detectors and
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:59.240]  there are always ways around it my hope is that a free people that actually cares about his freedom
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:03.800]  will always be one step ahead i agree with you but why are we letting the government say we're
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:08.360]  going to hit a button and broadcast a code to turn your camera off without a warrant without
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.680]  anything controlling your property it's incredible that's true of course we're not letting that they're
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:17.640]  doing it regardless of how we feel and it just goes to show how frustrating it is i'm sure you
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:23.080]  feel the same way when i see people get really passionate in a presidential election year for
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:28.920]  a candidate other than ron paul i feel like you just haven't woken up yet there obviously
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:34.200]  isn't going to be a change between romney and obama and the fact that people are going to see
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:39.240]  this dinesh to susan movie and walking out saying i got a clamp down i got to do everything i can to
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:45.640]  get establishment candidate a out so i can replace him with establishment candidate b if only these
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:51.000]  people's efforts were directed in the right place we might be getting somewhere i'm glad you brought
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.400]  that film up i mean it was at about an eighth grade level instead of a second grade level like most
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:18:00.280]  you know democratic films are but it's honest that government wants to destroy america but that's
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:06.600]  to consolidate it it's really colonialism by the globalist and crony capitalist against america it's
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:13.560]  not obama is anti-colonialist so he's misguided obama's a total globalist like romney yeah of
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:19.560]  course that's right obama is first of all obama is not a marxist he doesn't hold most of the marxist
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:24.680]  views but in a way that makes him more more sinister and more dangerous he doesn't want to
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:30.280]  he doesn't want to end american imperialism or any of the old marxist slogans he wants to intensify them
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:35.240]  as does romney and in terms of surveillance and all the other issues the two people are
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:40.840]  indistinguishable imperialism home you know i'm i'm what i want to do is one of these

[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:18.120]  all right tom woods is our guest is in short segment long segment coming up i think this is
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.680]  our first visit with him over the years hopefully the first admitting tom what are solutions to
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:27.320]  this fight i mean ron paul still out there getting the word out that he's riding off the sunset a
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:33.240]  little bit uh rand's up there uh you know close to his dad but not his dad obviously those are
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:38.200]  focal points there's what you're doing lou rockwell and others doing a great job i i know that you're
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:44.120]  in a film that we promote and sell uh nullification which breaks down states rights and when i go
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:48.520]  study what the pentagon's doing they're not preparing to fight al-qaeda there they talk about
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:55.880]  going after legislatures that rebel and don't go along so the the the corrupt system is worried
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:25:02.280]  about states rights that tells me it's the answer tell us about that well my view is that we have
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:07.560]  to try something that's not out of the new york times playbook i mean the new york times and the
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:13.560]  mainstream media their role is to try to limit our range of debate is to say well here are the
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.400]  issues that you're allowed to talk about here are the positions here's the three inch range you're
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:21.800]  allowed to take on those issues and if we're going to play by their rules we're never going to get
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:27.160]  anywhere so we've got to be willing to do things that aren't mentioned in newsweek or aren't mentioned
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:31.880]  on the on the tv and so that's why i like the idea of state nullification i wrote a book called
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:37.160]  nullification as you mentioned and the idea of this is that the states created the federal
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:42.040]  government they ought to have some say in whether the federal government is obeying the constitution
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:47.960]  or not saying what their opinion on that is and in fact as madison and jefferson said in 1798
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:53.000]  the states in the last resort have to say to the federal government no what you're doing is unconstitutional
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.280]  and we refuse to go along with it now that is needless to say not in the romney agenda it's not
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:02.520]  the obama agenda it's not what chris matthews would say it's not what bill o'reilly would say
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:09.000]  so in my book that makes it great so basically you've got all the corrupt uh as mic church calls
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.320]  the decepticons on the one side and you get thomas jefferson on the other i'll take thomas
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:17.640]  jefferson at state nullification we're starting to see this picking up steam around the country as
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:22.920]  people feel like you know i've voted for the candidates i've handed out pocket constitutions
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.800]  i've done everything else i'm gonna try this if it's good enough for thomas jefferson it's good
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:32.760]  enough for me what is the harm in trying it i'll tell you there's a lot of fun in trying it because
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:37.800]  when you see the look on the face of rachel madow and chris matthews when they talk about
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:44.280]  the reappearance of state nullification it's like their dog died this is not something they want us
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:49.640]  doing by the way you have absolutely hit the heart of it they control the debates between
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:57.480]  the demo rats and the decepticons they sit there and and and give you this false tiny spectrum
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:02.360]  and my seven-year-old daughter was in the back of the car and she goes well daddy are we democrats
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:07.560]  are republicans and my nine-year-old son said no that's a false choice because he listens to the
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:14.040]  show more and said that's you know how they control us you know we need more choices and i was like
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:19.880]  amen to that and you know she started to get it i'm like they give you false choices and they're
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:24.520]  scared because they're losing control of the narrative now they can't keep us on the reservation
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:29.160]  absolutely so of course when you do pursue something like state nullification as some
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.880]  states have been talking about with a variety of pieces of federal legislation naturally the state
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:38.360]  is going to come out with all the guns rhetorical guns at least at this stage that they have uh
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:43.640]  namely they're going to accuse you of of course you're an extremist uh the word they never define
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:48.920]  of course there's nothing extreme about what they do you understand i'm extreme not them uh they call
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:54.040]  it sedition they call it sedition to even want to have a state yeah exactly a sedition that's
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:58.840]  right of course the irony well there's a lot of irony here but i hardly think it's sedition to
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:04.200]  support thomas jefferson uh so i started to point that out they never went by with jefferson but the
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:10.120]  law in the short of it is we're just reclaiming what are obviously our american rights as and in
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:14.680]  the nullification book the whole reason i wrote it was that i knew we were going to be attacked and
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:19.560]  smeared we support slavery and all this nonsense nullification was never used to uphold slavery
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:23.320]  it was used to fight against the the fugitive slave laws they don't want us to know that because
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:29.720]  they want to paint us as these terrible uh people who pine for slavery they use for those that don't
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:36.280]  know states right so that people could run and be safe that's exactly what was going on in wisconsin
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:40.840]  and elsewhere and they said we have to protect our state sovereignty our right to protect these
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:45.480]  poor souls and give them a jury trial and not have them just be dragged away to their masters
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:49.160]  that's history that we're not supposed to know we're supposed to know that the states are wicked
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:53.720]  the federal government is this great wonderful progressive force and we are blasting that narrative
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:29:00.840]  to bits with nullification keep telling us about it well let me just short break a short segment
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:04.520]  alongside that i figured i want to give you a chance to jump in and stop me well we're going
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:08.120]  to break in about a minute it's just that that is the answer when you read the john warn defense
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:13.720]  authorization act when you look uh uh uh well i mean you saw when texas unanimously in the house
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:18.280]  said we're going to enforce the law don't grow up people at the airport uh misdemeanor on the
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:24.360]  outside felony on the inside that's just the law they threatened f-16 arm blockade and it wasn't
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:30.040]  even big news it's like oh well our f-16s will stop you from uh enforcing that i mean the state
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:34.040]  should have called that block i want to come back get your take on that and then just keep expanding
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:39.560]  because we sell the dvd that's based on your book to a great extent you're in the dvd uh in fact i'll

[02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:26.200]  to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:30.920]  from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise

[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:10.360]  rightful remedy a documentary film is so professionally done when so ever the general
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:16.360]  government assumes undeligated powers a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:24.920]  thomas jefferson and again ladies and gentlemen people can get this powerful film at info or
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:31.640]  store dot com and tom woods has a book of the same name he's in it store roads and so many others
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:37.960]  it's really an amazing film nullify now because the federal government itself has been taken
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:44.600]  over and i want to get into that subject right now with our guests but there's also a a a dark
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:49.480]  side type of nullification when congress won't do things that are unconstitutional like past
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:54.680]  carbon taxes obama just doesn't the executive order so the federal government itself as they've
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:35:00.040]  bragged on cmbc has been captured by these offshore globalists that are above the law and
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:07.240]  fat on bailout money here's an article out of local news elgan sustainability visioning workshop
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:13.000]  set for september 10th that's here in elgan outside austin it's it's a cow town and they
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:17.880]  said they want to take over the local land decide who can develop and they put it out there like
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.440]  it's a wonderful new thing that's what the un said three years ago at the copenhagen treaty
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:27.720]  they said we can't take over the the the federal government fully will take over at the city and
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:32.840]  county and state level and schwarzenegger leads that initiative show they understand the real
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:36.680]  powers local that's why they say think globally act locally so they don't want us to win that
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:41.480]  they're like oh no let's have 60 turnout for a federal election but eight percent on average
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:46.520]  for local so everybody get out to elgan tonight we'll give you that at the very end of the show
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:51.240]  but these meetings are happening everywhere where hi you want to be have a livable area
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:56.840]  pass a law that bureaucrats decide if you can use your land at all you know forget fishing
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:59.880]  wildlife then you have a puddle on your land that you've owned for a hundred years now we're
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:04.360]  going to take it now just look pass a law because it's trendy you know we're going to shut down
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:10.920]  your coal power plant because it's trendy uh going back to tom woods tom getting into the issue of
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:17.160]  what the feds are doing and how they themselves have been taken over we we ended the last segment
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:23.800]  bringing up the point about uh texas threatened with f-16s to uh to to not let aircraft come into our
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:30.440]  state uh if we uh dared to not let tsa you aren't even police stick their hands down our pants
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:37.000]  well my own recommendation for this is that as we go forward and as we gain more and more
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.600]  interest in the idea of nullification is that we need to coordinate we need to have friendly
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.920]  legislators in one state coordinating with legislators in other states and we do have
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:49.560]  legislators around the country who are on board for nullification i know that for a fact i know a
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:55.240]  lot of them and have the states do this all at the same time and then really i mean of course the
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:59.480]  federal government has overwhelming power it could strictly speaking do whatever it wants but it does
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:05.160]  have to reckon with public opinion at some level it does not want the general public to withdraw
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:11.160]  its consent entirely so i'd like to say what if 15 states refuse to do something at once or 20 or
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:15.240]  25 what are they going to do withhold the the highway money from everybody at some point
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:20.760]  they have got to back down which they have done in the past they back down on real id although
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:25.480]  now they're trying to get that back they back down on 55 miles an hour all we have to have
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:31.240]  is a collective this is wrong you shouldn't be over this and a sammy hagar song we've got to
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:37.560]  make it culturally popular to rediscover liberty yeah absolutely and and the fact that i mean you
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.680]  could sort of play on you sort of do what i used to do when i was a college professor i'd have all
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:45.320]  these 18 year old kids and they weren't all that excited about being in my class i don't know why
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.240]  but they weren't and so one of the ways i would get them excited is i would say look i'm going to
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:54.520]  teach you stuff in this room that if you went to harvard they would not tell you and then suddenly
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:59.640]  their teenage rebellious nature i was i was using it for my purposes no suddenly because they want
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:03.880]  to know well what are they keeping from me well likewise nullification and the sorts of things
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:08.600]  we're doing are sorts of things that we are not supposed to do no authority wants us to do them
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:12.920]  that sort of makes them cool i mean in the old days the left used to say question authority now the
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:17.320]  left is the authority half the time so they don't they have no use for questions anymore we are the
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.240]  question askers and we're the ones and i'll give you the answer the answer is nullification it's not
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:26.360]  the answer to every problem but what it does even if it fails which i don't think it will but even if
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:33.640]  it did it succeeds in getting people to think outside this suffocating box yes like the only
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:38.440]  the only opinion you can have is between joe biden and mit romney that's just a that's a mental
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:44.840]  exactly but but but i mean what you just said is so true they lie awake at night afraid of
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.320]  nullification because the states created the federal government and the two are supposed
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:54.120]  to be a separation of powers and the federal government has become this distant imperium
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:59.400]  just like england became a distant imperium and the city of london from the 13 colonies and you
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.920]  read what's in the declaration of independence it's exactly what's happening today and then some
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:11.000]  i mean it things are worse today than they were then and like you said so-called liberals
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:18.520]  aren't liberals they are authoritarians they they always want to tell us well a nine month old baby
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:24.200]  in the womb's not a baby we say it's a fetus you know everything with them is they define everything
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:30.840]  and it's so pretentious and and and it's a mind game go ahead i'm sorry no no no no i agree with
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:36.840]  everything you said on the nullification issue jefferson predicted this outcome and he warned he
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:42.040]  said if you let the federal government have the final monopolistic word on what the constitution
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:47.880]  means take a wild guess on what will happen it's going to interpret it in ways that benefit itself
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:52.840]  and in ways that eclipse the states and the people well obviously that has happened now the
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:58.360]  argument for nullification constitutionally morally every other way is such a home run i know this
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:03.160]  because i've had exchanges with law professors on it these law professors can't debate their way out
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:08.120]  of a paper bag they've all they've all have the same three rotten arguments so i got so sick of
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:12.120]  answering the same things over and over again i just put up i bought the domain named state
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:18.280]  nullification dot com and i basically put up there all the information you need to beat even a law
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.080]  professor because they don't have the arguments it is true that jefferson said these things it is
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:27.560]  true that the states created the federal government all these things are true that this constitution
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:33.000]  was ratified state by state that the united states in the constitution is never referred to in the
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.360]  singular the united states is always just 30 years ago the fbi had to get permission to come in your
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:44.680]  town now the police get little federal cards and other codies and why do we even have states then
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:48.680]  why do we even have an america why not just a global government well that's why they have
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:53.160]  to get rid of the states to then get rid of the sovereignty itself of the country right exactly
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:57.880]  the states are not just you know cute little you know arbitrary boundary lines and you know
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:02.520]  vermont has some quirks and california has its quirks and isn't that neat these are supposed to
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:08.120]  be boundary lines against tyranny that's why they're there firewalls they're for convenience for the
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:12.040]  government they're not there for fun they're there for this purpose so we're not going to use them
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:16.520]  you're right might as well might as well not have them well they're firewalls aren't they like uh
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:22.040]  bulkheads in a ship i mean if one falls people can run to the other oh and absolutely in fact
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:27.080]  what's so awesome is that in the early 19th centuries of 200 years ago the governor of
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:32.920]  connecticut what a northern state yes that's right the governor of connecticut jonathan trumbull
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:38.840]  said that the state governments are in the last resort resort the bulwark of the liberties of the
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:45.320]  people and so in 2010 in connecticut the very same state 200 years later there was an attorney general
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:51.480]  race and the woman who was running as a republican got in the debates picked up my book nullification
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:56.200]  which quotes the old count connecticut governor 200 years ago and she quoted from it and said we
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:02.280]  need to do this again well of course the media just went absolutely berserk how she's not staying
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:09.000]  between the the biden and ronnie spectrum how dare she say these things that it's exciting
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:15.400]  that we have all this history yeah real us history that is not taught and i don't think it's not taught
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:20.520]  just because by accident or they didn't have time to get to it that day it's because if you don't
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:27.240]  teach it it's easier to pass off this narrative whereby uh in american history all we have is
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.720]  the great glorious progressive federal government always doing wondrous deeds for the people that's
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:36.040]  that's the that's what they want us to take so that we'll sit back and not ask them questions
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:43.480]  where do you see this confrontation going because clearly the federal government's buying 1.4
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:50.120]  billion bullets the lapdog media spends that into 174 000 and says why are you guys upset
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:55.720]  when they're setting up checkpoints tsa on the streets 1.4 billion bullets and they spin it
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:04.360]  to 174 000 uh when they are federalizing everything india a patriot act face scanning
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:10.760]  cameras going in to buy and sell out of a science fiction dystopia and then they still look at us
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:15.240]  and go you're the crazy people that say the government's too big uh or you know the southern
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:20.600]  property law center and adl are like dangerous terrorist i think there's a world government
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:26.200]  as it's being announced everywhere i mean it's it's i don't think they understand or do they
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:31.160]  that they're really losing the hearts and minds right now and shoveling more dis info
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:38.200]  is only making people's exodus from under their dark wings accelerate i think so i mean the fact
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:43.240]  that uh as lou rockwell said at the paul festival i don't think there's a 25 year old in this country
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:49.160]  a 25 or under who still reads a newspaper so in other words the usual mechanisms that they
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:56.040]  once used to to for to manufacture consent no longer exist as far as most young people are
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:00.600]  concerned and then of course we all know how ron paul did among the young people uh gary johnson
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:04.600]  who's not quite ron paul but nevertheless he represents some kind of a difference is doing
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:09.160]  much better among the younger people so it not although time is not really on our side in some
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.120]  ways well in other ways at least we see that there the young people who haven't been raised on a diet
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:19.480]  of you listen to the three channels and you accept what they say are willing to look elsewhere
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.480]  for their information because they know liars when they see them well that encourages me
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:27.640]  but we also as you're right we've got to talk about the local level because maybe at this
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:31.480]  point i mean ron paul did us a great service educational service on the national level and
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.160]  i don't know what we would have done without that but moving forward we've got to think about the
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:39.640]  local level and what you can do as an individual like new hampshire is a great example they passed
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:45.400]  a jury nullification law so the juries can can not only decide whether the person was guilty
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:50.200]  or innocent but also decide the justice of the law the free state project in new hampshire is
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:55.000]  trying to encourage a free society by just having people go to one place new hampshire and working
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.720]  together to build a free society now unfortunately my old state of massachusetts which i'm sorry i
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:04.440]  apologize i'm from massachusetts is screwing that up because so many people in massachusetts they screw
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:09.320]  up massachusetts they have no idea why massachusetts is screwed up they have no idea that they did it
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:12.040]  and then they move to new hampshire they want to screw up new hampshire so they've got their
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:16.680]  hands full up there but these are the sorts of things that liberty minded people creatively
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:21.960]  are coming up with when they're faced with what seems like in insuperable odds they're just saying
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:26.520]  well you know what it may be insuperable odds but but i'm gonna go down fighting you know and and
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:33.000]  maybe we just might win it's okay california i mean they passed a 20 carbon tax a couple years ago
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:41.240]  so knowing that when you raise taxes uh too much it it it actually destroys the tax receipts uh and
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:48.680]  now the exodus has accelerated and then their answer is raise taxes again there is this predatory
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:56.600]  instinct to the bureaucrat and the bureaucrat minions and also these kleptocrat mega corporations
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:01.320]  that love working with big government to shut down their competition i was reading where walmart now
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:06.840]  you know has much lower profits well what do they expect when they engage in anti free market
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:12.200]  monopolistic tactics and then try to frame the free market for a monopoly they've created
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:18.040]  that's the opposite of that well there's also there's also this move to try to get a national
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:23.160]  sales tax on the internet and there are some merchants who would like to see that happen
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:28.920]  because they feel like that would help them against local competitors and so on everybody
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:34.280]  winds up trying to use the government to line his pockets which is which is why see unfortunately
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.360]  in the mainstream media the way they respond to that is say well we got to take the money out of
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:44.200]  politics now you got to take the power out of washington because you're never going to get the
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:49.080]  money out as long as there's stuff to be had the crooks will always figure out how to get their
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:54.280]  rubby hands on it so you have to go after the source of the problem which is not that too much
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:59.800]  money is being donated to campaigns it's that once elected the president can favor you we don't want
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:05.480]  that well that's like the more money they spend on education the more expensive it gets the lower
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:12.440]  the quality the more money you spend on health uh then the higher the cost and the less quality
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:18.280]  because it's all being centrally controlled you cut the money off then that will start cutting
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:24.280]  the corruption off yeah absolutely i mean the education bureaucracy is a disaster and a joke
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:29.960]  i mean the the uh the administration is so bloated in all these cities uh in in new york city it's
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:35.800]  something like 6 000 bureaucrats in the central office whereas the catholic schools educate like
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:40.680]  one sixth as many students so they should have a thousand bureaucrats they've got 26 i mean it goes
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:44.440]  to show there's something wrong here this is not a matter of i just sent this on c-span the other
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:49.480]  day this is not a matter of the government is there because these are wonderful public-spirited
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:54.840]  people who just want to promote the common good no these are people who want to loot and expropriate
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:48:01.240]  you and build up their own uh impenetrable fiefdoms where they increase their budgets and their power
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:04.760]  that's what it is it's not what you learned in third grade about how the government works that's
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:08.600]  the that's the reality of what's going on well look at this example where the people end up in the
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:15.480]  state of deposit box having coins worth 7.9 million a piece these st godin's 33 and the government
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:20.360]  said well we have an executive order that we can take your gold and they just steal it and then and
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:25.880]  then abc news reports it like it's a good thing i mean don't people understand that once due process
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:30.920]  the constitution of bill of rights is gone none of us have any protections don't the bureaucrats know
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:37.160]  that that they can be looted now i mean i mean you know don't the cops know that once there's
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:41.400]  on a bill of rights and constitution that they have no protections well that's why i think it's
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:45.960]  important all this there's been some good educational work done to try to reach local police and
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:49.560]  educate them and and make them alert to what's going on a lot of them are just they feel like
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.640]  they're just doing their jobs and they're not really aware of the of the implications of all this
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.440]  so that does need that does need to be promoted but uh the law of the short of it is what we're
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:02.840]  seeing though today at the same time i mean i think we've got two things going on at once on the one
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:08.680]  hand the acceleration of trends that are deeply disturbing and dangerous for all of us but on
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:13.640]  the other hand we have more people than ever who are becoming alert to this and are becoming
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:20.040]  interested in alternative sources of opinion and that's all to the good and so for instance september
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.560]  22nd i'm told there's a big nationwide and the fed rally at all the different federal reserve banks
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:29.960]  now now for me most of the time i feel like a lot of these demonstrations don't really do much
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:35.640]  but i make an exception to this because the very fact that there's a demonstration outside a federal
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:40.680]  reserve bank makes people realize the federal reserve is something people actually have an
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:45.480]  opinion about and it makes them start realizing hey it's private and hey we're not just going to
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:50.200]  protest the puppet republicans and democrats we're going to go directly to the real puppeteer
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:55.720]  exactly right exactly right because again establishment candidate a versus establishment
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:00.520]  candidate b isn't going to change anything these people are none of them are going to dismantle
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:03.960]  the federal reserve that's their bread and butter none of them are going to do any of these things
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.640]  so we have to go directly again we have to go directly to the public and say what is the thing
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:14.760]  the most important institution that is privileged by the government namely the federal reserve
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:19.560]  that you never hear about or if you do talk about it you are dismissed from polite society
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:23.320]  why is that why do you think it is that we're not supposed to talk about this again arouse
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:28.760]  people's curiosity that can't hurt now i again i don't know in the end game of all this how this
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:33.640]  turns out if we necessarily win maybe we went maybe we don't win well resistance is victory the
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:37.320]  level of turning we'll live under is what we put up with is jefferson said i want to come back and
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:44.120]  talk about uh how we uh counter all of this but bottom line people are really starting to wake
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:49.000]  up as you were saying and as things get worse and worse that will only get other people to wake up
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  stay with us we'll be right back
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:06.600]  what do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking

[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:36.120]  yeah the federal government had decided we were all going to drive 55 and the people said we're
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:41.320]  not putting up with it and it took 20 years but now they're raising the speed limit up to 85 in
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:50.520]  texas hey the germans could drive 150 a lot of the studies show that you get places quicker and
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:56.200]  there's actually less accidents but you better not be texting while you're driving the point is
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:01.240]  the reason i wanted to play a little clip of that is that it's an example of people just saying no
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.960]  and culturally getting what's happening abortions becoming incredibly unpopular
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:12.040]  gun controls becoming incredibly unpopular because people are just waking up and figuring
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:17.640]  out hey you don't want my guns to protect me you want to make me your slave and that's what's
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:23.240]  happening tom woods is our guest best-selling author researcher he's also been awarded humanity
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:27.640]  studies fellowships and he's taught at universities i'm not going to go over the whole deal but he
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:33.800]  has written the book nullification we saw the dvd that he's in that is incredibly powerful
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:38.840]  nullification info war store dot com hope you get it today we got about five minutes left
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:43.800]  look i mean i mentioned this you've got the un and global is taking over with sustainable
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:48.440]  development all the rest of it in towns everywhere because no one's resisting them
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:53.160]  they understand the power of the local and and and so i tell listeners just get out there with the
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:58.200]  truth and get in these parasites face and they'll act like you're powerless up front that's a
[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:04.120]  mind game the truth is they're powerless tom woods well that's absolutely right and as you said
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:09.080]  earlier the to turn out for these local elections are basically negligible so this is i mean talk
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:13.960]  about low-hanging fruit forget about trying to run for congress or something when you could get in
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:19.480]  a state senate without all that much difficulty and a lot of good liberty-minded people will rally
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:24.840]  around you and you don't need a gigantic budget but if you are remotely charismatic and you know
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:30.280]  your stuff then you can't actually stop these people because really these people they they
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:36.840]  prosper in the darkness they prosper by keeping their intentions quiet or off the table or masking
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:42.200]  them with with cutesy saccharine sounding language about the children and future generations whatever
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:47.720]  but they need that benign mask ripped off their faces by somebody who's knowledgeable and frankly
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:52.840]  who can laugh at them humor is so important because these people like to be treated with
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:58.200]  deadly earnest and for us just to treat them as just laughable nobody's just gets under their
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:02.760]  skin and to me it's not enough to just to fight them i want to get under this funny i didn't
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:09.080]  understand that till a few years ago 17 years on air that they will ban our videos and file false
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:15.080]  claims on them when i make fun of a professor saying reduce humanity or i make fun of the tsa
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:22.200]  they do they do not like us laughing at them you're right yeah so i mean basically everybody's
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:27.320]  got to do what he's got to do and i know you know you have a huge audience and a lot of your audience
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:32.360]  feels like i'm already doing everything i can do but maybe not everybody maybe maybe it's you have
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:36.520]  just maybe you should be writing a blog or something instead of emailing 50 of your friends
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:41.080]  your thoughts all the time share your thoughts with the world start doing youtube videos start
[02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:46.520]  doing local access put out a local newspaper put out a newsletter at work you start talking
[02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:50.600]  whatever yeah read a book with your friends something but i mean we have an opportunity
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:55.240]  that hasn't been seen since Gutenberg to spread information and if we don't take it we have only
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:58:00.200]  ourselves and that's why obama now says the cyber security executive order to shut down free speech
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:06.200]  he's now saying an executive order congress wouldn't do what he wanted well the executive order thing i
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:11.720]  mean we could do a whole show on that but that is just so egregiously unconstitutional but neither
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:17.560]  party will actually stop it as long as my party's president is doing it it's okay all right tom woods
