[00:00.000 --> 00:26.040]  They have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the main flu is the
[00:26.040 --> 00:30.600]  next year and it's always a whole bunch of flu dozens and dozens of them and that it does nothing
[00:30.600 --> 00:37.640]  to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu. That's why they never ask why they
[00:37.640 --> 00:42.040]  don't have a vaccine for the common cold because it's too varied because there's thousands of them
[00:42.040 --> 00:46.520]  and because you have to get it exactly right and viruses are always mutating but you notice
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.680]  they're telling you they've got a vaccine they want you willingly to go take whatever it is
[00:50.680 --> 00:55.160]  that's going to be in there now Fauci has come out of you just joined us we're going to play the
[00:55.160 --> 01:00.120]  clip again first here in a moment and said hey we're going to surveil people we're going to cycle
[01:00.120 --> 01:04.840]  into other seasons next year you won't be able to go out either so they'll run into the middle of
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.520]  summer and then let you have a month or two and then clamp it back down but there'll be special
[01:08.520 --> 01:12.920]  apps they're announcing you'll be tracked China was the model they're going to roll it out like
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.640]  they just got these ideas but it's all pre-planned by the Rockefeller Foundation Billumelina Gates
[01:17.640 --> 01:24.120]  the tabletop exercises predicting COVID-19 in November when it was already launched in China
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.160]  I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one and if we fail this test
[01:30.040 --> 01:38.440]  we're going to be ruled by the threat of unending invisible bio weapons they're going to tighten
[01:38.440 --> 01:45.480]  down the restrictions loosen them by the summer and then release new strains immediately that aren't
[01:45.480 --> 01:50.760]  even as bad as the current strain they'll say they're worse fearmonger and then clamp down even
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.840]  stronger that's what they've done in Italy it's what they've done in other areas where they've
[01:54.840 --> 02:00.440]  been beta testing like Spain and now moving towards Australia so this is all formulaic it's all
[02:00.440 --> 02:07.640]  heavily scripted and we know their plan so those are clips from a year and a half ago right through
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.840]  to about a year ago predicting exactly with precision what then unfolded how do we do it
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.680]  because it's all scripted the mainstream media the enemies of humanity are rubbing their hands
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.040]  together with all these gleeful articles about all the deaths in the hospitals and all the
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.760]  incredible pneumonias and illnesses of all these new diseases that are rising up and all these
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.680]  strange new viruses that are killing young people and saying oh you said COVID wasn't real huh
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.440]  oh no it was a real virus they made in the lab where the vaccine response
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.960]  then causes massive mutations and all these new variants which I predicted with top scientists
[02:43.960 --> 02:53.640]  on my show 18 months ago 17 months ago 16 months ago 15 months ago 14 months ago would by this fall
[02:54.760 --> 02:59.640]  we said eight months or so after the first inoculations cause a massive plague
[03:01.080 --> 03:07.480]  so we have all the clips where we predicted that and that's coming up today the cruise
[03:07.480 --> 03:11.960]  been giving me all these clips that folks are digging up and freaking out over but I want you
[03:11.960 --> 03:17.400]  to know again it wasn't that Alex Jones had a supercomputer brain even though all our brains
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.160]  are more powerful than a supercomputer my point is not a supercomputer of supercomputers
[03:22.200 --> 03:27.480]  not a mighty mouse brain just the brain god gave me and we laid out exactly what's going
[03:27.480 --> 03:34.520]  to happen so I can tell you right now all over the country my contacts tell me I talked to a
[03:34.520 --> 03:39.720]  very high level scientist very high level doctors today two different ones one of them is in
[03:39.720 --> 03:46.600]  Michigan speaking at a big event with general Flynn he runs a hospital and he was saying this
[03:46.600 --> 03:52.280]  is a Chinese bio weapon for sure and he just can't believe that Fauci and Gates and all them that
[03:52.280 --> 03:58.840]  helped set up the lab run the drills have not been put in prison that really is what all this
[03:58.840 --> 04:05.240]  comes down to and the perfect plan to create an injection that supposedly counters the virus
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.840]  that then makes your body produce new variants of it and mass and by this this this winter you
[04:10.840 --> 04:14.680]  know there's just going to be millions of dead probably and we always knew that that was in
[04:14.680 --> 04:18.760]  the literature so all the top scientists said you know the good news is most of the doctors
[04:18.760 --> 04:23.000]  and scientists are on our side and they they knew all this and warned everybody and I thought it was
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.160]  a little extreme 16 17 months ago when every scientist we had on and every scientist we played
[04:29.160 --> 04:35.640]  clips of all the former chief scientist at Pfizer in the head EU advisor and then so many others
[04:35.640 --> 04:40.760]  and Dr. Francis Boyle that wrote the US biological weapons law and the chief human prosecutor said
[04:40.760 --> 04:47.960]  everything would come true like this and it did it did I mean they really did it to us and and
[04:47.960 --> 04:53.080]  now we're in hell and we have a puppet president that just signed over Afghanistan to China
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.160]  China's threatening to invade Taiwan this is the end of America folks they did it the country's
[04:57.160 --> 05:07.320]  under assault the first time I heard the speech the first time I read the writings of Teddy
[05:07.320 --> 05:13.400]  Roosevelt I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the
[05:13.400 --> 05:18.040]  man in the arena and I just remember thinking about that saying I want to be the man in the arena
[05:18.680 --> 05:23.880]  but when it comes to media info wars has been the tip of that spear but Mike Lindell has come along
[05:23.880 --> 05:29.320]  and done just as good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and
[05:29.320 --> 05:35.720]  other issues and that's why if you go to my pillow.com use promo code Alex you get up to 66%

[06:35.240 --> 06:43.080]  well this is it the end of america the fall of the republic and the birth of the new second
[06:43.080 --> 06:51.400]  dark age under the cyclotronic control of the technocracy and the good part is all the leftist
[06:51.400 --> 06:56.680]  and all the scum are going to be judged they'll be the first to die the first to be incinerated
[06:58.680 --> 07:02.280]  but everybody that didn't like america didn't like freedom and didn't like Jesus
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.480]  didn't like free market and didn't like self-defense you're about to get front row seats to your own
[07:09.480 --> 07:22.360]  destruction this is the very twilight the final minutes soon to be the final seconds and the death
[07:22.360 --> 07:29.320]  of the republic and the takeover of the planet by the globalist the eu and the chikoms and hollywood
[07:29.320 --> 07:35.960]  and its satanic minions are going to take their time with us slowly breaking the country down and
[07:35.960 --> 07:41.880]  slicing into little chunks and we are going to go into bondage just like those little babies
[07:42.600 --> 07:46.520]  who never got to suckle up their mother's breasts never got to learn their first word
[07:46.520 --> 07:52.040]  never got to learn about puppy dogs and kittens or goldfish they just got their brains sucked out
[07:54.040 --> 07:58.440]  on the operating table at nine months old they were lucky they weren't lucky they got
[07:58.440 --> 08:04.760]  taken delivered live to a university facility where the medical staff did unbelievable things to them
[08:04.760 --> 08:10.360]  they weren't just ordering live fetuses for live vivisection they weren't just cutting their hearts
[08:10.360 --> 08:16.520]  and livers out you know they were doing more don't you that's why on national canadian television
[08:16.520 --> 08:22.120]  suddenly they just cut in with a satanic ritual on live tv it's all about letting you know that it's
[08:22.120 --> 08:32.760]  game time game time ladies and gentlemen on canadian tv and australian tv and everywhere
[08:32.760 --> 08:41.720]  this stuff is just cutting in we've got some more news on that
[08:44.440 --> 08:52.360]  coming up so let me give you the big news i've talked to a lot of medical doctors around the
[08:52.360 --> 08:57.160]  country talked to one today a very prestigious one you know guy you see on fox news was gonna be
[08:57.160 --> 09:02.920]  coming on our show in studio soon fellow texan and i've talked to a lot of people in the military
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.360]  that are left that aren't part of the system they're part of the old system and uh this is
[09:08.360 --> 09:14.520]  definitely a communist chinese globalist attack but directed by the globalist cfr trilateral commission
[09:15.240 --> 09:23.480]  debos group through the obama combine and they set by enough told him that there would be a
[09:23.480 --> 09:31.320]  safe withdrawal so they could then burn him to obviously then invoke 25th amendment and bring
[09:31.320 --> 09:38.120]  in kamala who's a total incomplete puppet even more so than biden and it's about making communist
[09:38.120 --> 09:42.680]  china look strong so they can say that they're going to invade taiwan they said when the invasion
[09:42.680 --> 09:48.680]  comes america will betray you america won't help you that is just super massive news but
[09:48.680 --> 09:55.080]  but i love america and i love what's left of it but i would lie to you if i didn't say
[09:56.360 --> 10:00.680]  that the fact that we allowed the chinese communist with traders inside our own government
[10:00.680 --> 10:06.200]  to launch this bio attack on us that big tech helps censor all the info and even block treatments
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.800]  at every level and and and and the fact that we failed to stop the criminal combine of the big
[10:11.800 --> 10:18.840]  banks big tech the media the chai comms and traders in our government to launch this has
[10:18.840 --> 10:24.680]  emboldened them and they went ahead with the inoculation program of the gene therapy that then
[10:24.680 --> 10:31.720]  turned 150 million americans that took the denly injections into vaccines shedding factories
[10:31.720 --> 10:38.120]  which is confirmed any live vaccine whether it's virus vector or mRNA those are all live
[10:38.120 --> 10:44.120]  operations sluffs new mutants that's confirmed not debated that's the big story and
[10:47.560 --> 10:52.920]  now there is true illness and true death all over the place and when you call the doctor
[10:52.920 --> 10:57.640]  they're not given any information by the big pharmacies or by their medical boards they're just
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.000]  say oh the hospitals are full you just stay at home stay in bed and when you stay in bed with
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.360]  covid 19 with a delta variant your lungs slowly collapse and then right when you're ready then
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.000]  you go to the hospital they animate you and you die within 48 hours they don't tell you about the
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.080]  steroids you could take they don't tell you about ivermectin they don't tell you about zinger hydroxy
[11:17.080 --> 11:24.200]  chloroquine they just wait like demonic spiders to kill you and the death toll is just incredible
[11:24.200 --> 11:29.800]  i most of the people i know have friends and family that are now dead just recently but notice
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.920]  it's not a big deal in the news yet when the real attack comes they don't tell you when it was the
[11:34.920 --> 11:39.320]  fake attack last year they were getting you ready for the vaccine that would ensure it got in your
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.880]  body to make sure they could do it to you well they hyped up every car wreck every gunshot wound
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.400]  every person that died of cancer or heart failure as as covid but it was a real virus that so they
[11:49.400 --> 11:55.400]  could own it a chimera to then have the so-called vaccine be the response that turns you into
[11:55.400 --> 12:00.840]  incubator and then right at the key point the oldest people the sickest people that have
[12:00.840 --> 12:06.360]  already had their immune systems lowered almost to nothing by the last two so-called vaccines
[12:06.360 --> 12:11.800]  then you take the booster which bill gates said a year and a half ago they'll be a booster
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.760]  that you'll need to take within the first year but they said they never knew that they never
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.800]  knew the vaccine would fail but of course they did it's not a vaccine so what is the third shot
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.920]  going to do that they've specially made right now well that's going to be the super weapon
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.320]  that the people that are already primed have their immune systems lowered
[12:35.080 --> 12:38.840]  they're going to take the third booster shot like they're already doing in england and they're
[12:38.840 --> 12:44.440]  already doing in israel and the vast majority of those that take it get deadly ill go to the hospital
[12:44.440 --> 12:50.840]  and many of them die and that's because they are a factory weapon the third injection fully takes
[12:50.840 --> 12:57.080]  over your body you have no immune system no nothing it gets in it replicates it takes you over and
[12:57.080 --> 13:03.720]  you're like a suicide bomber you just and then yes the evidence shows once they shed and infect
[13:03.720 --> 13:10.360]  others they infect others they infect others they infect others so this isn't normal virology
[13:11.560 --> 13:16.040]  where people get a virus and then they have variants that are almost always weaker
[13:16.040 --> 13:24.280]  no no these are these are stronger because it was already cooked up and the different generations
[13:24.280 --> 13:30.440]  of how it mutates was already prepared and studied on human subjects in china and on animals
[13:30.440 --> 13:37.640]  so this is decades in the making developed by globalist in the pentagon under obama developed
[13:37.640 --> 13:43.080]  and then deployed in 2015 to china and then there was a nationalist uprising worldwide the
[13:43.080 --> 13:48.200]  globals were in trouble and so they implemented operation lockstep as biden has now said we
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.440]  have implemented operation lockstep he told you about that years before he ever talked about it
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.640]  10 years before hell he was vice president we first told you about lockstep but now he's the
[13:57.640 --> 14:03.000]  president the puppet he says i've implemented this all in lockstep that was loaded into his
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.400]  teleprompter so this is a bio attack on the world and the chinese always said they said we're happy
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.840]  to have a nuclear war we got too many people so they made a deal with the globalist to let their
[14:14.840 --> 14:21.320]  own people get hit let us get hit but notice the chinese there's the key and the indians and
[14:21.320 --> 14:30.680]  all those other countries they refused the maderna the phyzer the jnj the astrazeneca and all of it
[14:30.680 --> 14:40.440]  they all refused it and remember not even 10 percent of india is taking it even their own
[14:40.440 --> 14:48.840]  government shot only 20 percent in australia and remember the rest of the world's not taking this
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.080]  and they're only targeting the western world with these weapons because you can't have a new world
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.200]  order into the future with a bunch of uppity americans that want motorboats and swimming pools
[14:58.200 --> 15:06.040]  and and and and casinos and they're seinfeld episodes you're dead this is it they're removing
[15:06.040 --> 15:11.080]  you they're killing you right now this is a bio attack you live to see it you're in world war
[15:11.080 --> 15:15.880]  four folks the cia called cold war world war three i agree with that this is world war four
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  and it is a corporate war against humanity itself a depopulation war but the main group not under
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.760]  global is controlled these areas of latin america a few areas of africa the united states and some
[15:30.760 --> 15:34.520]  areas of europe and the uk and those are all the places where they're saying you've got to take
[15:34.520 --> 15:41.400]  your shot 100 because they need to go ahead and kill as many of us as we can and by the time we
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.080]  figure it out again they'll say oh it's a new variant like i said a year ago when i said you
[15:45.080 --> 15:48.840]  take the vaccine it's going to kill you it's going to kill others they're going to say oh it's a variant
[15:48.840 --> 15:54.760]  did it they've done it so they've launched the attack and just remember that no matter who you are
[15:54.760 --> 16:01.080]  or who you work for you're gonna have to face this now if you're concerned about the power grid
[16:01.080 --> 16:06.200]  and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most important
[16:06.200 --> 16:12.040]  message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in
[16:12.040 --> 16:17.960]  stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most
[16:17.960 --> 16:24.120]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an
[16:24.120 --> 16:29.320]  endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power
[16:29.320 --> 16:34.840]  grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages
[16:34.840 --> 16:41.800]  again even better all this week radio listeners get over 700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too

[17:00.600 --> 17:05.960]  thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food i've got great news in fact i'll
[17:05.960 --> 17:10.840]  bet it's the best news you've heard in a while here's the thing we've just received a fresh batch

[18:00.840 --> 18:05.960]  so when i first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i
[18:05.960 --> 18:11.000]  had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard doctor
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.840]  group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.400]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.320]  you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[18:23.320 --> 18:29.800]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.080]  i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[18:35.080 --> 18:39.480]  years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're
[18:39.480 --> 18:44.440]  all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it'll literally like if you
[18:44.440 --> 18:49.160]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.640]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[18:53.640 --> 18:58.200]  our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call
[18:58.200 --> 19:04.440]  and godspeed gerald and south carolina go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker hey alex
[19:04.440 --> 19:09.320]  welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.960]  stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double
[19:13.960 --> 19:21.160]  amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my
[19:21.160 --> 19:27.400]  life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[19:27.400 --> 19:33.560]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is math
[19:33.560 --> 19:41.080]  you 24 verse nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[19:41.080 --> 19:47.800]  shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.920]  one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because
[19:52.920 --> 19:57.160]  god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy
[19:57.160 --> 20:06.360]  hates it because god created this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:18.120 --> 20:22.680]  remember the man that wrote and sang this incredible song almost died from the Pfizer shot
[20:22.680 --> 20:29.080]  he says it's part of a depopulation plan that's right let's listen to him for a second he's still
[20:29.080 --> 20:43.800]  alive but barely turn it up how many people gotta get sick and die from these shots before we can
[20:43.800 --> 20:52.520]  bring fouchy and bill gates to justice you know psychos always launch attacks and the smarter ones
[20:52.520 --> 20:59.560]  do it covertly like these guys have done but we've exposed them and i want fouchy and i want gates
[20:59.560 --> 21:05.000]  to know at a metaphysical spiritual level i know you're going to pay for what you've done in this
[21:05.000 --> 21:14.200]  life and after you're dead i know that at a spiritual holy spirit level today i was very upset this
[21:14.200 --> 21:20.440]  morning going through a lot of stuff and god just said don't worry they're gonna pay and they're
[21:20.440 --> 21:29.480]  gonna pay very soon and not by my hands and not by your hands god is going to destroy these people
[21:29.480 --> 21:34.280]  that are trying to destroy our country in the world but let's be honest we got here because
[21:34.280 --> 21:40.200]  we become a backslidden evil nation and the whole world is now really getting upset watching what the
[21:40.200 --> 21:46.040]  united states has turned into ladies and gentlemen they 100 percent told the taliban to take over
[21:46.040 --> 21:53.800]  that way they 100 percent set joe biden up as much as i hate his guts this is obama and this is
[21:53.800 --> 21:58.840]  kamala harris and this is their plan doesn't mean biden doesn't get in trouble doesn't mean he's not
[21:58.840 --> 22:05.720]  terrible my point is we need to put the blame on the bureaucracy that put him in and and the media
[22:05.720 --> 22:10.280]  that said he could be a president and that helped him steal the election they all want to turn on
[22:10.280 --> 22:18.440]  him now so they can bring in the next obama puppet because joe biden is senile as he is
[22:18.440 --> 22:24.280]  he's not a complete obama puppet they want another puppet in there so they can carry out their
[22:24.280 --> 22:31.000]  globalist operations and then they don't get the blame and then america gets the blame through the
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.880]  puppet president instead of it being their puppet this is a globalist project afghanistan was a
[22:35.880 --> 22:41.240]  globalist project we should have left afghanistan but the way biden was told in his briefings oh
[22:41.880 --> 22:48.200]  we with 300 000 person it's fine it's going to be great but he flip flops and goes oh we always
[22:48.200 --> 22:53.720]  knew it was going to fail that's just him arrogantly doubling down because normally he's got media
[22:53.720 --> 23:00.840]  support to do that this is all a setup and a green light to china go ahead and take tywin
[23:00.840 --> 23:05.560]  go ahead and do whatever you want move in with the taliban and take over the 2.2 trillion in
[23:05.560 --> 23:14.040]  infrastructure that place has three lane highways now and shopping malls and grocery stores and and
[23:14.040 --> 23:21.960]  infrastructure everywhere to get the tens of trillions of dollars of rare earth minerals i mean
[23:21.960 --> 23:30.760]  afghanistan just has all sorts of incredible rare earth minerals just laying around the ground
[23:30.760 --> 23:35.400]  it's like areas of africa just have diamonds laying around well in in afghanistan it's just
[23:35.400 --> 23:41.960]  everything you need for a modern society everything goes into computers and switches
[23:41.960 --> 23:49.320]  and chips is all there everywhere and so they don't even care with him even have the clocks right
[23:49.320 --> 23:55.880]  to even you know not show secret cia stuff he does a briefing because it's all about projecting
[23:55.880 --> 24:02.040]  weakness because one of the cfr say going back 30 years we're going to have the end of america by
[24:02.040 --> 24:11.240]  2020 and the rise of communist china and the new world order and the technocracy by 2030 you can go
[24:11.240 --> 24:19.400]  read this in the books they write all the cfr articles i mean i i go to classical bookstores
[24:19.400 --> 24:24.760]  still sell books every few months and i'll go to the magazine section they have a a book it's like
[24:24.760 --> 24:30.920]  a magazine it's a bimonthly book called foreign affairs but the cfr and i usually buy it i've
[24:30.920 --> 24:36.040]  shown it to you on air and read excerpts of it but a good third of the time that i pick one up a few
[24:36.040 --> 24:41.880]  times a year it's half the articles are america sucks china's taken over the dragon century
[24:41.880 --> 24:48.840]  on and on the fact what this is because the parasites that took over america hate christianity
[24:49.800 --> 24:56.440]  and they fundamentally have always wanted to basically defeat america and so they don't even
[24:56.440 --> 25:03.640]  care about losing their own power as long as they can really persecute christians and really bring
[25:03.640 --> 25:08.520]  satanism to america and really bring pedophilia to america they can do it and that all sounds
[25:08.520 --> 25:14.040]  fantastical it sounds terrible but you see the news you see the culture you see the television you see
[25:14.760 --> 25:20.600]  what it is and and so it's religious that's like why would a jihadi blow themselves up for no reason
[25:20.600 --> 25:27.480]  well he thinks he gets seven virgins instantly he's he's dialed into that satanic force that's why
[25:27.480 --> 25:34.040]  islam is allied with the globalists because at the end of the day they are the satanic force who
[25:34.040 --> 25:40.200]  take the symbol of the pentacle which is the symbol of man like a rush album it's not a satanic
[25:41.080 --> 25:45.320]  to have a man standing in a pentacle that's the ancient symbol of a human that's why they say
[25:45.320 --> 25:50.040]  you're a star you know the symbol of a human they had the two arms legs you invert that
[25:50.760 --> 25:55.880]  it's humanity going down that's what the satanists are wearing a symbol of is the destruction
[25:55.880 --> 26:02.440]  of humanity same thing with a cross a cross is really a sun symbol all cultures have it it's a
[26:02.440 --> 26:11.960]  swastika and the most simple form is two arms and a head and a leg and it's it's it's rotating
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.800]  and it's it but it's the symbol of life across with the arms straight out or up is the symbol of life
[26:19.240 --> 26:22.760]  now what's the symbol of death what's the democrats main symbol what's the left symbol
[26:22.760 --> 26:29.560]  a cross with the arms down that's the rune of death whether it's whether you're
[26:30.120 --> 26:37.800]  british or whether you are germanic or whether you were an ancient person in india or an ancient
[26:37.800 --> 26:43.800]  arian in iran nothing to do with hitler's arian's it was actually called the arian empire
[26:45.400 --> 26:51.960]  that was a symbol arms up a treat guys type in the rune of life the rune of life
[26:51.960 --> 26:57.320]  is arms up on a tree what's the true and trees alive is its branches up or it dies as its branches
[26:57.320 --> 27:05.720]  down so see our symbol is across arms out arms up what is the satanic symbol arms down
[27:06.600 --> 27:13.720]  dead tree just type in rune of death germanic rune of death it's in every other culture so so
[27:13.720 --> 27:20.920]  they're telling you look the the the the cross is upside down the star is upside down the tree is
[27:20.920 --> 27:29.000]  upside down it's death death death here i'll show you yeah that's a rune of life right there now
[27:30.440 --> 27:34.840]  show people oh that's a rune of death right there absolutely anybody can test it for yourself
[27:34.840 --> 27:39.720]  and again they'll probably have an adl story jones flashing swastikas on screen yeah like in hindu
[27:39.720 --> 27:45.400]  temples all is is a sun symbol people what what's good the sun it turns it rolls it goes up it goes
[27:45.400 --> 27:50.200]  down it rolls across the horizon it brings life you bring your sick out and put them under the sun
[27:50.200 --> 27:57.240]  the sun will heal them when a tree has life its arms are up when a tree has death its arms are down
[27:57.240 --> 28:06.840]  there is the rune of death well the circle around it it means a ritual of worldwide death worldwide
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.960]  death the liberals the democratic party the peace movement they are not what they say they are does
[28:11.960 --> 28:17.000]  that mean peace is bad no no no they claim they're the environmental movement as they kill the earth
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.520]  they claim they're the peace movement as they kill humanity they claim they're guardians of the galaxy
[28:22.520 --> 28:28.360]  when they come to destroy it now i'm going to stop ranting about this but i just can't lie to you
[28:28.360 --> 28:34.520]  and i can't come on air and not tell you that we are in grave trouble and they've initiated the
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.160]  total collapse of the united states only a total awakening and people in government waking up to
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.480]  how much trouble we're in and refusing to comply with these orders is going to stop this and maybe
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.880]  that's not supposed to happen maybe we're all supposed to be judged but remember what comes next
[28:47.880 --> 28:54.840]  is a lot worse if we don't turn it around now now we have some huge january 6 news straight ahead
[28:54.840 --> 29:02.920]  will break live on air stay with us hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy covid

[31:59.240 --> 32:05.000]  thank you so much for your support let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a
[32:05.000 --> 32:10.520]  science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members
[32:10.520 --> 32:16.280]  of congress and former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental
[32:16.280 --> 32:23.240]  injection that grows blood clots and and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly
[32:23.240 --> 32:29.240]  on an airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell
[32:29.240 --> 32:36.040]  just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and then
[32:36.040 --> 32:40.680]  they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she got to
[32:40.680 --> 32:46.120]  take it every few months and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time
[32:46.120 --> 32:50.600]  so i can go outside and not get sick from coven even though it gets you sick from coven and now
[32:50.600 --> 32:55.560]  there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's
[32:55.560 --> 33:00.200]  in mainline studies bill gates and foulsy did this need to go to prison for it right now
[33:00.200 --> 33:06.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:17.080 --> 33:18.200]  cyrus jones
[33:18.200 --> 33:27.560]  cyrus jones from 1810 to 1913
[33:29.000 --> 33:38.040]  made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103 103 is forever when you're just a
[33:38.040 --> 33:44.280]  little kid that's how old my dad's grandmother love to be cyrus jones they call her ma jones
[33:44.280 --> 33:51.640]  jones i got to know her good but that wasn't a real name my name was moon jones
[33:54.120 --> 33:58.920]  and she came from a native american tribe he had to keep secret interesting stuff
[34:01.400 --> 34:04.040]  texas is a cool place all right
[34:06.840 --> 34:12.280]  a little bit of factoid there my dad comes from the county like one over more willing else is from
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.760]  him there's a lot of willy nelson looking old weirdos out there that are good guys though
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.680]  and old willy i don't blame him too much for being a leftist he doesn't know any better
[34:20.680 --> 34:27.240]  he's brainwashed in control he's way way past his prime barely alive every time i hear him sing
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.760]  that song it makes me think about it all right let's get into it right now um
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.760]  um
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.480]  you know it's hard to tell a willy nelson story and then get into something like this
[34:42.520 --> 34:48.440]  because this is really really a big deal and i don't want to say things about this that are wrong
[34:50.760 --> 34:55.160]  and a lot of times when i get ready to say something on air during the break i had it all
[34:55.160 --> 35:03.640]  crystallized and i had the perfect explanation to put the english spin on it i don't mean spin
[35:03.640 --> 35:12.920]  like in politics but spin like in pool billiards to take so many different pieces of information
[35:14.520 --> 35:19.480]  and put it together so that it's really clear and people get the nuance of it does that make sense
[35:19.480 --> 35:25.800]  and then i take a phone call and forget what i was going to say and then i say hey i'll
[35:25.800 --> 35:33.080]  i'll cover it next segment which is what i'm going to do now but just as soon as i try
[35:38.360 --> 35:41.800]  to grasp that fire again it flickers away from me and disappears
[35:41.800 --> 35:50.680]  but i tell you i'm really surprised at the establishment i mean it's one thing to plan
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.760]  this new world order it's one thing to plan the end of america it's one thing to plan a bio weapon
[35:54.760 --> 35:59.800]  release it's one thing to plan injection people with a program that's going to grow prions in them
[35:59.800 --> 36:06.040]  until they die and then suppress treatments but it's whole another inch a lot of baby to do it
[36:07.560 --> 36:11.720]  so i'll give it to schwa but i'll give it to gates and i'll give it to fouchy man you guys are
[36:11.720 --> 36:21.400]  some bad motherfuckers you guys are some bad bad hombres hitler ain't got nothing on you
[36:23.320 --> 36:27.960]  you vampire bat creature but you know what
[36:30.360 --> 36:33.240]  if we take what claus schwaab and bill gates dish out
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.640]  and fouchy pisses on us with and we deserve what we get i actually i actually get what they're
[36:39.640 --> 36:48.760]  saying about survival of the fittest and social Darwinism if i let them kill my family without
[36:48.760 --> 36:59.480]  retribution that i deserve to die but i do think they've really uh outstayed their welcome on this
[36:59.480 --> 37:06.840]  planet and i do think that they have the like psychos always do take our sleeping and our kindness
[37:06.840 --> 37:11.480]  for weakness and i don't think that's the case those of us that aren't seeking power and aren't
[37:11.480 --> 37:17.080]  seeking blood just for blood sake quite frankly don't want to spill your blood we don't want to
[37:17.080 --> 37:23.400]  touch you we wish you'd go scurry off into some dark hole and just disappear but you know just
[37:23.400 --> 37:27.480]  like all the other evils in this world in history you're not going to go away without a fight are
[37:27.480 --> 37:39.160]  you and i think that's really the bottom line of what we've come down to here so next segment
[37:39.160 --> 37:43.960]  i'll cover the news that that is interesting and you know it's not because i'm at the center of
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.400]  this news and i'm going to cover it in fact it's because i am at the center of this news
[37:48.520 --> 37:51.960]  that i would have led with this story today i woke up at five a.m
[37:51.960 --> 37:58.760]  like waiting for another punch in the stomach i put my name in google news
[37:59.400 --> 38:03.960]  to prepare to see the new lie the new attack is nine and a half percent of the time it's some
[38:03.960 --> 38:14.200]  horrible vicious thing and i sat there on the toilet at five thirty a.m and hit the button
[38:14.200 --> 38:20.200]  waiting for the punch in the stomach and there was the fbi exonerates alex joneson roger stone
[38:20.200 --> 38:25.480]  for january six and so ever since five thirty a.m i've been thinking about what does that mean
[38:28.280 --> 38:36.280]  and i i i think i know what that means and it's actually a positive thing not for me i mean i
[38:36.280 --> 38:42.920]  let me explain something i i signed my life over a long time ago i made a deal with god
[38:42.920 --> 38:51.080]  for god to save me if i do the right thing so the globalists can't threaten me they can't
[38:51.080 --> 38:56.280]  threaten my family they can't do anything to get me to sell out because i already have a deal
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.240]  so i'm not worried about myself but i really wanted to think and know what this meant so i
[39:03.240 --> 39:07.320]  called a lot of people i respect and they had different ideas and different different views
[39:07.320 --> 39:14.840]  on it but i i i know what it is and it's something smart cfbi being smart whatever's left of it
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.080]  and i and i think and even in the establishment that that's that's not anti america in the small
[39:21.080 --> 39:26.600]  vestigial grip it's left there's got to be a question of like is is the new world order really
[39:26.600 --> 39:33.560]  a suicide pack i mean it's screwing america over and your power and taking over really really
[39:33.560 --> 39:41.000]  gonna be good if you're destroyed in the process and so and so that's what this is about now i'll
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.520]  talk about it and go over it next segment because it is an important big story i mean they had the
[39:46.520 --> 39:54.920]  dogs out wanting me arrested for january 6 and they they subpoenaed us and fbi's told me you're
[39:54.920 --> 39:59.960]  under criminal investigation and you know all the rest of it and i never really worried about any
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.320]  of that because i didn't do anything they were saying i did i understood it was part of something
[40:05.320 --> 40:14.040]  larger about starting a war with the american people and i don't want a war with the american people
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.680]  i don't want a war with the fbi i don't want a war with the us army not just because they're
[40:18.680 --> 40:27.640]  a bunch of killers but because it's stupid and it's not for anybody's interest but there is the
[40:27.640 --> 40:36.120]  chicken crap dimension i talk about and these weird globalists that want to see america burn
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.680]  because they don't want the idea of prosperity there when this new dark age of tyranny begins and
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.560]  that's really what this is and so we have to transcend this and not be emotional and really
[40:45.560 --> 40:51.080]  realize what's going on and and and deescalate all of this crap right now because there's a large
[40:51.080 --> 40:57.560]  of the federal government that's allied with satan not even the chinese that's just allied with
[40:57.560 --> 41:03.160]  pedophilia just anything hollywood it's it's hollywood it's a spirit of hollywood that that literally
[41:03.160 --> 41:10.200]  wants a war with the christians but they want the military and police they already hate to go out
[41:10.760 --> 41:17.800]  and have that war with us i i choose not to participate and and and that's all i'm saying
[41:17.800 --> 41:23.880]  and i've said that on air and i hope that stuff like this from the fbi is the beginning of sanity
[41:23.880 --> 41:32.280]  so this can be stopped because i'm not scared of the fbi i'm scared of me and i'm scared of people
[41:32.280 --> 41:37.800]  like me and i'm just saying please stop please the globalists are going to win if this war starts
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.520]  we do not want a domestic war we do not want this insanity so a bunch of bankers can have their
[41:42.520 --> 41:48.040]  chinese century let's just stop complying together and just not kill each other and we can save the
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.200]  world i'm going to go to break and come back i said i wouldn't start hitting it but i i did
[41:52.200 --> 41:57.320]  start hitting it right there but there's a this is a big deal all this is a big deal
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.640]  and we just need to stop it now separately i can't stay on air if you don't find this plus

[44:03.880 --> 44:09.240]  i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i
[44:09.240 --> 44:13.720]  heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.360]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[44:18.360 --> 44:21.960]  had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[44:21.960 --> 44:28.440]  and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[44:28.440 --> 44:33.800]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple
[44:33.800 --> 44:38.360]  of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're
[44:38.360 --> 44:43.480]  all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout literally like if you want
[44:43.480 --> 44:47.960]  to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[44:47.960 --> 44:52.440]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[44:52.440 --> 44:57.320]  our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and god
[44:57.320 --> 45:08.040]  speed the first time i heard the speech the first time i read the writings of teddy roosevelt i was
[45:08.040 --> 45:14.120]  in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena
[45:14.120 --> 45:19.320]  and i just remember thinking about that saying i want to be the man in the arena but when it comes
[45:19.320 --> 45:24.920]  to media info wars has been the tip of that spear but mike lindell has come along and done just as
[45:24.920 --> 45:30.360]  good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues and
[45:30.360 --> 45:36.920]  that's why if you go to my pillow dot com use promo code alex you get up to 66 percent off on
[45:36.920 --> 45:41.240]  all the amazing products he's not so many not just pillows not just towels not the sheets
[45:41.240 --> 45:46.040]  and then you fund info wars and mike lindell and the fight for free speech against the globalist
[45:46.040 --> 45:50.360]  there's not a better place to spend your money than my pillow dot com with promo code alex
[45:50.360 --> 45:55.480]  and if you do it it funds the info war it funds the election investigation and it stands up against
[45:55.480 --> 46:02.040]  these globalist bullies my pillow dot com promo code alex take action now let's go back in time
[46:02.040 --> 46:08.280]  say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world
[46:08.280 --> 46:13.240]  government's being established where members of congress and former presidents are censored by
[46:13.240 --> 46:19.480]  big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood clots and and prions
[46:19.480 --> 46:25.640]  all over your body then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane think about that because that's
[46:25.640 --> 46:32.280]  where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would
[46:32.280 --> 46:38.680]  be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's out of axia gene therapy
[46:38.680 --> 46:43.320]  and it doesn't really work she got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.680]  say great i want to take it all the time so i can go outside and not get sick from coven even though
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.640]  it gets you sick from coven and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing
[46:53.640 --> 46:58.920]  the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies bill gates and foulsy did this need to go
[46:58.920 --> 47:10.280]  to prison for it right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:10.280 --> 47:21.640]  you
[47:22.280 --> 47:31.160]  keeps on raining love is going to break going down going down now down to chicago
[47:31.160 --> 47:38.440]  you know lady good stuff right there
[47:42.760 --> 47:44.520]  here it comes back around one more time
[47:44.520 --> 47:51.800]  so
[47:55.160 --> 48:00.920]  didn't consciousness amazing welcome back to this august 20th friday transmission
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.480]  i'm your host alex jones so what are the smartest minds out there people i respect what do they
[48:07.480 --> 48:14.920]  think about the big announcement that reverses the national security policy of the president the
[48:14.920 --> 48:21.480]  puppet national security strategy for counter domestic terrorism says islamic threat doesn't
[48:21.480 --> 48:27.720]  even exist with five million islamic refugees from afghanistan coming to europe and the u.s right now
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.760]  and people hanging off airplane wheels no they say opposition to coven measures questioning the
[48:34.760 --> 48:41.400]  election that's the main terror threat so then the fbi comes out the big article to roiders
[48:43.400 --> 48:48.600]  and reverses that and says we're giving a final report to congress they've already
[48:48.600 --> 48:51.640]  seen it will be public soon then the democrats agree with it
[48:54.200 --> 49:01.640]  that there's scant evidence not zero i what is definition of scant means maybe like a shadow of
[49:01.640 --> 49:13.880]  evidence that anybody planned an attack on the capital that was premeditated and and and they
[49:13.880 --> 49:19.880]  specifically say that alex jones roger stone and donald trump coordinated hell they've admitted
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.280]  to us they got all our phone records they check trump's phone records they went over everything
[49:24.280 --> 49:30.600]  they sent police to my hotel roger stone literally said get out of dc but we're gonna arrest you i mean
[49:30.600 --> 49:36.040]  it was that illegal that police state they the cops literally believed we launched the attack on the
[49:36.040 --> 49:43.560]  capital and with one group of police we were like hey here i am on video saying please don't
[49:43.560 --> 49:47.640]  they're like wow we didn't know that we're told it's you you attacked us i mean this is the level
[49:47.640 --> 49:52.600]  of bs going on how they manipulate americans against each other and how stupid this is
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.240]  why would i get a million people in dc for a 10 day investigation and a pause on the election
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.680]  to prove fraud to have us act like idiots and go in there in in berserker outfits and
[50:02.680 --> 50:08.680]  defecate nancy polosi's office making us look like idiots that is the last thing i would do
[50:08.680 --> 50:16.520]  but it doesn't matter i'm on video trying to stop it but this isn't about alex jones or roger stone
[50:16.520 --> 50:24.200]  or even president trump this is about you saw thousands that's a conservative number of articles
[50:24.200 --> 50:31.240]  saying arrest roger stone arrest alex jones arrest trump they premeditatedly did this
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.720]  their million people attacked the capital uh no they didn't look at that crowd it goes for miles
[50:35.720 --> 50:41.560]  and miles and miles they were told trump was going to speak there but before he even finished his
[50:41.560 --> 50:50.040]  speech provocateurs and the crowd started fights with the cops and the rest is history so we know
[50:50.040 --> 50:58.440]  we were set up we know what happened what does it mean here's the Reuters exclusive fbi finds scant
[50:58.440 --> 51:05.880]  evidence us capital attack was coordinated sources and i can't believe how accurate these fbi statements
[51:05.880 --> 51:12.600]  are i mean i'm reading this it's like very nuanced it's extremely true because it's like uh yeah
[51:12.600 --> 51:16.200]  there was about five percent that were provocateur militia grips we're not sure it was commanding
[51:16.200 --> 51:21.320]  them but looks like they just did it kind of on their own and that they did think they were going
[51:21.320 --> 51:25.240]  into the capital to take over but then they had no plan once they got there that's exactly what
[51:25.240 --> 51:29.480]  we've researched that's true because it was q stuff and you said be there something magic's
[51:29.480 --> 51:35.720]  gonna happen just so so it was q stuff is that the democrats is that a foreign agency i don't know
[51:36.360 --> 51:41.400]  i just know that you got a million people there and a couple hundred fight the cops and then a
[51:41.400 --> 51:48.520]  six hundred or so go in and then we're all terrorist and so you read it the fbi goes on to say
[51:54.280 --> 52:01.080]  90 to 95 percent of these are one-off cases said a former senior law enforcement official
[52:01.080 --> 52:06.040]  with knowledge about the investigation then you have a five percent maybe of these militia groups
[52:06.040 --> 52:11.800]  that were closely organized but there was no grand scheme with roger stone and alice jones
[52:11.800 --> 52:19.160]  and all these people to storm the capital and take hostages uh yeah exactly we'd add guns if
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.560]  that was our plan and that's not our plan my plan is not to commit suicide tomorrow and be the
[52:23.560 --> 52:32.760]  villain for the rest of the hit it's like this is insane that i would do that and it just goes on
[52:32.760 --> 52:40.280]  from there so the bigger question is it hey i'm right and hey i'm gonna sue abc and nbc and
[52:40.840 --> 52:44.760]  all these other people that lied about me and said i mean the wall street journal said jones
[52:44.760 --> 52:52.040]  was there leading the attack as a coward out of range of police tear gas saying attack attack attack
[52:52.040 --> 53:03.320]  attack and obviously i didn't do that that's not true why why would i have my whole career be about
[53:03.320 --> 53:10.280]  peace and then i would go and do this to us in a fiasco form but it isn't about me it's not about
[53:10.280 --> 53:15.640]  oh i'm proving right oh i'm vindicated the that doesn't matter because if i don't have a country
[53:15.640 --> 53:21.400]  or a planet who cares if i'm vindicated the bigger question is why is the fbi doing this
[53:26.120 --> 53:30.520]  well a lot of people that are on the tail of this like tucker carlson and other investigators
[53:35.160 --> 53:40.360]  believe that this is because the fbi does not want an investigation of the leadership of the
[53:40.360 --> 53:50.920]  militias just like michigan and because the head fbi guy there was so spiritually evil or dumb or
[53:50.920 --> 53:58.120]  whatever he was the lord works mysterious ways he leaked to the opposition to the to the to the
[53:58.120 --> 54:04.200]  defense team and that group wanted to kidnap the governor that they had set them up and
[54:04.200 --> 54:10.440]  provocateur it and gave his own internal recordings laughing how he was setting them up and then the
[54:10.440 --> 54:16.040]  fbi still covered that up for him then he beats his wife up because she wouldn't have sex with a
[54:16.040 --> 54:22.120]  bunch of dudes at a sex party i mean like beats are bloody and we're talking contusions cuts all over
[54:22.120 --> 54:28.280]  her face beat the living means like a big gem rat gorilla beats his wife up because she won't gang
[54:28.280 --> 54:34.600]  bang dudes or whatever and and i'm like look this is this is what's happening january 6 so because
[54:34.600 --> 54:41.720]  of this it's unraveling because by the way the whole michigan group they were involved by the way
[54:41.720 --> 54:48.120]  trying to set folks up on january 6 so the systems worried about all of that coming out and it's this
[54:48.120 --> 54:52.520]  particular subgroup of the fbi i wouldn't say the whole fbi is running operations you know like this
[54:52.520 --> 54:59.560]  that are just flagrantly like something out of the hallucinations of the love child of malsay tongue
[54:59.560 --> 55:07.480]  and anolf hitler so there's that but but i think it's bigger than that i think it's bigger than just
[55:11.080 --> 55:14.280]  the fbi not wanting an investigation of the provocateur groups
[55:14.280 --> 55:21.400]  no it's about this it's about the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism
[55:22.920 --> 55:29.720]  listing gun owners and veterans and uh people that question elections or lockdowns
[55:30.280 --> 55:36.360]  as terrorists and saying they're gonna have a war if the fbi had any self-preservation any common
[55:36.360 --> 55:46.520]  sense the fbi would not be led into a war with the american remnant i mean you think we couldn't
[55:46.520 --> 55:52.120]  win a war against the vietnamese or the afghans can you imagine the left isn't gonna fight this war
[55:52.120 --> 56:03.400]  they want fbi agents they want federal marshals they want atf they want bureaucrats do bureaucrats
[56:03.400 --> 56:13.800]  want soldiers men to go out and fight other men for their domination and the simple thought is if
[56:13.800 --> 56:20.520]  you're not under mind control is i don't want to fight with the fbi or the us military that wouldn't
[56:20.520 --> 56:25.480]  help america anyways and i'm an american i'd rather reach out and wake them up and they're like
[56:26.600 --> 56:31.400]  we see criminals running down america selling us out to china and now the left one says to go start
[56:31.400 --> 56:37.160]  a war with gun owners and veterans and declare them this maybe we should start saying no
[56:38.760 --> 56:44.200]  and that is what this is and bucking the democrats and saying they're issuing a final report that
[56:44.200 --> 56:50.280]  they've already got copies of saying no this was not premeditated and it wasn't the greatest
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.000]  attacks of pearl harbor 9 11 and we're not gonna walk up to the american people and
[56:55.000 --> 57:01.480]  then slap them across the face a couple more times and try to start a fight with them this is good
[57:02.680 --> 57:09.880]  this is healthy this is sanity and this is what we need to see a lot more of is not framing patriots
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.560]  not framing people that actually want to save the country but actually going after the weak
[57:15.560 --> 57:22.360]  pathetic evil political system with creatures like obama and hillary and sake running it
[57:22.360 --> 57:27.640]  who want to run us in the ground so it's a very positive thing doesn't mean i trust the fbi to
[57:27.640 --> 57:33.000]  its own bureaucracy doesn't mean you know america's out of the woods but the fact that they've had to
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.200]  come out and say here's the headline fbi shoots down dim conspiracy theory the january 6th capital
[57:38.200 --> 57:43.800]  riot was pre-planned that is a big blow to to biden and obama's narrative to start the american
[57:43.800 --> 57:47.480]  civil war and i'm all for stopping the civil war it'll get us all killed
[57:47.480 --> 57:54.760]  you say you want to fight tyranny you say you want to fund the second american revolution

[59:34.440 --> 59:38.120]  so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country he didn't want his name on it because
[59:38.120 --> 59:41.400]  obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the
[59:41.400 --> 59:46.200]  design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and
[59:46.200 --> 59:49.160]  you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your
[59:49.160 --> 1:00:05.880]  truck drivers we love you you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:23.800]  you know ladies and gentlemen i said this again yesterday i've got stacks of articles
[1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:28.120]  so much incredible news so many clips but i'd be a liar that i just keep repeating the same
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:33.240]  emergency we got hit by a bio weapon by our own establishment with the chinese
[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:39.000]  and it's already killing so many people and last year was fake it's in the inoculation
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:44.600]  and we just can't sit here and take this from these people and we can't have a civil war and
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.800]  kill each other we have to realize it's a tiny group of technocrats that are in control of this
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:55.800]  and either they go to prison either they get stopped or or or billions die and that's just
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:01:00.360]  an honest statement of course it's incendiary and it's incredibly dangerous and i i just said it i
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:07.240]  mean i i can't lie to you and i think anybody that makes a serious assessment of where we're at knows
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:16.680]  that well everybody said my god this guy sounds like alex jones 2.0 and turned out i didn't even
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:21.800]  know he's been on the war room twice i knew he looked familiar he's on at the bottom of the hour
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:31.800]  in 30 minutes math maker the alex jones with dreadlocks he uh he joined us bottom of the hour
[1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:37.720]  and that's the spirit because he's not up to threaten them he's saying you're assaulting us stop
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:45.240]  assaulting us and he is getting people fired up to take action if they don't stop and we really
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:48.520]  really don't want this to start because
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  world's a complex place and it's the globalists that are crazy enough to launch an extermination
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.880]  operation we're just trying to stop it and we understand we're already halfway into it but
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:05.800]  the quicker we reverse this the better and then we can bring those that did this to justice and
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:12.920]  here's the good news this is something really important i want to say the globalists would never
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:18.680]  launch something like this unless they had an effective treatment or cure so we've got great
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:23.240]  scientists we've got great sources and yeah we don't know the whole plan we've re-engineered
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:31.080]  reverse engineered most of it that's our job but there's got to be treatments or cures for
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:36.520]  what they've done to people so instead of talking about how we're gonna shoot the blue helmets and
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:40.360]  have a civil war which is what the globalists want they're gonna sit back while this country burns
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:47.560]  let's be christlike and try to figure out the big plan educate everybody and try to convince
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:52.280]  people in the system they're compartmentalized in the corporate system governmental you name it
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:56.120]  to be sane for their own families and their own futures and let's figure this out
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:01.880]  because as long as claus schwaab and bill gates and all them can sit back in a distance
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:05.800]  and do all this and watch us kill each other like we're morons they're gonna keep doing it
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:13.880]  but they've already had to withdraw a lot of their people and they're already in a lot of disarray
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.080]  and they're already getting a lot of heat from their own minions
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:26.280]  but that's why we're in so much danger they didn't launch this big attack on everybody because they
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:30.600]  were in a position of power they had this stuff on the shelf but they're cowards
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:38.200]  so they only did it once they were more afraid of us than what would happen if they got caught
[1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:43.720]  and i think now i don't think i know they know they made a mistake this is not going well for them
[1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:49.400]  as bad as it looks for you everybody out there and believe me it's rough i know it is i haven't
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:56.440]  told you the half of it these guys put on their confidence acts all day let me tell you something
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:03.000]  at 3 a.m these guys are crawling around the ground crying for money the devil's got a big old long
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:12.840]  black bull whip just like you get in there and you kill these humans or i'll destroy you you see
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:19.000]  what i just did to this person you see what i did to that person you get it in gear now sonny boy
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:28.760]  pedal the metal sonny boy you carry out my operations or i'll destroy you right now
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:39.800]  because these people do the things they've done to get cut off from god so they can get that satanic
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:42.440]  influence
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:50.760]  we're gonna come back from break and i'm gonna hit all the rest of the news
[1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:54.680]  got a big transmission lined up for you today
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:07.640]  the first time i heard the speech the first time i read the writings of teddy roosevelt
[1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:13.400]  i was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:17.880]  in the arena and i just remember thinking about that saying i want to be the man in the arena
[1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:23.160]  but when it comes to media info wars has been the tip of that spear but michael indell has come
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:29.080]  along and done just as good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes to election fraud
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:34.600]  and other issues and that's why if you go to my pillow dot com and use promo code alex you get
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:40.280]  up to 66 off on all the amazing products he's got so many not just pillows not just towels on the
[1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:45.240]  sheets and then you fund info wars and michael indell and the fight for free speech against
[1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:49.560]  the globalist there's not a better place to spend your money than my pillow dot com with promo code
[1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:55.080]  alex and if you do it it funds the info war it funds the election investigation and it stands up
[1:05:55.080 --> 1:06:06.040]  against these global's bullies my pillow dot com promo code alex take action now
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:06.760]  yes you can
[1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:11.320]  oh i can taste it
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:14.920]  i've certainly seen it
[1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:18.680]  i have faced it
[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:27.960]  oh lord i can oh we're very near it now
[1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:37.880]  because the whole galaxy is just a city
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:47.000]  and we're going to get off this planet together it's god's plan you belong in the city you belong
[1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:54.920]  and those that are trying to block the development of our species are already destined to fail
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:01.800]  they already signed on to the wrong spirit they already signed on the wrong energy
[1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:06.040]  they know they're cut off and that's why they're so angry all right he's coming up at the bottom
[1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:09.960]  of the hour talking about the resistance and i meant to do more of this because you know just
[1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:14.120]  in san diego where he was speaking there were six or seven clubs i saw amazing people only
[1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:19.880]  played a few and then it's in texas and michigan and just everywhere i mean we need to magnify the
[1:07:19.880 --> 1:07:23.640]  citizens that are going out and speaking up and saying no and having victories
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:29.400]  and we need to get others then to realize how important that role is and it's game over
[1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:32.840]  and i've got a big stack of news here that i need to hit that's on the whole force in
[1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:37.080]  oculation the rest of it will hit after this club you're only on show show today because
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:43.800]  human action and human resistance is key to this and it's already happening they make all these
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:48.040]  huge announcements to see if you'll do it then they got to back off because people aren't complying so
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:58.040]  this is a big moment and i haven't played in the club shed out of france and when i watch
[1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:06.760]  these videos i see the entire chain of events the dominoes the plan and it is very disgusting
[1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:12.040]  that's coming up next segment but right now he's joining us the bottom of the hour but here is matt

[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:22.360]  let's go ahead and look at some of these headlines
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:30.520]  video shows angry french shoppers being blocked from entering the supermarket because they don't
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:34.600]  have covid passports this is the future i'm going to air this clip and others next segment
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:43.320]  meanwhile report fox is asking employees to upload their vaccination results notice
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:48.600]  they're asking because their lawyers know this is lawsuit hell it's like a pedophile ask a kid to
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:56.200]  get in the back of the ice cream truck just say no flight attendant suggested mom glued
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:03.640]  daughter's face with superglue to her face after she refused to put it on oh your two-year-old won't

[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:17.800]  oh just glue it on its face or texas doctor's group retreats on policy not a law seeing vaccination
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:22.760]  status to be part of care decisions oh you're not going to get a surgery here you didn't take an
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:27.560]  experimental shot even if it was an authorized shot that's a nuremberg violator i mean this is just
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:35.880]  insane 64 year old heart patient removed from transplant list for refusing covid vaccine
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:41.320]  even the covid vaccine attacks your heart oh gee i've got a heart problem i don't want to take
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:45.160]  something they say if you have heart problems don't take but there's like we don't care what even the
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:54.520]  literature says it's all about giving up common sense submitting to these lies and it gets worse
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:13:00.360]  five month pregnant i face losing my job and health care for choosing not to get a covid injection
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:04.920]  even though it's not authorized for children or 12 to take they say oh well give it to pregnant women
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:11.240]  even though 82% 83% in the first trimester lose the baby when they take it it's all about human
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:18.040]  sacrifice all about what will you put up with british man in singapore given six weeks in prison
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:23.080]  for not wearing face mask a psychiatric assessment you're insane because you don't like a fraud
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:29.160]  even mainstream news though and slate reports of the noble lives of covid 19 and how they
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:35.880]  lied on purpose or i'm good of course their neighbors called done covid 19 of hoax can these
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:41.800]  icu nurses forgive them no the original covid 19 was fake numbers and fake bcr tests now your
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:47.240]  variants are being sloughed out of people on record because it's a live virus vaccine
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:55.000]  so we've got all of that another big article by jamie white bombshell study finds mRNA vaccine
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:01.560]  may cause tragic and even catastrophic side effects but those aren't side effects we're

[1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:54.120]  little bit better than i used to be because i'm alive i'm alive wire
[1:20:54.120 --> 1:21:03.560]  all right ladies and gentlemen we got incredible footage that is the gateway to the future we
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:10.360]  have footage in australia we have footage in the uk we have footage in france that's where
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:15.960]  we're going first of the un directed martial law slave training now i want to be clear about this
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:20.600]  footage because i've got a bunch of these clips and it's designed to enrage the french
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:27.800]  remember mccron a month ago said to go to the grocery store you're gonna have to have the injection
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:33.400]  you're gonna have to have the pass on your phone and first it was train stations and cafes you saw
[1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:39.240]  that footage so the fritz then try to go to the grocery store and the full footage they're throwing
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:43.960]  them out the exit they found people that are coming in one door they're throwing them out another
[1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:53.400]  and it's big giant nfl size black guy and black guys literally attacking white people now imagine
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:58.040]  the image of that but but think about it they say bring in tens of millions out of africa don't give
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:04.840]  them jobs then set them up as the enforcers against the french to make it racial the reason i raised
[1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:10.840]  that is take ten of square have it back in the late nineteen eight the first day it was pro democracy
[1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:17.160]  protesters they were peacefully weren't violent the local military was from that area they wouldn't
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:22.920]  attack them so from 800 miles away because the chinese you know like nine different dialects and
[1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:27.320]  they're all just as territorial as the north versus the south or the cribs versus the bloods
[1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:32.040]  they had to bring in a group of chinese from the north known that hate that area
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:37.720]  because the regular troops would not run over their own people but don't worry a day later
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:45.000]  they brought in 50 000 troops that were not that group of chinese so that's what globalism is
[1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:50.520]  is you bring in groups from outside that country who will then oppress people who they're not part
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:57.800]  of and then it only creates more divisions so let's go ahead and play these clips video shows
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:03.320]  angry french shoppers got the french police being blocked from entering supermarket because they
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:07.640]  don't have covid passports and then again later it'll be because you haven't followed all the other
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:12.040]  rules you're not politically correct and then we've got the footage of the black security guards again
[1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:17.080]  assaulting white people but just imagine if that was white security guards doing that to group of
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:23.720]  black people it's bad either way but this is the racial division system yeah go ahead and play with
[1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:37.560]  audio please your radio listener it's like a six foot five black guy pushing like a five foot woman
[1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:47.640]  around slapping or hitting or everything and in fairness there's some other africans saying don't
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:53.800]  do this so this is like insane but this is the this is the division they bring in a client group
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:24:04.040]  they can control to them be the outside enforcer and this goes on for hours there's hours of this
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:18.360]  footage it's a lot worse more people get involved the attack more people fights break out the guy
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:25.880]  showing him i've got my vaccine passport can i come in i mean this is like this is at a scale
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:31.480]  of like one to ten a scale of one of a trillion this is a trillion can't go in a grocery store unless
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:40.440]  you've taken an experimental shot and this is the french again and again i guess you guys
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:43.480]  found a different clip by sitting on twitter the one i have is like a minute and a half mash-up of
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:48.120]  like them beating people up and attacking a bunch of other people this is a different clip that i
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:52.760]  sent but uh here's another go ahead turn the audio up on this please
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:25:02.280]  this is the police keeping people out of the supermarket because they didn't take an experimental
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:24.920]  shot so again this this is real tyranny this on a scale of one to ten this is a ten and a half
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:29.400]  this is an 11 and it goes on against worse from here now let's go to just one of the clips from
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:33.000]  australia while we have time because i've got too many of these i went and looked this up
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:42.120]  and i found a local news article about it this is a father and daughter the five-year-old girl
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:49.240]  and her dad caught out on the street more than three miles past or three kilometers excuse me
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:55.160]  less than three miles from their house so the police take them to a covid facility and the
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:26:00.440]  dad is trying to get his little girl to let them stick the swab up her nose but she fights back so
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:06.920]  they deck him and knock him down and then grab her and then drag her off to a back room this isn't
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:13.960]  this isn't grand theft auto folks this isn't a video game this is the real world the dad is
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:19.000]  literally trying to get his daughter she's got good instincts she sees her dad grabbed out the
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.400]  street by police she knows her daddy's a good person taken to this facility they're the ones
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:27.400]  that cooked it up at will on all of it's all big bs no way to stop it it's out there everybody's
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:33.640]  gonna face it that's what these guys do they play on our fear they control the fear and then they
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:39.720]  start beating her because he wants video they're like dad did nothing he's trying to make her do it
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:46.520]  but he didn't submit enough so in case he resisted take him out and drag her off to god knows where
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:56.600]  if you'll do this you'll do anything here's the shocking footage radio listeners he's patting
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:27:02.440]  his daughter tell her everything's okay honey let her do it he's trying to get her to do it
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:11.080]  surrounded by these hyenas these demons these shotgun agents and now
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:17.720]  they just go ahead and beat him up just as this is an act of power she scrabbles she runs from
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:29.720]  the wolves of the hyenas now they hog time him and drag her into a back room to do god knows what
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:37.640]  to her and that's that's that's that's what this is you go to a grocery store you ain't coming in

[1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:28.760]  the
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:54.120]  we are back and i am very excited about having matt baker on i thought this guy looks familiar
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:59.640]  he's been on the warren before he's a long time info wars listener and he's organized rally speak
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:04.920]  to council meetings written songs and protesting businesses trying to infringe on human rights
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:10.280]  maths activism has just begun to gain more traction through viral videos and that's the real power of
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:16.120]  the people being at least the real power and so i started getting a few days ago clips like it's an
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:22.840]  alex jones with dreadlocks i'm like no this guy's this guy knows he's under assault and i noticed
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:26.520]  twitter only allows like two two minute clips so they had to cut off the first party talked about
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:31.720]  about our ancestors and our human destiny and we're all one human species and our will and
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:39.160]  feeling that strength and dialing into that it's it's just incredible though because
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:44.920]  if you if you really just give into it and submit to your human destiny then there's your
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:49.720]  fulfilled right there there's no more class warfare there's no more racism there's no more anything
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:53.640]  because we already have the destiny we already have the birthright so brother beautiful what you
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:58.200]  said i want to shut up the next 30 minutes and give you the floor to talk about san diego and
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:02.280]  what's happening and and what you said and tens of millions of views across the internet really
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:05.800]  resonating with people that righteous rage so good to have you here with us matt
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:13.720]  well it's uh fantastic to be on the show alex and you know i am a massive fan um and what people
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:19.320]  don't realize is i might not always be screaming and yelling but when i do it's for freedom well let
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:35.720]  me say i'm a massive fan of you brother so we're all team team humanity we've only begun to fight
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:45.320]  it's we the sequel baby we the sequel we're back what people don't realize is uh here in san diego
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:49.880]  i mean we get a lot of crap out here you know everyone tells us like we should flee the state
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:55.240]  and move to texas or whatever well we're on the front lines out here you know we're we're trying
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:36:00.280]  to stop the domino effect over here if anything we need more patriots to move here to give us some
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:07.400]  backup to stop the collapse which is going on which is actually pressuring all of us into becoming
[1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:12.920]  as some people say diamonds you know i'm just an artist i'm just a freedom loving guy i like
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:19.000]  to go out i like to have fun you know i have an art page i blow glass and ever since the insanity
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:25.080]  started i just uh i just started going off on this whole pandemic since day one i mean since
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:30.760]  you gotta ask yourself when they first started showing people dropping in china like where did
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:37.560]  that go i mean the whole thing is based it's like a hologram it's a fractional reserve lying
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:42.760]  it's fractional fractional reserve fraud they start a fraud with people falling over in the
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:47.400]  streets and i make everybody scared then people go oh my god what are we gonna do well we better
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:53.080]  start getting some tests out we get some tests then we get some cases then the cases are fake
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:58.280]  so on that then they build we need a vaccine so then they create something that isn't a vaccine
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:02.360]  they said don't worry about that we'll just change the definition in the dictionary to make
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:08.200]  a vaccine that isn't an mRNA gene therapy a vaccine so boom there's another fraud so people
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:12.280]  are falling fraud people are being tested with fake things that's fraud then they start the
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.680]  vaccine which is another fraud then they then they say oh well there's no other possible
[1:37:17.560 --> 1:37:23.000]  things that we can do for it there's no ivermectin there's no hdq we can't use anything else so
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:28.280]  therefore we must need uh emergency authorization when everyone's sitting there screaming and yelling
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:32.440]  going no actually we can they just said you're deleted you're deleted and you're deleted and
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:37.160]  you're deleted and so that's more fraud they stopped the whole pop i lost my youtube channel
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:41.800]  just because i said the word hydroxychloroquine exactly the premeditation to suppress us and
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:45.800]  kill us and block the treatments i mean this is a hundred percent criminal and planned
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:52.120]  yeah man and if you know we've tried being nice you know trying to wake people up
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:57.480]  i'm using art i'm sending out memes i'm going to these council meetings you know and i'm sitting
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:02.280]  down there i actually had a pre-written speech but the uh that was supposed to be given two weeks
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.720]  ago and that was but you called on your ancestors and they spoke didn't they they did actually that
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:12.600]  was a freestyle i freestyle that speech i really don't know where it came from i would i would actually
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:17.400]  think it was uh you know just it just came through me really uh people might think that's silly but
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:23.560]  it's not like it's not we all find that place we instantly win we've got to find that centered
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:28.600]  place to our ancestors to the president of the future generations that's the zen timelessness
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:33.960]  right there you talked about yeah i mean people think you know i was almost not going to speak
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:37.880]  because there was nine i showed up and i was hanging out outside there was this big like
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:41.480]  there was food trucks and stuff one of the there's another guy went viral forget his name
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:45.720]  uh a little while ago from san diego and he had set up these food trucks and everything there
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:49.800]  were so many people there and i was like i'm i'm just going to kick back outside here and
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:53.000]  then eventually one of the people that was inside there like i thought you were going to speak we
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.840]  really need you i'm like man we got 90 patriots here what am i going to say they're not going to say
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:01.640]  so uh they they actually stopped me at the front door they're like sorry there's nobody
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:07.080]  more allowed in here because there's too many people in the auditorium so i lied i just said
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:12.120]  well i'm going to go uh get a passport because it's in the same building and so um i i got past
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:15.960]  that guard and then i went up and i thought well they're not going to allow me to turn in my slip
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.880]  now because it's too late but i managed to get my slip in and i sat there all day and it was 90
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:27.080]  people speaking just running a train on this council one after another amazing speeches by
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:32.760]  everyone and props to every human being that showed up to that i mean there was some very very
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.000]  well put together speeches very more so you were charged up by the time you got to the podium
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:43.320]  oh my god and what was really charging me the whole time was the fact that this nation
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:49.320]  Nathan Fletcher scumbag that he's apparently part of the world economic forum he's like a
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:54.520]  plant from the world economic forum he has a he has a profile on their page and this guy is
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:40:00.360]  sitting there on his phone the whole time there's mothers up there crying like my child i can't speak
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:05.800]  his voice impediment and the nurses coming up like we're treating these vaccinated people
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.920]  and the guy is sitting there on his phone one of the patriots actually found out that he was live
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:16.440]  on twitter hating on everybody in the in the thing while we were there pouring our guts out
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:22.360]  and so every single point i had in my speech that i already had set up was was like over a
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:26.920]  grilled and grilled and grilled and grilled and by the time i got up there i'm just like these people
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:34.440]  and you know what i want to call them but for the children at home um these m efforts are gonna
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:39.880]  have to listen at some point and i just i just i did i called i called upon the ancestral flame
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:46.680]  and i just i just for some reason the whole idea of this wind wind blowing the sound of wind just
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:51.800]  blowing i i don't know when i was a kid i was a catholic school and i used to get in trouble for
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:55.640]  speaking out and there was a hallway they would put me in and maybe it was that wind or something i
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:01.960]  don't know i'm gonna start crying but but i just thought about that and and then i just went with
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:07.480]  it and the whole thing just flowed downhill and and and apparently people liked it and listened
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:12.360]  no but i think you're right the use the japanese term kamikaze wasn't just the airplanes and they
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:18.040]  were desperate flying into aircraft carriers or battleships it's the divine wind is the kamikaze
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:23.720]  and it is our breath they're trying to suppress our breath it's like it's a continued god created
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.040]  the earth with his breath it's very archetypal what you said that came out of you it's true
[1:41:28.040 --> 1:41:32.360]  we need the breath of truth to blow down their lives our breath of humanity to say no to what
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:40.600]  they're doing yeah they they are building this insane like hologram of lies in front of us
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:45.880]  and they managed to build their next hologram off the last holograms through some weird satanic
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:49.880]  magic that they do even though we've defeated the last hologram they're building the new
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:55.480]  hologram on top of the old one so we're like in like almost like neo like feeding these holograms
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:59.640]  and we're knocking each one down oh what you said is totally it exactly we keep defeating
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:05.080]  them but they keep creating new ones as fast as we go yeah it's insanity and at a certain point
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:09.160]  you know uh you know i'm glad there's a first amendment and that's what they don't realize
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:14.600]  what they're doing by suppressing us online is it's like we could have had these conversations we
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  could have expressed ourselves and now they're like well this guy's getting all worked up well
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:24.840]  i'm sorry you're taking away all our freedoms so and you're coming at us with a deadly poison
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:31.720]  which they admit doesn't even work yeah which is which is mega horrific but really for me the
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:37.720]  absolute line is these vaccine passports that is full on the mark of the beast and once they get
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:43.480]  that thing enacted they're never going to relinquish it like i said he's on rumble at slave to the
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:48.280]  number two liberty slave liberty on instagram matt baker will come right back to him on the other
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:55.480]  side of malls jones info wars dot com tomorrow's news today then we got that amazing new york doctor
[1:42:55.480 --> 1:43:02.200]  that first exposed all this he's joining us it is through our five senses that we are kept
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:07.880]  fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through this illusion
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:14.840]  is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:20.040]  forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:24.920]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras align with the
[1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:30.600]  endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described
[1:43:30.600 --> 1:43:36.280]  as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:42.680]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping our
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:49.160]  pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:55.880]  water fluoride free and the propure showerhead will seal the deal get them both today for yourself
[1:43:55.880 --> 1:44:03.960]  or a friend at infowarstore.com the world is awakening the world is beginning to understand
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:10.200]  the globalist paradigm they are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the cfr the
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:17.800]  trilateral commission the builderberg group the bohemian grove the club of rome and so even though
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:23.560]  it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:30.200]  human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open so as bad as
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:35.640]  these times are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning you've got
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:43.560]  to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice that is invincible that is ethereal
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:49.320]  timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in god till he got a director's soul
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:53.720]  and then take action against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment from alex jones
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:59.000]  and my crew to you we will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:06.040]  let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:11.400]  set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of congress and
[1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:16.840]  former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:23.880]  that grows blood clots and and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:30.280]  think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:37.000]  if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:42.120]  it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work so you got to take it every few months
[1:45:42.120 --> 1:45:46.920]  and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time so i can go outside
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.240]  and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick from covid and now there's record numbers
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:56.040]  of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:46:02.120]  studies bill gates and foulsy did this need to go to prison for it right now the first time i heard
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:10.280]  the speech the first time i read the writings of teddy roosevelt i was in sixth grade and we had this
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:15.880]  history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena and i just remember thinking
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:20.680]  about that saying i want to be the man in the arena but when it comes to media info wars has
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:26.120]  been the tip of that spear but mike lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:31.160]  done maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues and that's why if you go

[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:57.960]  people and the rest of the tyrants out there we have been talking to you we've been telling you
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:03.560]  we've been screaming at you we've been yelling at you we've been pleading at you we are on the very
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:10.760]  edge of the end of the first amendment you go any further than this this is the line in the
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:20.840]  frickin sand you need to stop what you're doing now before it's too late your whole world is going
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:25.480]  to be destroyed what do you think it's going to be like from here on out when you have to go to the
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:30.440]  store and you have a vaccine passport every five seconds you're being checked that doesn't seem a
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:37.640]  little bit Nazi to you do you really want to live in that world wake up your children are at stake
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:43.160]  we're at stake if you want to take your damn vaccine take it there's a thing in this world
[1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:51.880]  it's called freedom we have the freedom to choose what goes in our bodies and you are not going to
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:50:01.960]  force us to do it do you understand back me up here alex no i'm listening to you brother i want to
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:06.280]  give you the floor because you're a great speaker and you're absolutely right look look the guys at
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:10.760]  the top know it's about the population they know it's about to take over we rebelled against them
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:14.600]  we didn't buy their new order so they started killing us that's what this is and it's hard for
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:18.040]  you and i to admit that to ourselves i don't want to admit that but that's where we're at right now
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:22.280]  i mean the majority of hospitalized have had the shot the majority spreading all these viruses have
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:27.960]  the shot it was a hoax before now the vaccine is causing the shedding we know they did it so i just
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:32.120]  think it's important to understand we're in a war we didn't ask for it but crazy tyrants try it again
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:37.400]  i'm gonna ask all the nurses out there now some people are talking
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:42.360]  bad about you guys because now you're like oh we don't want to get forced to get the vaccine
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:50.120]  personally i embrace you i embrace the police i embrace the tyrants join team humanity i will
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:55.240]  not hold it against you maybe you're fooled under mind control maybe you thought you were on the
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:00.200]  winning side and you just wanted to be on the winning team you're not on the winning team there
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:06.600]  is no win the path you're going down it's only satanic hell and death for humanity you must
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:12.760]  join us on team humanity or there will be no future to the nurses out there if you want to
[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:20.680]  put an end to this we need some serious whistleblowing going on i want data i want to see how many
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:28.280]  people that are in the hospitals are vaccinated me personally i know groups of three probably
[1:51:28.280 --> 1:51:34.120]  ten different groups of three people that were we're fully vaccinated we went out the other night
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:41.320]  we all got covid we're fully vaccinated our whole our whole band got vaccinated we got covid our whole
[1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:46.120]  restaurant got vaccinated and we got covid it's happening over and over and over again these people
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:51.880]  are the governor of texas got it they admit 95 percent of people in the hospital in israel took
[1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:58.040]  the shot yeah and then they come on tv and then they say it's 99.9 percent effective like just the
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:03.240]  other day you know the stats 74 percent of people what say was that was a michigan or wherever it
[1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:11.720]  wasn't forget 74 percent of the people that were got covid had the vaccine double-vaxxed 74 percent
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:17.160]  that's three quarters of the population then they say oh but they don't get as sick well let's look
[1:52:17.160 --> 1:52:23.480]  at that that same study then said four out of five of the people that went to the went to the hospital
[1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:28.440]  were double-vaxxed so that's four fifths as opposed to three they're lying they're they're totally
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:33.640]  they're totally lying they're totally lying so and then and then at the end of that article
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:37.960]  they said well what are we going to do about it well obviously we need to get more people vaccinated
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:43.800]  this this is they're really kicking into the into the doublespeak uh at level of this i'm seeing
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:49.880]  more and more articles where it's like uh it goes flash flooding as the drought continues like for
[1:52:49.880 --> 1:52:54.680]  real i'm seeing this every day where they'll say like you know uh they'll say the absolute opposite
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:58.920]  thing from beginning to the end of the sentence flash flooding as the drought continues it's
[1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:03.720]  like it they're they're they're just trying to drive us crazy and you know what it's working
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:10.360]  no i agree they know their system's insane it's run by behavioral psychologists who are
[1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:15.800]  more insane than anybody and you're right though this is being done by design but i i don't think
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:21.320]  their program is going well and i think what you did going to city council what others are doing
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:26.200]  whether it's on local tv or a local radio shows doing a live show go there and say something
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:34.120]  calling to talk ready all of us being heard will overwhelm the system you're gonna find your best

[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:41.000]  I mean, I think the answer is every venue we've got, the public power America has, we
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.680]  let the politicians say, you know, you're not going to put up with this and we take
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:46.080]  back control of our government.
[2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:48.680]  We do recalls like we're seeing with Governor Newsom.
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:51.560]  All right, real quick.
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:58.880]  Last night, I said one comment to Steven old get old, but the old Bert report, whatever
[2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:05.520]  his name is, and I call him some name and my, my Instagram account was deleted instantly.
[2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.720]  So you need to now follow me.
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:09.560]  I just decided to go with it.
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:14.160]  Matt Baker unhinged, it's Matt Baker underscore under unhinged.
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:17.160]  I just said, I'll own it.
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:20.000]  But yes, slave to Liberty is my brand.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.440]  And these are the shirts that I've been putting out everywhere.
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:27.080]  What I call on everybody to do is just see how fun it is and just how amazing it is.
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:31.520]  And we are actually, we're been inoculated against tyranny right now.
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:32.520]  And what's happening.
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:36.760]  I want the new world order to know this too is what you've done is you've introduced this
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:41.960]  this tyranny into the bloodstream of the planet and the killer teas and all the lymphocytes
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:45.480]  and we're all starting to gather together and we're starting to analyze the enemy.
[2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:49.960]  We're like enemy, enemy, and we're spreading around and we're starting to gather.
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:52.320]  Together and we're building networks.
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:53.320]  Okay.
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:57.960]  And we're really aware of who's who now and we're just getting stronger and stronger
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:01:58.960]  by the second.
[2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:02.040]  And when you unite with us, we could care less.
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:04.600]  In fact, we love you even more if you're black.
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:06.200]  We love you even more if you're a woman.
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:07.200]  If you're gay, you're straight.
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:09.200]  We have people of every stripe.
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:12.640]  People love me because I'm dreads are like, whoa, right, when guy that gets it and he's
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:14.880]  got dreads, they just embrace you.
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:16.920]  All they want to know is that you love freedom.
[2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:18.240]  You love humanity.
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:19.600]  We're all on the same team.
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:20.600]  That's key.
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:24.920]  What you said, how do we get people that serve the power structure realize we forgive you
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:25.920]  for being conned?
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:26.920]  We're not perfect either.
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:28.120]  Just stop now.
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  Join humanity.
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:35.360]  Well, I, I called in actually a long time ago and it was right before Jeffrey Epstein
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:39.720]  didn't kill himself funnily enough and I, and I said to you guys, there's so much corruption.
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:43.800]  We have to give some form of amnesty to these people.
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:47.640]  There's going to have to be somewhere where you guys can come forward and we're going
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:48.640]  to say, look.
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:53.440]  You come to team humanity and you give us your, you know, you give us your resignation
[2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:56.720]  to the new world order, basically, and you say, look, here's what we've been doing.
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:02:58.800]  Here's who we're working with and here's our network.
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:00.720]  We're going to absolutely embrace you.
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:02.960]  We're going to, we'll fricking build statues to you.
[2:03:02.960 --> 2:03:03.960]  We love you.
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:06.520]  Please join humanity now before it's too late.
[2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:08.280]  You have no future in this.
[2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:10.840]  Your money is going to be absolutely worthless.
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:13.440]  Your houses, you think you're going to keep these buildings?
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.200]  Like I said to the people, the four feet of marble, they're in there elevated, they think
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:19.920]  you're somehow separated from the fate of humanity.
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:23.760]  You are not separate from humanity.
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:25.880]  We are all in the same fricking boat here.
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:26.880]  Pay help.
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:32.640]  Now wake up and join this team and let's save the modicum of self-respect we have as humans
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:35.520]  on this planet before it's too late.
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:36.520]  Absolutely.
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:40.160]  The globalist is a post-industrial anti-human world.
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:42.720]  They're going to overwrite the entire genetic code of the planet.
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:44.360]  They're actually destroying the planet.
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:48.760]  There's no reason to join this except cowardice.
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:50.920]  And greed.
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:54.480]  People think they're getting up, they're getting money, they think they're getting ahead.
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:58.760]  And there's a certain evil, I guess, in certain men's hearts where they just want to be, they
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:03:59.920]  just want to do bad.
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:04.000]  Like you said, Alex, and I got to tell people when they get this vaccine passport in, if
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:09.280]  they do over my dead body and like they say, you know, pull this from my cold dead hands,
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:16.080]  where you can put your vaccine in my cold dead arm, how's that, okay?
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:20.480]  So when they get this supposed, which I actually have enacted in other places, and once they
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:25.720]  get that, I'm just telling you, these people are sick, sick people, okay?
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:28.760]  They're doing this as a form of sexual fetish bondage.
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:29.760]  I totally agree.
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:30.760]  It's all about dominance.
[2:04:30.760 --> 2:04:31.920]  It's about spiritual rape.
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:33.320]  It's about genetic rape.
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:35.360]  It's about hating God.
[2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:36.520]  And to the children.
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:40.920]  And once they get everybody doing that, it's like porn, they're going to get bored of it.
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:42.760]  They're going to want something more.
[2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:43.760]  They're going to need kicks.
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:47.520]  They'll have you crawling to get into a store by the end of the season.
[2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:51.080]  And when they get you done crawling, they're like, well, you have to cut off your balls.
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:52.600]  Well, you have to give us your first.
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:53.600]  Exactly.
[2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:54.600]  Matt Becker, join us again.
[2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:55.600]  We love you.

[2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:06.520]  You say you want to fund the second American Revolution.
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:07.520]  I know you do.
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:08.520]  That's why you're here.

[2:05:58.920 --> 2:06:18.280]  So thank you so much for your support.
[2:06:18.280 --> 2:06:31.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, well, historically, we
[2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:36.800]  know it's true, evil builds its power secretly and then makes its move each time for the
[2:06:36.800 --> 2:06:40.200]  new operation.
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:46.040]  And we're witnessing right now, Dr. Vladimir, Zev Zalinko was the first medical doctor I
[2:06:46.040 --> 2:06:54.080]  saw saying hydroxychloroquine, zinc, ivermectin, vitamin D, 18, 19 months ago, at the very
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:59.120]  beginning he treated thousands and thousands of people in New York and I've just seen him
[2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  do an amazing job.
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:03.360]  We've played many clips of him here, but like I know him, we've got him for the rest
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:06.240]  of the hour, I'm going to try to shut up and let him talk because he's on these other great
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:09.960]  medical shows, but like five or six other doctors, I want to give him a chance, he's
[2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:14.480]  on Fox for five minutes, he's on something else, I want to give him, in the 45 minutes
[2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:18.680]  we'll have of air time in this hour, a lot of time here, but he's a doctor who recommended
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:23.480]  that President Trump take hydroxychloroquine, his protocol results in 99% for survival of
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:28.680]  high risk COVID patients, Dr. Zalinko has nominated for the presidential medical freedom
[2:07:28.680 --> 2:07:32.320]  and for the Nobel Prize, he's recognized as a hero of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:38.480]  Committee hearing, he's published in top peer-reviewed journals with world-renowned
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:43.280]  physicians, Dr. Zalinko provided counsel at the White House, personal, multiple governments,
[2:07:43.280 --> 2:07:48.480]  hospitals, physicians and public figures, so he's a real trailblazer and we've got his
[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:56.960]  website on screen for you, ZStackLife.com, ZStackLife.com or just search his name, Dr.
[2:07:56.960 --> 2:08:02.960]  Vladimir Zalinko. Sir, thank you so much for joining us, wow, what a time historically
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:08.200]  to be alive, you can do big picture, 35,000 view or the microscope view, wherever you
[2:08:08.200 --> 2:08:13.360]  want to start, please with your research, your background, you talk about these deadly killer
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:16.760]  shots, what we're facing, we really appreciate you, Dr.
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:22.480]  Thanks, Alex, thanks so much for having me. I'm a family physician, board certified and
[2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:28.960]  the last 20 years I've taken care of a community in upstate New York and Monroe, New York and
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:34.120]  in March of last year, but the community is 35,000 people that live within the square
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:40.880]  mile and last March, the first week of March, COVID arrived and spread to almost everyone
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:44.960]  and we had thousands of sick patients and if you remember at that time, there was no
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:50.040]  treatment available, all we were telling patients is go home, take Tylenol, if you get sick or
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:55.840]  go to the hospital, you'll end up on a respirator and in Manhattan, 80 to 90% of the patients
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:00.280]  on the respirators were dying, but that was the treatment model that we had, it wasn't
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:06.160]  very satisfying, these patients were family to me and they were looking at me asking me
[2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:10.360]  for help and I had nothing to offer them, it's a terrible feeling, I hope no one has
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:16.120]  to feel that way ever again and so what I've learned throughout my life is that if there's
[2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:22.000]  no answer, you have to find an answer and so I started innovating and I just used common
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.360]  sense, it's pretty pathetic that in this world, common sense is considered genius, but here's
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:33.880]  the common sense ideas that I decided to apply, that the sooner you treat someone, the better
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:42.800]  the outcome, that's just life and then I needed to know who are the patients at risk, so I
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:47.960]  called up my colleagues and my friends at the local hospitals and we're going to ICU
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:52.600]  and I asked them who's dying, they told me all the elderly people and those with medical
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:57.200]  problems and I said what about the younger people, they said we're not seeing them, so
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:01.920]  I realized that this virus doesn't kill people equally, it picks on the vulnerable, that
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:06.160]  was important information because my office instead of saying 50 patients a day, which
[2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:12.360]  was the average and we were saying 250, half my staff was sick, the outpatient resources
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:18.080]  like radiology and blood work were shut down, the hospitals were near capacity, so we didn't
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:23.640]  have enough resources to take care of everyone, so I triaged, I sent home the low-risk patients
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:27.840]  and devoted my limited resources to the high-risk patients and what did I do?
[2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:32.000]  So I looked around what other countries I've been doing in treating COVID, I looked at
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.880]  South Korea and I looked at France and I put together their protocols and modified the
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:42.880]  dosing and I started using it in my patients and here's the key, when they presented to
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:47.680]  my office, I did not wait for the results of the flawed PCR test because it would take
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:51.520]  a week to get back the results, by the time I got the results they were half dead, didn't
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:56.080]  make sense to me, so if I thought the patient had COVID, I used my clinical judgment, I
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:01.680]  would do the testing also, but I would not delay treatment and what I noticed was that
[2:11:01.680 --> 2:11:07.840]  within 12 to 24 hours of giving patients this three-drug approach, they all started getting
[2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:13.000]  better, I didn't believe it myself, but I kept on doing it and I realized that after
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:17.560]  around 50 patients that this is not a fluke, this is not a mistake, that God had given
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:27.040]  me some brilliant gift that really saved people's lives and I realized what this could mean,
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:31.480]  so I made a video, a YouTube video with the help of my son, because I didn't know how
[2:11:31.480 --> 2:11:37.000]  to make videos, and it was addressed to the President of the United States and 16 hours
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:44.440]  later I get a phone call myself from Mark Meadows, the President's Chief of Staff and
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:50.280]  he said, Dr. Slanko, you're looking for the President and I said yes, I explained to him
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:55.400]  what I was seeing, they were very interested and I had his contact information now, Mark
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:12:01.480]  Meadows, I mean cell and email, and every other day or so I would give them updates,
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:07.720]  then Stephen Hahn, Dr. Hahn was the Commissioner of the FDA, he called me on my cell phone,
[2:12:07.720 --> 2:12:12.080]  he wouldn't, he wanted to know what I was doing and I told him and then he connected
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:17.120]  me with the head people at the NIH and I started speaking to them and that was a dead end,
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:21.200]  because first of all they weren't interested, second they didn't even know what to do with
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:26.600]  real world evidence, see I wasn't doing research, I was just trying to keep my patients alive,
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:32.280]  but by doing so I generated very important information that I was hoping that people
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:37.160]  with resources would look into, but that didn't go anywhere, but what really changed
[2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:43.320]  things was Rudy Giuliani called me and we did a podcast together and that went completely
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:48.800]  viral, millions of people saw it and since then my life has never really been the same.
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:52.760]  Well it really is amazing that you did the first original research of anybody I saw on
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:57.920]  this doctor and wow, if this information hadn't got out and that's a whole other subject,
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:01.920]  I want to talk about currently what the disease is morphed into and what's happened, but what
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:06.840]  about big tech, what about big pharma, actively trying to suppress you and so many other
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:11.320]  prominent scientists and doctors, to me this is a crime against humanity, I don't use those
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:16.280]  words lightly, I mean this has really been a premeditated attempted suppression of what
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:19.840]  you and other real doctors found on the ground.
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:26.680]  You know I'm an ascetic Jew and my family lost 40 or so relatives in the Holocaust buried
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:35.560]  alive in Babiyar outside of Kiev, so I won't use the word genocide loosely, this is a genocide
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:41.600]  against the innocent and the vulnerable, this is a carefully coordinated, brilliantly orchestrated
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:51.880]  and executed, evil plan to damage and hurt billions of people and it took me 18 months
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:56.520]  to reverse engineer this crime, but it is a crime against humanity, I really agree with
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:00.800]  you and actually I was the first in the world to actually call it that in the third week
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:03.640]  of March when I did an interview.
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:09.280]  I know you did doctor and you're absolutely right and it shocks me to see this attempted
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:14.280]  takeover and extermination of humanity, so when we come back I want to give you the floor
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:18.120]  to get into currently what's happening, how people you think should be treating it from
[2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:22.800]  your own research or how we counter this genocide, we got a minute and a half to break, what
[2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:27.440]  else do you want to cover sir, I'm going to give you unfettered the floor when you come
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:28.440]  back.
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:33.840]  Well I'm going to leave your audience with very practical information that should empower
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:38.800]  them to be able to protect themselves and their families, you know there are two risk
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:45.800]  factors to die from COVID, it's the doctor you choose and the government you live under
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.760]  because the government's tyranny is making it difficult to gain access to life saving
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:56.200]  medication and physician malfeasance and malpractice is delaying crucial treatment in
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:01.880]  the right time frame and that's why people are dying, so the key here I'm going to, there
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:09.400]  are over the counter options that people could buy and use for prophylaxis and for treatment
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:16.000]  that can reduce hospitalization and death by more than 80%, my data showed a reduction
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:23.720]  in hospitalization by 84%, hospitalization and death by 84%, subsequently dozens of studies
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:29.640]  around the world peer-reviewed studies corroborated the same observation, so what that means is
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:36.000]  out of 600,000 dead Americans we could have prevented 510,000 from even going to the hospital.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:43.480]  Incredible doctor, Vladimir Zenzalinko, Zenzalinko stay right there ZStackLive.com, absolute
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:47.160]  trailblazer I'm so honored to have him on, I don't care about Hollywood, I don't care
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:51.080]  about movies, I don't care about power but I care about real people, so I got chills
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:55.440]  having this guy on, without him we'd be in a lot worse shape right now, stay with us
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:15:59.480]  and tell folks how to tune in right now.
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:03.320]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:08.960]  electricity this will be the most important message you'll hear this year, here's why,
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:14.360]  we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock, these emergency backup systems
[2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:19.640]  provide life-saving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas generators solar
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:25.240]  generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:30.520]  electricity from the sun, whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just
[2:16:30.520 --> 2:16:35.780]  getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:16:35.780 --> 2:16:41.080]  Even better all this week radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses

[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:04.040]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:07.880]  I've got great news, in fact I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:13.280]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:18.920]  soup beans, these beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious and above all with no hesitation
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:22.520]  whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:27.960]  The best part, we've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:33.000]  food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to,
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  gets even better.
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:38.720]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:43.960]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  world, period.
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:51.400]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the real reason we're giving
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:57.600]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:04.600]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist,
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:09.080]  the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important but
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:12.960]  the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:17.720]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[2:18:17.720 --> 2:18:22.160]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:23.920]  system metabolism of a human.
[2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:27.200]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours but people take this,
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:30.680]  people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:36.800]  not high, nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:40.360]  can call us whatever you want, it's a total solution, all around the best you're going
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:41.360]  to find.
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:46.000]  Turboforce, without you we don't roll, with you we search forward together, it's like
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.680]  a bulldozer without the diesel fuel, if we don't have your financial support we will
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:52.760]  be defeated, you support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:19:00.800]  mind, it's a win-win, 360 together, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:03.960]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:04.960]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:10.440]  I would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:13.600]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:20.320]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:19:20.320 --> 2:19:25.560]  Living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:27.560]  me, living defense brought me back.
[2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:33.320]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now, this
[2:19:33.320 --> 2:19:40.760]  is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:47.040]  and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be offended
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:50.480]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:52.160]  That's right where we're at brother.
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:56.600]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:03.280]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:17.680]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:22.000]  And we are back live here on the Alex Jones show on this Friday edition with Dr. Vladimir
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:30.840]  Zev Zelinko, the original trailblazing doctor, it's true, who first exposed all this back
[2:20:30.840 --> 2:20:35.640]  in, I guess, February or he direct me of 2020.
[2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:40.000]  And so he was the first doctor we heard all this from now it's all well known, but still
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:41.600]  big tech tries to suppress it.
[2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:46.640]  He was he was getting into the fact that this is basically a depopulation operation.
[2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:52.240]  So he's got the floor now to continue with the history of it or how to counter it now.
[2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:55.920]  I mean, I know before it targeted the old people that were sick.
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:01.880]  Now I'm seeing the Delta variant ravage my family, so many others and see a lot of evidence
[2:21:01.880 --> 2:21:05.920]  from other scientists that it is mutating from the so called vaccine, which is a live
[2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:08.080]  virus vaccine, but he's the medical doctor.
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:11.480]  So doctor, please continue.
[2:21:11.480 --> 2:21:12.840]  Thanks again for having me.
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:15.040]  So actually it was in March.
[2:21:15.040 --> 2:21:20.920]  That's when I started, but I sent a letter to the president of the United States documenting
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:21.920]  my experience.
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:24.160]  This is March of 2020.
[2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:29.600]  And I sent the letter last week in March.
[2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:33.880]  And when the president made an announcement that he's taking hydroxychloroquine, he referenced
[2:21:33.880 --> 2:21:38.080]  my letter as the reason why he was doing it, that he got a letter from an upstairs doctor
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:40.240]  telling him about his experiences.
[2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:46.080]  So I had that began my relationship with the with the Trump administration.
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:51.200]  And what happened was when after the president came out in support of hydroxychloroquine,
[2:21:51.200 --> 2:21:58.240]  he began to be vilified viciously, and any doctor who was using it was was was persecuted.
[2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:01.000]  They were brought up before medical boards, they were losing their jobs.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:03.280]  It didn't make any sense.
[2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:08.440]  And when the president announced that he wants hydroxychloroquine made available to every
[2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:16.080]  single American, he tasked Secretary Azar with that job from Health and Human Services.
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:22.000]  Secretary Azar gave it to Larry Kodlow, who's the head counsel for them, and Larry Kodlow
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:25.760]  called Dr. Rick Bright from BARDA.
[2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:30.760]  Now what I'm about to tell you is the mechanics of genocide.
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:37.160]  And the basis of what I'm about to tell you is Dr. Rick Bright's own words in a documentary
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:40.240]  called Totally Under Control.
[2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:45.680]  And what he describes as the following, when he got the president's order to make hydroxychloroquine
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:50.880]  available to every American, he says he felt that that was a terrible idea, and him and
[2:22:50.880 --> 2:22:53.120]  his team were against it.
[2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:58.600]  So they crafted, together with Janet Woodcock, who's now currently the acting head of the
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:05.800]  FDA, a strategy to limit access to hydroxychloroquine.
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:06.800]  And how did they do that?
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:12.440]  Well, first, they were supposed to use the right to try legislation, which enabled every
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:18.160]  single American to have access to certain drugs outside of clinical trials.
[2:23:18.160 --> 2:23:22.040]  They were supposed to use that pathway to make hydroxychloroquine available to every
[2:23:22.040 --> 2:23:27.000]  single American, to open the national stockpile of medication to every single American.
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:32.600]  Instead, what they did was they crafted an emergency use authorization that opened the
[2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:38.120]  national stockpile of medication to only hospitalized patients.
[2:23:38.120 --> 2:23:44.840]  What that did effectively, and it sent a message to every single doctor in America, an employer,
[2:23:44.840 --> 2:23:50.920]  that the government is only in support of hydroxychloroquine usage in the hospital setting.
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:57.720]  And certain employers set policies that if a doctor uses hydroxychloroquine in the outpatient
[2:23:57.720 --> 2:23:59.600]  setting, they would lose their job.
[2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:03.640]  So effectively, what that emergency use authorization did, what you said about that, it's like telling
[2:24:03.640 --> 2:24:09.560]  a fire department you can't use, you can't use fire hybrids and water to put out fires.
[2:24:09.560 --> 2:24:10.880]  Correct.
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:18.560]  And so the data shows that the early use, pre-hospital use of hydroxychloroquine together
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:24.520]  with zinc and azithromycin reduced hospitalization and death by 84%.
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:32.640]  That means 84% of Americans who ended up in the hospital could have been saved.
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:35.520]  We're talking about over a half a million people.
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:40.160]  In America alone, and everyone knows what the FDA does, the rest of the world follows.
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:45.720]  We could have, by the way, I treated President Bolsonaro also, but that digression, but
[2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:50.320]  everyone knows that whatever the American FDA does, everyone else follows.
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:56.600]  We could have ended this thing globally, except for people like Rick Bright and whoever the
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:00.280]  stakeholders are that he serves, it definitely doesn't serve the American people.
[2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:02.760]  That's for sure.
[2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:04.280]  You're right, doctor, it's very clear.
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:08.600]  They want a corporate response, only their so-called vaccines, because they can't get
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:09.600]  correct.
[2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:13.400]  They can't get emergency use of these gene therapies they call vaccines if there's stuff
[2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:14.720]  out there that has any efficacy.
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:15.720]  Is that correct?
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:17.720]  That is correct.
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:23.640]  I got my hands on internal FDA documents which showed the following criteria, who can get
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:26.200]  an emergency use authorization.
[2:25:26.200 --> 2:25:32.360]  The answer is only if there is no other option available, if there's no other therapeutic,
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:37.800]  then a drug that may be given emergency use authorization, it shows potential promise.
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:42.160]  Otherwise, it has to go through the 10-year process and millions of dollars to get the
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:44.560]  drug through different trials.
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:51.400]  What happened was that the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine obstructed other drugs
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:54.240]  from getting it.
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:59.640]  There was a study that came out by Lancet, the most respected peer-reviewed journal
[2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:06.600]  in medicine, that concluded it was a 96,000 patient meta-analysis that hydroxychloroquine
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:09.480]  kills people.
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:17.200]  What happened was the WHO took that information and you made a global moratorium against the
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:19.240]  use of hydroxychloroquine.
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:22.320]  The only problem with that study was it was fraud.
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:23.720]  That data didn't exist.
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:25.600]  Those patients didn't exist.
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:32.040]  And Lancet had to retract that study, which is the biggest scandal in the history of medicine.
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:33.760]  Why am I telling you this?
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:39.880]  Because when the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine in
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:45.800]  the document that explains why they did it, they quote this fraudulent study from Lancet
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:51.120]  after it's been already retracted as much value as toilet paper, our government, our
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:27:02.360]  wonderful FDA, still used a fraudulent document to destroy access to hydroxychloroquine.
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:06.280]  These are actions of a government that does not want you to live.
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:07.280]  Absolutely.
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:09.920]  I saw that last year when you were covering it.
[2:27:09.920 --> 2:27:11.920]  It's incredible that they would do this.
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:17.040]  So what do you think, Dr., the end game is here?
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:22.600]  So let's look at the facts and reverse engineer.
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:26.920]  Access to life-saving medication is being suppressed.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:30.600]  Information about life-saving medication is being suppressed.
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:36.480]  Any doctor who dares say something that is against the narrative of the government, it
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:42.400]  could be the world leader in mRNA vaccine technology, Dr. Robert Malone, if he says
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:47.360]  something that is not consistent with the narrative, he gets deplatformed.
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:50.680]  So information and voices are being suppressed.
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:57.240]  I personally have been thrown off of Twitter, Facebook puts me in jail all the time, LinkedIn
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:02.960]  threw me off, YouTube takes the down on my videos.
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:05.280]  So it's horrific.
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:09.160]  Now we're going to get to the vaccine in a minute, but I want to explain to your listeners
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:10.160]  the following.
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:14.640]  There are four important components to any pandemic response.
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:22.560]  The first is spread prevention, then it's pre-hospital care, then it's hospital care,
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.000]  and then there's safe and effective use of vaccines.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:27.960]  I'm not against vaccines.
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:31.400]  I have vaccinated tens of thousands of patients a month ago.
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:32.400]  Dr., don't want to cut you off.
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:33.400]  We got a satellite break.
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:34.400]  We're going to come back.
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:37.120]  You'll have the floor to start over with those four points.
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:38.120]  Amazing.
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:39.120]  Yes, sir.
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:44.080]  Dr. Vladimir, Zev Zalinko, ZStackLife.com, they're censoring him, they're blogging him,
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:49.120]  he's a great doctor, serves over 30,000 great people in New York, and has been proven to
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:50.120]  be right.
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:53.680]  And he and others like him are the answer coming out of this great evil.
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:57.320]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break, please stay with us till folks
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:28:59.560]  tune in.
[2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:03.360]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:08.080]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:09.080]  Here's why.
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:13.080]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:18.080]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:23.240]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[2:29:23.240 --> 2:29:27.160]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:31.080]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:35.840]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:41.120]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:42.120]  too.
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:45.800]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:47.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:52.360]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk,
[2:29:52.360 --> 2:29:56.240]  and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:56.240 --> 2:30:00.880]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:30:00.880 --> 2:30:06.160]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight, I had
[2:30:06.160 --> 2:30:08.080]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:12.640]  I was barely holding onto a jaw, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:16.040]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[2:30:16.040 --> 2:30:17.200]  And it worked pretty good.
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:20.280]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too, you had, you know, with a deep
[2:30:20.280 --> 2:30:23.240]  burden of course, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[2:30:23.240 --> 2:30:29.560]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:30:29.560 --> 2:30:34.240]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:38.280]  the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all
[2:30:38.280 --> 2:30:39.280]  of your supplements.
[2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:41.280]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:30:41.280 --> 2:30:43.400]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:45.640]  It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:30:45.640 --> 2:30:46.640]  It's amazing.
[2:30:46.640 --> 2:30:47.640]  It works.
[2:30:47.640 --> 2:30:50.840]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[2:30:50.840 --> 2:30:54.840]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:55.840]  own hands.
[2:30:55.840 --> 2:30:59.720]  That's what we said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:06.240]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid 1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set
[2:31:06.240 --> 2:31:11.240]  in the year 2020, where a world government is being established, where members of Congress
[2:31:11.240 --> 2:31:16.120]  and former presidents are censored by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental
[2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:22.080]  injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[2:31:22.080 --> 2:31:24.680]  to fly on an airplane.
[2:31:24.680 --> 2:31:27.320]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[2:31:27.320 --> 2:31:32.280]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would
[2:31:32.280 --> 2:31:33.280]  be happening.
[2:31:33.280 --> 2:31:35.280]  But it is happening now.
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:39.400]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:40.400]  really work.
[2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:42.320]  So you got to take it every few months.
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:46.480]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:50.280]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[2:31:50.280 --> 2:31:54.120]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[2:31:54.120 --> 2:31:55.120]  of the virus.
[2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:57.040]  And that's in mainline studies.
[2:31:57.040 --> 2:32:00.680]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[2:32:00.680 --> 2:32:07.960]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:13.720]  I was in sixth grade, and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:14.720]  in the arena.
[2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:18.480]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:22.320]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear.
[2:32:22.320 --> 2:32:27.800]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:30.560]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:36.760]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off
[2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:38.160]  on all the amazing products.
[2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:41.560]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:46.040]  And then you fund Info Wars and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech, and it's a
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:47.040]  globalist.
[2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:50.720]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:55.240]  And if you do it, it funds the Info War, it funds the election investigation, and it stands
[2:32:55.240 --> 2:32:56.800]  up against your globalist bullies.
[2:32:56.800 --> 2:33:04.280]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[2:33:04.280 --> 2:33:28.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:53.120]  Welcome back to the Censored Attack broadcast.
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:34:00.240]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Dr. Vladimir Zev-Zalinko, American patriot in New York, has over 30,000
[2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:01.240]  patients.
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:03.480]  He was the first person to talk about how they were suppressing treatments.
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:06.560]  Well, he brought out treatments that were working, then they tried to suppress him.
[2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:11.080]  So he's getting into the big picture right now of what's happening, what he thinks is
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:13.480]  coming next, and just so much more.
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:14.480]  You got cut off by the break.
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:15.480]  Dr. please continue.
[2:34:15.480 --> 2:34:18.480]  Yeah, I was talking about vaccinations.
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:22.760]  I look at each vaccine and judge it on its merits.
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:27.320]  There are three components that comes to any therapy that we need to assess when we're
[2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:30.680]  making a risk versus benefit analysis, whether or not it's worth using.
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:35.040]  Number one is medical necessity, just because we have a capability doesn't mean we need
[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:36.040]  to actually use it.
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:37.680]  It has to be a need for it.
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:42.200]  So for example, a surgeon that operates on every patient is not a surgeon, he's a butcher,
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:43.880]  he's not using medical judgment.
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:47.800]  So just because we may have an ability doesn't mean that we need it.
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:52.640]  So we have to look through the different demographics and see, is there an actual need for these
[2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:53.640]  vaccines?
[2:34:53.640 --> 2:34:54.640]  Number one.
[2:34:54.640 --> 2:34:55.640]  Number two, efficacy.
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:34:57.040]  You want to make sure this stuff actually works.
[2:34:57.040 --> 2:35:00.800]  By the way, when you got cut off, just to interrupt you, because I remember now, you were going
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:04.400]  through the four types of medical response and then start over.
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:12.800]  Yeah, I mentioned that there is spread prevention, pre-hospital care, hospital care, and vaccinations.
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:17.520]  But the vaccinations have to be safe and effective and medically necessary.
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:22.280]  So we'll go through the analysis, whether or not these vaccines, you actually need them,
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:25.440]  then we'll see if they work and then we'll analyze if they're safe.
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:31.080]  But I want to tell you before we go in there, what Governor Cuomo did to my patients.
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:37.000]  First, Governor Cuomo, who ex-Governor Cuomo was directly responsible for 20,000 nursing
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:43.240]  home deaths, I have friends who lost their parents in nursing homes.
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:46.960]  Some nursing homes lost 50% to 60% of their census.
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:54.520]  So this same governor made an executive order to block access to hydroxychloroquine to my
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:35:55.520]  patients.
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:35:59.320]  And I mean it was my patients, I was the only one who was actually using it.
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:04.200]  Wow, the magnitude of this doctor, your prominent doctor, thousands of patients, your patients
[2:36:04.200 --> 2:36:05.560]  blocked when you knew it would help.
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:06.560]  This is murder.
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:07.560]  Yeah, I agree.
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:12.720]  And so what I was forced to do, I was forced to innovate again.
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:17.000]  You know, there's a saying, you don't go to war with the army you wish you had, you go
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:18.760]  to war with the army you do have.
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:25.160]  I lost my hydroxychloroquine, which is nothing more than a zinc delivery system, and I had
[2:36:25.160 --> 2:36:26.160]  to find something else.
[2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:31.080]  So I was looking on the NA servers of all places, and I came across something called
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:36.320]  Corsitin, and apparently it did the same thing, it got zinc inside the cell.
[2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:40.440]  And I never heard of Corsitin, so I googled it, and I see it's over the counter.
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:46.120]  So what I realized, I took a step back, and it was one of those moments in my life, but
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:51.680]  I realized I just stumbled across the cure for tyranny, because now, like I mentioned
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:58.520]  earlier, I could just tell you, Alex, go buy this stuff in the vitamin shop, and you'll
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:00.520]  be protected.
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:01.520]  So it was amazing.
[2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:06.640]  So I started using Corsitin, vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc for all my patients, and I had
[2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:07.640]  the same exact outcomes.
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:08.640]  So it was remarkable.
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:12.920]  So I should thank Governor Cuomo for sending flowers.
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:19.400]  But anyway, getting back to these vaccines, if we go through each demographic, if we go
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:25.680]  through the demographic of 18 or younger, basically healthy kids, the CDC says their
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:33.240]  survival rate is 99.998% without treatment from COVID-19, it's safer than influenza
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:34.240]  virus.
[2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:39.760]  Why would I vaccinate a demographic that has a near 100% recovery rate without treatment
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:45.280]  with something that is not even FDA approved and was brought to human use after a year
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:50.480]  of development when historically it takes 10 years to bring a vaccine to market?
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:51.480]  Why would I?
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:57.040]  The answer is not for medical reasons, perhaps if I believed in child sacrifice.
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:03.480]  If you look at another demographic from 18 to 45, and healthy adults, the survival rate
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:08.080]  without treatment is 99.95%, with treatment it's a near 100%.
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:14.560]  So the same question, why would I vaccinate with an experimental liquid that was only
[2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:21.920]  used, it took a year to develop, why would I vaccinate that demographic with something
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:22.920]  like that?
[2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:24.800]  The answer is not for medical reasons.
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:28.640]  Or if someone had COVID, then they have antibodies, they have natural immunity.
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:31.680]  Everyone knows that natural immunity is much more protective.
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:35.800]  Why would I inject them with something to make inferior antibodies?
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:36.800]  That doesn't make sense.
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:39.800]  And then you get to the last group, and this is really important.
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:44.000]  The high risk group, which is 45 and older are those with medical problems, they are
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  at risk.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:48.640]  They have a death rate of 7.5%, completely unacceptable, I agree.
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:54.120]  However, with proper treatment, we can reduce that risk to less than 1%.
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:59.160]  So now comes the risk versus benefit analysis, that if the proper treatment I could have
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:05.000]  a death rate of less than 1%, what am I going to see if I use these vaccines?
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:10.800]  But that's going to segue into safety issues.
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:15.920]  So if you look at the three time periods you need to analyze, from the moment of injection
[2:39:15.920 --> 2:39:20.480]  to around three months, from three months to three years, and then long term, more than
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:21.480]  three years.
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:26.760]  In the acute setting, what we're seeing is people dying from blood clots, from inflammation
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:31.280]  of the heart, and from miscarriages in the first trimester.
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:36.000]  Even if the VAERS system, which is a terrible system, but that's all we have, VAERS stands
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:41.280]  for Vaccine Endress Event Reporting System, there are 11,000 dead Americans.
[2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:44.760]  So my question is, what is the threshold of death?
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:52.440]  In 1976, with the swine flu vaccines, 26 deaths happened, they scrubbed the entire system,
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:56.720]  where the government is actually admitting to 11,000 deaths.
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:39:57.720]  That's not enough?
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:06.000]  How about what the CDC whistleblower is saying, the number is not 11,000, but it's 45,000.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:07.800]  It's a whistleblower.
[2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:14.480]  Or how about the 2009 Harvard study that said only 1% of actual deaths are being reported
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:15.480]  on VAERS.
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:18.960]  Okay, I can make an argument that death is reported at a higher rate.
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:19.960]  So what's that rate?
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:20.960]  20%.
[2:40:20.960 --> 2:40:21.960]  30%.
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:28.000]  Rather than scale whatever numbers that you're seeing by a factor of five.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:34.080]  And also, I have colleagues that want to file reports, and their reports are being rejected.
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:35.080]  Their patients died.
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:39.920]  So doctor, we have censorship, we have suppressive knowledge, we have suppression of treatments,
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:41.840]  we have all of this.
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:42.840]  How do we respond to this?
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:47.640]  I guess speaking out like you're doing, this is just, this is horrible.
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:54.040]  I'm a big advocate of looking into biblical sources to find answers for modern problems.
[2:40:54.040 --> 2:41:01.120]  So King David, in the Psalms of David writes, turn away from bad, do good, and live.
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:02.840]  So it's a very good prescription.
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:08.200]  So in this context, turn away from bad means, do not submit to the fear, do not agree to
[2:41:08.200 --> 2:41:14.080]  the isolation, and stay away from the poisoned death shots.
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:21.440]  It's very simple, just turn away from the fear and the lie and live.
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:22.800]  I think that's simple.
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:28.000]  The problem is that we're witnessing a very sophisticated psychological manipulation
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:29.440]  of humanity.
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:35.240]  Everyone knows who studied psychological warfare that prolonged anxiety coupled together with
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:40.280]  social isolation, leads to a psychological decompensation.
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:46.560]  And what that happens to the person is they become very gullible and very easy to manipulate.
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:51.920]  If you look at 2015, Bill Gates said that the world population needs to be reduced by
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:52.920]  15%.
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:53.920]  It's a TED lecture.
[2:41:53.920 --> 2:41:59.720]  In 2020, the same Bill Gates said that 7 billion people need to be vaccinated.
[2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:05.120]  So the first question, why would I want to take a vaccine sponsored by someone who believes
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:06.960]  that the world population should be reduced?
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:09.680]  A vaccine for my health, I mean.
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:10.680]  Does that make sense?
[2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:11.680]  That's very simple logic.
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:14.200]  It's just logic.
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:16.960]  And so here's the issue.
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:25.680]  I really feel that we are living through an attempt to enslave humanity.
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:32.360]  This is a war against God, because there are two systems that a thought that can no longer
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:33.360]  coexist.
[2:42:33.360 --> 2:42:36.920]  The first system is that we're made in God's image that...
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:37.920]  Doc, final segment.
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:40.760]  If you can hold over, it's fine, but do one more segment.
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:43.960]  The war against God with Dr. Straight Ahead.
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:44.960]  This is so powerful.
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:45.960]  It's so true.
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:52.040]  Dr. Vladimir, Zev Zelinko, ZStackLife.com, I'm Alex Jones, so everybody tune in now.
[2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:53.160]  This is key.
[2:42:53.160 --> 2:42:57.880]  And then share the video once it's posted to Band-Aid Video and FreeWorldNews.tv.
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:42:59.600]  We've done everything we can.
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:04.760]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:05.760]  we are told.
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:11.240]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:13.520]  water is a big problem.
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:18.240]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts
[2:43:18.240 --> 2:43:20.560]  down its natural functions.
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:23.480]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:26.200]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:29.960]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:34.880]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:40.200]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:44.880]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:50.240]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:54.040]  free and the pro pure shower head will seal the deal.
[2:43:54.040 --> 2:44:03.840]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:44:03.840 --> 2:44:06.920]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:07.920]  Go ahead.
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:10.360]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:15.880]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:21.360]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:27.360]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:30.680]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:34.720]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:39.000]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:49.040]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:55.360]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:45:01.360]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:06.680]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:11.120]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:13.080]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:18.120]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:20.160]  products to the everyday consumer.
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:24.840]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically
[2:45:24.840 --> 2:45:27.840]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:32.200]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:34.120]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:39.200]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:43.960]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:48.440]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.

[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:04.280]  You say you want to fight tyranny.
[2:46:04.280 --> 2:46:07.080]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:08.080]  I know you do.
[2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:09.080]  That's why you're here.

[2:46:58.240 --> 2:46:59.520]  down to the globalist.
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:03.600]  So thank you so much for your support.
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:32.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:38.640]  All right, Dr. Vladimir Zevzelenko, one of the most prominent doctors out there exposing
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:42.040]  the whole COVID situation, the first guy to expose alternative treatments that were proven
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:46.800]  to be right and that were suppressed by major medical journals, which had to reverse themselves
[2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:51.560]  later, is here in this final long second, maybe a little bit longer, but whatever, we've
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:55.680]  got another hour coming up, but he's at least here for another 10 minutes.
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:01.880]  You were getting into the war on God, which anybody studying this, the enemies of freedom
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:06.600]  just go around common sense, their own future, their own personal lives to do evil.
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:08.200]  It isn't war against God.
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:09.600]  So it's a start over, sir.
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:14.760]  There are two systems of thought that cannot coexist.
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:21.120]  The first is a divine system, divine consciousness with the belief that every human being is
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:23.360]  made in the image of God.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:28.120]  If we're made in the image of God, that means our lives are sanctity.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:31.040]  If our lives are sanctity, that means we have human rights.
[2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:37.680]  If we have human rights, it's not in the realm of another person's prerogative to decide
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.880]  how long a person should live and how many of us should be on the planet.
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:49.920]  The other system is the survival of the fittest eugenics system, where it's a hierarchy of
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:57.200]  genetics, the people that have the highest adaptability or the strongest to dictate
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:48:58.360]  what happens to others.
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:04.800]  So invariably it leads to three types of categories, the superhuman, the human, and the subhuman.
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:09.800]  This sounds like a fairy tale, except that 80 years ago it killed 200 million people,
[2:49:09.800 --> 2:49:17.440]  because the Arians believed they were descendants of some Nordic gods, and that that entitled
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:19.680]  them to decide who should live and die.
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:25.880]  So they wanted to enslave the Anglo-Saxons, the Europeans, and eliminate, exterminate
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:32.320]  the subhumans, the Jews, the Gypsies, the Slavs, the handicaps, political prisoners,
[2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:34.160]  anyone who didn't agree with them.
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:40.040]  So what we're seeing now is the same exact thing, except it's not anti-Semitic.
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:46.880]  What it is is there's a group of people, a small group, that believe that they've evolved
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:52.480]  intellectually into a higher level of consciousness, which gives them the power and the right to
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:54.600]  dictate what happens to others.
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:49:58.320]  In my opinion, they didn't evolve, they've devolved Pagans.
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:01.280]  There's nothing new under the sun.
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:03.280]  This has been historically and biblically denerited.
[2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:04.880]  Oh, I totally agree.
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:09.680]  They're the conquest system versus the renaissance system that builds us up and empowers us.
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:13.000]  They're like cancer, just because cancer can take over doesn't mean it's dominant, it's
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  a malfunction.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  They're sociopaths.
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:20.640]  I have a joke, the whole world is suffering because Bill Gates couldn't find a girlfriend
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:21.640]  in high school.
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:22.640]  Exactly.
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:29.760]  It's such a hatred for others and such a narcissistic need to destroy and crush others, to make
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:38.640]  themselves feel powerful, it's an absolutely horrific, ungodly, pagan approach to life.
[2:50:38.640 --> 2:50:39.640]  But I totally agree.
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:44.800]  It's those of us that love God and the human destiny and believe in the divinity of humanity
[2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:48.520]  through God, and those that believe, no, they're God because they're going to dominate us.
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:52.720]  That's how they prove their God and their social Darwinism is dominating.
[2:50:52.720 --> 2:50:54.560]  They believe that's to prove their God.
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:56.640]  So how do we counter something like that?
[2:50:56.640 --> 2:51:01.960]  So look, I just found out two hours ago that I had cancer again.
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:08.960]  My doctor called me and I'm going to need open heart surgery and chemo and radiation.
[2:51:08.960 --> 2:51:14.320]  So you have to understand where I'm emotionally and where I'm coming from and how I'm looking
[2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:15.720]  at life.
[2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:21.120]  And when someone potentially is very close to meeting God, okay, I'm telling you, it's
[2:51:21.120 --> 2:51:25.440]  not about my ego, it's not about my reputation, it's not about money.
[2:51:25.440 --> 2:51:30.200]  I want this world to be a better place for my children and for everyone's children.
[2:51:30.200 --> 2:51:39.440]  And we're now slowly going into a world of depravity, a world of where sociopaths will
[2:51:39.440 --> 2:51:40.440]  rule.
[2:51:40.440 --> 2:51:42.840]  Listen, there's many more of us than that.
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:48.760]  The biggest fear is an educated, informed public.
[2:51:48.760 --> 2:51:54.640]  And so we have to open our eyes and live on a higher level of consciousness and realize
[2:51:54.640 --> 2:52:02.200]  that we are God's children and no putrid, maggot psychopath has the right to dictate
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:06.000]  how long you're going to live.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:11.040]  If you look at the side effects of these vaccines, because that's the real play, you see COVID-19
[2:52:11.040 --> 2:52:13.600]  is extremely treatable.
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:23.320]  But the psychological use of fear and isolation has created a false motivation or justification
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:24.320]  to immunize.
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:27.520]  Dr. Zalinko, I know you're a smart guy, so I know you already see this.
[2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:30.120]  They project their own hatred of themselves on us.
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:34.960]  They want to genetically ruin us and poison us to make us the subhuman they claim.
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:39.560]  They're breaking us so that we're broken so we will be what they claim we are.
[2:52:39.560 --> 2:52:43.400]  Well, that's how the vaccine is, how it's doing it.
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:49.600]  I was going to explain to you that in the first three months, there's going to be a
[2:52:49.600 --> 2:52:51.800]  group of people who die from blood clots.
[2:52:51.800 --> 2:52:54.680]  There's going to be a group of people that die from heart damage.
[2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:57.520]  And there's going to be an increased rate of miscarriages.
[2:52:57.520 --> 2:53:02.840]  Then there's this period where the world experts are screaming genocide, like the Luke
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:07.680]  Montagueur, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for finding HIV in 2008, is saying this is
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:11.120]  the biggest risk of genocide in the history of humanity.
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:15.920]  Dr. Robert Malone, who invented this stuff, is saying, don't take it, the government's
[2:53:15.920 --> 2:53:16.920]  lying to you.
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:23.920]  Dr. Dolores Cahill from Ireland says she believes that in two years, 90% of the people vaccinated
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:24.920]  will be dead.
[2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:30.480]  Dr. Michael Hinton, the former vice president of Pfizer and the head of their vaccine development
[2:53:30.480 --> 2:53:37.160]  program, said for every one child that dies naturally from COVID, 100 will die from the
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:38.160]  vaccine.
[2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:42.600]  This is child sacrifice.
[2:53:42.600 --> 2:53:52.000]  So the mechanism of death is your own immune system gets pathologically primed, and when
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:58.400]  it comes into contact with a similar virus, the antibodies produced by these vaccines
[2:53:58.400 --> 2:54:00.640]  destroy, it's like a bomb going off.
[2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:03.200]  By the way, there is a way around it, by the way.
[2:54:03.200 --> 2:54:04.680]  I just want to help people realize that.
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:08.080]  Yes, please, everybody's asking, is there a way to counter it, if you've taken a shot
[2:54:08.080 --> 2:54:10.240]  or someone has been shedding on you?
[2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:13.960]  Listen, this is a rule for repentance, you know, if you realize you made a mistake and
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:21.600]  you want to go back to a more rational way of thinking, that's fine, we all make mistakes.
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:25.640]  But the key is, if you understand the trigger of the bomb, you can prevent it from going
[2:54:25.640 --> 2:54:26.640]  off.
[2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:32.840]  And the trigger is another similar viral infection that matches the antibodies that these vaccines
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:34.240]  produce.
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:39.160]  And so the only way you're going to avoid the detonation of your bombs is by preventing
[2:54:39.160 --> 2:54:41.320]  yourself from getting these infections.
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:45.400]  And the way you're going to prevent yourself is not taking another vaccine and making more
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:46.400]  bombs.
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:52.240]  It's by taking antiviral, say, effective medications, whether it's hydroxychloroquine
[2:54:52.240 --> 2:54:55.240]  or either Mectin or Corsizin or EGCG.
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:55:02.240]  So are you about to tie this to cervical viruses and herpes?
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:05.840]  Because I was seeing studies that the two are linked.
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:12.840]  Well, these are RNA viruses and all RNA viruses use the same pathway, I'm sorry, most RNA
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:15.840]  viruses use the same pathway for replication.
[2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:20.160]  So there's an enzyme called RNA dependent RNA polymerase, but it's an important enzyme
[2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:25.640]  because all the strains of COVID use this one enzyme to make copies of its genetic material.
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:31.000]  So if you could shut down this enzyme, you could shut down the replication of all the
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:32.400]  strains of COVID.
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:36.520]  That's why I don't care if it's Delta, Lambda, South African or whatever, they all are treated
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:37.520]  the same way.
[2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:41.000]  We can shut down their viral replication, the body's immune system will take care of
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  the job.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  So what do we do?
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  What do we do prophylactically, doctor?
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  What do we do preemptively?
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:48.080]  Well, you need a bullet and that's zinc.
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:50.320]  Zinc stops inhibits this enzyme.
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:54.600]  Zinc does not get into the cell on its own, so you need a zinc delivery system.
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:56.200]  It's like a gun and a bullet.
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:55:58.120]  So there are four zinc delivery systems.
[2:55:58.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  One is hydroxychloroquine.
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:04.440]  Another is ivermectin, then there's corsitin and EGCG, which is a green PX tract.
[2:56:04.440 --> 2:56:09.360]  When you use that together with zinc, you have a functioning unit, a synergy of gun
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:14.240]  and bullet or zinc delivery system, a zinc ionophore with zinc, it gets the zinc into
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:19.000]  the cell in the right concentrations, inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and what happens
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.880]  is you shut down viral replication.
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:27.600]  If a virus cannot make copies of its genetic material, it will not spread.
[2:56:27.600 --> 2:56:30.600]  So that's the key, it's so simple.
[2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:36.280]  And if you prime your immune system by having enough zinc already on board and enough vitamin
[2:56:36.280 --> 2:56:41.960]  D and enough C, then most likely you will not get these infections.
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:46.000]  And if you do get this infection, you have to treat much more aggressively in day one
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:51.320]  or two and not allow for your immune system to explode and kill you.
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:54.040]  The long-term consequences here are completely unknown.
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:56:57.760]  There's paper showing the increase of risk of cancer, increase of risk of...
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:01.520]  Well, doctor, that was my next point, and I know you've got to go.
[2:57:01.520 --> 2:57:04.400]  Can you do five more minutes, a little short second, one of those?
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:08.360]  Because I'm not a rocket scientist like you, but I read a lot of stuff, and I see where
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:13.200]  people take these Pfizer-Moderna shots that they get, like Roger Stone's wife, a week
[2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:17.160]  later, she had this big thing under her arm, she went and they said, oh, it stays for cancer.
[2:57:17.160 --> 2:57:20.360]  And they admit, oh, it's going to make you get cancers, but don't worry about it.
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:24.560]  It's probably not cancer, but then all these people I know, including family, 40-something-year-old
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:28.960]  woman had to have her uterus removed because she got cancer a month after the Moderna shot.
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:34.560]  So to me, it's just so crazy to watch this happening.
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:42.640]  Back in two minutes, Dr. Vladimir Zebsalink, oh, ZStackLife.com, here on this Friday edition.
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:43.960]  Wow, what a powerful interview.
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:44.960]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:44.960 --> 2:57:45.960]  Stay with us.
[2:57:45.960 --> 2:57:56.840]  Hey, Alex, welcome, would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:00.600]  and amongst all this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold
[2:58:00.600 --> 2:58:01.600]  of you for a year.
[2:58:01.600 --> 2:58:08.760]  Okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:10.240]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:14.560]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:16.000]  Brain defense brought me back.
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:21.720]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:28.720]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[2:58:28.720 --> 2:58:35.440]  you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be offended
[2:58:35.440 --> 2:58:38.640]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:40.560]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:58:40.560 --> 2:58:45.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:50.800]  and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:58:50.800 --> 2:58:55.600]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:58.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:02.560]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:07.120]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:10.600]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too, you know, with a deep-burdened
[2:59:10.600 --> 2:59:14.480]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it and man, in two weeks
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:19.680]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know.
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:20.760]  I could think again.
[2:59:20.760 --> 2:59:25.680]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got
[2:59:25.680 --> 2:59:29.280]  my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:31.160]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:59:31.160 --> 2:59:35.600]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:59:35.600 --> 2:59:36.600]  It's amazing.
[2:59:36.600 --> 2:59:40.760]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:44.920]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own
[2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:45.920]  hand.
[2:59:45.920 --> 2:59:46.920]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:59:46.920 --> 2:59:49.560]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:56.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:56.960 --> 3:00:09.760]  All right, final segment with Dr. Vladimir Zevselenko, the pioneering doctor exposing
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:11.600]  all this over here and a half ago.
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:14.320]  He was on fire during that two-minute break talking about he believes there's a global
[3:00:14.320 --> 3:00:18.800]  awakening happening and other key points about how we counter this, so please, sir, please
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:22.480]  continue with closing comments.
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:28.200]  So I think God is testing every single individual and here's the following test.
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:32.200]  I know you're afraid, I know you're scared, you've been destabilized.
[3:00:32.200 --> 3:00:36.920]  Question is, who are you going to seek energy from?
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:37.920]  Who are you going to seek reassurance?
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:43.600]  Are you going to bow down to me, God, and ask me to help you with your fears?
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:45.640]  Ask me for your protection?
[3:00:45.640 --> 3:00:51.080]  Ask me to cover you with clouds of safe security and glory or are you going to run to the false
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:57.520]  gods and the golden calf of this vaccine, sociopathic oligarchs, or corrupt governments?
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:01.600]  Because if that's the case, let's see how that works out for you.
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:05.680]  I really believe that that's the question that every single individual is living through.
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:10.560]  Right now, the world has become in a very ironic way like the Garden of Eden.
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:14.080]  What I mean by that is that in the Garden of Eden before the sin, there was good, there
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:19.120]  was bad, because there was a tree of knowledge of good and bad, but they were separate.
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:23.760]  And for 6,000 years or whatever, it got really mixed up, the way you couldn't tell where
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:25.280]  it was good and where it was bad.
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:32.440]  Right now, you could tell with absolute clarity, where is God's consciousness, God-centered
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:36.480]  living, compared to true idol worship and paganism.
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:41.200]  I agree, Dr. So, what would you call this time where finally it's all been confused,
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:42.200]  now it's clear?
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:47.320]  I call it a wonderful opportunity to choose good over bad.
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:53.960]  I'm calling it a wonderful opportunity as a prophet to say that the spirit of iniquity
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:59.000]  will be removed from the world forever, and death will be swallowed up forever.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:02.560]  And all that depends on the separation of good and bad.
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:08.040]  You know, fear, I mentioned this multiple times, is the tool of the enemy.
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:15.400]  And it turns out that fear lives in the psychological space where God is absent.
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:16.400]  Yes.
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:19.480]  I call it happy birthday everyone, happy birthday Alex.
[3:02:19.480 --> 3:02:20.980]  I didn't lose my mind.
[3:02:20.980 --> 3:02:26.720]  What I'm trying to point out is that every second is a creation, every second of life
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:28.960]  is an act of recreation.
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:33.240]  So the fact that me and you are talking means that God is actually creating us and giving
[3:02:33.240 --> 3:02:35.880]  us the opportunity he wills us to be.
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:40.640]  Now, if you really believe that, if you really walk around with that type of thinking, you're
[3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:46.880]  never alone, and if you're never alone, there's no space, there's no emptiness where fear
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:47.880]  is set in.
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:55.280]  And what these animals are doing, what these sociopathic, putrid pagans are doing is trying
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:03:02.160]  to cause fear everywhere so that you would become psychologically enslaved and codependent.
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:03.160]  Exactly.
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:07.120]  They want to turn us into beasts like they are.
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:11.960]  And you know, Elon Musk just put out, it was unbelievable, I saw our video this morning,
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:19.600]  the new Tesla humanoid robot, and he said the following, that this, these robots will
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:25.360]  remove the needs for any type of manual labor, just the person he said, this will usher in
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:29.000]  a era of universal income.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:34.880]  What I'm seeing is they're ready to eliminate us useful, useless eaters.
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  You know, the, the group of people of the subhumans, you know, 80 years ago, they came
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:43.880]  after the Jews.
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:49.760]  Now, I want to wake everyone up, we're all Jews from that perspective, they're not discriminating
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:57.080]  by religion, they're coming after those people that are vulnerable, that are weak, that are,
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:59.760]  they could destroy easily.
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:06.920]  So wake up and say no to that, don't listen to them, don't give them to the fear.
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:13.080]  Put your faith in God, fill that void with, with, with the, with the faith that God loves
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.840]  you and that he's creating you every second, happy birthday again.
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:22.480]  That's the only way I could think of how to navigate this chaotic turbulence of uncertainty.
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:26.640]  Well, doctor, I loved it when I saw you over here and a half ago and having here has been
[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:27.640]  such a great thing.
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:31.040]  I know you're going to transcend no matter what happens with the heart problems, the
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:33.880]  cancer, whether you're going to live forever here or live forever after that, we're going
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:36.040]  to be together in a turn, you're absolutely right.
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:40.080]  They're selling us a post human nightmare, telling us to step aside to make these machines
[3:04:40.080 --> 3:04:42.080]  become our God so they can play God.
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:48.400]  It is so satanic, ZStackLife.com, please join us again next week to get more into treatments
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:49.520]  and more into so much more.
[3:04:49.520 --> 3:04:52.640]  We're really blessed to have you, sir, and we're really glad this interview happened.
[3:04:52.640 --> 3:04:55.640]  God bless you and God bless America.
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:04:56.640]  Absolutely.
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:04:57.640]  All right.
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:04:58.640]  Wow.
[3:04:58.640 --> 3:04:59.640]  All right.
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:00.640]  Stay with us.
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:07.360]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:13.080]  I was in sixth grade and we have this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:14.080]  in the arena.
[3:05:14.080 --> 3:05:17.840]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[3:05:17.840 --> 3:05:22.360]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear, but Mike Lindell
[3:05:22.360 --> 3:05:27.960]  has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes
[3:05:27.960 --> 3:05:29.920]  to election fraud and other issues.

[3:06:05.640 --> 3:06:19.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones Boy, Dr. Zev Zelenko is just, he's such an
[3:06:19.320 --> 3:06:22.160]  amazing wealth of information.
[3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:32.280]  We are so lucky to have brave, educated, responsible, intelligent, I mean, really just no nonsense
[3:06:32.280 --> 3:06:36.400]  people like Dr. Vladimir Zev Zelenko educating us.
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:41.960]  I mean, this, this PSYOP that has taken us over is just I'm seeing things that, you know,
[3:06:41.960 --> 3:06:42.960]  just personal experience.
[3:06:42.960 --> 3:06:46.000]  I was kicked off Twitter, for example, which no big deal.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  That's fine.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:48.760]  I was going to leave them anyways.
[3:06:48.760 --> 3:06:55.680]  But the reason why for pointing out that two kids died in the aftermath of a mass inoculation
[3:06:55.680 --> 3:07:02.120]  of some 24,000 youth without the presence of any adults, parents were not allowed into
[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:08.480]  that Australian sports arena turned into a mini Auschwitz.
[3:07:08.480 --> 3:07:13.520]  And now it's been confirmed three dead, two boys and a girl.
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:20.080]  As just today I interviewed a 45 year veteran of the Royal Australian Air Force.
[3:07:20.080 --> 3:07:21.080]  But think about that.
[3:07:21.080 --> 3:07:27.160]  I mean, we, we are really living in a place where 24,000 kids are being herded, ushered
[3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:37.920]  into a basketball arena or some kind of a sporting arena and jabbed with this thing.
[3:07:37.920 --> 3:07:43.400]  That Australian Air Force veteran brave soul coming forward out of a continent that seems
[3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:45.080]  to be the prototype for the new world order.
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:46.080]  I don't know.
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:47.080]  It's devastating.
[3:07:47.080 --> 3:07:52.120]  And it could have been that tweet or maybe it was the factual statement that I made about
[3:07:52.120 --> 3:07:56.920]  the so-called vaccine mandates in the workplace.
[3:07:56.920 --> 3:08:04.120]  I simply pointed out that if you're a crazy lunatic, tyrannical overlord called a boss
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:09.560]  was acting like an authoritarian dictator requiring that you get poked, you might consider
[3:08:09.560 --> 3:08:13.520]  working for some place that's not currently mandating the shop.
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:18.200]  And a few of those places you could work and still have medical freedom, a few of the most
[3:08:18.200 --> 3:08:23.920]  notable places to work that are not currently mandating the jab are the White House, Pfizer,
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:29.000]  Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, the World Health Organization, the CDC and the FDA.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:34.360]  That tweet went nuts, totally viral, and then boom, I was gone.
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:40.760]  The tweet remained, however, why because it's true.
[3:08:40.760 --> 3:08:46.720]  And now I'm watching comments in social media, specifically on my Telegram channel, which
[3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:51.680]  I love being there because I read literally almost every single comment and I interact,
[3:08:51.680 --> 3:08:53.680]  I love Telegram.
[3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:57.640]  And I'm there and I'm reading these comments and I'm telling you that I'm really starting
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:05.360]  to see the extremely apparent side effects of this psychological hell that these globalist
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:08.360]  elitist ruling class have begun to put us through.
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:15.320]  And I say begun because this is only the beginning.
[3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:20.820]  And there are a lot of you that are failing this test.
[3:09:20.820 --> 3:09:26.120]  People are deciding on what man to follow.
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:30.600]  What man to worship, what man to wait for to come riding in on some white horse with
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:32.960]  a sash and save the world.
[3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:38.560]  You've read the book, you know how this, you know how this story ends.
[3:09:38.560 --> 3:09:43.280]  And people are still failing the test because they're failing to put their faith in God.
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:49.840]  People are going into complete mental breakdown mode.
[3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:52.300]  So we have to back off the rhetoric.
[3:09:52.300 --> 3:09:55.460]  We have to back off the theories.
[3:09:55.460 --> 3:09:57.520]  We have to back off the plans.
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:09:59.920]  We have to back off this speculation.
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:05.440]  We have to bring it back to facts.
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:10.360]  Ben Shapiro, one of the biggest phony grifters I can imagine.
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:15.520]  One of the most disgusting, self-absorbed, neocon, almost sociopathic, the way he handles
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:20.160]  himself, conservative, ink, media, industrial complex, Trump fundraising, dingleberry, just
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:22.720]  hanging on to whatever he can.
[3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:27.200]  He likes to say facts don't care about your feelings, which factually is wrong then because
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:29.760]  caring is a feeling.
[3:10:29.760 --> 3:10:33.360]  But we have to do better.
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:38.080]  When I say we, I don't necessarily mean we as a population, although I agree that we
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:40.640]  as a population have to do better globally.
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:48.480]  But when I say we have to do better, I mean we who have been blessed to have a platform.
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:57.640]  We meaning me, people in a position with a microphone, with a platform, to be the bullhorn
[3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:04.080]  screaming what everybody else is thinking, asking the questions of people who are objective,
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:09.880]  fact-based people, experts, people who are trained to deal with these things, although
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:13.480]  we are being told that there's only one acceptable science in the world and that is the science
[3:11:13.480 --> 3:11:15.400]  of Dr. Tony Fauci.
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:18.440]  It's complete nonsense.
[3:11:18.440 --> 3:11:23.240]  And so we have to get back to being strong and objective.
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:24.600]  We have to be responsible.
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:27.880]  We have to deal with the facts that we have in front of us.
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:30.840]  We have to rely on these experts to bring them to us.
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:36.960]  We have to then use our own discernment to arrive at a place and that place will dictate
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:37.960]  where we are.
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:38.960]  How do we feel?
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:39.960]  What does it look like here?
[3:11:39.960 --> 3:11:43.400]  Where do we go from there?
[3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:46.040]  One of those experts is Dr. Ben Edwards.
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:51.480]  He is the founder and medical director of Veritas Medical in Lubach, Texas.
[3:11:51.480 --> 3:11:56.640]  He did his undergrad at Baylor, medical degree from UT Houston, residency at McClennan County
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:01.080]  Medical and Education Center of Research Foundation where he was a chief resident, fellowship
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:02.720]  and integrative medicine.
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:07.440]  He now oversees a team of seven nurse practitioners at a set of three different clinics across
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:10.960]  West Texas and he joins us now.
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:16.960]  Dr. Edwards, you come from a long line of physicians, nurses in your family, many who
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:19.040]  have worked for Baylor Scott White.
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:24.760]  We have seen what Scott White has done to Peter McCullough, treated him very badly.
[3:12:24.760 --> 3:12:30.520]  People coming forward are being oppressed by these huge conglomerate medical systems
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:38.800]  and we have to back away from all of these theories and just talk sensical about what
[3:12:38.800 --> 3:12:46.440]  is happening with these injections, with this so-called virus in the medical world.
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:48.080]  How do you see it?
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:55.080]  Stu, the way I see it is we're at the culmination of 110 years of a deception and we're at a
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:59.600]  point now I would say the healthcare system has finally broken.
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:02.720]  Let me just say real quick for listeners because I'm going to say some stuff that's
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:05.480]  going to be controversial and sound crazy.
[3:13:05.480 --> 3:13:10.560]  Like you said, I come from a long line of allopathic doctors and I was conventional as
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:11.560]  could be.
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:15.200]  For seven years I was practicing as the only doctor in the county out in West Texas in
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:19.960]  a tiny rural health clinic and they put me on the front page of the Washington Post because
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:25.120]  we were so successful, meaning financially successful and then I met a doctor who told
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:32.240]  me before 100 years ago, prior to 100 years ago, all healing modalities for thousands
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:39.440]  of years all worked with the body's ability to fix itself, to heal itself.
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:47.560]  And now, or in 1910, John D. Rockefeller in conglomeration with the Carnegie Foundation
[3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:49.760]  hired Abraham Flexner.
[3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:55.800]  The Flexner report was published in 1910 and what it said was there are too many, a wide
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:59.080]  variety of medical education curriculum out there.
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:04.840]  We need to standardize this to the allopathic model meaning pharmaceutical, which happened
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:10.800]  to be a derivative from John D. Rockefeller's petroleum products from coal tar in particular
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:13.840]  to where all these pharmaceuticals came from.
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:17.560]  Pharmaceutical and surgery, that's what we need to standardize everything to.
[3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:19.560]  That was 1910.
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:22.840]  Pre-World War II, we're the healthiest people group in the world.
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:24.600]  Since then we've gone nothing but downhill.
[3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:29.480]  Now we're the sickest group of people in the world, of the industrialized world.
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:32.440]  54% of our kids are sick.
[3:14:32.440 --> 3:14:36.480]  The majority of Americans have two chronic diseases or more.
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:42.280]  Five pharmaceuticals is your average number of pharmaceuticals for adults over 50.
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:47.160]  The first heart attack ever reported in the American medical literature was in 1912 when
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:48.660]  there was one.
[3:14:48.660 --> 3:14:54.400]  Now it's the number one leading cause of death at 650,000 deaths a year from heart disease.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:15:00.520]  Here's number two, and I was just reading a book that said in the early 1900s lung cancer
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:05.640]  was so rare that every single case got published.
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:09.640]  There was just a handful, and now there's 550,000 cases a year of cancer.
[3:15:09.640 --> 3:15:13.240]  Those are your top two killers, so people need to understand for the past 100 years
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:18.080]  this pharmaceutical-based approach to medicine and symptomatic treatment only has led us
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:19.680]  to where we are now.
[3:15:19.680 --> 3:15:23.520]  And now it can simply train doctors don't even have a clue that there's another way.
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:30.640]  It just seems to be that there is a medicine to cover the symptoms from another medicine
[3:15:30.640 --> 3:15:32.760]  that is then stacked on top of another medicine.
[3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:36.760]  And as you look at the stock of pharmaceutical companies, when they dip, they come out with
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:41.720]  a new drug, and then later you'll watch and you'll see an increased spike in the number
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:45.920]  of deaths that were associated with that group of people that that medicine was prescribed
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:48.040]  for almost like they're sitting back and laughing.
[3:15:48.040 --> 3:15:49.040]  I got to go to break.
[3:15:49.040 --> 3:15:52.120]  We're going to come back with Dr. Ben Edwards right after this.
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:54.120]  My name is Stu Peters.
[3:15:54.120 --> 3:16:24.080]  We'll be back with more of the Alex Jones show, stick tight.
[3:16:24.120 --> 3:16:50.080]  Or fireplace heat without fireplace smoke, wall of fire dot com.

[3:16:55.040 --> 3:16:58.800]  that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:05.280]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.

[3:19:39.760 --> 3:19:44.760]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:19:44.760 --> 3:19:47.160]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:50.760]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:19:50.760 --> 3:19:55.840]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and
[3:19:55.840 --> 3:19:58.680]  hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us.
[3:19:58.680 --> 3:19:59.680]  God bless.
[3:19:59.680 --> 3:20:24.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:24.240 --> 3:20:30.760]  Do Peters dot TV, there's my site right there and yes, the military jab is a definite imminent
[3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:32.320]  risk to national security.
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:36.000]  We're lucky to be joined right now by Dr. Ben Edwards, founder and medical director
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:39.080]  of Veritas Medical in Texas.
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:43.240]  So you did, you explained a little bit about your family history.
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:46.960]  I've talked about your undergrad at Baylor, your medical degree from UT Houston, your
[3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:51.080]  residency, all of your education and research and all of the things that are happening in
[3:20:51.080 --> 3:20:55.360]  our country right now surrounding the so-called COVID-19 virus that seems to almost have become
[3:20:55.360 --> 3:21:01.160]  a brand now as heavily as it's been advertised and the push towards this inoculation.
[3:21:01.160 --> 3:21:03.880]  We don't have a whole lot of time, so I just want to get right to that.
[3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:10.280]  You've no doubt noticed the push and you've no doubt looked into these shots being called
[3:21:10.280 --> 3:21:11.360]  vaccines.
[3:21:11.360 --> 3:21:14.200]  Tell us what you know about them.
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:17.000]  Yeah, well, we know one thing.
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:18.800]  They're not as effective and safe.
[3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:24.200]  I mean, people can say it's a catchphrase, safe and effective, anybody can say that.
[3:21:24.200 --> 3:21:26.240]  Where's the data?
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:28.800]  The data doesn't support it, period.
[3:21:28.800 --> 3:21:33.800]  The most they're going to be able to say is maybe it decreases your chance of getting
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:34.800]  severe disease.
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:35.800]  Well, guess what?
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:44.480]  Go to c19early.com and you'll see 24 different therapies on there for early outpatient treatment
[3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:47.000]  and they all show positive benefit.
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:51.040]  I can almost guarantee you all 24 of those and many of those are over the counter all
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:56.760]  natural summer prescription, but they will have a safer and a well proven track record
[3:21:56.760 --> 3:22:00.160]  of safety profile compared to this shot.
[3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:05.800]  What's difficult about from a doctor standpoint to give informed consent, I need the data.
[3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:08.220]  The data is so hard to find, the true data.
[3:22:08.220 --> 3:22:13.280]  When we have a whistleblower from the CDC telling Tom Rents, we've got 45,000 deaths
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:17.720]  within three days of the shot, there's an autopsy, a pathologist out of Germany, he
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:21.920]  did 40 autopsies on patients that died within two weeks of the shot.
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:26.920]  He said 40% of those he would say were from the vaccine specifically and he called for
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:30.880]  a whole lot more autopsies to prove this out.
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:32.640]  That's the whole point.
[3:22:32.640 --> 3:22:34.800]  This is so new, never been done before.
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:37.960]  It's hard to give informed consent on something that's new and unknown.
[3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:40.240]  We don't know the long term anything.
[3:22:40.240 --> 3:22:44.960]  It just blows my mind that we're putting billboards out, we're bribing college students here
[3:22:44.960 --> 3:22:49.960]  locally in Lubbock, Texas Tech, giving out free parking and food vouchers, et cetera.
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:56.320]  For a population kids that have zero risk, definitely more risk, Dr. Eaton said 50 times
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:23:00.480]  more risk of dying from the shot if you're a kid than dying from COVID, you have more
[3:23:00.480 --> 3:23:02.680]  chance of dying from influenza than COVID.
[3:23:02.680 --> 3:23:06.960]  It just makes no sense at all and it seems clear to me, when you have so many different
[3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:13.080]  early outpatient treatments that are being completely ignored, I've talked to more ICU
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:17.720]  doctors in the past 10 days and they tell me the same thing.
[3:23:17.720 --> 3:23:21.200]  These patients come in super sick, they were sick at home for two weeks, nobody treated
[3:23:21.200 --> 3:23:24.600]  them so they show up in the ER and there's nothing we can do but throw them in the unit
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:28.360]  and put them on remdesivir and thoma on a vent and they die.
[3:23:28.360 --> 3:23:31.880]  That's what she told me and I hear it over and over and over.
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:32.880]  It's unbelievable.
[3:23:32.880 --> 3:23:35.840]  I said, well, why don't you and me team up and let's do a press conference and let's
[3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:40.200]  get a billboard, early outpatient treatment, let's keep them out of your ICU.
[3:23:40.200 --> 3:23:41.960]  We're not hearing it from anybody.
[3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:46.840]  If I see one more billboard about vaccines and masks, I'm going to pull my hair out.
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:49.520]  It's so clear.
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:52.600]  So I've talked with so many experts, so many doctors.
[3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:59.080]  Listen, you guys are the unsung vault of super important information right now.
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:02.400]  In times past, I will admit, a doctor is a doctor, you go see him when you're sick,
[3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:04.280]  blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[3:24:04.280 --> 3:24:06.400]  I've always appreciated what you guys do.
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:10.240]  You have a tremendous amount of schooling that you have to do and whatever, but you
[3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:13.960]  guys are like, boom, all of a sudden, celebrities, you guys are on the scene here and we're talking
[3:24:13.960 --> 3:24:14.960]  to all kinds of them.
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:18.520]  Dr. Brian Artist says that this remdesivir actually will shut down your kidneys.
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:22.720]  It drowns patients, the vent, I mean, this is a cocktail for murder and that doctors
[3:24:22.720 --> 3:24:26.280]  know this but that these ethics systems and other systems being used by hospitals are
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:30.520]  essentially being controlled by AI where doctors aren't really making traditional decisions
[3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:31.520]  on their own anymore.
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:34.960]  They're being told what to do, practitioners and so on and so forth.
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:40.320]  Now you oversee a team of seven practitioners at three clinics across West Texas.
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:45.200]  I've talked with respiratory specialists and doctors who are saying that they're seeing
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:51.360]  a huge influx of inoculated patients coming in, presenting symptoms that are consistent
[3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:53.800]  with this antibody dependent enhancement, ADE.
[3:24:53.800 --> 3:24:55.680]  Is that what this Delta variant really is?
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:58.520]  Do you think, is that what we're seeing, all these sick people?
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:03.000]  I think that's definitely the concerns too and again, it'd be nice if we would have had
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:06.240]  some studies, long-term studies that could have proven this out because in all the animal
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:08.360]  models, that's exactly what happened.
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:10.800]  So why all of a sudden do we think it's not going to happen?
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:15.760]  So yeah, we're seeing some vaccinated patients coming in with a much exaggerated inflammatory
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:21.000]  response, much more difficult to treat and yeah, so I think until proven otherwise, we
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:25.480]  have to say of course, it's probably that because historically speaking, that's what
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:26.840]  the study showed.
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:30.480]  And so we've got to be concerned about that for sure.
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:32.640]  Are you concerned about kids taking this thing?
[3:25:32.640 --> 3:25:39.200]  I mean, you mentioned that kids are not being impacted by the virus itself.
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:40.960]  They were never at risk.
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:43.760]  We're ushering in Australia 24,000 kids into an arena.
[3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:46.040]  As you can see, there's schools here in California.
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:47.760]  If you're not vaccinated, you can't come to school.
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:49.840]  They're pushing this thing on our kids.
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:50.840]  Why?
[3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:51.840]  It's unbelievable Stu.
[3:25:51.840 --> 3:25:52.840]  I can't tell you why.
[3:25:52.840 --> 3:25:56.560]  I mean, there's no logical explanation of this at all.
[3:25:56.560 --> 3:26:02.560]  If you have no risk from the actual virus, and there's substantial risk, and I'll have
[3:26:02.560 --> 3:26:07.520]  people tell me substantial, it's only like 0.001% or whatever it is, percentage-wise.
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:12.440]  I don't care if it's five kids or 15 kids or 20 kids or 100 kids, percentage-wise it
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:14.320]  might not be anything.
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:18.800]  Zero kids died from COVID who didn't have a preexisting condition.
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:23.880]  And I imagine even the preexisting condition kids that did die unfortunately, and God bless
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:24.880]  them.
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:28.600]  I imagine they probably weren't treated with butycinide and ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:30.400]  and IV vitamin C.
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:34.040]  So there's absolutely no reason, in my opinion, you would ever subject a kid.
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:38.240]  I mean, why are we even talking about, it blows my mind we're even discussing this.
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:42.880]  Pregnant women and kids are going to be subjected to something that we have no idea, acute or
[3:26:42.880 --> 3:26:43.880]  long-term.
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:48.320]  We have a better idea now on acute side effects because we've got VAERS, which obviously we've
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:50.600]  talked about under reports.
[3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:52.240]  It's just, it's unbelievable Stu.
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:54.600]  I mean, we're in a state of deception.
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:26:58.840]  I mean, I was reading in Revelation the other day and sorcery, the word sorcery in Revelation
[3:26:58.840 --> 3:27:02.760]  can be translated as pharma-chia and we got to be careful.
[3:27:02.760 --> 3:27:08.160]  We put our hope, our faith, our trust in this savior called pharma-chia and it's a demonic
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:09.680]  deception in my opinion.
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:12.760]  We got to get back to the very root of this, which is spiritual.
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:15.760]  It's a delusion and a deception in my opinion.
[3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:19.760]  Dr. Ben Edwards, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you coming on and you did it
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:26.560]  in short notice, but we have to get back to a point where we are dealing with facts and
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:30.560]  people have to start really understanding that these are the things, whether they hurt
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:34.120]  your feelings or not, whether it's what you want to hear or not.
[3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:35.720]  The facts are the facts.
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:36.720]  The truth is the truth.
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:39.680]  You can call it what you want to, is it a bioweapon, was it predetermined, did it come
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:45.760]  out of Wuhan, what's in the injections, graphene oxide, this, poison that, euthanasia, new world
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:49.600]  order, the great reset, all of it.
[3:27:49.600 --> 3:27:53.920]  The speculations are what they are, but the facts that we have to deal with is that these
[3:27:53.920 --> 3:28:01.080]  things are causing unprecedented amount of adverse events that, as you mentioned, the
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:03.920]  VAERS system only is one system.
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:07.560]  It's the least comprehensive, the most unreliable, it's completely underreported.
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:11.680]  The Harvard study says that only about 1% are actually in there and that means that
[3:28:11.680 --> 3:28:18.440]  we are looking at potentially death at monumental proportions unlike anything that we have ever
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:19.440]  seen.
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:20.440]  I really appreciate you being here.
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:21.440]  Thank you.
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:22.440]  You're welcome, Stu.
[3:28:22.440 --> 3:28:24.520]  Thanks for having me.
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:30.120]  When we come back on the Alex Jones show, we are going to be talking with Jerome Bell.
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:35.040]  We're talking about this injection being forced on military personnel as an existential threat
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:36.960]  to national security.
[3:28:36.960 --> 3:28:39.000]  This Lloyd Austin, a complete joke.
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:44.640]  You see this guy wearing these welders visors and these gloves and like 35,000 masks on
[3:28:44.640 --> 3:28:50.720]  his face, this is the guy in charge of leading the most brave men and women on the face of
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:51.720]  the planet.
[3:28:51.720 --> 3:28:55.400]  Our United States military, our soldiers, will talk to a Chief Petty Officer from the
[3:28:55.400 --> 3:28:57.040]  Navy when we return to the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:28:58.040]  My name is Stu Peters.
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:28:59.040]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:28:59.040 --> 3:29:03.640]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:29:03.640 --> 3:29:06.360]  from beta testing to operational.
[3:29:06.360 --> 3:29:11.080]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[3:29:11.080 --> 3:29:12.080]  takeover.
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:15.520]  The good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:20.160]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:21.280]  Humanity is strong.
[3:29:21.280 --> 3:29:25.080]  We're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:26.080]  of defeating it.
[3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:28.440]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:32.680]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:34.400]  others is absolutely essential.
[3:29:34.400 --> 3:29:38.920]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:42.600]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[3:29:42.600 --> 3:29:48.920]  also funding our operation info wars store.com info wars store.com is incredible.
[3:29:48.920 --> 3:29:52.240]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:54.720]  back in like bodies, vaso beats and others.
[3:29:54.720 --> 3:30:01.120]  So get them today at info wars store.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:30:01.120 --> 3:30:08.320]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that it's
[3:30:08.320 --> 3:30:13.200]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public, they do the same
[3:30:13.200 --> 3:30:18.640]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and
[3:30:18.640 --> 3:30:19.640]  over again.
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:27.280]  Well guess what, it was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout
[3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:31.600]  of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more
[3:30:31.600 --> 3:30:37.520]  people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually
[3:30:37.520 --> 3:30:42.000]  go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:47.360]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[3:30:47.360 --> 3:30:48.360]  the road.
[3:30:48.360 --> 3:30:52.400]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:57.720]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[3:30:57.720 --> 3:31:00.000]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[3:31:00.000 --> 3:31:04.760]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:31:04.760 --> 3:31:07.480]  from beta testing to operational.
[3:31:07.480 --> 3:31:12.240]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[3:31:12.240 --> 3:31:13.240]  takeover.
[3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:16.640]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:21.280]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:25.400]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[3:31:25.400 --> 3:31:27.080]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:31:27.080 --> 3:31:29.560]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:33.800]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:35.440]  others is absolutely essential.
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:40.160]  And at the same time supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on
[3:31:40.160 --> 3:31:44.560]  air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding
[3:31:44.560 --> 3:31:45.560]  our operation.
[3:31:45.560 --> 3:31:46.560]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:31:46.560 --> 3:31:47.560]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[3:31:47.560 --> 3:31:53.360]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are
[3:31:53.360 --> 3:31:55.840]  back in like bodies, vasobes and others.
[3:31:55.840 --> 3:32:00.120]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:32:00.120 --> 3:32:07.440]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[3:32:07.440 --> 3:32:13.160]  I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[3:32:13.160 --> 3:32:14.160]  in the arena.
[3:32:14.160 --> 3:32:17.840]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:21.760]  But when it comes to media, InfoWars has been the tip of that spear.
[3:32:21.760 --> 3:32:27.240]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[3:32:27.240 --> 3:32:30.000]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:36.200]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off
[3:32:36.200 --> 3:32:37.760]  on all the amazing products.
[3:32:37.760 --> 3:32:41.000]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:45.880]  And then you fund InfoWars and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech against the globalist.
[3:32:45.880 --> 3:32:50.160]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:54.680]  And if you do it, it funds the InfoWars, it funds the election investigation, and it stands
[3:32:54.680 --> 3:32:56.240]  up against these globalist bullies.
[3:32:56.240 --> 3:33:02.760]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[3:33:02.760 --> 3:33:23.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:25.120]  Military jab, national security risk.
[3:33:25.120 --> 3:33:31.720]  Yeah, I mean, that is, that is the fact, that is 100% true that you inoculate any group
[3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:38.240]  of people with something that is proven to be dangerous, more than likely deadly for
[3:33:38.240 --> 3:33:44.280]  anybody that takes it, depending on how your body reacts to it, call it an experimental
[3:33:44.280 --> 3:33:45.600]  vaccine if you want to.
[3:33:45.600 --> 3:33:46.600]  That's fine.
[3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:47.600]  It's not the truth.
[3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:52.080]  If that's what you call it, whatever you want to, it's hurting people and killing people.
[3:33:52.080 --> 3:33:55.360]  It's killing kids, it's killing adults.
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:59.320]  It's going to kill a large mass of people.
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:04.560]  And now the military is saying that they're going to inoculate every single person in
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:09.120]  the military, active duty, national guard, reservists, contractors, all of them, all
[3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:13.800]  military personnel, regardless of religious belief, regardless of preexisting medical
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:17.560]  conditions, none of that matters because there's only one science that we are allowed
[3:34:17.560 --> 3:34:18.560]  to follow.
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:20.560]  And that is the science of one Tony Fauci.
[3:34:20.560 --> 3:34:26.080]  And if that doesn't piss off every single person globally that holds on to any kind
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:31.320]  of core values, medical freedom, faith in God, any of that, then we're not on the same
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:32.320]  page.
[3:34:32.320 --> 3:34:37.400]  And it is because we've become shifted so far off of the page from one another, so polarized
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:41.920]  so divided on every single issue in this country, whether it's election integrity, was the election
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:46.840]  stolen, is Trump a Trojan horse, is that the real Biden in the White House, did he even
[3:34:46.840 --> 3:34:47.840]  really win?
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:48.840]  When is Q coming?
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:49.840]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3:34:49.840 --> 3:34:54.160]  And none of that really matters if we can't be united on one thing.
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:34:58.080]  And that one thing that should be nonpartisan is that you have the choice.
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:02.080]  You should be able to make the decision for yourself as to what substance goes into your
[3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:07.080]  body via a needle or an injection intravenously into your bloodstream and into the bloodstream
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:08.080]  of your kids.
[3:35:08.080 --> 3:35:15.000]  Now, it is past time that we stand up for our medical freedom.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:20.280]  And the reason that we are afforded that freedom is because brave men and women sacrifice sign
[3:35:20.280 --> 3:35:25.880]  on the line knowing that they are risking everything, their families, kiss them goodbye,
[3:35:25.880 --> 3:35:30.400]  say goodbye to them when they go on deployments to these hellhole countries halfway across
[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:35.040]  the world willing to die in piles of spent shell casings to defend that freedom, to give
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:37.400]  us that freedom.
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:42.040]  And then to thank those brave men and women that honorably serve in that military to provide
[3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:49.600]  that very freedom to us, you are going to strip that freedom from them, jab them.
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:51.440]  What has this come to?
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:36:00.960]  Not only that, not only that, but then you're going to execute a plan or a lack thereof to
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:04.800]  pull them out of Afghanistan, leave that place in ruins.
[3:36:04.800 --> 3:36:06.360]  We now have Americans that are stuck there.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:07.360]  The place is upside down.
[3:36:07.360 --> 3:36:10.320]  The Taliban is ruling everywhere over in Afghanistan right now.
[3:36:10.320 --> 3:36:14.400]  ISIS is growing up there are people coming in terrorist cells from Pakistan.
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:16.280]  It's a terrorist breeding ground again.
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:21.320]  And the likelihood of a full military scale redeployment to Afghanistan is increasingly
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:23.160]  becoming more probable every single day.
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:26.680]  Here to talk to us about it is Chief Bell Jerome Bell.
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:29.240]  He is a naval petty officer retired.
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:30.240]  He's running for Congress.
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:32.480]  He's an America first candidate out of Virginia.
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:37.160]  If I'm pissed about this Chief Bell, I can't imagine the way that you must be feeling.
[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:44.280]  Yeah, I'm really upset about this, not only we spoke about the jab on your show and what
[3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:45.280]  I felt about that.
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:51.600]  I was very, very public on that and hopefully I think because I came out public and toe
[3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:57.040]  and the military people that it was illegal to get this jab that they pulled back a little
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:36:58.040]  bit.
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:36:59.280]  So I'm hoping they're going to still walk that back.
[3:36:59.280 --> 3:37:02.720]  But what's going on right now in Afghanistan is a travesty.
[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:06.440]  We have over 15,000 Americans left behind enemy lines.
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:08.840]  We don't leave people behind enemy lines.
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:12.480]  What Joe Biden has done, you know, to these American, to these families, can you imagine
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:17.160]  what's going on in these people's families, their minds, that their people are left behind
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:18.160]  enemy lines.
[3:37:18.160 --> 3:37:21.840]  And our Joe Biden has to say as well, we have a deal with the Taliban that they're going
[3:37:21.840 --> 3:37:24.680]  to let them through if they show American passports.
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:25.680]  Are you insane?
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:30.760]  Oh, man, are you that fickle and factless minded that you're really going to believe
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:35.040]  that the Taliban is going to let Americans through if they come through and showing their
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:36.760]  American passports?
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:42.400]  What brain cell do you have left to even imagine that it is, it is, you know, very, very furiating
[3:37:42.400 --> 3:37:45.200]  and frustrating, you know, but that's what's happening right now.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:46.360]  And Joe Biden needs to resign.
[3:37:46.360 --> 3:37:48.480]  Kamala Harris needs to be resigned.
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:51.120]  This hapless General Milley needs to resign.
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:52.120]  He needs to be fired.
[3:37:52.120 --> 3:37:53.120]  He needs to be jailed.
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:55.400]  He lied to the American people and they've been lying.
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:37:58.880]  They've known about this, that this was coming since June.
[3:37:58.880 --> 3:38:00.120]  They've known about it.
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:03.320]  The documents are coming out, you have people whistleblowers coming out.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:05.200]  They've known about this since June.
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.720]  They were talking about it at the embassy since June and he let it happen, you know,
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:14.480]  and yeah, yes, I'm very, very upset right now.
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:21.840]  Milley is more concerned with promoting transgenderism in the military and introducing reading racist
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:27.680]  writings of Ibram X Kendi with this woke, you know, indoctrination of every military
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:33.480]  soldier trying to, you know, root out racism, systemic racism is the greatest threat to our
[3:38:33.480 --> 3:38:34.480]  military.
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  You know, that's what he's worried about.
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:38.280]  And as far as Biden and Kamala Harris are concerned, you're absolutely right.
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:39.600]  They should step down immediately.
[3:38:39.600 --> 3:38:45.040]  Trump had a plan to do this and Trump's mantra also was we don't negotiate with terrorists.
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:46.160]  We don't negotiate with terrorists.
[3:38:46.160 --> 3:38:52.440]  So what are we doing assuming like you said that the Taliban, a terrorist organization,
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:56.400]  the Taliban, the most violent people on the face of the planet are going to say, oh, yeah,
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:38:59.240]  there's your passport, proceed to the next gate.
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:03.000]  And I'm now hearing that Americans who are left there are being told, well, if you're
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:08.440]  looking for the exit plan, follow us on Twitter, follow the state department on Twitter to get
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:10.320]  your latest updates on your exit plan.
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:12.240]  Well, what if there's a conservative over there?
[3:39:12.240 --> 3:39:14.000]  I bet they're banned from Twitter.
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:17.040]  So now Jack Dorsey's Twitter bans are going to lead people right to their death.
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:18.920]  I don't know how far his impunity goes.
[3:39:18.920 --> 3:39:22.000]  I mean, this whole thing is just a complete mess.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:23.920]  Yes, total mess.
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:27.160]  Not only that, they don't even have a way to get these people to the airport.
[3:39:27.160 --> 3:39:29.760]  They don't even have an exit plan for them.
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:32.680]  If you make it to the airport, then guess what?
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:35.640]  You could pay $2,000 and you can be evacuated.
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:40.720]  They are charging Americans up to $2,000 or more to be evacuated if they make it to the
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:47.360]  airport where they're putting these Afghans on these planes for free, unvetted, un-tested
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:48.880]  for COVID or whatever.
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:51.600]  They're putting these people in place for and flying them back to the United States
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:54.000]  when the UAE said that they would take them.
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.200]  When you have Qatar, they said that they would take them.
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:39:59.840]  When you have Dubai, you have all these other places over there that would take these refugees
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:00.840]  from Afghanistan.
[3:40:00.840 --> 3:40:01.840]  You can drop them off there.
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:05.160]  They can stay in their Muslim countries, but yet they want to bring them here.
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:09.960]  We have over $4,000 right now in Fort Lee, Virginia, where our hapless, black-faced governor
[3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:18.080]  went and actually congratulated them for coming over here and said that welcome them for coming
[3:40:18.080 --> 3:40:19.080]  over here.
[3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:20.080]  We don't want them over here.
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:23.440]  But we don't know who these people are, and now we're bringing them in.
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:27.560]  These people want to destroy America, and I'm sure they're being unvetted.
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:28.920]  So we're bringing in Trojan horses.
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:32.840]  We're bringing in some jihadis that want to cause Americans harm.
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:37.400]  And I just feel for these families, and I really wish I had a team that could go over
[3:40:37.400 --> 3:40:42.960]  there and rescue these Americans because it's heartbreaking right now.
[3:40:42.960 --> 3:40:49.240]  Is it possible that amid all of these election audits, I mean, we're watching Arizona very
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:50.240]  closely.
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:51.560]  We're just days away from these results.
[3:40:51.560 --> 3:40:56.840]  I've got about two minutes left here, but is it possible that this, I mean, mistakes
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:40:58.520]  like this just don't happen?
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:00.760]  Could this be intentional as a distraction?
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:03.320]  I'm too busy dealing with this crisis in Afghanistan.
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:05.160]  We're pausing on this election deal right now.
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:06.760]  I don't want to hear about your forensic audits.
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:09.320]  Could this be on purpose?
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:14.080]  Everything that you see has always been about the 2020 elections, too.
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:15.080]  You can wrap COVID.
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:16.080]  You can wrap the artist.
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:17.880]  You can wrap this Afghanistan.
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:22.960]  And Biden says that, well, you know, he was handed over this from President Trump in May,
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:23.960]  May 1st.
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:24.960]  Trump gave a date May 1st.
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:28.480]  Well, if you know anything about President Trump, he doesn't give exact dates.
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:32.320]  If he said May 1st, it probably wasn't going to happen on May 1st.
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:35.760]  He doesn't give Opset away like Joe Biden did.
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:37.600]  President Trump understood Opset.
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:39.600]  And President Trump did have a plan.
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:42.440]  You bring out American citizens first.
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:47.720]  You bring out all of our equipment second, and then you bring out our military.
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:49.080]  That's how it should have happened.
[3:41:49.080 --> 3:41:55.000]  Joe Biden did it as back as he shut down Bargameric base, just turned over the air base to looters.
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  To looters.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  They're on our air base.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:02.640]  And that was the one air base that we actually had secured that we actually could have evacuated
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:04.400]  Americans out of.
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:05.800]  And now we don't have that.
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:06.800]  Now we have Kandahar.
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:09.880]  You know, we have really that surrounded right now.
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:13.960]  And now he wants to send back in 6,000 troops and basically a suicide mission because now
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:19.600]  we have to go back in undercover under fire basically to try to rescue these people if
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:21.440]  they can make it back to the airport.
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:23.240]  You have Britain rescuing their people.
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:25.320]  You have France going in rescue their people.
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:28.000]  Britain sitting in paratroopers rescuing their people.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  Why can't we do that?
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:30.640]  Why can't we go get our Americans?
[3:42:30.640 --> 3:42:34.600]  And yeah, I believe it's totally by design, all of it.
[3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:35.600]  Totally by design.
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:41.780]  It's a complete takeover and a demographic population transformation in key battleground
[3:42:41.780 --> 3:42:44.080]  strategic areas for Democrats.
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:45.080]  That's what they're doing here.
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:46.080]  We know that.
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:49.200]  And we're going to talk about the furtherance of that attack on Americans when we return
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:50.200]  with Chief Bell.
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:51.200]  Jerome Bell.
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:53.480]  He's a America first congressional candidate out of Virginia.
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:56.520]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show more with Chief Bell right after this.
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:42:57.520]  Stick around.
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:43:04.200]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid April, 2021, and I just want to say something.
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:08.520]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:09.520]  the years.
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:13.200]  It's truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:14.200]  listeners of this show.
[3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:17.040]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:20.680]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you got red
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:21.680]  blood.
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:26.360]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:27.360]  and sisters together.
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:32.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:35.280]  And it's crazier things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[3:43:35.280 --> 3:43:38.720]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:43.720]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:46.120]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:49.720]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:50.720]  done.
[3:43:50.720 --> 3:43:55.240]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully
[3:43:55.240 --> 3:43:57.720]  God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[3:43:57.720 --> 3:43:58.720]  God bless.
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:04.040]  So, when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:06.440]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:10.960]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:44:10.960 --> 3:44:14.400]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[3:44:14.400 --> 3:44:15.560]  And it worked pretty good.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:18.640]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too, you had, you know, with a deep
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:20.840]  burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:21.840]  So I took it.
[3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:27.880]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:31.160]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[3:44:31.160 --> 3:44:35.640]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:37.720]  take basically all of your supplements.
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:39.640]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:44:39.640 --> 3:44:44.040]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:45.040]  It's amazing.
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:46.040]  It works.
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:49.200]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  the globalist system.
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:54.320]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:55.320]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:44:55.320 --> 3:45:00.520]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:45:00.520 --> 3:45:05.360]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie
[3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:10.720]  set in the year 2020 where a world government is being established, where members of Congress
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:15.600]  and former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:21.600]  injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[3:45:21.600 --> 3:45:24.160]  to fly on an airplane.
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:26.840]  Think about that because that's where we are.
[3:45:26.840 --> 3:45:31.800]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:36.880]  be happening, but it is happening now, and then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a
[3:45:36.880 --> 3:45:40.600]  vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you've got to take it every
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:41.600]  few months.
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:45.920]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[3:45:45.920 --> 3:45:49.400]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:53.600]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[3:45:53.600 --> 3:45:56.480]  of the virus, and that's in mainline studies.
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:46:01.360]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:06.160]  You say you want to fight tyranny, you say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[3:46:06.160 --> 3:46:08.160]  I know you do, that's why you're here.
[3:46:08.160 --> 3:46:12.440]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:16.680]  are really two places in the media that don't back down and that tell the truth, that have
[3:46:16.680 --> 3:46:21.160]  great products that are self-funded, and that's infowarstore.com with the supplements, the
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:26.640]  books, the films, the water filters, the air filters, all of it, and Mike Lindell and mypillow.com.

[3:47:03.720 --> 3:47:19.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:19.080 --> 3:47:22.360]  We've talked about the military jabs, we know that they're a national security threat,
[3:47:22.360 --> 3:47:26.880]  we know it's unlawful, we know that it's completely against every single protocol that you've
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:31.080]  ever seen, and ever, I mean, we understand that when people sign up to go into the military
[3:47:31.080 --> 3:47:38.000]  that they surrender a certain right, that they subject themselves to FDA approved medicines.
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  Not to experimental jabs that are causing unprecedented deaths, I mean, and that's only
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:46.400]  in one of the 12 systems that we have happens to be the most unreliable, happens to be the
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:52.280]  least comprehensive, happens to only report 1% according to a Harvard study, but yet
[3:47:52.280 --> 3:48:00.040]  we ignore that based on one man's science and some rogue dictator, administrator Biden,
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:05.480]  up here who's being controlled and moved around and used as a puppet for these globalists
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:10.360]  at the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, all of the billionaires in the good old boy
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:14.840]  club there with George Soros, and we know what it is, we've called out their names,
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:18.120]  we've talked about the great reset, we've talked about the new world order, the prototype
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:23.120]  is Australia, these kids, everybody's being locked down, you're not, you can only exercise
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:27.200]  one hour a day there, you have to wear a mask everywhere you go, police are making arrests
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:31.080]  if you go more than one kilometer, that's a half a mile away from your house.
[3:48:31.080 --> 3:48:35.000]  There's a video on TikTok that's going around all over the place from one of these kids
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:37.800]  that was forced jabbed, was passed out, he's dead.
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:43.760]  We've never seen so much tyranny happen in this world, completely unchecked.
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:49.800]  We are a country of 350 million people, we are a world of about 7 billion people, where
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:54.320]  are all of the men in this country?
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:48:59.480]  That I think is what confuses me the most, that the absolute acceptance of all of this,
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:06.440]  the stolen election, I mean, there were people in France and Italy, people in Hungary protesting
[3:49:06.440 --> 3:49:10.600]  our stolen election more fervently than we were here on the ground.
[3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:14.600]  This tyranny is completely unchecked, we're joined by an America first candidate for US
[3:49:14.600 --> 3:49:19.000]  Congress, his name is Jerome Bell out of Virginia, he's a retired chief petty officer
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  from the Navy.
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:25.280]  Jerome, listen, how much further is this going to go?
[3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:31.320]  Do you anticipate before we see some real action, grassroots, people in the streets,
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:35.680]  or is this just, are we just looking at the end times?
[3:49:35.680 --> 3:49:39.560]  You know, I don't know where that red line is going to be drawn in the sand, my red
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:44.280]  line has been drawn a year ago, you know, I never wore a mask, I would never take the
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:49.240]  jab, you know, and so these people have to wake up.
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:53.000]  We have too many complacent people in the United States, what's going on in Australia
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  right now should be a wake up call to everybody and thank God that we have not given up our
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.160]  right to guns yet, because this would definitely be a shooting battle if this was what's going
[3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:05.600]  on, if they started to try to do what was happening in Australia.
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:11.640]  They are physically taking people's kids away from them and giving them an experimental
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:16.320]  deadly vaccine, and there's nothing those people can do about it.
[3:50:16.320 --> 3:50:22.840]  That there is the most remarkable thing I've ever seen in my lifetime, I never thought
[3:50:22.840 --> 3:50:27.600]  that I would see anything like this in my lifetime, especially here in the United States,
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:32.000]  but when this mask came out, I came out against the mask, I said the mask is going to lead
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:36.440]  to the jab, the jab is going to lead to the vaccine passports, you're going to have to
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:40.640]  show your passports or proof whatever to eat to buy your thing, yeah, it's coming, and
[3:50:40.640 --> 3:50:44.880]  it's here, Stu, and I said it a year ago, that when you capitulate and when you comply
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:48.800]  to one thing, the government and the globalists will not give you your rights back, they're
[3:50:48.800 --> 3:50:54.280]  going to add on to it, and so you see what's happening, so Stu at some point, and I don't
[3:50:54.280 --> 3:50:57.640]  know when that's going to be, but at some point, Americans have to take to the streets
[3:50:57.640 --> 3:51:00.080]  because they're not going to get our kids like that.
[3:51:00.080 --> 3:51:03.560]  These people are not going to come into our homes and to our neighborhoods to come and
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:08.040]  get our kids without being a war, and if they want a war, that's going to be the red line
[3:51:08.040 --> 3:51:10.400]  when you start coming after our children.
[3:51:10.400 --> 3:51:14.920]  They're already coming after the minds of our children, but when you start to come physically
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:19.840]  at them to give them the jab, then I think that's going to be the ignition point.
[3:51:19.840 --> 3:51:28.800]  The propaganda behind the whole plan to put that patriotism on ice, to chill that resistance
[3:51:28.800 --> 3:51:33.080]  started with, well, I mean, obviously it's been going on for decades, but out in the
[3:51:33.080 --> 3:51:37.960]  wide open with January 6th, and now we know that Roger Stone, Alex Jones, a lot of these
[3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:42.480]  people have been vindicated as the FBI is now coming out and saying, no, we couldn't
[3:51:42.480 --> 3:51:44.640]  find that there was really any plan here.
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:49.240]  Well, yeah, we said that, we've been saying that, that there was no plan here, that the
[3:51:49.240 --> 3:51:54.600]  only plan was by the deep state and by Nancy Pelosi's Gestapo, and the only violence that
[3:51:54.600 --> 3:51:58.360]  was committed there was at her direction, and this was orchestrated by the FBI.
[3:51:58.360 --> 3:52:03.720]  The FBI infiltrated inside of here and turned us around, but the point is that this was
[3:52:03.720 --> 3:52:09.840]  used to scare Americans into inaction, to put the fear of God into them where they're
[3:52:09.840 --> 3:52:12.280]  not going to say anything, they're not going to oppose anything, they're not going to raise
[3:52:12.280 --> 3:52:15.440]  any flags anymore, they're certainly not going to go gather in large groups, they're not
[3:52:15.440 --> 3:52:19.280]  going to be out in the street because God, they could be jailed and they could be left
[3:52:19.280 --> 3:52:24.920]  in some solitary confinement with misdemeanor charges for God knows how long, and now we
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:29.280]  see this DHS bulletin coming out to law enforcement agencies advertised all over the place that
[3:52:29.280 --> 3:52:34.680]  if you question the response to COVID, or if you question the 2020 election, you could
[3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:38.800]  be considered to be a terrorist, I mean, where does it stop?
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:42.520]  You have to believe that this is fixable because you're running for Congress.
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:43.840]  So how is it fixed?
[3:52:43.840 --> 3:52:44.840]  I mean, where do we start?
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:49.640]  Well, it's going to start with the people, you know, and January 6 was definitely not
[3:52:49.640 --> 3:52:53.680]  an insurrection, you know, and that is coming out and what they're doing, they're backtracking
[3:52:53.680 --> 3:52:58.400]  because they're covering their asses, to be honest, because it's coming out that the FBI,
[3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:03.160]  they had infiltrators, they ran the operation on January 6.
[3:53:03.160 --> 3:53:07.120]  The Revolver News has done an excellent job and they're bringing that out, there's one
[3:53:07.120 --> 3:53:09.880]  of the news outlets that's bringing that out.
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:14.920]  So these, they had infiltrators and they had operators underground, the FBI and these
[3:53:14.920 --> 3:53:21.720]  other alphabets, I would say, you know, alphabet entities, but you know, these prisoners that
[3:53:21.720 --> 3:53:25.560]  they have, these political prisoners that they have locked up, they need to be released
[3:53:25.560 --> 3:53:27.680]  immediately, immediately.
[3:53:27.680 --> 3:53:33.040]  And not only that, Stu, when we signed the NDAA, then the Patriot Act, and I opposed
[3:53:33.040 --> 3:53:38.880]  that 2014 or 2000, before that, 2012, 2014, I said then, I said, this is going to be used
[3:53:38.880 --> 3:53:40.280]  against the American people.
[3:53:40.280 --> 3:53:45.000]  They called it the Patriot Act for a reason, not the Patriot Act to go after terrorists.
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:48.280]  They called it the Patriot Act because it's going to be used against patriots here in
[3:53:48.280 --> 3:53:49.560]  the United States.
[3:53:49.560 --> 3:53:53.320]  And once again, we're here, you know, and I said that years ago.
[3:53:53.320 --> 3:53:58.360]  But another for Congress to definitely try to stop that, and that's what I say, 2022,
[3:53:58.360 --> 3:54:05.240]  if we don't get the majority of American first, America first Patriots into Congress and into
[3:54:05.240 --> 3:54:11.200]  the Senate and get out and get out these rhinos and these Democrats, then, you know, our bets
[3:54:11.200 --> 3:54:15.800]  are off, our bets are off after 2022, you know, we have these people need to look past,
[3:54:15.800 --> 3:54:19.760]  you know, President Trump on the 2024, no, we need to find out what happened in the elections
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:20.760]  2020.
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:21.760]  We know what happened.
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:22.760]  We've been talking about it.
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:26.560]  It needs to be brought out to the American people and these people that committed treason
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:27.560]  in the United States.
[3:54:27.560 --> 3:54:28.560]  They need to be tried.
[3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:33.320]  They need to be arrested, tried and fried and put on public display, just like they
[3:54:33.320 --> 3:54:36.760]  tried to put these, these pages on display January 6th.
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:41.480]  The people that have committed fraud and they helped in this coup of the United States needs
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:44.880]  to be put on trial.
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:51.560]  You know, there are so many people with platforms that tiptoe around this and I don't know why,
[3:54:51.560 --> 3:54:57.360]  but if President Trump had called for an armed insurrection, they would have got it.
[3:54:57.360 --> 3:55:00.040]  They would have seen what a real action looks like.
[3:55:00.040 --> 3:55:04.360]  There would have been no doubt they would have got it because there are 150 million
[3:55:04.360 --> 3:55:08.240]  gun owners that would have been there and there would have been some problems there.
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:09.480]  I said it.
[3:55:09.480 --> 3:55:10.680]  That was not an insurrection.
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:15.240]  You're seeing an insurrection happening in Afghanistan right now, that Taliban is doing
[3:55:15.240 --> 3:55:19.040]  what we could call an insurrection right now and the only insurrection that I can think
[3:55:19.040 --> 3:55:22.680]  of in recent times that has happened here in this country happened overnight between
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:27.680]  November 3rd and November 4th when a successful coup d'etat was implemented, the political
[3:55:27.680 --> 3:55:33.720]  assassination of a sitting president after multiple failed and false phony lies and a
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:36.080]  charade called an impeachment.
[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:40.760]  We know exactly what happened and the fact that these media conglomerates out here won't
[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:43.440]  talk about that makes them complicit as well.
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:46.960]  All of them, every single one of them, and there is not a gatekeeper that's gonna be
[3:55:46.960 --> 3:55:47.960]  safe for me.
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:50.360]  I will come after all of them and I bet you will too.
[3:55:50.360 --> 3:55:52.720]  Final minute, you're running for Congress.
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:55:53.720]  Make your plea.
[3:55:53.720 --> 3:55:56.800]  Yeah, I'm running for Congress from the United States.
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:56:00.280]  I'm going after all of them too, whether it's Democrats, whether it's rhinos, I'm going
[3:56:00.280 --> 3:56:03.560]  after all of them because what happened definitely was a coup d'etat and you're only gonna find
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:08.920]  a handful of people like you and myself stew that's gonna call it the way it really is
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:10.720]  and the way it really happened.
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:15.240]  So if people wanna join my fight, I'm calling it the new conservative revolution, not this
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:18.040]  old conservatism, not this old Republican party.
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:22.200]  I'm calling for a new conservative revolution of black conservatives, white conservatives,
[3:56:22.200 --> 3:56:26.240]  Asians that's gonna come together and take this country back because we have these faceless
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:30.920]  rhinos and these faceless Democrats that's only hungry for power and they're controlled
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:36.160]  by the CCP, they're controlled by the globalist and they think that they're gonna be safe.
[3:56:36.160 --> 3:56:37.640]  They're not safe either.
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:38.640]  They're not gonna be safe.
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:39.760]  We're gonna come after you.
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:46.080]  We're gonna get you out of office and if it comes down to what they really want then they're
[3:56:46.080 --> 3:56:49.520]  gonna get that too, whatever that is and I'm not gonna say because I don't want people
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:53.840]  to say I'm trying to cause an insurrection in the United States because I'm not.
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:58.880]  I would rather have to rather this not be violent but we need to get this country back
[3:56:58.880 --> 3:57:03.200]  and if people wanna help me and donate to my campaign so I can stay in the fight, you
[3:57:03.200 --> 3:57:12.120]  go to dronebellforcongress.com join the fight, join this new conservative revolution, let's
[3:57:12.120 --> 3:57:17.280]  take this country back because we have less than two years to really take this country
[3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:20.920]  back or we're gonna lose it forever Stu.
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:27.760]  Thank you for talking real talk and for speaking plain USDA choice died in the wool thoroughbred
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:28.760]  patriotism.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:30.640]  I'm gonna bleed it and I can tell brother you have my support.
[3:57:30.640 --> 3:57:32.880]  Dronebell, thank you very much.
[3:57:32.880 --> 3:57:35.160]  The war room is up next with Owen Schreuer.
[3:57:35.160 --> 3:57:36.720]  Do not be black pilled.
[3:57:36.720 --> 3:57:37.960]  Do not let this get you down.
[3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:40.760]  Remember this is a big country and you are the majority.
