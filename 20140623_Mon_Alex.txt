[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:40.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:50.000]  I did a lot of research last night on the different trends taking place in the world after I completed my Sunday evening radio transmission.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  And then this morning I got up at about 6 a.m. and I did a research for several hours.
[00:56.000 --> 01:05.000]  But then driving into work when you're calm and not on the telephone or not looking over stacks of news,
[01:05.000 --> 01:15.000]  it just hit me that I needed to calmly try to take a deep breath and come on air and break down the big picture.
[01:15.000 --> 01:26.000]  I know we talk about the big overall view of the world by the globalist versus the general public and humanity,
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  but it's important to really state where we are currently in the history of the world.
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  So I want to talk a few minutes about that at the start of the next segment and then obviously go through all of the news.
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  And I've talked a lot about this on air, but it's a phenomenon that happens that I've somehow got to dominate in myself.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  I've got to change.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  The broadcast is informative.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  I have a lot of passion.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  I speak from the heart.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's not scripted.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  I have a pretty good grasp on the geopolitical systems and how they really work.
[02:02.000 --> 02:16.000]  But at the same time, sometimes I drive a little too fast and end up wrecking the car on the way to trying to get the pole position
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  and then the checkered flag.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I think we all do that.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  But I got so angry yesterday on the Sunday broadcast, I had invited David Knight down here to be on for one segment
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  and ended up having him on base of the whole show and Kit Daniels down on the border, he'll be back on today with us giving us an update.
[02:32.000 --> 02:41.000]  I started yelling and screaming and talking over everyone and hyperventilating and literally yelling and screaming during the breaks.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  I mean, it's not an act.
[02:44.000 --> 02:57.000]  And it's because I sit here studying the globalist day after day, hour after hour, week after week, month after month, year after year, dreaming about it as well,
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  seeing it threaten my family, seeing the social engineering destroying my world, your world, seeing the psychological rot,
[03:05.000 --> 03:15.000]  expanding not just with my own eyes, but I can see the digital readout metrics of it in society all across the planet.
[03:15.000 --> 03:26.000]  And I realize the reason I'm so disgusted is that I'm beyond anger and hatred of the New World Order now.
[03:26.000 --> 03:38.000]  I look at these people and they are just giant piles of stinking garbage.
[03:38.000 --> 03:50.000]  And I know they're weak and I know they're pathetic and I know how they're programmed and I know how their substratas operate.
[03:50.000 --> 03:59.000]  And it's very frustrating as an individual that I can't flip the levers to reverse what they're doing.
[03:59.000 --> 04:14.000]  And it's a very sickening feeling, the opposite of empowering to realize that I'm smarter and better than even most of the establishment operatives.
[04:14.000 --> 04:26.000]  And that they're so weak they've chosen evil, but they've got such a jump on us long term, building these systems of artificiality and false consciousness, false reality,
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  that they themselves are just programmed biological androids.
[04:31.000 --> 04:43.000]  And it's then frustrating to have to focus on them all day and that they become the center of our world when there's this incredible universe all around us.
[04:43.000 --> 04:54.000]  But I know the way to beat them and that is to set the brush fires of liberty in the minds of men and women everywhere and we will overthrow this humanizing system together.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  The only question is how painful will it be?
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  On average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  It is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment is not going to do it.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[05:59.000 --> 06:09.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot. It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[06:09.000 --> 06:20.000]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[06:20.000 --> 06:30.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the earth.
[06:30.000 --> 06:38.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today. It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  Experience the new formula. Experience the ancient purity.

[07:20.000 --> 07:29.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[07:29.000 --> 07:37.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[07:41.000 --> 07:50.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[07:58.000 --> 08:08.000]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[08:08.000 --> 08:37.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[08:38.000 --> 09:05.000]  It is Monday, the 23rd day, ladies and gentlemen, of June 2014. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, always thought-provoking, always informative.
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  We're going to have David Ike joining us via video Skype from his TV network studios in the second hour today.
[09:22.000 --> 09:31.000]  That said, I want to just pull back here at the beginning of the broadcast and look at the big picture.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  And then I want to go over the stacks of news that we have here in front of us.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  This is just the top of the stack. Some of these stacks have upwards of 30 stories in them.
[09:42.000 --> 09:51.000]  And that's why I get wound up and sometimes start the broadcast yelling and screaming because I'm immersed in seeing what the globalists are doing.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  It's 100% crystal clear what their plans are. They're all stated on record.
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  And that's what hit me this morning is that their program, their operation is so public.
[10:06.000 --> 10:18.000]  And they don't even bother hiding it because the general public has been raised under mainstream media and sports and things that don't matter.
[10:18.000 --> 10:28.000]  And trendiness in Hollywood to the point of living in a false reality with a near false consciousness,
[10:28.000 --> 10:39.000]  a super ego-induced form of artificial narcissism disorder, whatever particular name you want to give it,
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.000]  to where the public is living in false reality like a five-year-old girl dressed up like a fairy princess
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  imagining she's a princess and really delusionally believing that she's a fairy princess
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  when she's playing on the back porch.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  Now that's normal and healthy for a three, four, five-year-old girl to do.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  It's not for a 40-year-old woman.
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  That's completely normal and natural for a five-year-old boy to imagine he's Superman or Batman on the back porch
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  jumping around fighting with his friends or imagining he's a Jedi Knight with toy lightsabers.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  It is not the case for adults.
[11:21.000 --> 11:32.000]  We're meant to imagine art types of being a warrior or being a scientist or being a soldier or playing house.
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  But if a 35-year-old woman has a toy refrigerator and toy onions and tomatoes and toy bread and toy butter,
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  you say, that's a crazy woman if they're playing with it believing they're really doing it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  And when I say I want to pull back and give you the big picture, I haven't really studied psychology officially.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  I took a few courses of it in college.
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  I've read a lot of books on it, a lot of history books where I learn real psychology the way humans really operate.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  And modern psychology is very politicized.
[12:03.000 --> 12:12.000]  And you've got pop psychology that the general public is basically fed on at the trough, which isn't real psychology at all.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  But when you get into the real schools of German and British and US psychology and Russian psychology and psychiatry,
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  there's a real science there because the elite want to know how to control populations.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  And the approximations and systems they have that aren't political on the surface or aren't pop.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  Like there's political psychology saying if you oppose big government, you're mentally ill.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  Or if you think there's corruption in government, you're schizophrenic.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  You have psychosis. You're nuts. You're insane.
[12:47.000 --> 12:57.000]  That Soviet style or fascist style, political approximation, and any real psychologist or psychiatrist knows that.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  It's all very political.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  Then you've got pop psychology.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  They put magazines and stuff in the general public.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  It has no relation to what's really going on.
[13:08.000 --> 13:20.000]  But as a layman, I already noticed people would imagine they were tough and would imagine they were going to start a fight with you.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  And they were going to beat you up until the real fight started.
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  Or guys would imagine they were a rodeo star and would imagine they knew how to throw a lariat, a lasso,
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  and they would hang it in the back of their truck, even though they didn't know how to do it.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  It's called being a poser.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  And I remember being three, four years old playing Batman and Robin on my front porch and clicking and thinking,
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  this is pathetic. I'm not really Batman or Robin.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  I've got all this geopolitical news, all this incredible breaking stuff.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  It's just that I want to get the general public out there to come out of their trance.
[14:01.000 --> 14:10.000]  Now, I've since gone and studied psychology, the real psychology that the PhDs and people read, that the social engineers use.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Not the psychologists you talk to down the street.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  And they know full well what they've done.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  They've used television in Hollywood to induce men into a false reality of sports and superheroes and comic books,
[14:25.000 --> 14:34.000]  arrested development, and they've induced women into a fake feminist mode that they're dominant and they're taking over
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  and they're independent and they've got all this power and they don't need men and they're going to be beautiful.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  But the husband in the state is their husband.
[14:45.000 --> 14:54.000]  That is, the state is their husband and their facsimile is following fake, trendy programs because they never had an identity.
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  And I realize from birth in front of the television being programmed,
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  first they put out programming in the 40s, 50s, and 60s where everyone was happy and everything was great.
[15:07.000 --> 15:16.000]  And dad was good and mom was good and everybody was straight and strong and America was perfect to get people into a comfort zone trusting the state.
[15:16.000 --> 15:27.000]  Then they began to roll in by the 70s the cultural destroying systems once they had people in a trance and now they're going into pure programming,
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  preparing people for the nanny state and the end of civilization and humanity as we know it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:43.000]  And it's all completely programmed and it's only a select group of globalist technocrats, social engineers, political scientists that know about it and control it
[15:43.000 --> 15:53.000]  and they've all written books about it, not giving all of it away but much of it to be able to understand how to run the system.
[15:53.000 --> 16:09.000]  They need to give some of the Promethean satanic fire of evil, human control, social control, free will destruction to their subsect minions to be able to carry out the great work.
[16:09.000 --> 16:20.000]  The shackling of humanity, the shuddering of humanity, the great pulling down by the Lillipullian control freaks of the great titan that is free humanity.
[16:20.000 --> 16:37.000]  The great conquering, the great destruction, like a hunter gets on a power trip when he lets the bull elephant charging and then shoots the elephant in the chest with the high powered rifle
[16:37.000 --> 16:49.000]  and watches the elephant fall into its knees and slide like a locomotive coming to a halt in a pile of dirt, like a bullet fired into a sand bank.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  That's what all of this is about.
[16:51.000 --> 17:08.000]  In George Arwell, a.k.a. George Arwell, Eric Blair, who was a top scyop officer in OSS, who before that was an imperial secret police officer, who before that was a deep cover OSS communist infiltrator,
[17:08.000 --> 17:21.000]  he gave it away in a allegory, the parable of 1984, when Winston is tearing his teeth out with pliers and torturing him for several months.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  He said, listen, I could have just killed you.
[17:23.000 --> 17:34.000]  It's about breaking your soul and having you be delusional because you were a great man, Winston, and it's about our cult of power, annihilating goodness and humanity and justice and truth.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  We're going to stop you to hell.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.000]  Nothing will stop the satanic total release.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  That's their spirit.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  And I'm able to tune into the enemy, folks.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  That's why I'm able to understand their operations.
[17:47.000 --> 17:53.000]  I can tune into their wavelength and I can read their books where they tell you what they're going to do.
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.000]  Orwell was completely freaked out about it when he finally, as even a high level officer, clicked to it all when he was brought into the Fabian Socialist.
[18:01.000 --> 18:13.000]  He said, man, we're Satan worshippers, bro. We're going to kill the plan is mass death hell razor, black uniforms, burning cities, and finally, burning the earth to a crisp.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  We're going to murder everybody.
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  We're going to do it slow, though.
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  You want to see the future?
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  So we've had a discussion now about the big picture.
[18:26.000 --> 18:39.000]  While you're running around imagining you're a fairy princess when you're 45 years old and while your husband thinks he's manly and struts around other guys, puts on the ball game and does everything,
[18:39.000 --> 18:51.000]  a giant psych warfare positronic multi layered system is assaulting your DNA, your children, poison in the food and water all on record, hitting you and hitting you hard.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  And you're all delusional.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  I mean, general portray us all of them.
[18:55.000 --> 19:08.000]  If you think you're going to escape this system and that you're going to be given the true life extension by the elites.
[19:08.000 --> 19:15.000]  I looked into Dick Cheney's eyes and I see someone who's scared and had his soul basically sucked out.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  And all he knows how to do is act calm and act like he's in control of a situation.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  Dick Cheney, despite the fact he's been given an advanced life extension.
[19:24.000 --> 19:33.000]  He's got a big PR facade up that he got standard care and anybody can get this bull crap.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  He's out there saying ready for a giant new terror attack.
[19:35.000 --> 19:46.000]  Oh, I bet death trains loaded with tens of thousands of illegals pour across as the North American Union is officially founded on the ashes of the old Republic.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  That's all coming up masses of news today.
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  But I want to pull back one more segment, give you the geopolitical analysis of where we are currently.
[19:55.000 --> 20:24.000]  I'm Alex Jones.

[20:58.000 --> 21:25.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  If you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.

[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  Now again, I've been talking about that for almost 20 years. When I was first discussing it, it sounded like something from Mars.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  Now it's all over Discovery Channel, History Channel, all over Wired Magazine, all over the news being announced like it's a foregone conclusion.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  Humans will merge with machines and no longer be homo sapiens sapien by 2035.
[24:43.000 --> 24:53.000]  It's going to be great. You're going to live forever. You like NASA and GATT, you're going to love this. You love to Obamacare, you're going to love this. You like the Iraq war, you're going to love this.
[24:53.000 --> 25:00.000]  You like government run healthcare, you're going to love this. The globalists want to suppress the general public having access to all this.
[25:00.000 --> 25:09.000]  And I know I restate this every week. It's because the general public has been induced to care about things that don't matter, to live in a false reality,
[25:09.000 --> 25:18.000]  and then laugh with their programming, ah, you're a conspiracy theorist, to knowledge that they don't know about because they're so ignorant.
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.000]  That's the little defense mechanism that they're given. But now they're beginning to see that, oh wait, this new world order is real.
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.000]  So that's the good news is most people don't laugh at this or make jokes anymore.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  But they come up to me and they say, what are we going to do about it?
[25:34.000 --> 25:41.000]  Well, first off, most people who think they're awake don't really know how big it is.
[25:41.000 --> 25:53.000]  Or they'll have a attitude like, well, you know, this is just part of evolution and this is the way it is.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  Imagine a general population that believes they don't affect the future.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  That's called believing you're disempowered on every front.
[26:04.000 --> 26:13.000]  When the animating contest is taking place to decide the future and you have incredible power, that's why they're telling you you don't have power.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  But what they're currently doing, and then I'm going to come back with a really big news.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  Dick Cheney, you know, is saying, get ready for terror attacks.
[26:22.000 --> 26:30.000]  So we're going to get nuked, Obama, Dianne Feinstein saying get ready because I want to know where they're going next.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  Let me just tell you briefly where we are currently.
[26:33.000 --> 26:42.000]  If you read the BAMP Canada documents that were from 2006, Judicial Watch Sue 2007, it's in my film Endgame.
[26:42.000 --> 26:54.000]  They say in the meeting with the top 200 CEOs of the world plus meeting in round table events with the leaders, the Secretary of States, presidents, prime ministers and others there.
[26:54.000 --> 27:04.000]  And then the corporations would vote officially in the North American Union agreement that Bush had signed two years before at Baylor in Waco in a secret ceremony with a Sente Fox.
[27:04.000 --> 27:13.000]  That document's still secret, but in the minutes, imagine a secret North American Union that no one's ever been able to see except the front page.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  The front page says we have officially merged Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  Our militaries will interchange, we'll help each other with insurrections.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  That was then put in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act two years later, 2007.
[27:24.000 --> 27:32.000]  It's all official. It's all global law, totally illegitimate, but they're moving forward with it.
[27:32.000 --> 27:42.000]  You see, they're just doing it because the government is now under its control and the big corporate CEO bosses would vote and then they would give the quote,
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  recommendation and administrative law to the governing heads of the countries, usually secretaries of state or their counterpart.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  Hundreds of them were there and then they returned and began implementing it full speed ahead.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  Why?
[27:56.000 --> 28:04.000]  Because if they implement it, they all get corporate junkets, they all get corporate payoffs, they have revolving doors and they get a place in the global government.
[28:04.000 --> 28:11.000]  That's why anybody will tell you, even in main line political publications that no one wants to be at the state level or the federal,
[28:11.000 --> 28:19.000]  they want to be at the international, the IMF, the World Bank, the UN, the International Bank of Settlements, the EU,
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  because you literally have diplomatic immunity, you don't pay taxes, you're above the law.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  Look it up. This is the new royalty. They have established this.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  Obama presses North American Union with Mexico, Canada.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  Look, there's the headline from February of this year with him saying North American Union.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  See, they're uncloking. They deny, they deny, they deny, it's going on.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  Oh, these crazies think the police track your cell phones in real time.
[28:47.000 --> 28:53.000]  I said that in a 2003 film, The Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul in a speech.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  The film is built around those speeches.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  And I said, every cell phone is tracked in real time with the police, but they're not allowed to tell you.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  But I've talked to high level people at the threat fusion centers and seen the documents.
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  And the governor of Wisconsin slipped up and admitted it once.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  Here's the article.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  Everything's in live time.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  They hit one button.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  They listen to you in your car or in your house.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  Boom.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  That's now in the New York Times.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  Last week, it's in the Columbia Journalism Review.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  Today, local cops can track your phone without a warrant and the government doesn't want you to know how.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  Well, it's got a satellite triangulator through the cell towers down to three feet.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  I mean, how do you think they do it?
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  I told you in 1996.
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  And again, you need to listen to me, folks.
[29:34.000 --> 29:45.000]  There are cancer viruses in the vaccine that embed in your DNA to trigger it when hormone levels go down to kill you.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  I mean, you're evil.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  I mean, what am I first talking about?
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  We're in March.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  And it's always fun to just throw in, by the way, there's cancer viruses.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  They're murdering everyone.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  You're being murdered.
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  The government is murdering scum, murdering killers, OK?
[29:59.000 --> 30:05.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[30:05.000 --> 30:10.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[30:23.000 --> 30:31.000]  Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth and deep earth crystals.
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  This is innovating.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation,
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  promoting true libertarian ideas.

[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[31:01.000 --> 31:09.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.000]  sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet,
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say that was good stuff.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others,
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[31:58.000 --> 32:03.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[32:30.000 --> 32:36.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  It's time to take action.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  It's time to filter our water.

[32:58.000 --> 33:23.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:23.000 --> 33:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  Here's the big picture and then I'm getting into the news.
[33:33.000 --> 33:41.000]  In their own words, the globalists see humanity as a wild, out-of-control, ugly, deformed scourge
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  of 7.5 billion people that must be controlled, engineered, and prepared to be phased out
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  because the new technologies are coming and the elite are going to live in this Elysium type
[33:52.000 --> 34:00.000]  of heavenly moon raker meets Zarda's world.
[34:00.000 --> 34:07.000]  And again, I know our listeners know that, but we have to get the message of end-game
[34:07.000 --> 34:17.000]  blueprint for global enslavement that is already a 7-year-old film out to everyone.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  Because that documentary is even more powerful now and freaks people out when they learned
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  it was made in 2007 because just what we said would happen within that time frame happened
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  in the film and then we go further in the film and tell you what's going to come after that.
[34:32.000 --> 34:40.000]  Because the globalists have a blueprint and they just tell the unwashed masses that nothing exists.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  Fluoride's good for you, there's nothing bad in the vaccines, no one's listening to you,
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  no one's tracking you, I love you, I love you, welcome to Costco, I love you.
[34:50.000 --> 34:57.000]  To quote idiocracy.
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.000]  The public is being stunned and dumbed down in preparation because the elite openly are moving
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  and that's why they're collapsing the border because they have treaties, they have secret agreements,
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  much of them public and just as General Petraeus said in the London Telegraph last Wednesday
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  we covered here, they said what comes after America?
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  In a public symposium and he said North America.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  And that means North America, not where a Mexico evolves becomes a freer state and Canada does
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  and with high tech it just becomes we're all open.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  No, no, no, we become a giant Mexico city.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  We become a giant failed system forcing the compact cities while the elites live in high tech reservations
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  in the beautiful countryside.
[35:43.000 --> 35:51.000]  That's their model with ground based Elysiums.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  It's all being thrown in your face with predictive programming.
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  And this is the debate we should be having.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  And now they're moving on every front.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  I've told you over and over again as we come towards this flash point you're going to start seeing
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  major proxy wars, major dollar devaluation, major global currency devaluations,
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  building on the crisis while the globalists ride the crises they've helped create and exacerbate
[36:18.000 --> 36:27.000]  into global governance, world taxes, world regulations on the ashes of what was there.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  You'll still have euros, you'll still have dollars, you'll still have yens, you'll still have yons.
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's all globally based in an SDR strategic drawing right based system that the globalist control
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  and most importantly tax.
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.000]  They don't just want the power to issue and control the currency and be able to buy the world up with it.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  It's a magic trick like an unlimited credit card.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  The Federal Reserve which is the European bank front here in the United States, the Rothschild bank front on record
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  has an unlimited credit card but it's even better.
[36:59.000 --> 37:05.000]  They get all the goods and all the ideas and all the treasure and all the real estate and all the treasure
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  hordes and all the art, you get the debt.
[37:08.000 --> 37:19.000]  When you bank or mail out them, you suddenly are their debtor in Spain or the United States.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  That's why there's now in the Fed rallies all over Europe where they call it in the Fed.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  They call their private banks the Fed knowing it's the same octopus.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  You can read that article up on infowars.com.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  Giant ones everywhere.
[37:32.000 --> 37:40.000]  People in Europe know because they're in the depression in Spain and Portugal and Greece and Ireland
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  and everywhere else.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  They now know ladies and gentlemen.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  And so as all of this unfolds, as all of these crises accelerate,
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  the globalists are setting up the police state to try to suppress the public
[37:55.000 --> 38:05.000]  but that's not going to work if the public looks past Obama, past Boehner, past Cameron, past Merkel,
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  past all of these puppets to the globalists that of course they want to meet in secret.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  Of course they don't want you to know what they're up to in doing and just say there is no global government.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  There is no man behind the curtain.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  Move along. These aren't the droids you're looking for because then that forces a debate and it's game over.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  Everything is in this article.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  If you understand this headline, you understand reality.
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  And see, I'm suddenly seeing newspapers everywhere, even the New York Times, even the Wall Street Journal, go,
[38:34.000 --> 38:43.000]  did you know that the DEA creates fake cases and fake witnesses because they're really listening to everything in live time
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  and when they bust drug dealers, they don't want the public to know they're in the NSA.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  And so they then create a fake case for the indictment.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  But they don't even want to do that now.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  They're just getting the federal courts to rule.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  They can listen without warrants to everybody.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  See, but the bigger story is the sheep holes say, well, you know, they're doing that to keep us safe from drugs.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  They only bust the cowboys, the small level operators.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  The whole system is again to create monopolies and markets.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  So the globalists control the issuance of the currency and credit, but more importantly, with the new global SDR,
[39:18.000 --> 39:26.000]  they want 100 trillion in taxes per decade in one Tobin digital money use transfer.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  Once they make you go cashless like Israel and England have both announced they're forcing cashless phased in within five years.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  They're penalizing cash billboards saying it's dirty and bad.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  Why are they getting rid of it?
[39:37.000 --> 39:43.000]  Because they don't need cash for black market anymore because they'll just digitally ignore their black market.
[39:43.000 --> 39:52.000]  They want to shut you down and track everything you do and be able to raise taxes at levels to where you can't stop anything they're doing.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  Go read the article info wars.com.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  UK begins beta testing, casual society.
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  That's why the ultimate sin will be selling oranges or watermelons on the side of the road or corn.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  The ultimate sin will be buying cheese from Amish.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  The ultimate sin will be eliminate stand.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  As the media says, we're talking arrest.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  You don't do it because they're going to shut everything down.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  You've seen beef prices more than double.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  You've seen overall meat prices up 40 plus percent in the last year.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  You go into a diner.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  It used to be 10 bucks to eat.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  It's 20 now.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  You know why?
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  They're devaluing the dollar and they're shutting down the farms and ranches everywhere.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  You can't do business.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  You can't survive.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  It's all rigged.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Beef prices are record cost.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  You'd think ranchers would be rich.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  It's all rigged with the computers.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  There aren't real auctions anymore.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  How to stack a news on that yesterday?
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  We guys pull out the stack where the World Bank sounds alarm on sharp rising global food prices, AFP.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  What does that mean?
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  It means there'll be riots.
[40:53.000 --> 41:00.000]  There'll be revolution with the globalist controlling and steering the social networks to shut down the revolutions they don't want
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  and to push the communist and socialist ones they do, which get people deeper into the trap.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  Consumer price rise sharply in May.
[41:09.000 --> 41:16.000]  The feds say it jumped 0.4 after rising 0.3 in April.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  Does anyone believe it only went up 0.4 in a month and 0.3 before that?
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  Does anyone believe in the last year it went up 2.1 percent?
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  Food prices, ladies and gentlemen, are exploding.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  And again, the media is like, it's good you're poor now.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  It lowers your carbon footprint.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's good all this is happening.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  It's good everybody can't, you know, it has to carpool or can't afford to go to the park anymore.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  But they built us in sprawl where we won't survive now as they turn us off.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  It's designed to destroy us, not to make us more efficient.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  That's why Petraeus, you know, said it's good that we're bringing in all these illegals.
[41:58.000 --> 42:05.000]  We need a bigger population because you kill 53 million Americans with abortion.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  So you replace them with unskilled women with three or four kids or people with diseases?
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  No, no, they're meant to be attached as welfare queens to then become part of the new political class to bankrupt the country.
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  We have the documents, not just Cloward and Piven, but a June of 21.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  But see, when he goes and talks to a group of sub-globalists, the political right wing in England,
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  Petraeus says, North American Union's the future and we need immigrants to build us up.
[42:30.000 --> 42:41.000]  Yeah, immigrants we do need, but not to be put directly on the government trough to bankrupt things further.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  Central American migrants are on a word of mouth exodus to the U.S.
[42:46.000 --> 42:54.000]  Word of mouth, Biden just said they're going to legalize yesterday and give citizenship as Dream Act to all the kids.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  Who begin? Children of the state. Women.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  He run into trendy women and they're just literally, I don't need men. I don't like men.
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  I'm going to be successful. Defeating men makes me successful.
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  Oh yes, what a way to run a society.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  They just told black women 50 years ago, we'll give you a check if there's no man in the house.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  She didn't like it, but she did it.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  Now the women are like, there's no man here. That's right, there'll be no man there and he won't have you either.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  When you're 65 years old, they're euthanizing your butt.
[43:29.000 --> 43:35.000]  And now single mothers are turning to online prostitution as that's the only way they can make money.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  In fact, all these government state employees getting laid off, that's what they're turning to.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  You see, oh, wasn't it all a great plan they had?
[43:42.000 --> 43:49.000]  Isolating us, making us artificial narcissists, artificial sociopaths, breaking us down.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  And so now they're going to move. You're about to see globally, in fact, you're beginning to see it,
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  the proxy wars in Russia, the proxy wars in Europe, the proxy wars in East Asia,
[44:00.000 --> 44:06.000]  the proxy wars in South Asia, the proxy wars in the Middle East, the proxy wars in Africa,
[44:06.000 --> 44:18.000]  and the public is so dumbed down that Dick Cheney and Diane Feinstein and all the usual suspects can say,
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.000]  see, we do need checkpoints in Homeland Security and increased funding.
[44:23.000 --> 44:30.000]  We need to continue all these programs that take your rights because Al Qaeda is everywhere.
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  And Cheney went on to say there's a whole bunch of groups worse than ISIS.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  Don't worry about Iraq, don't blame him for that.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  No, no, no, there's all these new groups.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  Yeah, out of Saudi Arabia, funded by our government NATO, the door opened.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  Of course, Obama's in the news today saying there's no amount of American firepower
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  that's going to be able to hold the country together.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Obama takes another step back from military action.
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  They will say, oh, he mismanaged.
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  Oh, he let the Al Qaeda group that they changed the name to ISIS.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  It's still Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda flags, but oh, Al Qaeda's not a problem.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  The Tea Party's the main enemy.
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  And ISIS isn't a big deal either because, you know, they have a new name.
[45:08.000 --> 45:15.000]  And only Rand Paul has the courage to come out and say, no, our government helped create ISIS.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  We're going to play a clip of that coming up.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  But that's the issue here.
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  You see, it's so sensational that they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  Just type in polio vaccine cancer virus.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  And then you look at the new vaccines, they keep finding them in there.
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  They just so happen to be extremely virulent and just so happen to be time released
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  because it's all designed that way.
[45:36.000 --> 45:43.000]  They estimate 100 million Americans died from cancers related to the polio vaccine.
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  On purpose, by the way, boys and girls.
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.000]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, again, I just keep throwing that out to remember who we're under.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Remember, remember what happened?
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  We now learn a few decades ago in Ireland with thousands of children
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  given experimental vaccines that were actually kill shots to kill them, violent deaths,
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  and then throw them into a giant septic tank to rot.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  Oh, we have good guys running things. No, we don't.
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  And they can run al-Qaeda publicly and turn Iraq over to it
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  and then act like they didn't fund them in armament Syria.
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  And our media can say, time for the prime minister of Iraq to step down.
[46:24.000 --> 46:30.000]  Openly, our government using al-Qaeda as a proxy army, they can get away with anything.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  And they'll get away with nuking a major U.S. city down the road.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  I predict that they may do that, that it's in the cards.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  I predict they're contemplating it.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  I predicted they would start saying their biggest fear was a nuke going off in Manhattan.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  And Obama came out in March and said just that.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  Didn't even say who he thought would do it, because that's how they take full control.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  If you're the globalist who want to conquer America, how do you do it?
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  You stage a giant horrible attack, claim the Tea Party's working with al-Qaeda.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  Told you that was coming years ago.
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  Now they say the Tea Party works with al-Qaeda in Pentagon training drills to take over North Carolina.
[47:04.000 --> 47:11.000]  That's the Forbes magazine.
[47:11.000 --> 47:17.000]  Now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we have Diane Feinstein saying we're going to be killed
[47:17.000 --> 47:23.000]  and that there will be people to disrupt a plot in this country.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  So we need her.
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  We need her to save us from the terrorists they publicly run.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  So let's go ahead first and go to Dick Cheney saying another 9-11 is coming, but far deadlier.
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.000]  And I agree. Far deadlier because the people that control him, he's just their little emissary, the mouth of Sauron.
[47:41.000 --> 47:48.000]  The mouth of Sauron is telling you you better be afraid and subconsciously we know the threat's real because we know who's behind it.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  Let's go to it.
[47:49.000 --> 47:58.000]  If we spend our time debating what happened 11 or 12 years ago, we're going to miss the threat that is growing and that we do face.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  Rand Paul with all due respect is basically an isolationist.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  He doesn't believe we ought to be involved in that part of the world.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  I think it's absolutely essential.
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  One of the things I worried about 12 years ago and that I worry about today is that there will be another 9-11 attack
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  and that the next time it'll be with weapons far deadlier than airline tickets and box scatter.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  And it will be run out of Saudi Arabia publicly and groups publicly armed by our criminal government.
[48:22.000 --> 48:29.000]  And I'll be called a traitor on air even though I'll have 100 clips, plus of me saying exactly that before happen.
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  In fact, the day they set the nuke off, they'll probably take clips of me saying it years ago and say I said it that day.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  They've done that before.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  And let me tell you something.
[48:41.000 --> 48:48.000]  When they set the nuke off, folks, they will probably assassinate me, Rand Paul, Ron Paul and others hours before.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  In fact, that's the only balloon you're going to get.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  The only warning will be they'll wipe out the Liberty leaders.
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  A couple hundred of us hit teams in one hour.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  And once we're gone, so we can't sit here and warn you, they will detonate a nuclear weapon
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  or they'll release a biological weapon and all hell or maybe both.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  Remember, I predicted the anthrax shot on 9-11, the anthrax breakout.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  Let's go to the next clip.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  Let's go to Obama from March talking about the nuke.
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  Here it is.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  The number one national security threat to the United States.
[49:20.000 --> 49:31.000]  I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  Okay, let's now go to another clip.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  We've got Diane Feinstein as well.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  We've got a couple clips here.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  But next up is Rubio, Senator Rubio on Al Qaeda in Iraq.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  History is trying to repeat itself.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  Here's that clip.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  Well, if you look at what happened before 9-11, the reason why Al Qaeda was able to carry out the 9-11 attacks
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  is because they had a safe operating space in Afghanistan that the Taliban had given them.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  And now history is trying to repeat itself here.
[50:00.000 --> 50:06.000]  ISIS is trying to establish the exact same thing in the Iraq-Syria region that they're increasingly controlling.
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.000]  And then from this caliphate that they're setting up, they will continue to recruit and train and plot and plan
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  and eventually carry out external operations in Europe and potentially even here in the United States.
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.000]  So this is a very serious national security risk for the immediate environment.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  Look at that little talking head puppet.
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  And again, George Lucas in Revenge of the Sith tells you the whole plan.
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  The emperor is running the terrorists that are attacking the planets.
[50:33.000 --> 50:40.000]  And he uses that to set up a police state to then wipe out the Jedi, then wipe out the rebels and totally take over.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  And that's what they're doing with this.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  So if anybody doesn't understand this, some reporters here 50 times probably say,
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  we don't understand false flag, how's it work?
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  It's real simple.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  You take over by running an outside threat Al Qaeda.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  And the reward to Saudi Arabia is turning over the whole Middle East to them.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  Don't people understand that?
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  More clips coming up.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  So my elementary school age child is begging me for a cell phone.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  Please mom, please, all the kids have them.
[51:05.000 --> 51:15.000]  But I've seen the research and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies that close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  Harmful wireless radiation is real.

[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment.
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[53:53.000 --> 53:59.000]  Helping thousands prepare since 2005, goburkey.com.
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  And we've got other reports that they filed last night that we're going to be airing as well.
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  Now remember, with the backdrop of nuclear weapons detonating, give up all your rights,
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  Obama and Cheney, Feinstein, we've got to disrupt the terror plots.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  Oh my gosh, I'm a hero, I'm dying, Feinstein, turn your guns in, I love you,
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  but I've got to consult Kerry.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  You know, we're good people. Take your shots, drink your fluoride, we love you.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  GMO's good for you. Drink some Roundup, it'll help you.
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  We'll help you die, of course. While these scum run things and tell us
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  give up all our rights and the TSA fans out on American highways
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  and the Army is at public events everywhere, searching people's purses,
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  just randomly to train you to be slaves, the border is wide open.
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.000]  So just remember that and never forget it.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  It's all a hoax. We've got to break with the system and let them know we know you're a total fraud.
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  And that can happen. The Australian President, Prime Minister has now come out
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.000]  and they are shooting down the carbon taxes.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  Justices have limited the EPA's shutting down our power plants here.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  A huge Supreme Court ruling and there's a lot of good stuff happening
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  because it's so outrageous to shut off all the coal power plants when they're totally clean now
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  in Australia and the U.S. and it's hurting people with only a third of them shut down.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  I mean, you've seen your power prices. I mean, going bankrupt ain't fine.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Your kids don't have a food in fun, is it?
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  While all this is going on, people are getting upset.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  Australian Prime Minister introduces bills to repeal carbon tax and they've got the votes to do it.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  And the Australians have voted out two Prime Ministers who wouldn't repeal this.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  I mean, folks are getting angry, they're getting focused.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  And let me tell you something.
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  Rand Paul picked up on our analysis last year and we stopped the Syria attack
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  and after his leadership, Senator Cruz picked it up and others came out
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  and it became okay to say, hey, we're not Al Qaeda's Air Force, Obama's funding Al Qaeda.
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  The globalists totally freaked out over that.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  That's why they changed the name from Al Qaeda to ISIS to confuse the sheep.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  That ain't working. I salute Rand Paul and his courage.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  I salute him. He shouldn't take too many plane rides.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  Let me tell you, he's the real deal and they know it
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  and he's as clean as a whistle and they know it and they don't like it.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  And it happens to him and any of these guys, they've been set up.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  I don't know about Cruz, but I like him.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  But I can vouch for Rand Paul. I've known him for 18, 19 years.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  Now, let's get clear here.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  He came out. It's a long Fox piece. It's up on infowars.com
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  and he said, look, we gave them the safe haven in Syria.
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  That's a fact, Jack. And that's the issue here.
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.000]  I'm not defending Bush or Cheney. They're all part of the same plan.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  Oh, was it their fault they took Saddam out? Of course that was the plan.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  Now Saudi Arabia will be given full control.
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.000]  That's their payoff for being part of 9-11 and playing along with it.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  Man, it's so simple. Why did Iraq get attacked? They're the new at 9-11.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  Let's go to Rand Paul. Here's the clip.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  We are where we are because we armed the Syrian rebels.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  We have been fighting alongside al-Qaeda, fighting alongside ISIS.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  ISIS is now emboldened in two countries. But here's the anomaly.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  We're with ISIS in Syria. We're on the same side of the war.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  So those who want to get involved to stop ISIS in Iraq are allied with ISIS in Syria.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  That is the real contradiction to this whole policy.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  Right. And many of your Republican colleagues would argue that what we should have done in Syria
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  was get rid of Assad, and that would have stopped ISIS and its tracks.
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  We've done this. Look at Libya. That's singing in.
[58:04.000 --> 58:10.000]  There's another one we've got of him on Fox. He's on there with Candy Crowley.
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.000]  Also a Lord of the Rings character. Yeah, I bet you can guess.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  Cave troll. Sorry. The point is, it's got to have a little humor here. Gallows humor.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  Get rid of Assad. It's an ISIS. It's ISIS al-Qaeda.
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  They're going to take Assad out. You give him a whole base.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  You give him a whole country and high-tech weapons, including chemical weapons.
[58:29.000 --> 58:34.000]  Does that stop them taking Iraq? No. They can't take Syria as they're taking Iraq.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  This is pure bull. Pure bull. We'll be right back.
[58:38.000 --> 58:57.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[58:57.000 --> 59:04.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.000]  Most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[59:16.000 --> 59:21.000]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[59:21.000 --> 59:31.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  It's made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[59:42.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  All available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  I think we need to build our intelligence to see that we can disrupt the plot in this country before it happens because there will be plots to kill Americans.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  That's the witch, the anti-gun monster on CNN, Communist News Network 959.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  And Cheney says to get ready for a bigger 9-11. Obama says he's worried about a nuke going off.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  They're back hyping all of it. Let's play the Obama and the Cheney again in a moment.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  This is what's being pushed. So the more money you spend, the more money that you put out, trillions to fight al Qaeda,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  they just change their name to ISIS. You give them a base to attack Syria.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Now they take over Iraq. Obama acts like he's against both sides, but he's letting them take over.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  And her answer is we need more intelligence. We need more money. We need to spy on you.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Meanwhile, the entire domestic spy grid is pointed at the Tea Party.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  And they're getting ready to blow stuff up and roll it out against us.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that. And it's not fun to get up here and talk like this.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  I know it dangers me and my family, but my family's in greater danger, and so is your family,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  as this rotting society really gets to a new level of evil.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  The bottom's fallen out. I mean, they got the borders wide open right now,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  but they're setting up internal checkpoints all over the country to train you to be a slave.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  I mean, this is pathetic. This is our conversion into a total police state.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Do any of you want to live in this? Because it's not the old saying of,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  do you want your children to grow up in a society like this?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  No, now the issue is, ladies and gentlemen, do you want to live in this?
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Because the takeover is pointed at the human family itself.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  It's an anti-human, globalist, psychopathic agenda.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Why did Ted Bunny do the things he did? Because he liked it.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Why does the new ruler do the things they do? Everywhere they're in control,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  killing foster kids, torturing people to death, molesting children, murdering people,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  genetically engineering and deforming plants and animals in human life,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  all sorts of secret experimentation, macabre horror.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  I've seen New York Times articles, a couple of them, about the hottest art in New York City
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  that sold for $20, $30 million, isn't even Vincent Van Gogh art.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  It's crystal skulls, crusted crucifix in buckets of semen.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  I don't mean to get gross here, but, and billionaires go as a tithe
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  to these weird devil-worshipping artists, and you read the profiles.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  And I'll never forget, I was doing a search for Arnold Schwarzenegger gay porn,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  so I could put it in my film, Fall of the Republic, Police State.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  What was the name of the film I made? I've made like 20 something.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  What's the big three and a half hour long one? It's got the blimps in New York and all that.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  9-1-1 Rise of the Police State. That's the name of it.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Anyways, and so we're doing a gay porn search on Arnold, we did find it,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  and put some blurred out images over there, just a show, because he was getting ready to run for president.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  We wanted to have a part of the film to shoot him down.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  And it was him in Austria, no, it was Germany, and he traveled there just to meet with his favorite artists,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  like totally white skin, black hair, black uniform, the artist wears like an SS uniform.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  And I forget the artist's name, we've shown this before.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  And it's Arnold looking at the guy's artwork, and it's like four-year-old girls in SS uniforms
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  dead, laying on beds, with their legs partially spread.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  And then the other one is dead babies from car wrecks, and this is Arnold's favorite artwork.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  I mean, looking at it haunts me years later, seeing what this guy's into.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, infowars.com, David Ikes, coming up.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest-purity iodine available.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the Earth.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.

[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Now, intellectually, it's for God you can fail it.

[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  Zero tolerance lunacy becomes law if kids at public schools or elsewhere see that you have eaten a cookie and it looks like the shape of a gun.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  You won't be arrested.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  United Nations may soon be paying water bills in Detroit.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  That's up on infowars.com.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  UK begins beta testing cashless society.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Senator Feinstein says there will be plots to kill Americans because of the ISIS threat publicly run and funded by her and her controllers.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  Cheney says another 9-11 coming, but far deadlier if you don't give up all your rights.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  He actually says if we ask questions, if we debate this, yes, yes, don't say anything or terrorists will get you.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  Sounds like being held hostage to me.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  Hillary Clinton calls for harsh restrictions on alternative media, attacks the Drudge report,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  and Bloomberg admits there's a vast liberal conspiracy of billionaire globalist meaning to try to pass gun control.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  They're not liberal or conservatives.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  That's just how they divide their two controlled camps, folks.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  They are the globalist scourge.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Though you do have a libertarian-esque Tea Party move with UKIP here and the Tea Party in the United States,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  UKIP in England or David Ikez and then Tea Party here in the United States,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  that is challenging global governance.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  You have the prime minister of Australia who got voted in promising to repeal the carbon tax that's really hurting the people.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  Introducing a bill to do just that.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  You have the Supreme Court ruling that the EPA needs to stop shutting down all the power plants because the people are getting upset.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  The globalist agenda is being exposed.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  Here's another headline of the Columbia Journalism Review.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Local cops can track your phone and they do it without warrants,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  and the government doesn't want you to know how they do it through the Federal Threat Fusion Center.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Again, they don't want to have a debate about the man behind the curtain,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  but totos out there love them or hate them like David Ike and so many others have shocked people out of their stupor,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  out of their trance-like medical state.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  People grown up in front of television on record go pull up the studies,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  get Alzheimer's, get brain disorders, just type in Alzheimer's television viewing,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  or type in brainwaves lowered television or television pessimism.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  It causes pessimism that then triples your chances of dementia.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  People are watching weaponized television.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  They're in a near trance-like state with the chemicals in the food and the water exacerbating it as an adjuvant to accelerate that.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  And somebody like David Ike with all of his best-selling books and his research is able to flip a switch with a narrative,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  whether you agree with it or not, that so much of it is now revealed to be true,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  that he is able to get them out of their trance.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  You can say what you want about InfoWars.com and the way I come off sometime, but it doesn't matter.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  It's real, it's primitive, it's human.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  Toto is just a little dog but is able to pull the curtain back and show the controller.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Who's projecting this big Supreme Being image up there as a giant floating phantasm.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  We're here not to even analyze the politics of it anymore.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  We've proven all this.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  We're here now to talk to those that are still conditioned and have pre-programmed conditioning.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  To understand that you are being controlled.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And that where you're going is a very bad place.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And the reason you feel powerless or the reason you're laughing even though you know you're controlled
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  is because you've been preconditioned and that's artificial.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  That's an automatic response that has been programmed into you, literally.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  They had that perfected a hundred years ago with the psychology.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Now it's so advanced, but it doesn't matter how advanced the mind control is.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  If you can step out of it, look at it from the outside and realize that there's infinite love and infinite peace in the universe.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  And that the globalists aren't in even control of this planet fully.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  They're trying to get control, building an artificial construct to create a false consciousness, a false synthetic reality.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  They've been successful with some people a hundred percent.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Others by degree, but there's a giant split happening.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Now either those accelerating their awakening or those that are falling deeper into the control.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  And we shouldn't get mad at those people.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  We should feel really sorry for them because it's like the body snatchers already got them.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  That's my allegory.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Now joining us is the former World Champ soccer goalie, BBC News and sports presenter.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  The former head of the Green Party until he traveled to Peru.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  And I would liken it to Saul of Tarsus being knocked off his horse literally.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  And again, this was 20 years ago, began or plus, you know, seeing the world a different way.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  And some people see the world in a flash a different way.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Other people it's incremental, but David Ike began to do his research then.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  And so much of what he said that was fantastical is now common knowledge and common place.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  So we salute him for his success in getting people outside the matrix and getting them to take the red pill.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  And there's only a few of us that came in that early wave to not just challenging the New World Order and its political systems,
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  but going deeper into the larger paradigm.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  And I've got to say again, it's important to recognize Trailblazers like David Ike.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  It's important to recognize this radio show and you, the listeners who are just as important as I am,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  literally half the people I see on the street know who I am now and most of them agree with us.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Most of the military I talk to are listeners and agree with us.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  People are really waking up and that shows the power I've had in 19 years, the power David's had in 20 plus years,
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  the power you have, where is the next David Ike, the next Alex Jones?
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  You are in your area and it's about this journey and this animating contest.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  You see the wars breaking out, the famines, the dollar devaluation, the globalists are emerging, announcing their world government.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  They announced the United States of Europe with no sovereignty yesterday.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  That was in the Financial Times of London.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  So it's all happening.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  David Ike, thank you so much for joining us from your TV studios there in London.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  I know you want to get into ISIS and the perfect model of problem reaction solution,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  but I want to do that in the next segment, the five minutes we've got.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  In fact, I'm going to skip this break so we have more time.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  I want you to break down where you think we are using a football analogy in the game.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  I'd say we were three or four goals behind, but now we've gotten three or four more goals
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  and we're neck and neck with a quarter left here and we've got the initiative,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  but the enemy is going to strike back. Where do you say we are in this magical time?
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  Well, I think that this whole ISIS situation in the Middle East is the start of a whole new stage from the point of view of the agenda.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  And there's no doubt that more and more people are beginning to see through the cover stories
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  because in the end it's a perception deception. It's all a perception deception.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  It's programming a perception of reality that suits the agenda for you to have.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  So in the Middle East at the moment, we've got a kind of great cocktail of perception deceptions.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  We've got the deception that this ISIS came out of nowhere, that it's come out organic and just appeared.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  And then we've got the perception deception that the ISIS operation is imposing upon its followers
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  that it's some kind of holy war jihad on behalf of Islam.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  And so you've got the perception deceived going on social media and urging people to become terrorists and join the jihad.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  And they're just playing their part in destroying what they claim to be fighting for,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  i.e. that whole region of the Middle East and the religion of Islam.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  So it's a perception deception everywhere.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  The perception deception of climate change caused by human activity, which is just a scientific nonsense.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  And everywhere you see this, and the fork in the road, Alex, is what is your perception?
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  What is the source of your perception?
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  Are you having it downloaded by believing what the authorities in all their forms tell you, all the experts tell you?
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Or are you actually taking your mind back, filtering the information, checking it out,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  looking at alternatives in explaining that same situation, and then coming to your own conclusion?
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Because that's the difference.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  It's the difference between the free thinker who does not have a belief system to defend,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  does not have a belief system repelling all borders.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  I'm not listening to that because if that's anything like true, then my belief system must be wrong and that can't be true.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  So you have these belief system people that just resist anything that challenges the belief system.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  And if you are going to break out of that program, because it's beliefs, perceptions, downloaded,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  so the world that we live in, if you're going to break out of that, you've got to start to free think and work it out for yourself.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  I agree. Let me throw this at you.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  I remember reading the paraphrase from quotes of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  And these are papers that later came out where he was writing to his propaganda corps and he said,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  listen, it needs to be simple.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  It needs to be dumbed down when you speak to people's laziness to want to buy into our narrative.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  And the truth is 100% public that for four years almost now, they've been arming on the border with Iraq and Jordan and Turkey,
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  al-Qaeda groups out of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, under different banners of al-Qaeda.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  You can see it's the official al-Qaeda flag of the Wahhabist.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  Their flags even say, as someone been lauding on a bunch of them, I've learned to read it like I know a Texas flag.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  It's them, the black flags of al-Qaeda, and they have been given a base to try to take over Syria, kill all the Christians,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  300,000 dead, and now they're flooding in and our own government says, get rid of the prime minister.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  He hadn't played ball. We want to break the country in three.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  But we can't beat ISIS.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  Obama came out today and said, of course they can't beat them, because with a deal in Saudi Arabia for taking the blame for 9-11,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  even though Iraq got attacked, they are now giving the Middle East to them,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  just like British intelligence set up Saudi Arabia to begin with and have them take over Syria.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  And this is setting up the Middle East under al-Qaeda.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  And then down the road, they'll probably even overthrow Saudi Arabia. That's being said now.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  And then we'll have a huge giant war with that.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  I mean, it just goes on over and over again. It's all public.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  And as you said, though, now Diane Feinstein, Dick Cheney, all the usual suspects are saying, give your rights up.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Terrorists are going to hit us any minute.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  Oh, we've got to stick our hands down your pants, David.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  While the U.S. border is now officially wide open and they pay, the border patrol pays,
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  they don't just let them in. They pay to ship them in to the interior.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  So it's all a giant hoax and we've reached this point where they just don't care.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  What's happening, David?
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  Well, you know, in this situation at the moment in the Middle East with this ISIS and, of course, ISIS.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  ISIS is one of the names for the goddess in the religion of this cabal.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  And if you notice, by calling it ISIS, they have got newsreaders and news reporters to use their language.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  Like, ISIS forces have taken Mosul. ISIS forces are closing in on Baghdad.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  ISIS has done this. ISIS has done that. They must be laughing.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  And of course, as you know, all these big events, talk about the Olympics and symbolism,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  and literally they believe it gives their god power that it's now being invoked as lesser magic.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Yeah. I mean, symbolism is just an information field.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  You see, the importance of symbolism is in understanding the nature of reality.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  You know, I'm talking to you now and you're hearing words,
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  but the words are not passing between me and you.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  A vibrational field of information generated by the vocal cords is passing between me and people listening to me now.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  And then they decode that and when they've decoded it, when the brain decodes it, then they can hear the words.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  They turn them into words.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  Now, symbols are information. They're information fields at their base level
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  and they are entering the perception, the mind, not through the ears like this, but through the eyes.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  And the vast overwhelming majority of information that we receive is through the sight sense.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  Now, unless it's kind of subliminally broadcast, when someone is saying something,
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  at least it's conscious because you're hearing it.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  You are aware that some noise and speech is taking place.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  But symbolism, the information fields of symbolism, they are entering through the eyes.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  And it's a stunning figure, the tiny amount of visual information that we actually register and see that gets to the brain
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  compared with this tidal wave of visual information that's hitting the subconscious and registering at that level
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  without us being consciously where we're even seeing it.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  That's where subliminal advertising comes in and that's where subliminal symbolism comes in.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  So it's not just putting symbols around for a bit of fun.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  They're actually subliminally downloading information.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  And what we have in the Middle East, which in this ISIS situation, which I think it's worth emphasizing,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  is the elephant in the living room called Israel.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  Now, Israel is whenever there's anything going on in the Middle East, people like Netanyahu and Co.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  are up there immediately, can't find a microphone quick enough, saying,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  it's a threat to Israel.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  Oh my God, we need help, Paul.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  We've got to do this.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  It's a threat to Israel.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  And what's been really a shouted silence, if you like, is that this time, there is none of that.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  Now, if you're Israel, this sliver of land of less than 8 million people,
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  and this ISIS group is overrunning great chunks of Iraq, threatening to do the same in Jordan.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  They have an open demand or ambition to take over Syria, Iraq, and what they call the Levant,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  which includes Israel.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  And chop the head off of the King of Jordan.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Yeah, I've just, this story here, Netanyahu suggests a pinning ISIS against Iran.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  That's the headlines in the Jerusalem Post.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  But this is what he says.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Israeli Prime Minister suggested the United States should largely stay out of the fight
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  and instead allow the parties to weaken one another.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  Now, can you imagine in other situations in the past, an Israeli Prime Minister saying that
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  in the face of what's happening with Israel as one of the stated targets of this ISIS organization?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  And then you've got the American government, that is not kind of being gung-ho, as they almost always are.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Oh yes, we've got to go in and stop this.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And it seems to me this, Alex, that what we're looking at is a, in the end,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  Western US cabal dominated controlled operation in this ISIS with its billions of dollars in funding
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  and, of course, all the American weaponry that it's inherited from taking over parts of Iraq
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  and no doubt inherited in other ways as well.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  Benghazi.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  We've got this situation where I think that they want this to kick off.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  They want it to kick on.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  They want this ISIS organization to get a bigger foothold in this region.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  And then at the end of it, when it really starts to move in Israel's direction,
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  is to say we must go in and protect Israel.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Because, of course, they've all said, America, not least, that they will protect Israel at all costs.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  And when you look at the Albert Pipe scenario in the letter about playing the Muslims world off against the political Zionists,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  as he called them, to create World War III,
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  and you're starting to see a possible scenarios leading in that direction because of what's happening here.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  The other thing, Alex, is Iran.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Because I've been writing in my books for years that the plan was to create a massive rift and war in effect
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  in the Muslim world between the Shia and the Sunnis.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  And here you have a situation where you've got the allegedly, anyway,
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  a sunny ISIS against the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad, in Iraq.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  And then you've got the center of the Shia world.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  89% of Iranians are Shia.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  And so you've got this rather bizarre situation, Alex, recently,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  which I know people were going, what's going on here?
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  When after castinating and condemning Iran all these years and saying, we need to bomb and take out these nuclear facilities,
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  they now started saying, well, maybe we ought to have some kind of discussion with them about what we do over this thing.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  And I think the answer to why is they want to draw Iran into this Shia-Sunni conflict,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  because once Iran's involved in that, it will never get out.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  No, no, that's it.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  And what you then got is this mass of interconnected conflict in that same part of the world.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  No, that's it.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  And look, here's the bottom line.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  It is a Saudi Arabian, NATO, globalist-backed giant army formed and trained in Turkey, Jordan, and Western Iraq.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  They were given bases, we reported on this three years ago, in Western Iraq.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  The U.S. forces trained them. It's a giant army with thousands of vehicles able to roll right in.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  And the Iraqi military was told to stand down.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  The U.S. military didn't go in like the highway of death in 1991 in Kuwait and take them out.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  And then now Obama says there's nothing we can do about it,
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  because this is an official launch to bare minimum break Iraq into multiple pieces.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Iran may even be double-dealing, and the Prime Minister of Iraq has said this, to get a third themselves.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  So Saudi Arabia gets a piece.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  This new state gets created out of the north and the eastern or western area with this ISIS group.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  And then that's a new area to stage attacks successfully and a plausible deniability that the west isn't involved into Syria.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  That's the larger plan.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  The issue is it's so naked, the massacres they're committing, the evil they're involved in, and then they use them.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  Oh my gosh, ISIS, we better take your rights away.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  What do they do when there's terror attacks in America?
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  And we come back, I want to ask you, why do you think Dick Cheney's saying,
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  get ready for bigger 9-11, Obama's saying, look for mushroom clouds in Manhattan.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Same thing from Feinstein.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  What else do you expect them to pull in this new phase, proxy wars in Ukraine?
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Dollar devaluation, food prices going up.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  What's the next big shoe to drop in David Ike's mind?
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  Straight ahead, davidike.com's his website.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  Humanity is waking up.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN...
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  That's where the real march is happening folks, stay with us.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  Then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  For a limited time experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  A lot of times I get hysterical on air.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  My dad sent me a text last hour.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  He said you sound hysterical.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  Well you know what that's real.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  I was a little bit hysterical last hour.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  I can get up here and act all stoic and manly and talk real slow.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  And I'll do that when that's really how I feel.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  But I think I've been successful at waking up about as many people as anybody has out there.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  You talk to most people they say who woke you up to what's happening in the world.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  They'll say three names.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  Alex Jones, Ron Paul or David Ike.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  Three very different individuals in many ways.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  But still we've been the most successful.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Why is that?
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  We should study that.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  We should look at that.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  I'm going to ask David that question a moment and expand out what this new phase means.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  But some days I'm totally calm.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  Some days I'm screaming for an hour.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  Not as much as I used to.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  But I'm not in my comfort zone with what's going on.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  Our government publicly changed the name to Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  You can hear them in PR boardrooms coming up with this new thing.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  Like Coca-Cola, a new name, ISIS, makes it sound really cool.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  They're committing all these crimes and it lets me know what they want to do to me.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Wherever Christians are, not big establishment Christians, but old communities of Christians worldwide,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  the globalists want to go in and exterminate them.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  I want to get David Ike's take on that because I have the wrong numbers.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  The UN even admits that's happening and getting a lot of other issues with David Ike.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Briefly, we have some amazing supplements.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  And I didn't even plug anything last hour, skip breaks earlier.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  This is also how we fund our operation.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  So buy your war bonds in the Info War.

[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  It's only $5.95 a month.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  That helps pay for the bandwidth, the crew, the cameras, the reporters.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  You see how we've been expanding.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  Thanks to your support and your help.

[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  We're fighting the prisonplanet with prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  Now I want to thank those of you that are members.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  We're running a detox special with the fluoride shield, chelating detox, discounted massively with the news,
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  survival shield, X2, nascent iodine, the only deep earth crystal form that we know of existing.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  Believe me, we tried to find it. It was hard.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  And it just has such an amazing effect on me and my family.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  You can see videos on the website with Dr. Group breaking down the effects of this and why.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  They put all the bad halogens in the food, in the water, but take the iodine out.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  And when there is iodine, it's the bound type.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  This is the true nascent iodine.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  Turns into a purple gas.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  We tested other iodines before manufacture.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  They don't do that.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  This is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Research iodine science, and you'll find out what we're talking about.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  InfoWarsLife.com to see the still shots, the videos, and more.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  The super detox special is more than 30% off.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  When you get both bottles together, a lot of other specials, we're going to sell out this week of the lung cleanse.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  It'll be another month till more of that comes in.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  There's a lot of great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  And then, of course, at InfoWarsStore.com, hundreds of books and films made in America,
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  pro-liberty apparel to meet like-minded people and to promote freedom and to support the broadcast.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  Everything we do has to benefit the InfoWars, raising human awareness and consciousness to what's happening,
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  support you, be high quality, and support us.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  I only believe in win-win-wins.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  I'm obsessed with it.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  And I notice my whole life I've done that, that's why I've been successful and I sleep well at night.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  But now, I more and more become totally obsessed with it.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  I mean, it's got to be a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  And everything at InfoWars.com, at PrismPlanet.com, at InfoWarsStore.com, at InfoWarsHealth.com, at InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  is a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  That is my philosophy.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  With the globalist, they'll go 100 miles out of their way to make sure you don't get anything from them.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  We've all run into people that don't like making you dinner, don't like making you feel good, don't like, don't have hospitality.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  The type of people that really enjoy thinking they get something, you get nothing.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  And that's the New World Order predatory philosophy.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  And there's a battle for the future of this planet.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  DavidIke.com is his website.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  We're very honored to have him on with us today.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  We're going to try to give him the floor now and let him break down all the questions I've thrown out about,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  what is this next level that you're moving into?
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  In the football game analogy, we are seeing a big awakening, but where does he expect all this to go?
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  DavidIke.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Well, it's been a progression, clearly, along a road going way back.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  You know, people like George Orwell and Aldous Huxley with 1984 and Brave New World,
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  they weren't coming from their imagination entirely or even much of it.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  They were coming from a point of view of having access to the projected agenda.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  And they both said that. They both said that in public white papers.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  And, you know, in my last couple of books, I quoted a man called Dr. Richard Day,
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  who was a Rockefeller insider. He was an executive of Planned Parenthood.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  And in 1969, he was addressing a meeting of pediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  And for some reason, only he knows, he asked people to not take notes and not record anything
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  because he was going to tell them how the world was going to change.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  And what he then did was tell them what was coming and why.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  And one of the pediatricians did take notes and later did some interviews before he died
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  explaining what this Richard Day said and what Richard Day described.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  And remember, 1969, you know, it's 20 years after Orwell.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  And he was describing the world we're living in today or moving more and more in today
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  in all aspects of society. This is a plan that is projected forward in great detail.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  Therefore, what's coming is what they plan to come.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  And that will be up in the ante. It will be increasing the pressure.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  It will be moving further along the road in all these different areas,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  everything from GMO and food to additives like that to the radiation agenda,
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  which is phenomenal. You mentioned iodine a few minutes ago, Alex.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  Millions and millions and millions of times more radiation technologically generated
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  than there was 50 years ago that we're now kind of living in,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  like the sea of technological radiation.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  And given that we have an electromagnetic field, an electromagnetic level,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  that is going to impact and does impact upon us.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  And if the electromagnetic level, the electromagnetic field,
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  which is what we call the auric field, is disrupted by technological radiation,
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  that plays through into the body as a distortion and a disruption.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  And we call that mental or emotional or physical dis-ease.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  So it's progressing just as we can look back and see how it's progressed.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  But of course, there are certain points where it progresses very fast
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  because of events that are orchestrated.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  And of course, the best example of that is 9-11, where the agenda moved forward
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  more in the 10 years after 9-11 that it had in a lot longer time before that.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  And when Cheney's talking about another 9-11,
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  when Lindsey Graham, when he opens his mouth just like John McCain,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  he is speaking the cabal's agenda.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  He's talking about another 9-11.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  Over here, we're getting just the same Alex with the Prime Minister David Cameron
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  warning about, oh, we've got to increase surveillance
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  because of the terrorists coming back to Britain.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  We've got this guy today, Liam Fox.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Liam Fox is a British politician who's simply an agent of Israel.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  That's all he is. He's an agent of Israel.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  And he has come out today and said we need to have more surveillance, et cetera,
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  more big brother, in effect, to meet the challenge from jihadists coming back to Britain.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  So we are facing this fork in the road between the free thinkers
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  and between those that just accept the agenda and download it, you know, bar, bar, bar.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  And the number that go that way or that way will decide where we go as a human race
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  because we've shown when they wanted to move the Syrian invasion,
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  which is what it is, in fact, they wanted to move that along because it was behind the timeline,
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  people opposing that stopped that bombardment and affected the agenda
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  because, you know, people like you and me and all the others that do this,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  the idea is not to be proved right.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  It's for what the agenda is not to happen.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  It's about using that information to head off what's happening.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  And so it's not just about, you know, watching your own prison being built.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  Oh, yeah, they put the roof on now.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  Look, you see that? I told you they do that, didn't I?
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  We need to stop the roof going on.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  And one of the things that is fundamental to that is that we put down the fault lines of divide and rule
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  because what's happening in the Muslim world in the Middle East is just classic divide and rule.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  And we have different factions of politics.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  We have religions played off against each other.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  We have, you know, scientific belief systems played off against religious belief systems.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  But we need to put that down and say, hold on a second.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  There's a common theme here and that's that we're all the target for this unfolding global fascist agenda.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  And therefore, you know, if we don't come together now and put down our differences
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  and focus on what should unite us all and that's what is going to affect us all and is affecting us all,
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  then when we're in some concentration camp eventually, if we get that far,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  then we can have a lovely discussion over who's got the best religion
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  and who's got the best politics and who's got the best whatever.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  But by then it will be too late.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  And what they want, if you're targeting a vast population and there's comparatively few of you
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  and my goodness, it's so few at the core of in the shadows in the center,
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  then you have to divide and rule the target population and we allow it to happen so easily.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  I mean, look at the Middle East.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  I mean, we have people at war with each other over some arguments centuries ago
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  over who should be the natural or the right replacement for Mohammed.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  I mean, are we children?
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  Are we mature adults or are we children?
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  And I'm sorry, in some cases, like what's happening in the Middle East,
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  I apologize to children for using that analogy.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  But this is happening all over the place where people are played off against each other
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  and while we're divided and ruled, we will be one thing.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  We'll be ruled.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  It's in our hands.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  We have the numbers, but only if we come together.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  I don't care what your religion is.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  I don't care what your politics are.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  I care if you truly care about freedom for everybody.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Then we've got a chance.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  David, when I raise this point, it's not for us to talk about how great we are.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  More and more I realize the fact that I've been so successful,
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  you've been so successful, Ron Paul and others have been so successful,
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  because I get the calls.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  I talk to folks on the street.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  I even talk to my detractors.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  They go, yeah, I don't like you, but you woke me up.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  Why have we been so successful at getting people to realize that the Federal Reserve is not federal?
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  I mean, remember when it was so hard to just get people to realize that private banks control the Bank of England,
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  that private banks ran the Federal Reserve, that there was a plan for a new world order.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Now all that's admitted that there was a plan to put satellite tracker boxes and taxation boxes in all the cars.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  Now it's here.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  People now are listening to us and realizing they may not agree with our in-game analysis,
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  but this is going on, but they say, well, what are we going to do anyways?
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  Well, what are we going to do if the rest of it comes into fruition?
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  Because we can see the globalists want to turn off the resources.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  The globalists want us sick and dead.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  The globalists believe they're going to merge with machines and become gods,
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  which is what the elite have been told by the spider at the center, whatever that is.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  We're living in a science fiction horror movie, but simultaneously there is the beauty of my children
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  and playing with my dogs and sunsets and friends and honorableness.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  There's so much more good in the world.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  It's a very delicate balance I'm trying to get at.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  Some people ignore the new world order and say, I'm just going to live a great life.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  That's how I beat them.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  But then you allow their evil to grow.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  But if you just focus on their evil and fight it, you become so pessimistic that then they defeat you
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  because you're focused on them.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  That's almost like a form of worship.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  So where is the balance in that?
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  Because I feel in my gut and I intellectually see we are entering the most incredible time in human development ever
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  that will decide our fate, not just here, but on a trillion star systems, literally.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  This is a great test and we're about to go into this zone.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  We've entered the edge of it, the jump point, the flash point, the critical mass point.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  And I just want to somehow, I just constantly feel like I should be doing better as I enter this key point
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  because it's just so humbling to be at this point and to see the understanding, my understanding, accelerating,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  the stuff I won't even get into on air.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  It's so incredible.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  You've talked about it, but I keep a lot of my own views private because they're just too incredible.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  I mean, I just feel sorry for the people that serve the system now.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  I realize they, as you've said, don't even know what's going on.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  General Petraeus doesn't even know.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  I mean, I'm beginning to understand it's so compartmentalized is what I'm getting at.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Yeah, it's incredibly compartmentalized and if it was not, it couldn't work
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  because you have to keep people right up really close to the spider, really,
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  in ignorance of the full magnitude of what's going on.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  And, you know, if you concentrate only, and I'm not saying people shouldn't, I do this.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  We need to know this, but if you concentrate only on the level of banking scams and manipulated wars,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  you're still just walking around the outer rim of the rabbit hole, really.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  You've only just started to enter it.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  It's so deep.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  And it's understanding the nature of reality is fundamental to understanding what's actually going on.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  And because the daily experience of people and what they've been taught in the education system
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  and by mainstream science is that, you know, this world that they're living in is real
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  and it's somehow solid, although quantum physics has proved, of course, that it can't be.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  I mean, you talk about atoms making up a solid world, atoms had no solidity.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  How can they?
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  It's an illusion.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  And once you realize it's illusory, once you realize it's information, decoding information,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  it's like the wireless internet and you look around, I've not got the wireless internet here,
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  but if I had, you wouldn't be able to see it.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  It's an information field within the unseen to the tiny, tiny frequency range visible light
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  that we can actually see and experience.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  It's ridiculous how narrow visible light is, our visual world that we think is.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  We're basically blind.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Yeah, we are in that sense.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  And so if you only focus on what you can see and you try to get your sense of reality
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  and what's going on in the world only from that tiny sliver of frequency of information, of happenings, of events,
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  you're never going to do it.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  That's right, stay there.

[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  Not in America, this can't happen in America.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Because of my concern about our government, I was looking at survival stuff.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  I was raised as a Girl Scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  I said, well, this is a product worth having seen as it's so good.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  I like the pricing for what I got. I like the containers they were shipped in.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  If they keep in touch with you, you get your emails, you get your confirmation.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  Customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  I plan on buying probably about four more of these minimums.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  And this came so quick, it came right when they said it was top.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted food for patriots.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  Go to GetSurvivalFood.com to learn more. That's GetSurvivalFood.com.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  This is a national review. This is what an open border looks like.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  And you can just walk back and forth however you want. It's totally wide open.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  They've ordered to stand down. We've documented that.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Meanwhile, they now have the Army and National Guard and State Guard at public events all over Texas.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  At marathons, at kite festivals, you show up and the Army.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Now remember, you pull up in a green field. There isn't even an entrance at Silker Park.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  But they're there just searching people.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  And again, I'm not against the troops from Camp Maverick.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  The media will say he's against troops. That's the mind control.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  A suicide bomber would just go bomb the checkpoint. That just happened in Pakistan last week.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  But the whole issue is that the government's running and financing them with the airlift of evil.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  Everything David was talking about, he's graciously said he'll stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  to get deeper into the rabbit hole, to talk about solutions, to talk about all the pedophile scandals
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  that he first talked about, that he said BBC's basically run by pedophiles.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  He worked there. Now it just keeps coming out.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  There's so many movies like Under the Skin that parallel what David Ike says is at the center of the Spider Web.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  And he hasn't seen it yet, but he said, oh, I want to talk about this.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  So David, in this segment we've got left is five minutes.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  Talk about why, whether it's the X-Men or the Superman or all these movies now
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  are like from our perspective admitting that there's false flag, Captain America, Winter Soldier.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  Why are they doing this?
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  Well, in the nature of reality and the way we interact with reality
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  and the way that thought manifests as what we experience, I have this phrase,
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  what we believe, we perceive, and what we perceive we experience.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  If you can program someone to believe something, then that will become their reality.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  And if you can get people to take it on collectively, that will become the collective reality.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  It's very much like the stage hypnotist who puts a belief system or a belief in reality.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  That's what they're doing into the mind of the stooge on the stage.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  And then the stooge on the stage experiences that, whether it's someone naked in the audience that isn't,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  whether there's an elephant in the audience, but there isn't whatever.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  That downloaded belief manifests as their experienced reality.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  And I've been watching this for years now, Alex, way, way back.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  And it's virtually a tidal wave in filming terms of movies that are portraying one after the other
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  the world that they want to create.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  The world that the New World Order, as it's being called, is ultimately leading to.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  And what it's doing, it's downloading that, on one level, that belief.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  It's putting it in the subconscious, and that makes it much more likely to collectively manifest
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  because of what I'm talking about, what you believe you perceive, what you perceive you experience.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  And if we take on this subconscious belief, it doesn't have to be conscious.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  In this unfolding Orwellian state, then we will collectively manifest that while thinking it's happening externally.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  And another level of it is it's making it familiar to us.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  It's making it, if you like, as it literally comes in, they're making it less of a shock.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  But what, and tell me what is happening in terms of all this transhumanism stuff,
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  is that preparation is happening through things like Google Glass,
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  where you are interacting with the internet through glasses.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  Glasses, that's part of you.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  These things that people go around in their ears.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Getting you ready for the brain chips, stay there back in 70 seconds with David Ike, and what comes next, stay with us.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others,
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  This is a five-minute segment.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  We'll have a 12-minute segment with David Ike.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  Then our reporters from the border with breaking news, live video, audio feeds coming up.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  David, you got cut off by the break.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  I continue getting into how this programming works,
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  I don't even read mainline psychology books, they admit, but the public isn't aware of it.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  Then I'm going to come back from break and talk about all the latest scandals, your new book,
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  and what their world will look like if they get what they want
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  versus the fairy tale happy transhumanism they're selling.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  Well, yeah, the transhumanism agenda is absolutely fundamental
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  because they want to introduce technology to the human body.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  Because what we are, what we are is consciousness.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  That's our true state.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  Not form, that's just an experience of various kinds.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  We are consciousness.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  When people have near-death experiences and they leave the body and they can still see,
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  and suddenly they can understand realities and perceive realities over multiple realities at the same time,
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  so many endless people have had near-death experiences, I've told this same story.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  And when you come back in the body, if you like,
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  what the body does is it locks you into this tiny frequency band called visible light.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  So when you leave the body, you leave that limitation,
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  that the body concentrates our reality, our attention into this narrow band of frequencies.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  And what the controllers want, what the manipulators want,
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  is to suppress our awareness, to suppress our consciousness,
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  so we don't expand beyond this frequency band.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  Because once you do, you start to see the world in a different way.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  Because most people at the moment, although it's changing,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  because they are so focused on the five senses, everything is filtered through the five senses.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  It means that they're in this world and they're of it.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  The only source of information they have to get a fix on who they are, where they are, world events, anything,
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  is information, when you're in that five-sense mode alone, coming through the eyes and the ears.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  And who controls that?
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  The education system, the media and peer pressure from people who've been through the education system,
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  I mean programmed by the media.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  So once you're in that mode, you are little more than a computer terminal on an internet.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  But when you expand your awareness beyond that point and you go beyond that limitation,
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  you start to perceive things, you start to have insights.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  Because now, although you're in this world in terms of your body and your experience of this reality,
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  you're not of the world totally in terms of your perception of reality.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  And when people expand their consciousness and start to in effect look into the world,
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  instead of being in it and of it, that's when you're called mad.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  That's when you're called crazy.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  Because you are seeing a reality that most other people aren't seeing.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  And I've used this analogy before, but I think it just so explains where we are.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  We live in a madhouse.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  And if you're born in a madhouse and you grow up in a madhouse, madness to you is sanity.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  And people who come into the madhouse or can see beyond it and say,
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  actually, this is a madhouse and this is why those that can see only the madhouse who think it's normal,
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  that think it's sane, they think the people that can see beyond it are mad.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  This is what's gone on throughout human history.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  And what the controllers want is they want to hold us in that five-sense reality
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  so we don't go into that greater expanded awareness of everything.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  And that's why if you look at the world, Alex, it's all about the five senses.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  Touch this, smell this, look at this.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  It's all about pulling you into the five senses.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  Now, transhumanism is taking that a stage further.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  It's pulling you even further from expanded awareness into the five senses
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  by technologically entrapping you in them.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  It's the new sixth sense.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  They want to shut off the sixth sense with a new artificial consciousness.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  Stay there.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000]  about a potential fortune situation?
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news,
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  Info Wars is the tip of the spear.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  Is this another force-flight-stage attack to take our civil liberties
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  and promote homeland security by sticking our hands down our pants on the streets?
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  against the so-called rebels.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv

[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest-purity iodine available.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the Earth.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  Experience the new formula.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  Shield your family.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  Survival shield X2.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  Available now at infowarslife.com.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  X2 from infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  It's time to take action.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  We're talking about how the globalists openly try to shudder people's awareness,
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  and that means putting you into a false kind of Times Square television box
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  where they can feed you what they want and where you're not even outdoors.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  But beyond that, transhumanism is sold as this empowering system,
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  but it's all got Trojan horses in it to dehumanize
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  and to take us beyond just the five senses into an artificial consciousness.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  Synthetic tyranny.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  And I want to finish up on that subject with David Ike,
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  get into some of the other things that are happening
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  and where they'll take us if they're able to win.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  But first, throwing one more point out,
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  North American Union, they're completely getting rid of our borders.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  We know borders are an old tyranny, another construct.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  But you don't go to pure libertarianism by having open borders
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  and saying millions can come here and get everything free.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  The globalists are pushing it because it's a new political block,
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  again, for divide and conquer.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  And Breitbart reports on the train of death to the U.S.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  all the way from Central and South America,
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  all the way from El Salvador, right up into the United States.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  The representative for the Catholic Relief Services told the Colorado Gazette
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  as well as other publications that, no, they load them up south of Mexico.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  And Mexico now lets them through as long as they stay on the train,
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  they sit on the top, they fall off, they die by the thousands.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  This has been going on for months now and they just let them come right to our border.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  Then the Border Patrol openly takes them, loads them on buses
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  and buses them deeper into the U.S. and releases them.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  We have that on video.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  Meanwhile, if I want to fly, they want to grow up my children
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  and they have army at the kite festival searching people.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  So, clearly, David Ike, this is a total fraud.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  Petraeus told the London Telegraph that this is part of the New North American Union.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  Can you briefly speak to that and I want to talk big picture with you?
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  Well, I mean, the great block on this whole union network,
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  whether it's the European Union or the North American Union
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  and all these others around the world, is the nation state.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  And it is the sense of self-identity or national self-identity, if you like.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  And one of the things you see in their documents,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  when they're talking about how they were, they are doing it,
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  when they were talking about how they intended to socially engineer society
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  and get society how they want.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  One of the things was unfettered immigration.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  This was in their technique to destroy a sense of national identity.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  And so in the European Union, of course, the very nature of the European Union
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  is that within it there are no borders in terms of people coming in and out,
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  virtually no borders.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  And so what you're doing is you're taking loads of people from this culture
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  and you're putting them in that culture and loads of people from that culture,
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  you put them in that culture.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  And in the end, it's just one kind of universal culture, if you like.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  The sense of national identity has gone.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  Now, personally, I'm not a nationalist.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  I love the landscape of Britain, but I'm none of that stuff.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  If we're going to be streetwise, we need to go beyond that
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  and understand why it's happening.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  And the more that you can destroy a sense of national identity, this is the key,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  the more you're diluting resistance to having that national identity
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  officially deleted by bringing these unions together.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  And of course, the Prime Minister of Italy has now come out and said
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  that when they have the presidency of Europe,
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  he's going to press for a United States of Europe.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  Well, what he is, he's just a puppet,
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  because the United States of Europe was planned from well before
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  the original common market ever started.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  And you were a conspiracy theorist if you said that
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  and you've broken it down so beautifully.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  It's not that you're just raw, raw USA.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  They're getting rid of the borders to then bring in groups who will vote
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  to get rid of any semblance of Bill of Rights and Constitution
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  and to form the new core of the social workers to prey on the old group,
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  which is what they've done.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  I've had members of your parliament on.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  Most of social workers are foreigners.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  This is their Balkanization plan.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  They're erasing all cultures and they've brought in economic systems
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  in Latin America to enslave them.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  So they have no choice but to come up here.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  You can really see how they've rolled this whole plan down.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  And it's not that we're even against these immigrants.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  We've got to be streetwise and see if the globalists are for it.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  We need to be against it because it's part of a larger plan.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  Yeah, this is the point, Alex.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  You know, I mentioned earlier about divide and rule.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  And what they do is they play off people that don't want mass immigration
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  against the people who are coming in, the migrants.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  And yet both, this is the thing we need to understand.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  Both are victims of this cabal.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  The immigrants coming into various countries in vast numbers
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  are being used and manipulated just as much as the people in the country.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  And this is where we are.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  And that's how we communicate with them.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  I've actually been successful because we go past the paradigm
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  and say, can't have you all in here getting everything free,
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  but I love you.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  We need to make your country free and explain it to them.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  But it's just so incredibly sophisticated what the globalists have done.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  Let's shift gears now.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  On the time we've got left with David Icke of davidike.com,
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  and I want to talk some about your book,
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  maybe twist your arm till the bottom of the hour,
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  but I know you're busy.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  David, what happens if they win?
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  We know it's not the heavenly transhumanism Ray Kurzweil world
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  because we've got the globalist own documents.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  It's 90-plus percent population reductions.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  The rest of us merge with machines like something out of the Borg.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  Where does the spider want to take us ultimately?
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  Well, it will be a world in which people have no ability to free-think.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  Their thoughts will be downloaded to them,
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  and they will love their servitude.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  Some of these transhumanists are talking about that.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  This is what Aldous Huxley was talking about.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  You get people to love their servitude.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  Although they're robots, you manipulate their minds,
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  so they actually enjoy it.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  We've got a guy in this country called Warwick,
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  Professor Warwick at Reading University.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  Cyborg.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  Don't start me off.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  He's been one of these people that have pushed
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  the microchip agenda and the transhumanist agenda.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  He's saying, well, you know, if you can feel good
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  and feel nice and feel happy,
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  why not get attached to the matrix?
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  It's the complete end of the human being as we know it,
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  where you have the ability to process information
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  and come to your own conclusions.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  That human will exist no more.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  It will be a biological robot
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  that will just respond to stimuli.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  And now DARPA admits what we knew decades ago,
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  and we're cooks, that, oh, we're going to start brain-chipping
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  the troops, and, oh, we've been doing tests for decades.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  They had remote control rats and roaches, as you know,
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  30 years ago, and now they're rolling it out.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  Hey, it's great if you've got epilepsy
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  and a brain stimulator chip makes you be able to live happy.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  The problem is that's now attached to the Internet.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  That wireless system and to the spider,
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  and you literally have now have a control node
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  from the spider hooked into you.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  Yeah, I mean, for me, I mean, there's this movie
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  that's going around in Britain at the moment.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  It would have been in America earlier called Transcendence.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  And that was about the Internet becoming conscious.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  And we're now having scientists speculating
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  on whether the Internet could become conscious.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  I think it's already probably conscious.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  I agree.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  And the idea is to lock us in to that technological consciousness
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  so that it is feeding us all our thoughts.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  And it's something that sounds, well, even less and less now,
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  but to many people will sound completely science fiction.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  But that's where we're going.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  And so when we are seeing this movement to have brain-computer interfaces,
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  that's because the body is basically,
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  I've been saying this for so long.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  It's a biological computer.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  And the brain is a biological computer.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  And it's because of that.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  One's a biological computer.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  One's like a technological computer.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  But because the principles are the same in how they work,
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  the basic principles, that's how you can have brain-computer interfacing.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  The idea is to make that the norm so everyone is connected technologically
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  to this technological collective mind.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  And again, the consciousness of this new AI system being fed the ideas,
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  the dreams of humans, is now a future predicting system
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  with almost total accuracy of mass movements
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  cornering the human market, and that ends free will.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  Because if you can track what the future,
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  and then put in data that will actually change the course
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  and control the future, how long do you think stuff really gets crazy?
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  I wonder, Alex, I wonder if that's not already happening.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  I agree.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Can you, in your gut, a lot of people are picking up on the new consciousness.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  A lot of people feel the dread.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  I don't think it's a very sweet thing that's been created.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  Now, I have been convinced for a long time that we are being fed a reality.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  And the more that we, if you like, get programmed into it,
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  like with these movies that are portraying the world they want,
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  the more powerfully it affects us.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  But it's like I was saying earlier, you know,
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  if I had the wireless internet here, no one could see it,
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  and I had to tune a computer into that frequency to pick up the wireless internet,
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  and I have a whole reality on my screen that can be picked up anywhere in the world,
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  in any culture, because of the worldwide web.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  And all you're doing is locking into that worldwide web through the computer terminal,
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  and therefore you're accessing that collective reality.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  This biological computer is doing that on what we would call the matrix.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  That's the sixth sense. That's the sixth sense right there.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  David, you'll be gone in ten minutes.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  Stay there. I want to come back one more little segment to finish your thoughts.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  Alex Jones, incredible interview. Stay with us.

[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why bank stock workers' investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  When you refuse to take no for an answer, when you refuse to even accept the possibility that you will give up,
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  and that you know that the day you keel over and leave this reality, you'll still be doing it,
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  and you'll still be trying, and you'll still be doing what you can,
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  then when big challenges come up, when you get the abuse, when you get people trying to undermine you,
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  when people attack you, when people ridicule you, because giving up is simply not an option,
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  it means that instead of feeling sorry for yourself and walking away and sitting in a corner or walking away and thinking,
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  you know, I'm not doing this anymore, you keep walking, you keep moving, you do more, you are persistent,
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  and when you do that, you break down barriers, and key to that over the years is that what people have said is shown to have validity.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  I mean, when I was at the height of my ridicule, which was almost a historic proportions in this country in the 1990s, early 1990s,
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  I was of the belief that if what I said had any validity, then it would be shown eventually to be so,
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  and then all that abuse would start, and ridicule would start to fade away,
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  it wouldn't mean it would go, my goodness me, it hasn't, but it would start to fade as more and more people went,
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  hold on a second, what this bloke said then, it's happening, and then you go on to the next thing, more persistence,
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  more persistence, and that process repeats itself and repeats itself,
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  and eventually you part the seas if you like, and more and more people start to see actually this person, whoever it is,
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  is actually worth listening to because they've got a track record, look, it's happening what they said,
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  and this is why I say to people, if you hide and keep your mouth shut and don't speak your truth because you fear the reaction of others,
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  then you are not going to have that process of eventually people saying, hold on a second, what he said is happening,
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  my goodness, what else is he saying, because you've never said it, because you were frightened to,
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  because people would ridicule you or condemn you or whatever, if we don't have the backbone to speak our truth,
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  whatever that truth may be, then how can any of us talk about freedom?
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  Because there's no greater freedom than being able to speak your truth no matter what it is.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  Without that fundamental freedom, there is no other freedom.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  It's persistence and it's having the balls basically to say things that are unacceptable to society at that time,
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  take the consequences of that but keep saying them until the day dawns when people start to say, hold on a second,
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  it's not as mad as we thought it was, look, and without those two things, then you're never going to be successful in communicating this information.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  And it's like that anywhere in life, they want people to be spectators who aren't on the field and I didn't really know the answer to that when I asked it,
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  but that's total truth, what you said, veritas, sage advice, having the basic fundamentals, having your instincts, having the research, the history,
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  and knowing you're right and never stopping, that's what they're scared of and that's why we've been successful.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  We haven't been caught off in the end fighting, it's because we had a passion for freedom and truth, we've been successful.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  David Ike, it's great to know you, davidike.com, the new books out.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  We really appreciate you spending time with us and hopefully you'll be back with us again very soon.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  Thank you. Wembley Arena, 25th of October, I'm putting it all together.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  Oh, we'd love to promote that before we come back on about that. Wembley Arena, davidike.com, we'll be back with a report from the border.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  Thank you so much, david.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out, get electrically, it's begun, you can fail it.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:10.000]  And when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep. I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it, she's just not the woman I married.
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:34.000]  Oh Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much, get healthy and detoxify.
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:24.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  Again, about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:49.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:59.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  In South Texas, our reporters are at the far international bridge and they had to get out of there because of, quote, a dangerous situation.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  So they're going to be connecting with us soon. I didn't intend to come in with dangerous zone when the reporters just had to disconnect and get out of there.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  So I don't know what's happening right now down there on the border. But the trains of death are arriving daily all the way from Central America.
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  They're given passage. As long as they do not jump off the train, they're not taken to forced labor camps in Mexico.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  Mexico has always had the most draconian immigration laws in this hemisphere. Even the New York Times admits that the shame of Mexico's immigration law, I think, was the headline last year.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  But now they've made a deal that unlimited from Guatemala all the way down to El Salvador, the Gazette.com Colorado Gazette reports with the charities, the Catholic Church and others that are loading up the people and bringing them up into the United States where the
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  border patrol militarily salutes, puts them on buses to bring them in deeper, gives them vouchers to be sent to whoever they want to go to. I mean, just open borders with the government, conduiting the Central and South American people of the destitute with their
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  children. I mean, just pouring in. This is an unbelievable criminal operation. And they're going to get away with it. And they're going to get away with funding al-Qaeda to take over Iraq and Syria, calling them ISIS.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  And they're going to get away with anything, I guess, if we let them. And here's the issue about crime. Once a government gets to this level with tyranny, the sky's the limit.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  And we've now reached it. You think this is crazy? They'll probably start arresting people like me and just shooting patriots in the street or something. And then a civil war will start. I mean, there's, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs has no criminal record.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  I'm going to get him on the air about this. Maybe tomorrow. I just got swamped with the news. And he sold the three or four guns he had. He's been in the army gone for years before he moved down here to raise some cash.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  He got down here and he wants to get a rifle and stuff to go shooting with us. And he goes in time after time. They go, oh, sorry, you've been denied. We'll call you back. And they never do. Well, it's supposed to then trigger that they're supposed to give you the gun.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  There's no record. They won't do it. He honorable discharge. He's got the plaque on his office, purple heart, blacks, all nine yards, Esquire magazine articles about him jumping off armored vehicles and stabbing al-Qaeda in the neck and all the rest of it.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  He's a well-known soldier and he cannot get a gun. And most vets I know, Korea war vets, Vietnam vets. I know guys that are grandpas. One guy's a famous NFL football player.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  It was a UT football player. I talked to him at a party, a birthday party years ago. It's been going on for a while, about five years ago. And he cannot get a rifle for his grandson and he can't buy guns.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  He's got dozens of guns. It has no criminal record. They just, no one will sell him a gun. And that's because there's this lawlessness.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  I mean, the illegals are legal. There's no law. They just do it. It's violating the law. There's no law. They can't give him a gun, but they won't sell him one because it's all digital under FBI control and the NIC system.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  And you've seen Bill Clinton when he left office. They denied 87,000 troops being able to have guns. They just put them on a list. Have they ever even been interviewed for PTSD?
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  Well, you're not allowed to own guns via PTSD. At the time the diagnosis is wrong. But the issue here is this is the undemocratic, extrajudicial purge where the bureaucracy does whatever it wants and selectively enforces laws or doesn't even follow the law.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  And that's what this whole digital system is about. That's why they want to ban private sales. That's why they want to ban you selling your neighbor a gun or giving your son a gun or giving grandpa a gun or vice versa.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  I've given my dad probably four guns over the years. He's probably given me ten guns. And I've got them all. And they've all gone up in value.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  And the reason you get more guns is they're cool. You want to have more? You shoot them. You talk to them. It's a culture. And extrajudicially, folks, if they can get to veterans, they're going to get us all.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  A lot of people go, I don't care. I'm not a veteran. I don't care if they take their guns. I love this self-centered way people think.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  As if, oh, it's not happening to me today. Like, I don't care. I don't own a coal power plant. Why do I care if they shut it off? Because half of your energy comes from it, dummy.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  People are, they think their ignorance and their arrogance is a shield. It's not. It's an enslavement.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  Okay, they just reconnected from the far bridge. That's the name of the bridge. They'll tell you the town they're near. This is where Breitbart was.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  Sunday, where the Border Patrol told them they couldn't be there, quote, for their safety, they're at the International Bridge, right down on the edge of the border, and the Rio Grande on the United States side, right there by Military Highway 281.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  And they are reporting from that area. I wanted to tell us why they just had to pull out a moment ago to a, quote, safer place. What run-ins they've had with the Border Patrol is trying to get the press out of the area.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  Because they don't want people getting video of this train of death coming in. And other things that happened since I talked to them on the Sunday show last night.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  Kit Daniels and Rob Jacobson reporting from the border. Kit, what can you tell us?
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  Well, we just drove from Brownsville, Texas, about 60 miles parallel to the Mexican border to reach here for our International Bridge. And this entire time we've seen only one Border Patrol vehicle, this entire trip.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  Yet, we've seen maybe four or five state troopers on the way up here. And we, last night, we randomly took a side road near the border near Brownsville.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  And we encountered a wide open border gate, completely wide open, unguarded.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  And I wanted to come here to emphasize the fact that here, an International Bridge, which is very well known, is, it looks like an actual what you would expect on the border.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  But, going back to the south where we came from, on this, to reach here, we've only, we've seen several holes in the border fence and it's just unbelievable.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  And only one Border Patrol agent.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  Well, you know, I told you this basically was the headline yesterday. National Review went with it today.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  What an open border looks like in the Rio Grande Valley, illegal border crossers are surrendering voluntarily. That is the headline today, Kit.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  That's what's happening. The Border Patrol is now a delivery agent, a taxi service to get them to Greyhound buses and pay for the ticket.
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  And so, what we want to do here is go with that and then go with the headline in the video, Border Patrol leaves border gates open.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  Border Patrol stands down, sub-headline, border effectively erased.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  And then just write about how they're a taxi service, showing the Jacarie Jackson video of them admitting they paid them, now get them into the interior.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  And we have total treason documented.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  Then cherry on top in the article you're going to write tonight, and you've got a fabulous job, is why are there checkpoints on the highways?
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  Why is there army at the kite festival in Austin searching people?
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  Why is the TSA groping us?
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  This is total sickening treason. This is unbelievable. Kit, please continue reporting.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  And I read Kurt Nemo's article this morning about Senator Feinstein saying, hey, another 9-11 is going to happen.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  The terrorists are just going to, we've got to have intelligence, abuse the forced amendment to save us from terrorists.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  But what I've seen the past few days is wide open borders where illegal aliens can just roam across the border with immunity.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  And when they do encounter border patrol agents, a few that actually do, they are treated better than what we're treated when we are in line at the airport, the TSA.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  So it shows, to look into the border collapse that's now occurring is key to understanding how government spins reality.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  They will take a, it's just, it goes back to the Roland Empert deal, Clinton's problem reaction solution. They're going to take a crisis, or a government created crisis, and spin it to their agenda to take away our rights,
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  but at the same time expand government powers. That's what we're seeing right now.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  It's key to understand that the government is using this to, not only their own agenda, but they're also spinning the war on terrorism to fit their own agenda as well.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  Well, Kit, you've done a great job. We're going to come back to you in a few minutes. That lobs a little windy there in the high wind.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  We're going to try to go to handheld here. So I'm going to go back to you in just a moment there.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  Our reporters down on the South Texas border with Mexico confirming just all sorts of critical data.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  Again, we broke last week and Drudge Report carried it. DrudgeReport.com carried the infowars.com and prisonpunna.com articles confirming that the border patrol buses them in from the border and then pays to put them on Greyhound to ship them anywhere they want to go.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  That's confirmed on video. The border is wide open, but if I want to go to a UT football game, they now have TSA style checkpoints.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  A man will grab my genitals. So I'm not going, even though I don't want to see the game anyways. I'm not going.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  You know, when families in town might want to go, I still occasionally every few years will go to a UT football game just to see the spectacle of the simulated warfare and then people being turned into animals.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  But expanding on all of that, it is just absolutely incredible that we have gotten to this point as a society that the government can openly fund Al Qaeda and we cover it for three years plus the proxy war in Syria.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  Then they change the name from Al Qaeda to ISIS and have them invade Iraq. And Obama goes, I don't think I'll help the president. I don't think I'll help the prime minister.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  We're just going to, you know, let them take over because they run them. I mean, I mean, I'm getting to the point now with cops or anybody running around all paranoid, like there's terrorists everywhere.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  It's an excuse to take over. And to be down there and see border gates just open and to have the Border Patrol come up to our guys, I want to have them go back down to the border checkpoint.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  That's only about 100 yards away because guaranteed they'll run up and say, get out of here, get out of here. Then we can say, hey, we're here to report that you guys are busing them into the country and giving them vouchers.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  We need that interaction with them showing that they're being told this. That is absolutely essential. But there's the headline, city official admits Border Patrol fronting cash to bus illegals.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  Border Patrol, purchasing bus tickets, vouchers for illegal immigrants while saddling border towns with housing burden. I mean, it literally is to collapse the country.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:08.000]  The most poor, no jobs, no school, multiple kids, women just showing up to go directly on the welfare roll and to vote 100% Democratic.
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  And the Republican leadership's going along with it because they want to defeat the Tea Party. They want to balkanize and break the country up.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000]  Were we able to get a better mic?
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  All right, well, we'll have to go back to that one if it doesn't have, maybe it broke. I don't know.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  But maybe we can get them to go down by the Border Patrol checkpoint itself or tell us why they moved from that position to where they're at.
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  Maybe get into an area where there's not a bunch of wind so we can talk to them. But again, ladies and gentlemen, reporting for infowars.com from the border.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  I mean, listen, they say it's racist if you point out that totally undocumented illegals carry diseases. I mean, have you been to South America, Central America?
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  Doctors warn of looming health crisis due to flood of young illegal immigrants.
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  Well, that's what it's supposed to do is bankrupt the country. What do you think Obamacare is? What do you think?
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What do you think shutting down the power plants is?
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  This is the reality. New sensors will scoop up big data on Chicago.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  Metal fixtures going up will grab every that look like pieces of sculpture, but they'll provide big step forward. The Chicago understands itself observing the city's people and surroundings.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  Inside of the sculptures will be quote data collection sensors and see they call it a air quality, light intensity, sound volume.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  That's microphones. See, they're not putting up light poles that have microphones that listen to you. It's a sound volume or gunshot detector.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:58.000]  Though it's used to listen to you. See, this is 1984. It's not Chicago's putting up Homeland Security funded systems that have cell towers hidden in them.
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  We broke this a few months ago in Seattle to steal all your data and it turns out it's illegal. So they had to stop.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  No, no, no. In Chicago, it's a sculpture. You're not against art, are you? New sensors will scoop up big data on Chicago.
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  The sensors will also count people by measuring wireless signals on mobile devices. This was put in eight years ago, first in England, now in other cities in the U.S. last year and this year.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  And it tracks everything you do in real time. Bypassing even the telecoms, paying to get the data from them.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  It's just government's going to grab the data from you itself but also have its own network. But it's in a sculpture.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  Yeah, I mean, come on. And people still keep making jokes about me covering the New York Times years ago about the new light bulbs can have wireless systems put into them.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  That flicker data to communicate with new sensors that come in computer pads or that are inside the computer that then lets the government remote access your computer.
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  I mean, that's New York Times and it's a big liberal thing making fun of me that he thinks the light bulbs are spying on you.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  Okay, we've got the crew back, guys. What was it? You said it was a dangerous area you were in and so you guys had to move before coming on. What happened there and what else has been unfolding, Kit?
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  We took a back road just south of the highway and looked for a place near the border fence to make our shoot. And there was, we passed by a police station, like a little small town police station, which just so happens to have one of those surveillance towers.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  And we looked at it and I was like, wow, what is that? Why is that out here? So we kept driving and it's just wide open fences, no border patrol whatsoever. It's just it gives you really eerie, uncomfortable feeling.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  It's all just brush land. Like just about anybody can hide anywhere out there.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  Now, we've got a report you filed. I thought it was coming. You guys did such a great job shooting this. It's already done. We're going to premiere it here coming up in the next segment and keep you summoned to overdrive.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  Kit Daniels and Rob Jacobson are reporting from the Texas border, but in this new video, and I think we're going to title it, I guess, border wide open border patrol stands down or border patrol leaves gates open.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  I guess we already have the video that we're about to show folks when we come back from break. Describe what else you've seen, Kit.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  It just hit me like a ton of bricks. The state troopers and the small town cops here are trying to are doing a better job at border security and what the border patrol can do.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  That's why we just saw a city surveillance tower right near the border. Like driving up here, we saw like two or three like two or three state troopers parked several just every so often down the highway.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  The state of Texas and local police are having to step in to protect the border.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  And let's be clear. Just like in Mexico, the government wouldn't do its job and disarm the people so the crime rate exploded. Citizens got guns illegally restored order. Just like the feds are stepping back.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  That's a major important angle right there to confirm in the new report on when you guys get back. So you're coming back tonight is the fact that Texas steps in when border patrol stands down because you say you've seen almost no border patrol and I've been down there.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  It's usually crawling. So now you're seeing state police and locals having to step in.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  And I want to emphasize that the border patrol agent that we did see, he was just on the side on the shoulder of highway 281 is likely probably taking a phone call.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  It wasn't like we saw him out in the badlands that we just drove through.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  This is amazing. I've got your special report coming up and we're going to come back to you. Kit Daniels from the border info wars dot com. I'm Alex Jones and we're going to come back and play this report. Stay with us.

[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  We've got some new items coming this week. Made in America apparel and new Molan Labe belt buckles as well. Coming to madein1776.com.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and go to the border report showing more evidence of a complete treasonous stand down.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  In the border city of Brownsville, Texas, the incredible decrease of border patrol activity emphasizes that not only is the border patrol stretched thin, but agents are also being pressured to stand down from enforcing immigration laws as the federal government also begins to enact a media blackout on America's vanishing borders.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  If you're here at the international border in Brownsville, Texas, and as you can see, there's hardly any border patrol whatsoever, even at the border.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  You would think with the current flood of tens of thousands of immigrants from Central America overwhelming our borders, Brownsville would be crawling with border patrol vehicles.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  But, on the extreme contrary, we saw no exaggeration, while over 10 times the many border patrol vehicles parked at various facilities and we saw driving the streets in and around Brownsville.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  In fact, we stood for well over an hour outside the border checkpoint in the city and only saw maybe one border patrol vehicle every 10 to 15 minutes drive by.
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Just look at this wide open border fence. It's at night and nobody's guarding it. It's wide open. This just highlights the illusion of border security by the Obama administration.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  Consider the fact that the surge of immigrant youth has increased from 6,500 in 2011 to 90,000 this year alone, an increase of over 1,300%, and it's crystal clear that the Obama administration is forcing the border patrol to back off of enforcing existing immigration laws.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  One of the very few border patrol agents that we observed actually patrolling South Texas took a very keen interest in us. As you can see, he speeds up to catch up to our vehicle and likely ran her place.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  He tried to flag him down to talk to him, but he didn't respond. He told us very closely for several minutes nearly all the way into downtown Brownsville before he finally peeled off.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  We were driving around the border. I guess he took an interest in us.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  We're standing outside a legal immigration detention facility about 40 miles northeast of Brownsville, Texas.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  We drove down to the guard station and asked if we could take a tour of the facility as journalists, but they refused, told us to turn around, and even told us to stop recording.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  They were journalists out of Austin. Is it possible for us to take a look around?
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  No, sir.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  Drive around?
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  No.
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  You will have to call in and get an appointment.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  There are signs. You do have one sign. That's going to be recorded.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.000]  Okay.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  That's fine.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  In the past few weeks, the feds have been shutting down areas immediately on the U.S. side of the border, which have traditionally been open to the public. There they are closing them down by citing safety concerns.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  Do not enter authorized personnel only. Signs like these have been popping up in the last couple of weeks on our side of the border. They keep the public and the press away and in the dark about the border collapse.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  This is simply a media blackout that allows the Obama administration to control the narrative on illegal immigration. They've already been doing just that by deceptively skewing the number of deportations in their favor by classifying cases where...
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:44.000]  All right. We'll be right back, folks. We'll put the full report up on infowords.com so radio listeners can see it in the next 30 minutes.
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  Visit GCN Live.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:46.000]  We'll be back in overdrive.
[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:56.000]  This is some final analysis. Stay with us. Infowars.com.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  The new Infowars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:57.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:58.000]  Network.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:06.000]  Big Brother.
[03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  Final segment, doing a bit of overdrive here.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  Lord willing, I'll be back live tomorrow at 11 a.m. with a weekday transmission.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  Big broadcast week coming up.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  Oh, boy.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  I tell you, just seeing our borders wide open, seeing the Border Patrol going after the media,
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  seeing the Border Patrol pay to ship people deeper into the U.S., seeing them leave the gates open at night.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  They've been given orders to get rid of the border North American Union.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  Kit, any other points you think are important to make or breaking news you're going to have when you get back to Austin?
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  Any little prelude to there or anything Jacobson running camera would like to say about his observations?
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  Well, first, I want to point out that sign right there.
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  I don't know if you can see it on there.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  That is the largest gun control sign I've ever seen in my life.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  It's exactly the kind of signs that Michael Bloomberg would love to see on every street corner in America.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  Yeah, earlier, before your Skype degraded, it was crystal clear.
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  It said warning, firearms ammunition are illegal in Mexico.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  You will be arrested.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  And you should get some digital photos of that.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.000]  That's a whole other story to show that they have the highest crime rate in the world.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  And there it is.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  Bloomberg should love it because only the drug dealers and the criminal government have the weapons.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  I mean, they might as well put a sign on the Mexican side as welcome to USA criminals.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  That big of a sign.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  The second point I wanted to make is that we talk a lot about Cloward and Piven.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  As far as I saw an article in Info Wars, I think about two weeks ago about how Cloward and Piven is being used to bring in amnesty.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  But it goes beyond that.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  Cloward and Piven is being used to bring in the North American Union.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  We see the CIA the past several decades basically collapse South America and Central America with their misdeeds.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  And then now we see Mexico is pretty much opening up their southern border because they're going to believe that El Norte will take care of the problem.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  They're like, well, they're not going to stay in Mexico.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  They're just going to go up North.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:28.000]  So why should we worry about that?
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Yeah, now Senator Corn says give money to Mexico, billions so that they'll make it more orderly.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  And they'll probably, you know, fund first class tickets up here.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  The Republican leadership is deeply involved.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  This is the North American Union plan to take over this country on record.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  And that's a great point that you make about, listen, we say Cloward and Piven because I'd covered it over a decade ago.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  That kind of popularized it.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  As soon as 21, all of it is, is create crises off of the solution.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  It's the Gaelian dialectic.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  But Cloward and Piven is a very good example of the Democrats honing it down to an economic model.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  And that's what this is.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  And you watch that they've already said amnesty is the way to fix the flood of illegals because you just make them legal.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  Absolutely.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  And it goes back to what I said earlier about problem reaction solution.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  Senator Feinstein is looking at, oh, well, terrorism, we have to give the NSA more funding and more power to save us from terrorists.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  It's a typical problem reaction solution.
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000]  And then they're funding and running and helping the terrorists.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  Well, you've got a lot to report when you get back.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  A lot of HD videos about to go live on infowars.com.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  If you're a radio listener and missed what we just played, we'll have the full report up there.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  But again, great job.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  I know it's a dangerous area.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  I appreciate both of you.
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  You want to Jacobson just aim the camera at the sign if he wants, ask him if he's got any final points he wants to make.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  Yeah, sure.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  It was pretty shocking to me last night when we drove up on that open gate.
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  I was actually pretty startled.
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  And my impression was is like, well, they just opened it up.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  Come on in.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  Why not just have a big red carpet for them?
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  And this morning doing a little thinking and I it occurred to me we have a government that doesn't deport illegally aliens.
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  They're actually importing illegal aliens.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  And it's pretty troubling kind of a twilight zone place in history that we're living in right now.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  And we should all pay attention to the fact that there are wide 50 yard holes just open for anybody to walk through on literally hidden little roads in the back of Texas.
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  And then now they're blocking them so the media can't get there.
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  That's not just us, but others confirming it.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  You know, one of the border patrol, it's now the immigrant importation agency.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  So that'd be IIA.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  They're going to change the name.
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  We need a satire article, but it's not satire.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  Border patrol to officially change name to immigrant importation agency.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  Part of the Department of Treason.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  In the near future.
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:07.000]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:11.000]  Alert. Security. Alert. This is Homeland Security.
[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  Analysis. Info wars. Building independent media operation.
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:22.000]  Prime Directive. Discredit. Alex Jones.
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:28.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:35.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000]  They're never going to stop.
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  They're never going to deviate from their program.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  Until we stop them.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  Block free iPhone app at info wars.com.
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:48.000]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  Imperatives see truly simple planet TV.
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:06:06.000]  Now, collectively it's begun. You can fail it.
