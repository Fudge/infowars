[00:00.000 --> 00:11.120]  When I listened to Joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when I won.
[00:11.120 --> 00:12.720]  I won that election.
[00:12.720 --> 00:17.240]  And if you look at Crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people,
[00:17.240 --> 00:21.080]  there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup.
[00:21.080 --> 00:23.600]  They came after me spying on my campaign.
[00:23.600 --> 00:27.440]  They started from the day I won, and even before I won, from the day I came down the
[00:27.440 --> 00:29.240]  escalator with our first lady.
[00:29.240 --> 00:31.040]  They were a disaster.
[00:31.040 --> 00:32.840]  They were a disgrace to our country.
[00:32.840 --> 00:34.000]  And we've caught them.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.160]  We've caught them all.
[00:35.160 --> 00:36.440]  We've got it all on tape.
[00:36.440 --> 00:37.440]  We've caught them all.
[00:37.440 --> 00:40.680]  And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn.
[00:40.680 --> 00:44.720]  You better take a look at that, because we caught you, in a sense, and President Obama
[00:44.720 --> 00:45.720]  was sitting in the office.
[00:45.720 --> 00:46.720]  He knew about it, too.
[00:46.720 --> 00:49.200]  So don't tell me about a free transition.
[00:49.200 --> 00:52.600]  As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster.
[00:52.600 --> 00:57.480]  A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay.
[00:57.480 --> 00:58.480]  You're soliciting.
[00:58.480 --> 00:59.480]  They're asking.
[00:59.480 --> 01:00.480]  They send it back.
[01:00.480 --> 01:01.480]  You send it back.
[01:01.480 --> 01:02.480]  I did that.
[01:02.480 --> 01:06.200]  If you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country.
[01:06.200 --> 01:07.200]  There's fraud.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.680]  They found them in creeks.
[01:08.680 --> 01:10.320]  They found some with the name Trump.
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.320]  Just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a waste paper basket.
[01:14.320 --> 01:16.240]  They're being sent all over the place.
[01:16.240 --> 01:18.400]  They sent two in a Democrat area.
[01:18.400 --> 01:20.240]  They sent out a thousand ballots.
[01:20.240 --> 01:21.560]  Everybody got two ballots.
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.280]  This is going to be a fraud, like you've never seen.
[01:24.280 --> 01:26.980]  The other thing, it's nice on November 3rd.
[01:26.980 --> 01:30.680]  You're watching and you see who won the election, and I think we're going to do well because
[01:30.680 --> 01:33.240]  people are really happy with the job we've done.
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.240]  But you know what?
[01:34.240 --> 01:35.240]  We won't know.
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.800]  We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over.
[01:38.800 --> 01:40.480]  Take a look at what happened in Manhattan.
[01:40.480 --> 01:42.600]  Take a look at what happened in New Jersey.
[01:42.600 --> 01:45.280]  Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places.
[01:45.280 --> 01:48.120]  They're not losing 2%, 1%, which, by the way, is too much.
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.160]  An election could be won or lost with that.
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.680]  They're losing 30% and 40%.
[01:52.680 --> 01:55.320]  It's a fraud and it's a shame.
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.920]  Can you imagine where they say, you have to have your ballot in by November 10th?
[02:00.920 --> 02:02.000]  November 10th.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.440]  That means that's seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced.
[02:07.440 --> 02:09.440]  We have major states with that.
[02:09.440 --> 02:10.440]  All run by Democrats.
[02:10.440 --> 02:11.440]  Two minutes.
[02:11.440 --> 02:12.440]  All run by Democrats.
[02:12.440 --> 02:16.840]  President Trump, you're going to be able to continue.
[02:16.840 --> 02:21.000]  You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.400]  You say it's rigged, that it's going to lead to fraud, but in 2018, in the last midterm
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.640]  election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting.
[02:31.640 --> 02:36.400]  That was a quarter, more than a quarter of all the voters that year cast their ballots
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.760]  by mail.
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.240]  Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it
[02:43.240 --> 02:49.080]  and are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any
[02:49.080 --> 02:50.080]  dispute?
[02:50.080 --> 02:52.480]  I think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely.
[02:52.480 --> 02:56.880]  I don't think, well, I hope we don't need them in terms of the election itself, but
[02:56.880 --> 03:00.360]  for the ballots, I think so, because what's happening is incredible.
[03:00.360 --> 03:08.160]  I just heard, I read today, where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated.
[03:08.160 --> 03:09.160]  They take them.
[03:09.160 --> 03:10.160]  We don't like them.
[03:10.160 --> 03:11.160]  We don't like them.
[03:11.160 --> 03:12.160]  They throw them out.
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.160]  But what are you going to do about it if there are millions of ballots going out like
[03:13.160 --> 03:14.160]  that?
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.160]  What you do is you go and vote.
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.160]  You do a solicited ballot, and that's okay.
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.160]  I know you're going to vote.
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.920]  I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people have received it.
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.920]  You go and vote.
[03:21.920 --> 03:24.320]  No, but what I'm saying is, is there anything you want to do about the fact that millions
[03:24.320 --> 03:25.320]  of people...
[03:25.320 --> 03:28.840]  You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in, they're sending
[03:28.840 --> 03:30.440]  it back and you're sending.
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.280]  They have mailmen with lots of it.
[03:32.280 --> 03:33.400]  Did you see what's going on?
[03:33.400 --> 03:36.520]  Take a look at West Virginia, mailmen selling the ballots.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.600]  They're being sold.
[03:37.600 --> 03:39.320]  They're being dumped in rivers.
[03:39.320 --> 03:41.160]  This is a horrible thing for our country.
[03:41.160 --> 03:43.160]  There is no evidence of that.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.160]  There is no evidence of that.
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.160]  This is not going to end well.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  There is no evidence of that.
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  This is not going to end well.
[03:47.160 --> 03:53.640]  And five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more, five, including
[03:53.640 --> 03:55.540]  two Republican states.
[03:55.540 --> 04:02.000]  Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period not to engage
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.760]  in any civil unrest?
[04:03.760 --> 04:09.000]  And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.600]  been independently certified?
[04:11.600 --> 04:12.600]  President Trump, you go first.
[04:12.600 --> 04:18.040]  I urge my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what
[04:18.040 --> 04:19.040]  has to happen.
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.880]  I am urging them to do it.
[04:20.880 --> 04:22.840]  As you know, today there was a big problem.
[04:22.840 --> 04:24.840]  In Philadelphia, they went in to watch.
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.360]  They were called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing.
[04:28.360 --> 04:29.360]  They were thrown out.
[04:29.360 --> 04:30.920]  They weren't allowed to watch.
[04:30.920 --> 04:31.920]  You know why?
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.960]  Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things.
[04:34.960 --> 04:37.600]  And I am urging my people.
[04:37.600 --> 04:39.120]  I hope it's going to be a fair election.
[04:39.120 --> 04:41.960]  If it's a fair election, I am 100 percent sure.
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.400]  President Trump knocked it out of the park.
[04:43.400 --> 04:45.120]  A lot of people are saying he did a terrible job.
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.160]  No, he did an incredible job.
[04:48.160 --> 04:53.160]  Folks that sit there in Monday morning quarterback things have never been in the arena.
[04:53.160 --> 04:59.160]  Stay with us.
[04:59.160 --> 05:07.280]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.480]  which are well beyond what they should be.
[05:11.480 --> 05:18.560]  It's estimated that 200 million people have died, 200 million people have died.
[05:18.560 --> 05:21.600]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[05:21.600 --> 05:26.240]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60 percent of America has died from
[05:26.240 --> 05:31.560]  COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality, he would honestly say 6 million have lung
[05:31.560 --> 05:33.280]  scarring and heart damage.
[05:33.280 --> 05:34.280]  It's all made up.
[05:34.280 --> 05:35.280]  But you know where you got it?
[05:35.280 --> 05:38.320]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.160]  They said that 4 percent of America would be dead already.
[05:43.160 --> 05:48.280]  Of course, it's 0.000 and then add a number because the numbers vary.
[05:48.280 --> 05:52.960]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[05:52.960 --> 06:15.760]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind controlled.
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.880]  Well I am not a cheerleader for President Trump.
[06:17.880 --> 06:19.000]  I am not a cult member.
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.280]  I don't just agree with his performance because I want to be positive.
[06:24.280 --> 06:31.400]  I think overall Trump got an A- yesterday and that's an A- in the debate up against
[06:31.400 --> 06:37.320]  Chris Wallace and Joe Biden who were both double teaming him and interrupting him and
[06:37.320 --> 06:44.800]  lying and Wallace fact checking Trump in live time which is debating him.
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.880]  One precedent even from four years ago where they had multiple moderators ganging up on
[06:50.880 --> 06:55.960]  President Trump with Hillary there like a devilish hyena cackling.
[06:55.960 --> 07:02.640]  So I know that Olly Alexander is a smart guy, Mike Cernovich is a great guy, a lot of people
[07:02.640 --> 07:08.520]  are out there, even Carpe Donkton who usually never criticizes Trump thought that Trump
[07:08.520 --> 07:11.120]  got his ass kicked.
[07:11.120 --> 07:15.000]  And I guess if you have that view maybe it's you know you get to kind of be the Monday
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.280]  morning quarterback and people are entitled to their views.
[07:18.280 --> 07:20.920]  I just didn't see the same debate.
[07:20.920 --> 07:28.400]  I saw Chris Wallace controlling things with the questions he asked and Trump not going
[07:28.400 --> 07:32.600]  where he could of sometimes by just basically ignoring the fake loaded questions.
[07:32.600 --> 07:38.160]  But the way Wallace interrupted him five times more that's the number they've done the math
[07:38.160 --> 07:40.560]  then Biden was just incredible.
[07:40.560 --> 07:46.880]  On top of that, I don't just say that Joe Biden clearly had blood transfusions that's
[07:46.880 --> 07:48.480]  what these rich people do.
[07:48.480 --> 07:53.560]  They even have big global companies now where parents sign agreements and the kids sign agreements
[07:53.560 --> 08:01.320]  and the children get paid $500 or more for their blood as young as seven.
[08:01.320 --> 08:07.120]  I mean Peter Till's come out with a company that does this and the Queen Mother lived
[08:07.120 --> 08:08.800]  past 100 on these things.
[08:08.800 --> 08:12.480]  So when you see him suddenly look like he gained about 10 pounds.
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.160]  He disappeared last week and now he's all plump and he's all rosy.
[08:16.160 --> 08:20.400]  If he looked at his hands I looked at his hands from a week ago more plump.
[08:20.400 --> 08:26.700]  That's how you know they were putting in him probably two or three pints of blood a day
[08:26.700 --> 08:28.520]  for a week.
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.160]  And when you put in young people's blood that's what happens.
[08:33.160 --> 08:36.640]  The super rich are injecting blood from teenagers to gain immortality.
[08:36.640 --> 08:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was approached when I was out at a kind of Richie Rich type party
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.280]  a few years ago in the hills of Austin kind of over in the same area where Joe Rogan lived
[08:48.280 --> 08:53.560]  today and there was a medical doctor there and he's like, yeah, you ought to come by.
[08:53.560 --> 08:56.800]  We got your blood transfusions all been screened.
[08:56.800 --> 08:57.800]  It's all clean.
[08:57.800 --> 08:58.800]  It'll make you higher to kite.
[08:58.800 --> 09:03.120]  It'll make you feel like you're 15 years old again and he had like a 55 year old wife
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.600]  she looked like she was about 35 he was like 60 he looked like he was about 45 they were
[09:08.600 --> 09:09.600]  just glowing.
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.440]  It was blood folks.
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.480]  So I know people that are almost 80 years old that get blood who are rich every week
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.160]  and they're nice people but they get young people's blood here in Austin and it definitely
[09:21.160 --> 09:24.280]  is rejuvenating.
[09:24.280 --> 09:26.800]  So I'm telling you he was not on a bunch of methamphetamine.
[09:26.800 --> 09:34.000]  He probably took some Adderall or something but Biden was clearly on blood.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.560]  First time I ever heard about this was Queen Mother stuff like 20 something years ago and
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.600]  Al Gore was an AP article has a little refrigerator that goes around with him on private jets
[09:42.600 --> 09:48.720]  and he gets daily blood transfusions sometimes.
[09:48.720 --> 09:58.000]  So guaranteed folks on some type of designer and Fatima and on blood because he was a different
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  person entirely.
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.760]  A lot of folks think oh he must have a wire in his ear now he was responding too quickly.
[10:06.760 --> 10:13.080]  He did a lot of debate preparation but the blood the blood you put somebody old like
[10:13.080 --> 10:17.040]  that on in fatimines alone they'll they'll they'll just be irritable and out of control
[10:17.040 --> 10:19.360]  and it'll just accentuate the weirdness.
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.360]  You give him blood it's another deal.
[10:20.360 --> 10:22.600]  I'm not going to rant about that all day.
[10:22.600 --> 10:28.000]  It's just a fact that that goes on and one thing does that it's called blood.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.440]  He didn't start eating 15 cheeseburgers a day the last week and gained 10 pounds.
[10:32.440 --> 10:38.000]  He's got 10 pounds of blood extra floating around in him and it supercharges you that's
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.440]  what Lance Armstrong you know has said it wasn't the steroids it wasn't any of it.
[10:42.440 --> 10:49.280]  It was the fact that he would just absolutely dump 5, 6, 7, 8 pints of blood himself which
[10:49.280 --> 10:55.520]  is super dangerous he would go to the limit before race with oxygenated blood that he
[10:55.520 --> 10:59.840]  take from himself when he was training in the mountains months before refrigerate and
[10:59.840 --> 11:04.840]  so he would then have that supercharged you know very very high blood cell saturation
[11:04.840 --> 11:08.680]  the blood cells were trained from altitude be able to take on a lot of oxygen so he would
[11:08.680 --> 11:16.240]  be going up the French you know Alps with the back tire jumping back and forth with
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.400]  so much power when everybody else was slowing down he was going faster uphill because he
[11:21.400 --> 11:26.760]  had so much more blood pumping through him so that's what Trump should look into guaranteed
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.000]  me to see Joe Biden's veins.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.920]  Okay I'm done now it's the it's the it's the avant-garde thing and we're gonna have some
[11:37.920 --> 11:41.440]  guests on the day to think Trump did a terrible job the debate and he could have done a better
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.880]  job but when you're being ganged up on and that's happening if you think about all the
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.640]  good things that happen all the great things he said and that suddenly Chris Walls would
[11:50.640 --> 11:55.680]  start interrupting then then then you talk about the win that happened instead of saying
[11:55.680 --> 12:00.000]  it was a loss now a lot of Republicans thought he lost you know what Democrats and you know
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.160]  what Hispanics think CNN had a poll with a focus group every one but one person we'll
[12:08.160 --> 12:15.160]  show you that video coming up next segment thought that Trump won Tulumundo had a poll
[12:15.160 --> 12:22.880]  the vast majority of Hispanics watching thought that Trump won that's the reality people see
[12:22.880 --> 12:29.000]  the ganging up now was it annoying did parts of it get very hard to listen to absolutely
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.280]  because Trump was being interrupted constantly and I've got a bunch of these clips but he
[12:33.280 --> 12:40.000]  got into election fraud he got in to Hunter Biden on the Russian payroll he got in to
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.120]  Antifa he got in I wish he would have gotten into Jeffrey Epstein and the Democrats and
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.080]  how the party itself uses pedophilia to blackmail people he got an A plus if he did that but
[12:51.080 --> 12:58.960]  but here's the deal Trump got 66% on Tulumundo the 34% in a major poll and other polls show
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.080]  the same number so whatever the Hispanics were watching that's what I was watching to
[13:03.080 --> 13:09.680]  I mean I say Trump handily defeated two men and usually with a gladiator it's one man
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.680]  against another man right well this was two against one and one of the guys against him
[13:14.680 --> 13:22.080]  was the judge and was in control of the situation was a referee the arbiter so that's that's
[13:22.080 --> 13:28.040]  not a good thing we got a lot of big guests today coming up and we've got Jim Hoff to
[13:28.040 --> 13:34.480]  who thinks Trump did a great job joining us we got Dan Lyman on huge news in Europe with
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.200]  now European countries are now arresting the NGO heads that Soros funds so that's how you
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.160]  cut the head off the snake that's really good news and we're going to get Ali Alexander
[13:43.160 --> 13:46.360]  he can come on Robert Barnes a bunch of folks we're getting on the show hell let's call
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.360]  Paul Watson get him to pop on for just one segment let's get Carpe Donkton on for one
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.840]  segment let's get them all on for one segment and get their take but let you know who else
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.480]  I want to get on I want to get you on we're opening the phones up at the start of the
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.120]  next segment so nobody's in there the phone system isn't fired up yet so don't wait a
[14:04.120 --> 14:07.920]  few minutes till we call but when we go to break we're going to start opening the phones
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.920]  up specifically on what you thought we don't screen your calls make sure you have a good
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.080]  phone want to tell us what you're calling from that's fine want to tell us an affiliate
[14:16.080 --> 14:19.360]  you ought to ask that we never even plug our affiliates anymore we should we love them
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.000]  and then you're on the air you think you did a terrible job call and tell me you think
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.080]  you did a great job I really respect you and it's that communal debate discussion that
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.480]  really brings us to the next level and again I'm not putting anybody down that thought
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.640]  Trump did a better job it's easy when you're sitting in on your sofa and you're 30 years
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.760]  old you're 40 years old and you're not 74 you're not under the lights with Chris Wallace
[14:42.760 --> 14:49.800]  interrupting you constantly to point out where the doer of deeds could have done better but
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.960]  I just know what it's like to be under pressure up on a stage with someone interrupting you
[14:53.960 --> 14:57.720]  not at that level but pretty much as high level as you can get before that so I've been
[14:57.720 --> 15:02.160]  right to almost what Trump said with that level of stress on the stage when people are out
[15:02.160 --> 15:07.240]  numbering you and it's it's it's it's hard that's why I have the tactic why they won't
[15:07.240 --> 15:11.240]  have me on any shows is I just say what I'm going to say and ignore what they're saying
[15:11.240 --> 15:14.440]  and that's a tactic a good way to win debate so that's I've mopped the floor with them
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.480]  destroy Piers Morgan destroy her all the Rivera destroy them all because I have the facts
[15:20.480 --> 15:22.960]  and I would have gone right at the juggler and said your whole corrupt systems going
[15:22.960 --> 15:27.600]  down America's been reborn you'll never stop us you get 10 point punch
[15:27.600 --> 15:34.080]  just started to play games these people just grab them and crush them or eyeballs politically
[15:34.080 --> 15:41.760]  pop out of their rotten skulls but Trump went with the nuance the Polish presidential
[15:41.760 --> 15:45.280]  he looked better than he looked four years ago he looked incredibly presidential sounded
[15:45.280 --> 15:52.240]  great look great and I think Barnes is right when he says too polished too insulated could
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.560]  have been more hardcore that's that's the real critique that Trump falls play on a space
[15:56.560 --> 16:03.000]  hell no the Renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being replaced
[16:03.000 --> 16:12.440]  by scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the
[16:12.440 --> 16:19.960]  technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow
[16:19.960 --> 16:26.080]  in fact humans are seen as garbage it's going to be taken out removed that is the post human
[16:26.080 --> 16:32.240]  extermination plan that is the public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built
[16:32.240 --> 16:40.800]  with this high-tech grid is to absorb us anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any
[16:40.800 --> 16:45.480]  future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere
[16:45.480 --> 16:53.320]  shadow of what humans once were this is the satanic really elite engaged in mass vandalism
[16:53.320 --> 16:59.080]  against God's creation humanity this is the essence of evil we've now entered month number
[16:59.080 --> 17:04.560]  eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation
[17:04.560 --> 17:10.600]  but the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all over
[17:10.600 --> 17:16.240]  the planet hate Bill Gates he's the most unpopular person on earth people know he's
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.600]  not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that his vaccines that
[17:21.600 --> 17:27.360]  he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio sterilence and more it's even the associated
[17:27.360 --> 17:33.880]  press so now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[17:33.880 --> 17:39.600]  global government and the beast top-tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type
[17:39.600 --> 17:45.120]  of race war scams the coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember that and let
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.600]  them know that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible
[17:50.600 --> 18:00.040]  for the collapse of civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead
[18:00.040 --> 18:18.920]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[18:18.920 --> 18:26.120]  all right i have more than 20 clips of the debate here and they're all extremely important
[18:26.120 --> 18:33.160]  that's right if you're listening to this transmission you are the resistance i got 23 clips on this
[18:33.160 --> 18:37.320]  sheet a bunch of other ones right here incredibly important hour and a half debate went a little
[18:37.320 --> 18:43.600]  long but let me right now play you the most important clip of the night in my view and
[18:43.600 --> 18:52.760]  then we'll give the number out open the phones up and get your take on that chris wallis
[18:52.760 --> 19:02.000]  was the final domino to fall with the fix being in from a year and a half ago with cia operatives
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.200]  that they got elected to the house of representatives who then got on the house arm services committee
[19:08.200 --> 19:15.680]  who have been privately proposing the overthrow militarily of the president then about two
[19:15.680 --> 19:20.320]  and a half months ago they sent letters to general milley privately asking him if he
[19:20.320 --> 19:25.280]  would be part of such a coup two days after the letter was sent there was a front page
[19:25.280 --> 19:30.440]  article in the washroom post saying we're going to arrest any members of the joint chiefs
[19:30.440 --> 19:35.480]  and anyone else and we're going to have the fbi go after their families just in the front
[19:35.480 --> 19:40.120]  of the washroom post i probably showed you the article 30 times and it's in the headline
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.680]  we will arrest anyone that doesn't support our coup that was also a public threat to
[19:45.680 --> 19:50.880]  a million others that hey we're so powerful we will say we're going to have a coup and
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.440]  we're going to overthrow trump and you'll be arrested if you don't support us milley
[19:55.440 --> 19:59.720]  came out and said that's illegal i will not support you so that's the level of brinksmanship
[19:59.720 --> 20:08.560]  going on while we comfortably sit around and debate how trump did up on the stage now did
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.960]  this come up last night yeah it came up and it was the crux of the whole debate and trump
[20:13.960 --> 20:17.520]  kept trying to go back to it and they both kept ganging up and interrupting because they
[20:17.520 --> 20:25.600]  didn't want the leader to be able to communicate with you and i he says hey it's going to be
[20:25.600 --> 20:30.600]  a process it's going to take some time weeks months and will you pledge to not tell your
[20:30.600 --> 20:35.800]  supporters to get violent where has trump supporters been violent where has trump supporters
[20:35.800 --> 20:39.680]  gone out and burned things and gone after police stations and killed people and shot
[20:39.680 --> 20:45.040]  folks in the head at checkpoints no it's not it's them they're the ones that set all this
[20:45.040 --> 20:51.760]  up they're the ones that did all this they're the ones that have announced they're going
[20:51.760 --> 20:58.920]  to have a civil war and secession of the states during the build up to january 20th the 79
[20:58.920 --> 21:09.640]  days of hell because the real fight doesn't end on november 3rd 33 days from now it starts
[21:09.640 --> 21:16.880]  and no one else on air is saying this and i'm not saying oh look i'm exclusive oh look
[21:16.880 --> 21:24.280]  no one is as smart as me no everyone is in a normalcy bias we need tucker carlson we
[21:24.280 --> 21:32.360]  need rush limbaugh we need sean canady to move away from durham and move away from worrying
[21:32.360 --> 21:38.600]  about them ever getting in trouble and move into the real world and it sounds crazy to
[21:38.600 --> 21:41.960]  go on air and say the democrats are planning not to leave and the democrats have got a
[21:41.960 --> 21:48.520]  plan to cause the session and then on january 20th when they cannot finish the election
[21:48.520 --> 21:53.120]  and they're not going to have the electors seat trump polosi has readied the house and
[21:53.120 --> 22:01.480]  entered the bill as of monday three days ago you hear what i'm saying i'm getting chills
[22:01.480 --> 22:05.640]  here folks it's like watching your kid walk out in the highway and you tell them look
[22:05.640 --> 22:10.760]  out a train's coming or a bus and and and it's a mile away and and you're you're tied
[22:10.760 --> 22:14.120]  up and can't help them and the kid doesn't listen to you and finally the trainer the
[22:14.120 --> 22:20.120]  bus just runs them over i mean this is coming like a meteorite that's the size of manhattan
[22:20.120 --> 22:24.720]  to destroy human life this is coming to destroy our republic it's coming it's coming the gun
[22:24.720 --> 22:30.760]  is loaded their finger is on the trigger they've already pulled the damn trigger and just the
[22:30.760 --> 22:37.640]  magnitude of this and and and so she's prepared the bill under the constitution that when the
[22:37.640 --> 22:49.240]  president isn't decided and seated by the 20th of january 2021 112 days from now 79 days after
[22:49.240 --> 22:57.560]  the election that she will decide who the new president is with a vote in the house of representatives
[22:57.560 --> 23:03.640]  now that is the game plan that's what's going down so trump's all worried about them stuff in
[23:03.640 --> 23:09.960]  ballot boxes and and having dead people vote and all the rest of this and and vote harvesting
[23:11.400 --> 23:18.040]  when that's all just smoke screen they know there's a landslide for trump my god telemundo
[23:18.040 --> 23:24.520]  66 support trump after they saw the debate and said he won there's a collapse in confidence
[23:24.520 --> 23:30.040]  of the globalists they're done their only hope is to steal power and bring in permanent martial law
[23:30.040 --> 23:35.640]  using coven 19 type lockdowns and the EU's collapsing it will have a permanent lockdown
[23:35.640 --> 23:40.680]  and the and the bricks it's happening they want to have a permanent lockdown governments have lost
[23:40.680 --> 23:44.600]  control the corporations that control the governments have lost control so they're
[23:44.600 --> 23:51.800]  going to bring us into total tyranny it's not going to be incremental anymore it's here it's on top
[23:51.800 --> 23:58.040]  of us right now i'm sorry to have to give you that news but here's the good news this is illegal as
[23:58.040 --> 24:04.920]  hell this is criminal this is outrageous this is disgusting you know the EU you know the
[24:04.920 --> 24:09.000]  conservative and the liberal parties have all announced in the uk and the democrats are announcing
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.760]  here and they're announcing in australia and the un's announced it and canada's announced it forced
[24:14.760 --> 24:22.360]  inoculations mexico is announcing forced inoculations just like they made all the girls in mexico take
[24:22.360 --> 24:27.400]  garntisville and guess what those girls are all super screwed up now and their ovaries are fried
[24:30.840 --> 24:34.040]  i don't want mexicans brought up here and turned into my enemy and turned into somebody that hates
[24:34.040 --> 24:37.720]  me because i'm white but i sure as hell don't want to sterilize all the mexicans but let me get a
[24:37.720 --> 24:41.160]  little bit newsflash it's going to happen to you whether you're white or whether you're black or
[24:41.160 --> 24:45.800]  whether you're old or whether you're young we're all in this together and we better figure that out
[24:45.800 --> 24:51.720]  now do we have differences have we done stuff to each other of course but this is an AI global
[24:51.720 --> 24:59.800]  scientific end of humanity end of your family takeover period and because it is outrageous the
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.080]  democrats have tried all these coups and crossfire hurricane and all this stuff people are hit flat
[25:05.080 --> 25:11.000]  footed because they have a normalcy bias and that's why they say you're not in kansas anymore
[25:12.440 --> 25:18.440]  we're in the year 2020 real technology is about 2060 the globalists don't need you anymore they
[25:18.440 --> 25:22.920]  don't want you you've got to decide you have value you've got to decide you're essential and you've
[25:22.920 --> 25:26.920]  got to decide you're not going to comply with the global straightjacket they're putting on your ass
[25:27.560 --> 25:34.840]  because if they get this on us it's a harness to carry out our orderly extermination and
[25:34.840 --> 25:38.520]  there's got to be a point finally where you start taking the shots and they admit it kills your
[25:38.520 --> 25:46.680]  ass down the road and they've now come to that point of going yeah 100 of people take our m RNA
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.520]  vaccine get sick 80 get sick with the other one oh yeah there's some side effects yeah sorry
[25:54.200 --> 26:01.400]  that you're basically gonna have your ovaries turn into lacerated bloody pulps
[26:01.400 --> 26:07.000]  my god you read how they add this female hormone to the tetanus shot they give women and so the
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.280]  second trimester they have an autoimmune response in the ovaries and in the uterus and how does it
[26:12.280 --> 26:17.880]  just kill the baby over and over again it fries the woman's uterus and ovaries and ends up killing
[26:17.880 --> 26:22.920]  them usually down the road i mean what a sick system be nicer for bill gates just go blow
[26:22.920 --> 26:27.000]  these people's heads off but oh they would rise up and fight back you couldn't get away with that
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.400]  but if you kill them slow like that but see it's like bill gates always tell me release
[26:31.400 --> 26:35.320]  the mosquitoes he done it in florida too he said hey we don't just want the poor people to have
[26:35.320 --> 26:41.160]  these you need to experience it too oh don't worry he's coming for you too so we'll play this clip
[26:41.160 --> 26:45.480]  it's the most important clip and give the number out when we come back this is the most important
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.520]  thing of the night when wallace says you're gonna pledge to sit there and let us steal the election
[26:50.520 --> 26:57.720]  aren't you and see Nancy Pelosi as president aren't you aren't you aren't you remember the global
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.720]  lock manager witnessing the black lives matter antifer riots and racial attacks we're all seeing
[27:03.720 --> 27:10.600]  are publicly directed by a handful of top millionaires led by people like bill gates
[27:10.600 --> 27:18.360]  jeff bezos of course tim cook and others they set up there with their trillions of dollars
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.000]  they control their companies and their hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.920]  that against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police
[27:29.640 --> 27:34.680]  and the mayors are again they're playing their political game try to trigger the complete breakdown
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.560]  of the united states in western europe show these billionaires could come in and buy it all up for
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.960]  billions on the dollar that's why i'm so angry that these globalists because when you're looking at
[27:43.960 --> 27:49.160]  them they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us
[27:49.160 --> 27:57.880]  they are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with it's us or them period hello my name is Dr
[27:57.880 --> 28:06.120]  Fauci and i've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years and i've overseen well you know the age
[28:06.120 --> 28:13.640]  pandemic and so many other things and i take my orders from bill gate doctor bill gates i mean
[28:13.640 --> 28:21.800]  he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do and he now says you're going to take the shots
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.800]  and of course in england they are now saying what i told you you will not be allowed to travel
[28:27.800 --> 28:36.360]  leave your home until you take all the shots dr gates i mean bill gates your owner your master

[28:44.680 --> 28:53.640]  much more manageable just like bill gates give you polio and vexie i'm dr Fauci reminding you that we
[28:53.640 --> 28:59.960]  owe you if you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.920]  to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine
[29:04.920 --> 29:09.880]  about when they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park they have to look at us the common
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.680]  people they have to look at the proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they love
[29:14.680 --> 29:19.480]  the lockdown putting muscles on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what we
[29:19.480 --> 29:26.840]  can do bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration consolidation
[29:26.840 --> 29:32.360]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant vaccines day
[29:32.360 --> 29:38.520]  one ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used all the entertainment
[29:38.520 --> 29:43.880]  garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders living in for the kill you know this i

[30:29.080 --> 30:32.520]  of covid-19 vaccines if you want to be able to leave your house or travel
[30:34.760 --> 30:39.640]  tyranny isn't coming it's here ladies and gentlemen what are you going to do about it
[30:39.640 --> 30:45.240]  compliance is death this is the un dreamed be able to put in your body what they want when they want
[30:45.240 --> 30:50.120]  and the un's been caught across the world spiking vaccines with sterilants cancer viruses polio
[30:51.720 --> 30:57.320]  now these mRNA vaccines that just reprograms your whole body reprograms every cell in your
[30:57.320 --> 31:03.960]  damn body it's a nightmare scenario the precedent is just so revolutionary so over the top so
[31:03.960 --> 31:10.440]  science fiction dystopia that it it's it's it's it's completely revolutionary is only
[31:10.440 --> 31:15.160]  word to describe it it's it's just unbelievable and it's all just done like it's no big deal just
[31:15.160 --> 31:19.160]  the end of humanity big corporations make you put something in you that totally changes you
[31:19.160 --> 31:23.880]  and we've got vaccines that reprogram your brain with viruses that eat certain synapses so you
[31:23.880 --> 31:31.000]  can't get upset anymore that means you can't feel high level emotions anymore viral lobotomies it's
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.680]  all being done it's all been tested it's already it's all being rolled out against you but they
[31:36.680 --> 31:41.480]  but they metaphysically have to pressure you into doing it they have to make you acquiesce
[31:41.480 --> 31:46.280]  they believe karmically or they get instant destruction and they believe in it they know
[31:46.280 --> 31:52.280]  how the universe works there's still that key thing they reject god and the holy spirit the
[31:52.280 --> 31:59.480]  good operating system so they still get walled off from god but they escape retribution now in
[31:59.480 --> 32:06.520]  this life that's why the vampire has to ask you to invite him in you've got to make him again
[32:06.520 --> 32:11.880]  guest when he crosses the threshold because you have free will i'm not saying it's a real vampire
[32:11.880 --> 32:18.520]  it's an archetype okay so i talked about this last segment this is the key to everything
[32:19.480 --> 32:23.720]  chris wallace a little predatory monster thinks he's part of the cool crew thinks he's part of
[32:23.720 --> 32:29.960]  the winning crew and he sizes up trump and he inverts reality it's the democrats that say they're
[32:29.960 --> 32:34.360]  not going to accept the election it's the democrats that did the mail in ballots to be able to do this
[32:34.360 --> 32:37.720]  as the democrats that say they've prepared the bill where they will decide who they're going to
[32:37.720 --> 32:42.440]  elect up to january 20th under the constitution so they can hold up the election and not have it come
[32:42.440 --> 32:47.880]  out as a clear winner and they're the ones that have geared up their domestic armies have prepared
[32:47.880 --> 32:51.400]  their violence instead of the cops defend themselves their property or life in any way that
[32:51.400 --> 32:57.320]  they're terrorist and bad like written house whenever um biden called him a white supremacist
[32:57.320 --> 33:02.440]  just total defamation the lawyers are not demanding a retraction don't hold your breath
[33:02.440 --> 33:09.240]  so they're making their move and you already saw it with crossfire hurricane all the rest of it
[33:09.240 --> 33:14.760]  that's nothing when they fail at that they're going to go out in the open and all the corporate
[33:14.760 --> 33:18.840]  media and all the big tech and from fox news to see and then they're going to line up against the
[33:18.840 --> 33:23.000]  president and this is the move to removing this is about world government and their whole future
[33:23.640 --> 33:29.560]  and they can't stand it so we're 33 days out from that and then it just starts the 79 days of hell
[33:29.560 --> 33:38.120]  until the inauguration doesn't happen and polosia said they'll either have their own inauguration
[33:38.120 --> 33:43.960]  if somehow he even gets the delegates or gets the electors to see him they they say they're
[33:43.960 --> 33:48.120]  still not going to go with it so they've got that option they've got the option of holding it past
[33:48.120 --> 33:54.200]  where it's not clear to january 20th in 112 days they'll go that option or they could try to steal
[33:54.200 --> 33:59.560]  it and stop the ballots and say he won that night but they're saying to him we're allowed to contest
[33:59.560 --> 34:03.640]  but you don't contest i know i just keep repeating that every hour every minute when there's so
[34:03.640 --> 34:08.280]  much other interesting news it all the other news doesn't matter world government forced
[34:08.280 --> 34:14.680]  inoculations are coming trump is against it if they get rid of him it's going to go to civil war
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.520]  physical this isn't going to take time anymore they're coming pedophilia is out in the open
[34:20.520 --> 34:26.280]  devil worships out in the open this is it this is the biggest song ladies and gentlemen so i
[34:26.280 --> 34:31.560]  whatever you do pray get involved go speak out in public don't comply with the system
[34:31.560 --> 34:37.000]  because we are in a revolution with globalists trying to overthrow the country that's what
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.840]  i'm telling you america sucks i'm telling you we're all racist scum when you watch the movie
[34:42.840 --> 34:50.520]  red dawn made back in the 80s by patriots a millis who did his research on the communist
[34:51.560 --> 34:56.040]  millis is a big listener big fan of met his daughter great folks they did the dirty harry
[34:56.040 --> 35:02.120]  movies all the rest of it and i like having that guy as a fan but he had a stroke so that he
[35:02.120 --> 35:08.840]  didn't want to come on the show but in there you hear on the loudspeaker where they've round
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.160]  everybody up and they have local sports stadium with a big movie screen saying america is a hard
[35:13.160 --> 35:17.960]  house of pigs your founding fathers a scum you are racist nobody's capitalism is terrible and
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.960]  you will never be anybody that's playing in the background because that's what really goes on
[35:23.960 --> 35:29.240]  a reeducation camp ladies and gentlemen but it's not russians coming over to do this the same
[35:29.240 --> 35:34.360]  globalist went over and took over russia and did it to them and now russia has kicked out the
[35:34.360 --> 35:44.920]  globalist at least partially and they are so damn pissed so here is the enemy here is the collaborator
[35:46.440 --> 35:47.160]  here is
[35:51.800 --> 35:57.960]  chris wallace the whole point of the whole debate is you are not to question on election day
[35:58.600 --> 36:03.080]  you are to let us hold this out you're to let us do this do not fight us do not struggle but you
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.920]  see wallace is scared because they know what they're doing is illegal it's out of control
[36:06.920 --> 36:11.640]  and it's totally transparent but again they just keep drumming into us trump can't contest when we
[36:11.640 --> 36:18.760]  contest trump can't go well wait 97 percent of the votes are counted and i've won by this percentage
[36:18.760 --> 36:23.240]  so if you add that together i'm the projected winner no they're gonna have this create the
[36:23.240 --> 36:30.440]  dissension and the fights and the rioting all over it and there's way too much confidence by
[36:30.440 --> 36:36.600]  republicans and others they mean to do this you're like well they're gonna fail they failed all the
[36:36.600 --> 36:42.040]  other times yeah but this is an order of magnitude in escalation so here's where chris wallace tells
[36:42.040 --> 36:44.600]  you everything you need to know the most important part of the debate here it is
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.680]  will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period not to engage in any civil
[36:54.680 --> 37:00.920]  unrest and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been
[37:00.920 --> 37:07.880]  independently certified president trump i'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very
[37:07.880 --> 37:13.400]  carefully because that's what has to happen i am urging them to do it as you know today there
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.760]  was a big problem in philadelphia they went into watch they were called poll watches a very safe
[37:18.760 --> 37:24.120]  very nice thing they were thrown out they weren't allowed to watch you know why because bad things
[37:24.120 --> 37:30.360]  happen in philadelphia bad things and i am urging i am urging my people i hope it's gonna be a fair
[37:30.360 --> 37:36.280]  election if it's a fair election i am a hundred percent on board but if i see tens of thousands
[37:36.280 --> 37:44.120]  of ballots being manipulated i can't go along with that and i'll tell you what it means you have a
[37:44.120 --> 37:50.040]  fraudulent election you're sending out 80 million ballots they're not equipped to these people aren't
[37:50.040 --> 37:56.920]  equipped to handle it number one number two they cheat they cheat hey they found ballots in a waste
[37:56.920 --> 38:02.440]  paper basket three days ago and they all had the name military ballots they were military they all
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.080]  had the name trump on them vice president biden that's good vice president biden final question
[38:07.080 --> 38:13.240]  for you will streams ditches domsters of course folks but that's only one level of this
[38:13.240 --> 38:20.600]  so just like the sun came up this morning they've told us they're doing it pedestrian does online
[38:20.600 --> 38:27.080]  seminars with the top democrats two months ago admitting a plan they admit the crimes they're
[38:27.080 --> 38:33.240]  going to commit and then everyone downgrades it like tulsi gabard calls for ban on ballot harvesting
[38:33.240 --> 38:38.840]  sites project veritas video okay good for her sounds good but that's not just ballot harvesting
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.800]  that's illegal in minnesota it's that they're paying for it that's called bribery but everything
[38:43.800 --> 38:48.920]  is always engineered to make it less oh it's ballot harvesting no ballot harvesting is going
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.200]  around and getting people's ballots and putting them in for them because you can change them or
[38:52.200 --> 38:58.520]  mess with them and fraud is inherent when you pay somebody it's more than inherent it is bonafide
[38:59.400 --> 39:02.520]  all right here's the toll free number to join us eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three

[39:28.280 --> 39:32.280]  news i haven't hit a bunch of other clips but i'm not here trying to entertain you i'm sorry

[39:36.840 --> 39:40.240]  We're all in this together. This is this is the greatest threat since our founding
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.600]  Pray to God for mass awakening that the most important thing is prayer ladies and gentlemen seek God's face humble yourself
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.680]  And God will heal our land. Please stay with us. Please spread the word about the broadcast your own help
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.960]  I've come to you many times and ask for your support and you've always come through and
[39:58.960 --> 40:05.520]  And info wars has come through. We've never sold out. We've never backed down. We've always told the truth. We've made mistakes
[40:06.400 --> 40:13.360]  But 98% of the time or so we're dead on and the enemy knows that info wars is a thought leader
[40:13.440 --> 40:18.460]  Not just here but around the world and that's why the chai comms Hollywood the globalist
[40:18.480 --> 40:25.600]  Want us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air
[40:25.600 --> 40:32.000]  If you don't support us ladies and gentlemen now, they're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody else down as well
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.880]  You already know that it's out the open. So again count the cost
[40:36.560 --> 40:43.040]  Focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors your financial support
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.520]  Getting the products in info wars store.com and your prayer. I'm praying for you. Please pray for us
[40:47.520 --> 40:53.000]  Let's do this together. We're gonna win. We are winning, but it's not gonna be easy. The enemy's trying to take it all from us
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Let's not let them succeed
[40:55.000 --> 41:03.600]  Computer research scientists engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put out detailed reports at Tablet magazine
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.200]  Documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day
[41:08.800 --> 41:15.800]  Communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States as well as the media
[41:15.840 --> 41:21.720]  Put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in
[41:21.720 --> 41:29.720]  China earlier this year then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months
[41:30.080 --> 41:32.080]  This is the greatest strategic
[41:32.920 --> 41:34.760]  ever this is
[41:34.760 --> 41:40.520]  21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate style
[41:40.760 --> 41:45.800]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at info wars.com myself Alex Jones David
[41:45.800 --> 41:47.320]  I know and sure are covering this heavily
[41:47.320 --> 41:53.000]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China in the UN were behind the hysteria
[41:55.200 --> 42:02.200]  Are you sick and tired of your calm peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well at night? Is your city too safe?
[42:04.360 --> 42:06.360]  Well, not anymore
[42:06.680 --> 42:08.680]  introducing Democrats
[42:09.040 --> 42:12.040]  politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with liars
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.480]  looting
[42:14.480 --> 42:22.000]  rampant violence and even homelessness the secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity
[42:22.520 --> 42:27.760]  No more pesky lawn order when Democrats are in charge. Nobody's safe
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.400]  Simply vote for Democrats sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.920]  But wait vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts election fraud cancel culture
[42:41.600 --> 42:43.600]  taxes and more taxes
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.120]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door
[42:55.160 --> 43:02.760]  The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've aligned financially culturally, but most importantly
[43:03.440 --> 43:04.320]  spiritually
[43:04.320 --> 43:09.360]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire
[43:09.360 --> 43:17.320]  future destiny of our species and that's why big tech control of the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down
[43:18.440 --> 43:24.000]  Isolate us make us to press make us alone and try to control every aspect of our lives literally
[43:24.600 --> 43:29.360]  Rainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright
[43:29.680 --> 43:35.080]  Not as of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment
[43:35.080 --> 43:40.960]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension
[43:40.960 --> 43:42.960]  And we are walled off in a
[43:43.400 --> 43:49.360]  Technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score. This is their plan
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.680]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no. We must embrace God
[43:54.680 --> 44:01.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:01.800 --> 44:13.960]  This is the beautiful
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.240]  This is the he's president United States
[44:22.400 --> 44:28.320]  It's on his watch and with regard to more divided the nation that can't stay divided
[44:28.320 --> 44:33.600]  We can't be this way and speaking of my son the way you talk about the military way
[44:33.600 --> 44:39.600]  You talk about them being losers and being and and and just being suckers my son
[44:40.120 --> 44:42.880]  Was in Iraq. He spent a year there
[44:43.360 --> 44:49.160]  He got he got the brown star. He got to conspicuous service metal. He was not a loser
[44:49.520 --> 44:56.000]  He was a patriot and the people left behind there were heroes and I resent talking about
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.360]  Hunter are you talking about my son bow, Biden? You're talking about I don't know bow
[45:00.360 --> 45:06.600]  I know hunter got thrown hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged
[45:06.600 --> 45:11.840]  That's not true wasn't to talk in use and he didn't have a job until you became vice president
[45:11.840 --> 45:13.360]  What you know that is true?
[45:13.360 --> 45:18.920]  He made a fortune in Ukraine in China in Moscow. That is simply various other places
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.160]  He my son fortune my son and he didn't have a job my son like a lot of people like a lot of people
[45:25.160 --> 45:31.800]  We know at home had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's he's he's fixed it. He's worth that's enough
[45:31.800 --> 45:39.720]  I'm proud of I wanted to play this because we have the two different statements about call the military dumb bastards
[45:40.400 --> 45:42.400]  Telling them that they're not too sharp
[45:42.960 --> 45:44.960]  Exactly what they claim Trump says
[45:46.320 --> 45:52.920]  Word-for-word he says to their face because they knew that video was in opposition research and Trump was planning to play it
[45:52.920 --> 46:00.160]  Everything they've done they're in bed with the Russians. They say Trump's above the Russians. They're in bed with the Chinese
[46:00.160 --> 46:03.160]  They say Trump's above the Chinese everything they do
[46:03.840 --> 46:06.360]  they turn around on President Trump and
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.440]  You know, I mean, do you even need me to play the clip that's been played of him saying?
[46:12.720 --> 46:18.280]  Clap you dumb bastards and then later man. You're not that you're not that sharp. You're pretty dull, aren't you?
[46:18.280 --> 46:23.760]  And he says it with a very arrogant mean attitude and he's known for that
[46:24.800 --> 46:29.640]  He thinks he's better than everybody he gets up on stage and branched about how he's the best lawyer ever
[46:30.560 --> 46:32.560]  I don't know people that knew him in Delaware
[46:32.720 --> 46:39.520]  They are crooks man and nasty and use people and steel. I mean that he doesn't give tips either this Hillary
[46:39.640 --> 46:46.120]  Think about this Joe Biden doesn't give people tips folks. He goes in eats a steak dinner. You don't get five dollars
[46:46.120 --> 46:48.680]  He goes into a diner. You don't get a nickel
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.160]  Because he's a piece of filth
[46:57.440 --> 46:59.440]  It's disgusting
[47:00.720 --> 47:08.080]  And of course Trump then zing zing back and says 3.5 million from Moscow mayor's wife and it's all true folks
[47:09.680 --> 47:12.600]  It's all going on. It's what they do. It's who they are
[47:13.200 --> 47:15.200]  And they sold us up to China
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.960]  And then they admit that they want communist China to basically run the United States
[47:18.960 --> 47:24.120]  That's Joe Biden saying that every aspect of our lives. They need to influence it and be in charge of it
[47:25.400 --> 47:31.320]  Because they know it's gonna come out they work for the Chinese Communist, so they just hide it in plain view just like Dying Feinstein
[47:32.720 --> 47:36.400]  These people are criminals that have committed so many crimes with others
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.120]  They believe they're invincible in the swamp because everybody else will go down if they go down
[47:40.360 --> 47:45.040]  Well, here's the problem. You guys are bringing us down in America down and you're into pedophilia
[47:45.040 --> 47:48.480]  And devil worship and you hate the country and now you want to forcibly
[47:49.040 --> 47:56.000]  Anoculate us you want to get in our bodies and keep us locked down you want power over us and you don't know when to stop pushing
[47:57.920 --> 48:04.280]  I'm gonna go to Sean Joseph Mikey Mike Steve Jason Greg Catherine and others when we start the next hour
[48:04.280 --> 48:06.120]  I'll go right to you
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.160]  We do have Jim Hoff to the Gateway Pundit joining us to give us his analysis of the debate
[48:11.160 --> 48:13.160]  We've got a lot more to get into the debate
[48:13.160 --> 48:20.760]  And then we also have CIA as FBI to investigate if Hillary approved plot to create Russia hoax against F
[48:21.560 --> 48:22.960]  against Trump
[48:22.960 --> 48:26.240]  And again, the reason that's coming out is they have to have the FBI investigate what they already know
[48:26.520 --> 48:31.560]  Because that's the FBI's jurisdiction is here domestically. That's a big deal. The CIA is really saying is
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.480]  We were ordered to make up this fake dossier
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.080]  And we want you to now investigate yourselves and expose that we're gonna leak it
[48:39.080 --> 48:47.000]  That's what that really says CIA as FBI investigative Hillary Clinton approved plot to create Russia hoax against Trump meanwhile Comey
[48:47.520 --> 48:54.520]  Testifies the judiciary committee on crossfire hurricane, which he said did not exist. He testified in Congress twice
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.120]  And he told the president on record that you were never under investigation. Mr. President. That's not true
[49:01.120 --> 49:12.120]  He was running the investigation against Trump and he lied to his face. He lied to Congress a federal crime
[49:13.120 --> 49:19.120]  And if you are ahead of the department and you lie to the president to his face on an issue of national security
[49:19.120 --> 49:21.120]  That is a felony as well
[49:23.120 --> 49:26.120]  But these people have no respect for anybody
[49:26.120 --> 49:32.120]  I noticed Comey is always like, you know, putting behind the American flags and flags, you know from dead veterans and the rest of it
[49:32.120 --> 49:35.120]  To try to make himself look like a good guy. He's a monster
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.120]  And he hides behind the very flag he's trying to destroy
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.120]  He's an enemy of the Republican enemy of everybody. I mean, I don't have words to describe how bad these guys are
[49:45.120 --> 49:48.120]  So your calls are coming up and I just have unlimited news and information
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.120]  I've got all the different clips and all the different angles to cover but here's the big takeaway
[49:52.120 --> 49:56.120]  Appeals court upholds extended Wisconsin ballot deadline
[49:58.120 --> 50:04.120]  And another appeals court has ruled that, yep, the Communist judge in Black Lives Matter says it can go for months after
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.120]  The judges are all saying, oh, you can run it past January 20th. That's the date they're saying
[50:09.120 --> 50:11.120]  Because then they can not have Trump become president
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.120]  They tell you the judges ruling. Oh, you can have
[50:15.120 --> 50:17.120]  You can have three months
[50:17.120 --> 50:20.120]  Which is longer than 79 days
[50:21.120 --> 50:22.120]  See how that works
[50:24.120 --> 50:25.120]  See how that works
[50:26.120 --> 50:30.120]  In FullWars.com, appeals court upholds extended Wisconsin ballot deadline
[50:30.120 --> 50:37.120]  And where are they doing this with the mail-ins? All the battlegrounds, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.120]  That's where they're going to do it
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.120]  They're going to try to still Florida too
[50:47.120 --> 50:50.120]  All right, let me just get this out of the way and hope you listen to me very, very carefully
[50:50.120 --> 50:56.120]  When I tell you that I talk to people at the highest levels of food distribution but also manufacturing
[50:57.120 --> 51:03.120]  Everything from appliances to furniture to lumber to paper to medical goods
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.120]  It's all breaking down. The supply chains are gone
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.120]  If one person in a warehouse gets COVID, they shut the whole thing down
[51:08.120 --> 51:12.120]  We can't get almost a third of the supplements we used to get
[51:12.120 --> 51:17.120]  Just the companies are like falling apart, won't even take our money, can't even get the products anymore
[51:17.120 --> 51:20.120]  Everything we have is still in our warehouse in Austin ready to ship
[51:20.120 --> 51:25.120]  But it's breaking down. There's a big article on InFullWars.com by Michael Snyder. It's very important
[51:25.120 --> 51:27.120]  You should go read it
[51:27.120 --> 51:33.120]  Global food shortages are becoming very real and U.S. grocery store chains are preparing for worst-case scenarios
[51:33.120 --> 51:38.120]  And it's got CNN, Bloomberg, all of them admitting that people are now starving to death in Mexico
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.120]  Which that doesn't usually happen in
[51:40.120 --> 51:43.120]  It's one of the richest third-world countries, if you didn't know that
[51:43.120 --> 51:46.120]  People are starving to death in Guatemala, Argentina, you don't need to be telling me
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.120]  Obviously, Venezuela is getting worse than ever
[51:48.120 --> 51:51.120]  And Africa is starving to death and just millions have already died
[51:51.120 --> 51:53.120]  And it's just minor footnote that that's going on
[51:53.120 --> 51:57.120]  And the U.N. has got all the numbers on the very crisis they created with the lockdown
[51:57.120 --> 51:58.120]  COVID didn't kill the people
[51:58.120 --> 52:00.120]  COVID causes millions to starve
[52:00.120 --> 52:03.120]  No, the COVID lockdown caused that
[52:03.120 --> 52:05.120]  That's a fact
[52:05.120 --> 52:08.120]  But it's a big article. I suggest you read that article
[52:08.120 --> 52:12.120]  And I suggest you tie it into Yale Economist's warns of looming dollar collapse
[52:12.120 --> 52:14.120]  They're trying to collapse the dollar
[52:14.120 --> 52:17.120]  It's not devalued like the Chinese Yan and Yan comparatively
[52:17.120 --> 52:18.120]  It has been devalued
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.120]  Again, and a lot of the conservatives are out there doing this because they're on the Chai Kong payroll, folks
[52:22.120 --> 52:28.120]  Again, it's a fiat currency. Absolutely. It's inflated. It's dangerous. But that's the game we're in now
[52:28.120 --> 52:33.120]  And to say that we're going down is hoping we go down in the musical chairs and we don't get a chair
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.120]  It's whoever's left standing on this now
[52:35.120 --> 52:37.120]  We must keep world reserve currency status
[52:37.120 --> 52:41.120]  The left pushing for the dollar to die is the most insane thing
[52:41.120 --> 52:45.120]  It's like pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting it on fire. It is crazy town
[52:47.120 --> 52:51.120]  So that's all going on right now, ladies and gentlemen
[52:51.120 --> 52:53.120]  And so you go to PrepareWithAlex.com
[52:53.120 --> 52:56.120]  You find the full catalog of my Patreon supply
[52:56.120 --> 52:59.120]  at mfortwardstore.com. They're in our back end. They take the orders
[52:59.120 --> 53:01.120]  It's all secured. Best prices you're going to find
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.120]  Because they have a bunch of distributors they can't go below the prices that we have
[53:05.120 --> 53:07.120]  That's their lowest prices as well
[53:08.120 --> 53:12.120]  Unless they do a special on their page, they have a loophole
[53:12.120 --> 53:14.120]  And this is making their own distributors mad
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.120]  I don't cut it on what other people are selling
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.120]  So it's quick complaining to those folks
[53:18.120 --> 53:21.120]  But seriously, this is maybe one of the last ones they can do for a while though
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.120]  Because they believe the food orders are going to uptick again like they did
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.120]  They're already starting to see it. They see the shortages
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.120]  They've already bought out six months
[53:30.120 --> 53:34.120]  Now they're going to go up in price in a few months because they're going to have to buy more food into the future
[53:34.120 --> 53:37.120]  And so before food prices go up
[53:37.120 --> 53:40.120]  And before things get crazy and before there's big lines
[53:40.120 --> 53:44.120]  You want to be prepared in case things go sideways, which it basically already is
[53:44.120 --> 53:46.120]  So I said, hey, a lot of folks are complaining
[53:46.120 --> 53:49.120]  You've only got $150 off on the three month. People want bigger ones
[53:49.120 --> 53:53.120]  They said, fine, we'll extend the $150 off the three months food supply
[53:53.120 --> 53:54.120]  Unprecedented
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.120]  That's it. Prepare with Alex.com exclusively
[53:56.120 --> 53:58.120]  $300 off the six month
[53:58.120 --> 53:59.120]  $600 off the year
[53:59.120 --> 54:02.120]  $40 off the Alexa Pure water filtration system
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.120]  That's a big discount
[54:04.120 --> 54:06.120]  Because there's not much margin in there
[54:06.120 --> 54:10.120]  And 25% off the ready hour wireless solar power pack charger
[54:10.120 --> 54:12.120]  And 28 LED room light
[54:12.120 --> 54:14.120]  One of the highest quality ones out there you're going to find
[54:14.120 --> 54:17.120]  And the money we do make funds this operation when it's so critical
[54:17.120 --> 54:22.120]  So m4warstore.com is the regular place to go with the supplements, the books, the films, the t-shirts
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.120]  And the full selection of my Patriot supply at the very lowest prices
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  But if you want to get these special items
[54:28.120 --> 54:31.120]  Three month, six month, year, and these others
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.120]  You're going to get the biggest discounts everywhere exclusively at preparewithalex.com
[54:35.120 --> 54:38.120]  Or triple eight four one one zero three five zero
[54:38.120 --> 54:40.120]  Triple eight four one one zero three five zero
[54:40.120 --> 54:43.120]  We've got the big m4war's emergency election sale
[54:43.120 --> 54:44.120]  Total blowout
[54:44.120 --> 54:48.120]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very very simple
[54:48.120 --> 54:51.120]  They give you about freedoms by increments
[54:51.120 --> 54:54.120]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time
[54:54.120 --> 54:57.120]  And then the restrictions will be released
[54:57.120 --> 54:58.120]  But they're not
[54:58.120 --> 55:02.120]  They have a significant amount of time always four or five times longer than what they said
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.120]  They will then slightly release it a little bit
[55:05.120 --> 55:07.120]  Only tighten it down even more later
[55:07.120 --> 55:10.120]  This is called successive approximation
[55:10.120 --> 55:13.120]  Incrementalism or the inchworm effect
[55:13.120 --> 55:16.120]  This is the most common way that the Salatarians take over
[55:16.120 --> 55:19.120]  But there then becomes a point where the public wakes up
[55:19.120 --> 55:21.120]  Under the incrementalism
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.120]  He starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.120]  And you'll see more tyranny rolled out
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.120]  In just a few days weeks or months that you saw in the previous ten years
[55:31.120 --> 55:34.120]  And that's the period we're in globally right now
[55:34.120 --> 55:37.120]  A world government shy combat
[55:37.120 --> 55:39.120]  Globalist corporate takeover of the planet
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.120]  That wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever
[55:45.120 --> 55:49.120]  It's the evening of September 26, 2020
[55:49.120 --> 55:54.120]  And I just got done watching the horrible footage
[55:54.120 --> 55:58.120]  Of thousands of riot police with trejans
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.120]  Beating thousands of peaceful people in Trafalgar Square
[56:02.120 --> 56:06.120]  Protesting the COVID martial law lockdown
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.120]  An iron curtain is descending over the world from the United Nations
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.120]  Even more evil than the old Soviet Union
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.120]  And this model is communist China
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.120]  We're not facing incremental tyranny
[56:18.120 --> 56:24.120]  We're facing absolute 100% commitment to evil
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.120]  Because the system thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid
[56:26.120 --> 56:28.120]  And it's making this move
[56:28.120 --> 56:30.120]  And whether it's Australia, the UK or the US
[56:30.120 --> 56:33.120]  Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can run around and kill cops
[56:33.120 --> 56:35.120]  And burn things down in their heroes
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.120]  And oh, nobody's worried about the COVID BS
[56:37.120 --> 56:40.120]  But when it's patriots saying we have rights, we have dignity
[56:40.120 --> 56:41.120]  They get viciously attacked
[56:41.120 --> 56:43.120]  All the videos are at M4Words.com
[56:43.120 --> 57:12.120]  With David Ives speaking and more
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.120]  No banner, flutters in the sky
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  Star Spangled Banner
[57:34.120 --> 57:39.120]  That's right, time hustles those
[57:39.120 --> 57:43.120]  Who are afraid to die
[57:43.120 --> 57:46.120]  Sweet soul sister
[57:53.120 --> 57:56.120]  Alright, I was just looking at the videos, the articles I've got
[57:56.120 --> 57:58.120]  And I'm going to load it on the phone lines
[57:58.120 --> 57:59.120]  And they're just incredible
[57:59.120 --> 58:02.120]  There's some footage I'm going to play at the start of the next segment
[58:02.120 --> 58:04.120]  That I'm going to play then
[58:04.120 --> 58:07.120]  Because there's a couple more things I want to tell the crew to get ready
[58:07.120 --> 58:09.120]  To put together with this
[58:09.120 --> 58:11.120]  Because this is just unbelievable
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.120]  This is absolutely insane
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.120]  Clip 13 is not lucky for the globalist
[58:18.120 --> 58:20.120]  You know, if we got this info out
[58:20.120 --> 58:22.120]  It's the type of thing that can capture people's imagination
[58:22.120 --> 58:24.120]  And just end their scams
[58:24.120 --> 58:26.120]  What am I talking about?
[58:28.120 --> 58:30.120]  It's just incredible
[58:30.120 --> 58:32.120]  Democrat rep admits to Governor Tom Wolf
[58:32.120 --> 58:34.120]  That killed all those folks in the nursing homes
[58:34.120 --> 58:37.120]  That we wear the mask for political theater
[58:37.120 --> 58:40.120]  That's a quote
[58:40.120 --> 58:42.120]  And to keep his on
[58:42.120 --> 58:43.120]  It's just amazing
[58:43.120 --> 58:45.120]  And Fauci, when he's done
[58:45.120 --> 58:46.120]  He thinks the cameras are done
[58:46.120 --> 58:48.120]  He takes his off
[58:48.120 --> 58:50.120]  It's all just
[58:50.120 --> 58:52.120]  That they're of the virtue signaurs that care about you
[58:52.120 --> 58:54.120]  It's disgusting
[58:54.120 --> 58:56.120]  It's killing millions of people
[58:56.120 --> 58:57.120]  It makes me so angry
[58:57.120 --> 58:58.120]  So that's coming up
[58:58.120 --> 59:00.120]  Your phone calls right away
[59:00.120 --> 59:02.120]  And so much more
[59:02.120 --> 59:04.120]  And you know, I've got all this new news here
[59:04.120 --> 59:08.120]  But I don't want to glaze over Australia, Europe, the UK
[59:08.120 --> 59:10.120]  And Canada at the city levels
[59:10.120 --> 59:12.120]  That's where the UN's in control are announcing
[59:12.120 --> 59:14.120]  We're coming with forced inoculations
[59:14.120 --> 59:16.120]  And they'll just go to businesses and tell them
[59:16.120 --> 59:17.120]  You better have the app
[59:17.120 --> 59:18.120]  You better make sure they have it
[59:18.120 --> 59:20.120]  And then businesses won't let you in
[59:20.120 --> 59:21.120]  See how that's the market
[59:21.120 --> 59:24.120]  The base will go, oh, it's a private business
[59:24.120 --> 59:26.120]  But government and corporations are coordinating
[59:26.120 --> 59:27.120]  And racketeering to do it
[59:27.120 --> 59:29.120]  And it's illegal
[59:29.120 --> 59:31.120]  The Attorney General says this is the greatest thing
[59:31.120 --> 59:32.120]  It's slavery
[59:32.120 --> 59:33.120]  It's the worst thing in slavery
[59:33.120 --> 59:34.120]  And it is
[59:34.120 --> 59:36.120]  So do something about it
[59:38.120 --> 59:39.120]  Let me tell you
[59:39.120 --> 59:41.120]  When the globalists start paying for what they've done
[59:41.120 --> 59:43.120]  Is when this stuff's going to start reversing
[59:46.120 --> 59:48.120]  But if we sit here and live in denial
[59:48.120 --> 59:50.120]  We don't have a hope in hell
[59:50.120 --> 59:51.120]  And here's the thing
[59:51.120 --> 59:52.120]  I'm being honest with you
[59:52.120 --> 59:53.120]  I'm not trying to scare you
[59:53.120 --> 59:55.120]  I'm trying to get you to move and take action
[59:55.120 --> 59:56.120]  When I tell you this is going to come down quick
[59:56.120 --> 59:57.120]  You already see it moving quick
[59:57.120 --> 59:58.120]  Now you see what I told you
[59:58.120 --> 1:00:00.120]  Eight months ago is happening exactly like I told you
[1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:02.120]  Because you can study what they say they're going to do
[1:00:02.120 --> 1:00:03.120]  They're going to do it
[1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:05.120]  And so it's going to move very quickly now
[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:06.120]  I wish we had years left
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:09.120]  I wish we could turn it around all the way
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:12.120]  But I mean, I have to get with grips
[1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:14.120]  With my own psyche
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:17.120]  And just admit the full heart of myself
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:20.120]  That contact tracers, social workers are coming
[1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:21.120]  They're going to shoot your kids up
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.120]  They're going to take your kids
[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:23.120]  If you don't give them the shots
[1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:26.120]  And they're just going to get the mass of people behind it
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:27.120]  And just disappear your family
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:29.120]  And it won't matter when you have convulsions
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:30.120]  It won't matter when you die
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  It won't matter when you get sick
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:34.120]  Because Bill Gates will laugh at you
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:35.120]  Well, here's the deal
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:38.120]  If Bill Gates shoots up kids with polio vaccine
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:39.120]  And they get polio and die
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  And he knows he's doing it
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:42.120]  He deserves to be arrested
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:44.120]  He deserves to be tried as a war criminal
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:47.120]  And he deserves to be hung by his neck until he's dead
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  Now, obviously, if you talk like that
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.120]  Bill Gates will send people after you
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:52.120]  Go to hell, Bill Gates
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:53.120]  I don't care
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  You're the murderer
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:55.120]  You're the eugenicist
[1:00:55.120 --> 1:00:58.120]  That thinks you're saving the planet by depopulating people
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.120]  Then do it to yourself first
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:04.120]  You didn't euthanize your 94-year-old father that died last week
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:06.120]  But you tell us we need to kill old people
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:09.120]  And not give them service
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:11.120]  I don't respect people that don't lead by example
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.120]  Do I get the third world's overpopulated in some areas?
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:15.120]  Do I get their malnourished?
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:17.120]  Do I get that, yeah
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:19.120]  And the UN's using them as a weapon against me
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:21.120]  I know all the angles
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  I just sat inside your brain, buddy boy
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:26.120]  The truth is
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:29.120]  You work for a sinister anti-human force
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:30.120]  That wants to kill everybody
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.120]  And that's the big trick about this
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:33.120]  They want to get everybody
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:35.120]  They want to post-human world
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  They want the machine to take over
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:38.120]  He admits it
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:40.120]  So not just know to your plan
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.120]  Hell no, Bill Gates
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:43.120]  I'm not going to kill you
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  And nobody should anything violent to you
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:47.120]  We should talk about how you're violently attacking us
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  And how you are a murdering criminal
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:51.120]  That needs to be brought to justice
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:57.120]  Remember, the enemy is working around the clock
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  To suppress voices of independent people
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:02.120]  All over the world
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:07.120]  The globalists have a plan for total vertical integration
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:10.120]  Absolute authoritarianism
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  To where you are a captive of their devices
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  Of their control
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  But that is only a means to an end
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:26.120]  They are on record that they will bring in force inoculations
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:29.120]  That sterilize you and your family and worse
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.120]  Actually give people polio
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.120]  And actually give people cancer
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  Most cancer is viral
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:40.120]  That's a big secret
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  But the secret is beginning to come out
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:44.120]  It's even in the Associated Press
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:47.120]  Remember, all of these banned videos
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:50.120]  And reports are banned out of video
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:03:19.120]  But only you can share them and save humanity
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  But I've got my duty
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:26.120]  And I actually enjoy it
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:28.120]  If I gotta get smashed, flattered to pancake
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  To turn this around
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:33.120]  Well, that's what I was born for
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:36.120]  That's what this is all really about, isn't it?
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:39.120]  But what's gonna satisfy your soul?
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:41.120]  Certainly not serving sake
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  Yeah, we're not hedging our bets
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:48.120]  That's why I love the term zero hedge
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:50.120]  It's a great website
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:52.120]  Zero hedge here, folks
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  All in
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:56.120]  All right, we're going to your calls here
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.120]  But let me hit something really big right now
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:00.120]  There was a hot mic yesterday
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:03.120]  Where Democrat representative admits to
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:06.120]  Governor Tom Woods, political theater
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:08.120]  Worn for on-camera
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:11.120]  A high mic picked up the Pennsylvania House rep
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:14.120]  Admitting to the state's governor, Tom Wolf
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:16.120]  That face masks are only being worn
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:18.120]  As political theater
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:20.120]  And that's why when you see Pelosi or Schumer
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:22.120]  Or Feinstein
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:24.120]  Or any of these people
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:26.120]  They're not wearing them at restaurants
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:28.120]  The Philadelphia mayor, the Denver mayor
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:30.120]  The Houston mayor, none of them do it
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:32.120]  Pelosi doesn't wear it
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:34.120]  Remember when she said to play
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.120]  It's all a fraud
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.120]  It's about the power they have to shut your business down
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:40.120]  And their businesses stay open
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  Like Governor Psycho Newsom
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:44.120]  He never closed
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:46.120]  He has the biggest wine company
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:48.120]  And restaurant chain where people go pay
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  $100 a piece to drink wine
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.120]  And eat fancy food at these damn vineyards
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:54.120]  He's got
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:56.120]  He kept them open the whole time
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:00.120]  He should be politically torn limb from limb
[1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:04.120]  But no, he sits there and laughs at everybody
[1:05:04.120 --> 1:05:06.120]  And Facebook goes
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:08.120]  No one is setting fires in Oregon
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:10.120]  Or California or Washington
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:12.120]  And then there's dozens being arrested
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:14.120]  And dozens of videos of people setting fires
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:16.120]  And they arrest the same guy two days in a row
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:18.120]  Is Antifa and BLM
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:20.120]  And then people go, oh Joe Rogan
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:22.120]  You're wrong
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:24.120]  You said the fires were being set by Antifa
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:26.120]  He goes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
[1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:28.120]  Because Facebook said
[1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:30.120]  Facebook said Trump can't declare himself the winner
[1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:32.120]  Facebook said they won't let Trump
[1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:34.120]  Say that
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:36.120]  And now Fox News says, hey, you're not allowed to say
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:38.120]  That you can test the election, only we can
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:40.120]  They're pissing in your face
[1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:42.120]  They're rubbing it in, they're teaching you
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:44.120]  That you have no rights
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:46.120]  They're taking
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:48.120]  800 years
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:50.120]  Of western
[1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:52.120]  British common law
[1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:54.120]  Magna Carta, Constitution
[1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:56.120]  Villa rights that millions died for
[1:05:56.120 --> 1:05:58.120]  And you notice, boom
[1:05:58.120 --> 1:06:00.120]  They take you right away, you are now
[1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:02.120]  Absolutely overrun
[1:06:02.120 --> 1:06:04.120]  So
[1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:06.120]  Here's the hot mic
[1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:08.120]  Where she walks over, she's like, listen
[1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:10.120]  You got to keep it on, the sheep have got to see it
[1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:12.120]  Like when they're on the news
[1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:14.120]  Oh and co-bears, you know, at home
[1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:16.120]  It's too dangerous to go out
[1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:18.120]  I know the audience knows all this, but this is just
[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.120]  Outrageous
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:22.120]  So let's go ahead and roll the video
[1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:28.120]  So Wendy, I'm going to take
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:30.120]  I'm going to take my mask off
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:32.120]  I won't as well
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:34.120]  I'm waiting so that we can do a little
[1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:36.120]  Political theater
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:40.120]  So that it's on camera
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:44.120]  Can we roll the footage of Fauci
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:46.120]  For TV viewers, radio listeners
[1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:48.120]  Anybody can just type in Fauci
[1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:50.120]  When he sees the cameras turn off, he thinks
[1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:52.120]  He takes it off and walks out
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:54.120]  Fauci is
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:56.120]  A slave though, at first Fauci is like
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:06:58.120]  Don't wear a mask, they don't help you, because it's true
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:00.120]  But then once
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:02.120]  The establishment said, no, keep them on as a cult symbol
[1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:04.120]  And as a symbol of division
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:06.120]  Getting you ready for the vaccine, well, then it happened
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:08.120]  And there's footage of him in Congress
[1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:10.120]  Just type in Fauci takes off
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:12.120]  Mask in Congress after cameras turned off
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.120]  And then they do this thing where they sit
[1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:16.120]  30 feet apart
[1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:18.120]  I mean, again, I know you know all that
[1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:20.120]  But it's outrageous, you know, I go for
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:22.120]  Hikes a couple of days a week
[1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:24.120]  And when I walk by the slaves
[1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:26.120]  I don't care if it's one time or 50 times
[1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:28.120]  I say COVID-19
[1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:30.120]  Is an overblown scam
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:32.120]  Designed to kill the economy
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:34.120]  And starve the third world to death
[1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:36.120]  And I let him know
[1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:40.120]  Alright, let's go ahead now and go to this last piece
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:42.120]  Notice that Melania Trump
[1:07:42.120 --> 1:07:44.120]  Did not wear
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:46.120]  A master in the debate, but Biden's
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:48.120]  Wife did
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:50.120]  And again, that's all part
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:52.120]  Of their virtue signaling, and I know you know that
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:54.120]  As an audience, so what are you doing
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:56.120]  To warn others?
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:07:58.120]  We'll take this clip, the last five minutes
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:00.120]  And I'll end that video
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.120]  With a headline
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.120]  Hot Mike Democrats admit
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:06.120]  Mask are part of political theater
[1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:08.120]  And if you share that on your email and your text message
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:10.120]  On the last frontiers of where you can communicate
[1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.120]  And they're starting to censor that
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:14.120]  It will change the tide
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:16.120]  Until others, look, they admit the master scam
[1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.120]  Share this, put in the email, share it
[1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:20.120]  Call people, get them to open it
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:22.120]  Hey, I emailed you this, open it and share it
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:24.120]  That triggers what do they fear?
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:26.120]  Chain reactions
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:28.120]  Okay, I'm going to your calls
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:30.120]  Ahead of Jim Hoft
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:32.120]  And so much more
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:34.120]  I got a lot of big news, but we won't cover that
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  For the bottom of the hour, because I'm going to your calls
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:38.120]  We got more excerpts of the debate
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:40.120]  We've got Sean, we've got Mike Joseph
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:42.120]  Dave, David, Mikey
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:44.120]  Mike, Tanya,
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:46.120]  Jason, Greg, Catherine
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:48.120]  And many, many others
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:50.120]  Let's go ahead and go to Tanya
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:52.120]  In the great state of Colorado
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:54.120]  First Tanya, thanks for holding
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:56.120]  Go ahead
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:08:58.120]  Hi Alex, first off I wanted to say
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:00.120]  Thank you for everything you're doing
[1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:02.120]  Love what you're doing, love your team
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:04.120]  And I have you in my prayers constantly
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:06.120]  I wanted to mention
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:08.120]  Amendment 20
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:10.120]  Richard Proctor was on
[1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:12.120]  Doug Hagman's show
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:14.120]  A couple of weeks ago
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:16.120]  And I know he's often on David Knight's show
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:18.120]  But he was going over the 20th amendment
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  Is really going to be
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:22.120]  If Trump doesn't do something before the election
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:24.120]  The states are extending
[1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:26.120]  How long they have to
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.120]  For voters to file
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:30.120]  For those that don't know
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:32.120]  Under the 20th amendment
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:34.120]  On the 20th of January
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:36.120]  If Trump hasn't been seated
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:38.120]  Pelosi and the House of Representatives
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:40.120]  The Democrat run will decide as the president
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:42.120]  Exactly, and it's horrifying
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:44.120]  And if Trump doesn't get that through his head
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:46.120]  That he has to use his power now
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:48.120]  To stop them, then I don't know what to say
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:50.120]  And by the way
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:52.120]  I know how frustrating it is
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:54.120]  That it's only David Knight
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.120]  And a few other people
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:09:58.120]  And by the way, let's get that guest on
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:00.120]  He's excellent, and I want to see everybody
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.120]  I want to be made obsolete
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:04.120]  I don't want forcible injections
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:06.120]  I don't want microchips, I don't want to be killed
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.120]  I don't want to be a slave
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:10.120]  I don't want to be married to a muzzle
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:12.120]  And that's what's so frustrating is
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:14.120]  So many other people territorialize the info
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:16.120]  I don't care who gets the credit
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:18.120]  I just want everybody to know
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:20.120]  Joe Rogan, you name it
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:22.120]  I'll just say
[1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:24.120]  It's not about bragging
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:26.120]  But I don't want to get in trouble
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:28.120]  You name it, the big names have called me
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:30.120]  And said, man, you were right, we apologize
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:32.120]  Wow, you were a visionary
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:34.120]  I don't care about that, just get this out
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:36.120]  We're trying, you know, work or tell
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:38.120]  What we can do
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:40.120]  So the biggest people, not just Joe Rogan
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:42.120]  The big names, they all call me
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:44.120]  And they say, oh my god, you're right
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:46.120]  What do we do?
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:48.120]  The only one that's done that and has had courage
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:50.120]  Is Tucker Carlson
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:52.120]  And that's it, and he can't even go that far
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:54.120]  Because they try to control him
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:56.120]  That's amazing, I wish
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:58.120]  We could take over the airways
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.120]  Just like when they live and just
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:02.120]  Push the signal out to all these cheapos
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:04.120]  That are asleep, I'm so sick of
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:06.120]  The people wearing masks and not
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:08.120]  Fighting back against it, and that's the first thing
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.120]  Are they not seeing what's going on?
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:12.120]  They probably aren't, because they're watching mainstream media
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:14.120]  They're not seeing what's going on in the rest of the world
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:16.120]  And we have that to look forward to
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:18.120]  The tyranny is coming down on us
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  And if we don't stop it now
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:22.120]  We have no chance to fight back
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:24.120]  And it just makes me so nervous
[1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:26.120]  Exactly, the gates are closing
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:28.120]  Yes, well
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:30.120]  It's like the temple at doom or
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:32.120]  Where's the lost arteries running through the
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:34.120]  Temple, and he's got to just jump under the door
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:36.120]  As it's closing, the damn door is closing
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  That this is admitted, pure tyranny
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:40.120]  Laughing at us, admitting they're going to eff us up
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:42.120]  And it's like a guy who pulls the knives about to stab you
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.120]  You got to fight, they're coming with
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:46.120]  Deadly poison vaccines
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:48.120]  And they know it's going to hurt so many people
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.120]  They're like, a lot of people are going to die and get sick
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:52.120]  They already are dying in the test
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:54.120]  We don't care, they're getting the point
[1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:56.120]  Where they're admitting they're going to hurt us
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:58.120]  To normalize that
[1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:00.120]  Exactly, I wish Trump wouldn't be so politically correct
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.120]  He just needs to take the gloves completely off
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  And, you know, and
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:06.120]  Oh, maybe get
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:08.120]  Kaylee McEnany
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:10.120]  During her
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  Her press conferences
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:14.120]  To show video, like it was great when she
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:16.120]  Showed Nancy Pelosi without the mask
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:18.120]  They need to show more of those videos
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  That's a fireside chat
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  2.0, he needs at least twice a week
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.120]  At the White House
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:26.120]  Show people, God bless you
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:28.120]  And look, a lot of folks thought
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:30.120]  Trump did a terrible job last night
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:32.120]  They were interrupting, they were all over
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:34.120]  He did an A-minus
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:36.120]  But absolutely, he should have said
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:38.120]  Joe Biden wants your guns, he hates America
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:40.120]  He's got it over the destruction of the country
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:42.120]  He's just got his points out
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.120]  And so I get a lot of people are mad at Trump
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:46.120]  They want to see even more from him
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:48.120]  And I predict he'll do just like last time
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:50.120]  They'll get stronger in the next debate
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:52.120]  Until the Democrats don't want another debate
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:54.120]  That tells you he won last night
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:56.120]  Introducing InfoWarsLife
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:58.120]  Pure turmeric extract
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:00.120]  This is taken under the tongue
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:02.120]  It is pure turmeric
[1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:04.120]  It goes together very well
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:06.120]  With our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:08.120]  Capsule and absorbed in the stomach
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:10.120]  And intestines
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:12.120]  This is absorbed under the tongue
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:14.120]  Into the bloodstream, and then the remaining
[1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:16.120]  Also is absorbed by the stomach
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:18.120]  So it's more of an intense delivery system
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:20.120]  The two formulas are different
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:22.120]  But both are concentrates
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:24.120]  And our first product got rave reviews
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:26.120]  We've now been testing this out for several months
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:28.120]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:30.120]  Some like bodies better
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:32.120]  For me, they're both amazing
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:34.120]  For their anti-inflammatory action and so much more
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:36.120]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract

[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:20.120]  Now, I've pointed this out
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:22.120]  And the media has called me a scammer
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:24.120]  For saying that there's hope
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:26.120]  And that people should have their vitamins and their minerals
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:28.120]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:30.120]  And admit that you need vitamin D3
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:32.120]  And see, he should have also added zinc
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:34.120]  Because the NIH website says you die without zinc
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:36.120]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:38.120]  To admit the reality
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.120]  Because so many doctors and nurses
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:42.120]  And experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:44.120]  That he's being pressured now
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:46.120]  To admit the reality
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:48.120]  That experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:50.120]  That he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins
[1:14:54.120 --> 1:14:58.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:14.120]  Well, it really was Trump debating two different men
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:16.120]  Joe Biden clearly has got some blood transfusions
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:18.120]  And some speed
[1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:20.120]  Still didn't do a very good job
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:22.120]  But they sure lied their asses off
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:24.120]  How dare you say the troops are dumb bastards
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:26.120]  When he's on video saying it
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:28.120]  Just upside down world
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:30.120]  Mike in Chicago, what'd you think of the debate last night, my friend?
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:32.120]  I wouldn't say that whole thing was a joke yesterday
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:34.120]  Like, I've never seen a president
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.120]  Get blue-balled so much in a debate
[1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:38.120]  So it's ridiculous, man
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:40.120]  I've never seen a president
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:42.120]  Get blue-balled so much in a debate
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:44.120]  So it's ridiculous, man
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:46.120]  Oh, the absolute disrespect of the president
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:48.120]  But I think America sees through that
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.120]  What do you think of the CNN focus group?
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.120]  Everybody said Trump won, but one lady
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:54.120]  And 66% of Hispanics
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:56.120]  And Telemundo Paul said that Trump won
[1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:02.120]  Well, you know, it makes sense
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:04.120]  I mean, if you listen to some of the stuff that he says in there
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:06.120]  Like the things he talks about
[1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:08.120]  Like with the forest fire, everything in California
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:10.120]  With the fact that they weren't handling
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:12.120]  Their forest management that good
[1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:14.120]  You know, it's like
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:16.120]  You know, he had some really key points
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:18.120]  And I feel that Chris Wallace
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:20.120]  Just kind of passed
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:22.120]  Them by to go to Joe Biden
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:24.120]  You mean Chris the rat Wallace
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:26.120]  Would interrupt every time
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  Trump said something really powerful? Absolutely
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:30.120]  Yeah, exactly
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:32.120]  But give us your honest view
[1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:34.120]  How good do you think Trump did? Where did he do bad?
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:36.120]  What do you wish he would have said?
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:38.120]  I mean, I kind of wish
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:40.120]  He would have went a little bit more into
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:42.120]  The whole ballot mismanagement
[1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:44.120]  Like with Elan Omar
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:46.120]  You know, to kind of
[1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:48.120]  Bring up that point
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:50.120]  The Democrat Party's kind of
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:52.120]  Trying to create a fraud election with the mail
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:54.120]  Absolutely, Mike, we love you
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:56.120]  We appreciate you calling from Chicago, brother
[1:16:56.120 --> 1:16:58.120]  Keep spreading the word, that's the only way we're going to win
[1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:00.120]  Let's go to a caller in Wyoming
[1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:02.120]  Let's talk to Greg in Wyoming
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:04.120]  Greg, go ahead
[1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:06.120]  Alex, it's a beautiful day
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:08.120]  In the middle of nowhere, Wyoming
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:10.120]  The skies are blue
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:12.120]  But I can see a dark cloud
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:14.120]  Coming at us
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  That makes me think of that Merle Hacker song
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:18.120]  About a middle of nowhere
[1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:20.120]  Like somewhere like Montana
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:22.120]  I'd say the wind is really pretty too, brother
[1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:24.120]  You see a dark cloud coming, what do you see?
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:26.120]  Well, I see a false flag
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:28.120]  Election coming on it
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:30.120]  And this mail in election
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:32.120]  Just really cannot be allowed
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:34.120]  And because we
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:36.120]  The common thought is that
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:38.120]  If we have a mail in election
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:40.120]  It's going to be Democrats
[1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:42.120]  Voting for Biden
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:44.120]  But I don't see that
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:46.120]  What I see them doing is false flagging
[1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.120]  Trump and Trump supporters
[1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.120]  The American people
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:52.120]  By stuffing the ballot boxes
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:54.120]  With Trump votes
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:56.120]  So then they know where to find the votes
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:58.120]  And they can point their wicked fingers
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:00.120]  Of blame at you and me
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:02.120]  And Donald Trump
[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:04.120]  And claim that we rig the election
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:06.120]  Oh, you think they're going to claim
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:08.120]  That Republicans stuffed the ballot box?
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:10.120]  Yes, sir
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:12.120]  They're wicked people
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:14.120]  That's their MO
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:16.120]  They always project their crimes
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:18.120]  On to others
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:20.120]  And then attack the innocent
[1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:22.120]  They do it all the time
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:24.120]  No, you're right, if they follow their pattern
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:26.120]  Of always blaming us for what they do
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:28.120]  They would then
[1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:30.120]  They would
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:32.120]  Stuff the ballot boxes
[1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:34.120]  With fake Trump votes
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:36.120]  To then claim that Trump would engage in fraud
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:38.120]  And then throw the election
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:40.120]  Bottom line, they want to throw the election
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:42.120]  Into question to bring in the 20th amendment
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:44.120]  So that Pelosi can have a vote
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:46.120]  And she can basically appoint who she wants president
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:48.120]  But I think you're right, I think that's something
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:50.120]  We should definitely watch for
[1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:52.120]  Because notice, Chris Wallace kept saying
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:54.120]  You're not going to contest the election
[1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.120]  You're not going to cause a problem
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.120]  Hillary, Podesta
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:00.120]  Biden, they all say they're going to contest
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:02.120]  But then Trump can't contest
[1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:04.120]  That is just crazy
[1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:06.120]  How does Trump respond to that with 33 days out?
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:08.120]  Well, he's got to
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:10.120]  Just nullify
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.120]  This whole mail-in election
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:14.120]  I mean, we...
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:16.120]  Exactly, but they've got the courts ruling
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:18.120]  It can be done on purpose, thank you so much
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:20.120]  This is a big deal, folks
[1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:24.120]  They never had a way to get rid of Trump before
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:26.120]  He wasn't in bed with Russia, he wasn't in bed with Ukraine
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:28.120]  Everything fell apart, but this time
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:30.120]  They can use the election
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:32.120]  As the process to do this
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:34.120]  And we've got the Supreme Court situation
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:36.120]  Coming up, but this is so explosive
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:38.120]  All right, let's go to Mike in Arizona
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:40.120]  Then we'll go to Catherine and others
[1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:42.120]  Mike, welcome
[1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:44.120]  Yeah, hi, Alex
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:46.120]  65-year-old citrus farmer
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:48.120]  Here in the Phoenix area
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:50.120]  Liberty Hill, been listening to you
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:52.120]  For 15 years
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:54.120]  I take a lot of your products
[1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:56.120]  You're a good man
[1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.120]  And, you know, my folks
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:00.120]  Did a fundraiser for
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:02.120]  Goldwater back in the day
[1:20:02.120 --> 1:20:04.120]  We're all libertarians here
[1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.120]  And I spread the news for Trump
[1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:08.120]  Everywhere I go
[1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:10.120]  Because I'm getting ready to retire, Alex
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:12.120]  And I looked at a guy like Joe Biden
[1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:14.120]  Who's done nothing for 50 years
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:18.120]  How in the heck was he prepared last night?
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:20.120]  It seems to me they juiced him up
[1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:22.120]  Prop him up
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:24.120]  And it seems to me he got the questions ahead of time
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:26.120]  What do you think?
[1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:28.120]  He definitely did
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:30.120]  He's been rehearsing for weeks
[1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:32.120]  They admit he got the questions, that's come out
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:34.120]  But here's what's more important
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:36.120]  The blood transfusion
[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:38.120]  Now, that gives you a danger of stroke
[1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:40.120]  But if they give you a young person's blood
[1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.120]  Especially a teenager who's younger
[1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:44.120]  Of a healthy teenager
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:46.120]  That's what you're witnessing right there
[1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:48.120]  Was undoubtedly blood transfusions
[1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:50.120]  Do you notice how much plump his face was?
[1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:52.120]  Look at his hands, they were way more plumpy
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:54.120]  Than usual
[1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:56.120]  Biden definitely got blood transfusions
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:20:58.120]  See the eyes bugging out?
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.120]  His eyes don't normally do that
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:02.120]  Think about how shriveled he looked
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:04.120]  Just days before
[1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:06.120]  How did he suddenly gain like 10 pounds?
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:08.120]  Blood transfusion, brother
[1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:10.120]  And listen, Murray Goldwater was awesome
[1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:12.120]  And he helped educate people
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:14.120]  So it was the actions of your parents
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:16.120]  Way back then that led to the chain reaction
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:18.120]  Paul and info wars and everything today
[1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:20.120]  We really appreciate you, Mike, anything else?
[1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:22.120]  Real quick, Alex
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:24.120]  You know, if Trump hadn't been as aggressive
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:26.120]  As he usually is last night
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:28.120]  Wallace kept throwing him body checks
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:30.120]  I mean, it was insane
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:32.120]  You could see how one-sided it was
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:34.120]  The other thing, Alex, real quick
[1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:36.120]  Your callers are talking about the 20th Amendment
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:38.120]  If Pelosi has a chance to vote
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:40.120]  Somebody in
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:42.120]  Who takes over and then what
[1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:44.120]  What do we look like real quick
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:46.120]  On January 20th or thereabouts
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:48.120]  Or let's assume that
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.120]  That sucker Biden gets in somehow
[1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:52.120]  What does that look like, Alex?
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:54.120]  Well, you notice Chris Wallace said
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:56.120]  He said, your people
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:58.120]  If it's contested and held up a few weeks or months
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  They're not going to be aggressive, are they?
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:02.120]  Because they're really worried about us getting aggressive
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:04.120]  And finally removing them
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:06.120]  They're going to have their people burning things and shooting and killing
[1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:08.120]  But if we raise a finger, we're terrorists
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:10.120]  Well, once they get full control
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:12.120]  They're coming for everybody
[1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:14.120]  They're still in the election
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:16.120]  The American people have a right and a duty
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:18.120]  However, they see fit to stand up against it
[1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:20.120]  That doesn't mean going downtown to fight their antifa methods
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:22.120]  They're paying $20 an hour
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:24.120]  It means who are the enemy? Who are the globalists?
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:26.120]  What have they done?
[1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:28.120]  And that's where we are
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:30.120]  We have a foreign Chinese communist backed
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:32.120]  Attempted to take over the country
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:34.120]  They're really trying it because they never got in trouble
[1:22:34.120 --> 1:22:36.120]  So why shouldn't they? So I asked the listeners
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:38.120]  That's what I'm saying, what do we do?
[1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:40.120]  Thank you so much, Mike
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:42.120]  Let's come back to Catherine
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:44.120]  We got so many other callers
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:46.120]  I'm going to go in the order they receive Sean
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:48.120]  And many, many others
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:50.120]  Your calls are straight ahead
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:52.120]  I'm not somebody that talks about violence to act tough
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:54.120]  And I'm not planning any myself
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:56.120]  But they're coming with forced inoculations
[1:22:56.120 --> 1:22:58.120]  They admit it can kill you or make you sick
[1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:00.120]  And don't even protect you
[1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:02.120]  And when they're saying that they're going to take your kids away
[1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:04.120]  Under UN auspices if you don't let them take the vaccine
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:06.120]  And when they're saying we're going to kill cops
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:08.120]  And we're going to stop you at checkpoints
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:10.120]  Soros Group, we're going to put a cap in your ass
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:12.120]  I'm done
[1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:14.120]  And I've been on there 26 years
[1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:16.120]  I'm just telling folks, like Christ said
[1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:18.120]  Sell your cloak and buy a gun
[1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:22.120]  Now, a cloak was your overgarden
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:24.120]  He didn't say sell your underwear
[1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:26.120]  He didn't sell your loincloth
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:28.120]  He'd wrap a thing around yourself
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:30.120]  He didn't say share your shorts
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:32.120]  Or your shirt or your sandals
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:34.120]  He said sell your cloak
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:36.120]  Better for you to get cold at night
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:38.120]  You need a weapon
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:40.120]  The thing's going to keep you warm and safe is a weapon
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:42.120]  You need weapons now
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:44.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, to defend your family
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  This is the communist takeover
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:48.120]  Soros is color revolutionist right now
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:50.120]  And he's coming for us in the hands
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:52.120]  The globalists are very, very honest
[1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:54.120]  About their planetary goals
[1:23:54.120 --> 1:23:56.120]  They want private corporate
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:58.120]  Governance
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:00.120]  Above nation states
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:02.120]  Above religious institutions
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.120]  Above the family
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:06.120]  Above corporate power
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:08.120]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:10.120]  Called Roller Ball with James Cahn
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:12.120]  And it's based on a novel
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:14.120]  Set in the year 2020
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:16.120]  And in the book
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:18.120]  You have mega corporates that control the planet
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:20.120]  And there are no longer
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:22.120]  Nation states
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:24.120]  There are only cities
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:26.120]  That are the capitals of the corporations
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:28.120]  Well, if you actually read
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  What the most group of the CFR
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:32.120]  At the Lionel commission say
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:34.120]  That is their in game
[1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:36.120]  That is their goal
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:38.120]  So we're talking about hunger games
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:40.120]  Type scenario here
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:42.120]  Run by very, very, very ruthless people
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  To see us as shadow
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  And they're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:48.120]  The communist China as their model
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.120]  We must reject it now
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:52.120]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:54.120]  And I've been at the NIH
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:56.120]  And CDC for 45 years
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:58.120]  And I've overseen well
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:00.120]  You know the AIDS pandemic
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:02.120]  And so many other things
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  And I take my orders
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:06.120]  From Bill Gates
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  Dr. Bill Gates, I mean
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:10.120]  He's not a doctor, but he controls
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:12.120]  Everything you do
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  And he now says
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:16.120]  You're going to take the shots
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:18.120]  And of course in England
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:20.120]  They are now saying what I told you
[1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:22.120]  You will not be allowed to travel
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:24.120]  Leave your home until you take all the shots
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  Gates, your owner
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:30.120]  Your master
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:32.120]  Says you will have to take
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:34.120]  4-5 COVID shots a year
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.120]  For adult, too
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:38.120]  For baby here
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:40.120]  Baby may be much more manageable
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:42.120]  Just like Bill Gates give you
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  Polio and vaccine
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:46.120]  I'm Dr. Fauci
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:48.120]  Reminding you that we owe you
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:50.120]  The Renaissance
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:52.120]  The Great Enlightenment
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:54.120]  It's all being swept away
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:56.120]  And being replaced by
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:58.120]  Scientific tyranny
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:00.120]  That's establishing
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:02.120]  A form of planetary
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:04.120]  Digital law
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:06.120]  Where the technocrats are above the law
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.120]  The public isn't even
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:10.120]  Considered to be as valuable
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:12.120]  As a count
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:14.120]  In fact humans are seen as garbage
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.120]  That's going to be taken out and removed
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:18.120]  That is the post-human
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  Exterminus plan
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:22.120]  That is the public ideology of the globalist
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:24.120]  And everything they've built
[1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.120]  That tech grid
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  Is to absorb us
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:30.120]  And anesthetize our minds
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.120]  As we're slowly killed
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:34.120]  And any future generations
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:36.120]  That happen to straggle
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:38.120]  Out of their mother's wounds
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:40.120]  Will be a mere shadow of what
[1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:42.120]  Humans once were
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.120]  This is the satanic ruling elite
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:46.120]  Engaged in mass vandalism
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:48.120]  Against God's creation
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:27.800]  Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:33.440]  the Trump administration, along with 18 state attorneys general, are seeking to overturn
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:35.680]  Obamacare, to end Obamacare.
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:36.680]  You have spent the last...
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:38.680]  Because they want to give good health care.
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:40.720]  If I may ask my question, sir.
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:41.840]  Good health care.
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:47.320]  Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:54.480]  have never, in these four years, come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare.
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:55.480]  Of course I have.
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:56.480]  Well, I'll give you an opportunity.
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:57.480]  I got rid of the individual mandate.
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:27:58.480]  Excuse me.
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:01.480]  I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big joke of Obamacare.
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:02.480]  That is not a comprehensive plan.
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:03.960]  That is absolutely a big thing.
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:04.960]  That was the worst part of Obamacare.
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:05.960]  I didn't ask you, sir.
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:06.960]  Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:07.960]  You're debating him not me.
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:08.960]  Let me ask my question.
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:09.960]  Well, I'll ask Joe.
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:10.960]  I know...
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:13.960]  The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:14.960]  I got rid of it.
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  I'd like you to...
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:19.840]  I'm the president, I'm the moderator of this debate, and I would like you to let me ask
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:23.240]  my question, and then you can answer your question.
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:27.400]  In the course of these four years, you have never come up with a comprehensive plan to
[1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:30.320]  replace Obamacare.
[1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:37.120]  And just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:42.120]  people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate.
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:45.680]  So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:48.160]  Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him.
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:49.160]  But that's okay.
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:50.160]  I'm not surprised.
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:51.160]  Let me just tell you something.
[1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:53.000]  That there's nothing symbolic.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.320]  I'm cutting drug prices.
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:58.280]  I'm going with favorite nations, which no president has the courage to do because you're
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:28:59.960]  going against big pharma.
[1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:05.000]  That's how the scam works, is they create Obamacare that Ezekiel Emanuel admitted was
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.440]  meant to wreck the system and then create single payer still run by big banks so they
[1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:13.000]  can charge you whatever they want and get rid of competition, even more nightmare.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:16.600]  That's like fascism, not even communism.
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.160]  And they do these scams over and over again.
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:19.160]  So here's Trump.
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.240]  We pay the highest amount for prescription drugs because the middleman, he's got to deal
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.240]  to slice up to 90%.
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:26.440]  They don't want to hear any of that.
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:27.440]  And Chris Wallace does that.
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:28.440]  It's truly disgusting.
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:30.920]  I'm going to go to your calls very, very soon.
[1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:34.760]  We also have some other guests joining us, the head of Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft, is going
[1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:36.680]  to be popping in and more today.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:43.000]  But I wanted to get, and I appreciate him coming on from Europe, on very, very, very
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:50.280]  short notice, Dan Lyman, because this is the type of thing that's at europewars.com that
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:51.280]  will bring them down.
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:56.680]  If you just charge George Soros or the NGOs under him that publicly pay for the Zodiac
[1:29:56.680 --> 1:30:01.680]  boats, pay for the human smuggling, it's all felonies, pay for the caravans, then it'll
[1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:02.680]  stop.
[1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:06.280]  That's when Fox News, everyone has a guest on to say it, oh, you can't say that or oh,
[1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:15.440]  you can't talk about that judicial watch on the different business shows or even former
[1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:20.200]  speaker of the house just last week getting told, oh, you're not supposed to get into
[1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:21.200]  George Soros.
[1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:22.200]  That was New Cambridge.
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:30.000]  So he's striking right at the root here, and Greece is taking action, smashes migrant
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  trafficking network, arrests dozens of non-governmental organization operatives.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:36.840]  So this is the right direction.
[1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:41.080]  We now have, in just a month, more people coming across the English Channel with Spain
[1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:47.560]  and France organizing it, and the British government trying to cover it up.
[1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:52.680]  So the invasion is heating up again for round two as the third world collapses under COVID
[1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:53.680]  lockdown.
[1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:58.480]  The COVID is not causing the mass death and the migration, it is the COVID lockdown that
[1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:01.960]  is causing it, and again, that's part of the larger globalist plan, again, of dividing
[1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:05.920]  Congress, and Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com investigative journalist joins us to give
[1:31:05.920 --> 1:31:08.200]  us this latest news and other developments.
[1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:15.000]  Yeah, we had a big story break out of Greece yesterday, really big development, kind of
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  went under the radar for about 24 hours, and then it started breaking on the European news
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:20.880]  and in the Greek local news.
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:27.600]  Basically, the government has been conducting an investigation, the counter-terrorism and
[1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:33.320]  the intelligence agencies has been investigating these groups that have been involved in migrant
[1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:34.320]  smuggling.
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:39.160]  They believe that they have transported thousands of migrants from the shores of Turkey onto
[1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:43.640]  the Greek islands, most specifically onto the island of Lesbos.
[1:31:43.640 --> 1:31:45.880]  And so this is a big, big deal.
[1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:51.280]  They have basically smashed this network and rolled up 33 operatives of four different
[1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:55.360]  NGO, non-governmental organizations.
[1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:59.280]  Most of them were based in Germany, three out of the four, and the fourth nobody had
[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:00.280]  really heard of.
[1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:02.920]  It's probably one of these ones that kind of operates under the radar.
[1:32:02.920 --> 1:32:06.000]  And all the operatives that they rolled up are from outside Greece.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.440]  We have Swiss residents, German, French, Bulgarian, all from all over Europe, and then two more
[1:32:11.440 --> 1:32:15.360]  from outside Europe, both of them were apparently illegal migrants.
[1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:19.440]  And basically, this strikes, like you said, at the root of the operation.
[1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:22.600]  This is where the money is flowing in from the top.
[1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:26.880]  These organizations actually work hand in hand with the United Nations, with the International
[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:29.040]  Organization for Migration.
[1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:34.920]  And they basically work to transport migrants from Turkey that have come in from other countries
[1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:39.480]  such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and bring them into Europe.
[1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:44.760]  And then the operation goes on from there to bring them onto mainland Europe.
[1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:46.400]  Continue laying this out.
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:47.400]  Sure.
[1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:51.520]  What is interesting about this is, like I said, they have been bringing them onto these
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:52.520]  islands.
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:55.640]  They have been bringing them into the islands typically that are closest to Turkey.
[1:32:55.640 --> 1:33:00.720]  Lesvos is the one that is most notorious because at this point, they have been inundated with
[1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:06.880]  over 10,000, sometimes as many as 20,000 migrants at any given time for years now on an island
[1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:08.920]  with a much smaller population.
[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:14.480]  And what happened recently was the migrant camp there, the asylum center, that was designed
[1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:18.400]  to only hold a few thousand people, which has been holding over 10,000 people for a
[1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:19.560]  long time now.
[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:22.000]  It basically burned to the ground.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:27.360]  And because of that, these NGO operatives were then able to apply pressure on the governments
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:30.240]  around Europe, on the EU.
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:32.960]  Not that it was really much needed, it's all part of the plan.
[1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:36.800]  And also on the Greek government to then relocate the migrants that had been staying on this
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:41.280]  island, that they were having difficulty getting them off the island onto the mainland.
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:46.360]  They were able to use this as the excuse to basically pressure governments into taking
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:50.280]  many migrants and saying, you know, well, we've had a catastrophic loss of the asylum
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:52.720]  center here, so now we need somewhere to put them.
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:54.480]  And that operation has already begun.
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:59.120]  They're already moving migrants into countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:01.240]  And so that that's what's going on.
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:03.840]  So this operation runs deep.
[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:07.340]  Just getting them from Turkey to Greece, the Greek Islands is a big thing.
[1:34:07.340 --> 1:34:11.120]  But then from there, they have ways where they move them onto the mainland and be very
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:12.120]  clear.
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:13.280]  And then they're politically owned by Soros.
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:17.280]  They're politically owned and are continually controlled as operatives.
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:18.280]  Absolutely.
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:20.520]  And that's where they get a lot of their funding.
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:25.680]  Now, the people that are actually working on the ground, I call them Antifa of the sea.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:29.480]  These people, you look at them, you know that they are definitely Antifa sympathetic, if
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:32.880]  not actual outright supporters of members of the cell.
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:37.640]  These are skinny gene liberal trendies look like methods from Europe, from Germany, from
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:39.760]  the U.S., as you said, mainly Germany.
[1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:40.760]  Absolutely.
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:43.080]  A lot of Germans are involved with this.
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:46.760]  And you know, I've heard some pretty harrowing stories about the way that these NGO operatives
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:49.480]  comport themselves with the migrants themselves.
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:52.360]  I've heard stories that they, a lot of them sleep with the migrants.
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:53.560]  They're in close contact with them.
[1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:55.920]  Oh yeah, it's all very piratical.
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:56.920]  Absolutely.
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:00.800]  You know, they're in close contact with them on these boats for sometimes a week at a time
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:02.560]  if they can't get into a port.
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:04.360]  So they spent a lot of time with them.
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:07.720]  And you know, what's amazing about the whole thing is you have these governments that are
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:13.200]  shutting down their countries, locking up their citizens under the guise of being worried
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:15.720]  about COVID-19, the coronavirus.
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:20.400]  But at the same time, they're bringing in thousands of foreigners who are either untested
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:23.040]  or many of them often do test positive.
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:26.920]  And they bring them into these European countries to then compound this supposed situation.
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:31.000]  And then it is 90% of the time that within three years, none of them have jobs and they
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.640]  create these giant ghettos that the governments control.
[1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:38.480]  This is a plan that the United Nations admits that you've exposed it at EuropeWars.com.
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:42.440]  What do you make of them trying to stop Nigel Farage going in videotaping and showing them
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:43.440]  landing?
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:44.440]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:45.440]  Absolutely.
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:50.360]  And there's another situation that continues to get crazier as we reported a few days ago.
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:54.720]  After just over three weeks into the month of September, they had received more migrants
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:58.680]  crossing the English Channel than all of 2019 combined.
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:01.080]  And there is no sign of that abating at this point.
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:05.840]  Nigel Farage has done one of the greatest services by getting out in the field and reporting
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:06.840]  on that himself.
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:10.280]  He's fashioned himself as an investigative journalist at this point, and he's exposing
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:11.280]  that.
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:14.640]  And recently today, I saw a report that, you know, we've been reporting on this at their
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:16.160]  housing them in hotels.
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:20.280]  They are now housing them in over 90 hotels in the U.K., according to this report.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:25.760]  Some of them are four-star hotels, and the U.K. taxpayers are paying for this despite
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:26.760]  an incident.
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:27.760]  Incredible thing.
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:30.720]  Come back with us in a couple of days for a full hour and send me all the material,
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.080]  because I mean, you've got a lot more of what we want you to be able to get into, because
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:35.640]  I know you know a lot more than I do.
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:40.160]  As much anybody does about this at EuropeWars.com, please come back and break it all down.
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:41.160]  Phone calls are straight ahead.
[1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:42.160]  Let me talk to you during the breakdown.
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:43.160]  We'll be right back.
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:48.240]  I know it shows, but remember, only if this information gets out as you share the links.
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:52.520]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.760]  They get you to give up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only gonna be a short
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.160]  period of time, and then the restructions will be released.
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:02.160]  But they're not.
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.880]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:11.160]  They will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later.
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:17.760]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism, or the inchworm effect.
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:22.240]  This is the most common way that the tallitarians take over, but there then becomes a point
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:24.400]  where the public wakes up.
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:28.440]  Under the incrementalism, he starts resisting, and then there's usually a giant purge and
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:33.280]  a clamp down, and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks, or months
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:37.760]  that you saw in the previous 10 years, and that's the period we're in globally right
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:38.760]  now.
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:44.000]  The federal government chai-con-backed, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:49.680]  you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:55.360]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:38:00.480]  put out detailed reports at Tablet Magazine documenting what any trained eye could already
[1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:02.480]  see as plain as day.
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:07.520]  Communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:13.000]  in the United States, as well as the media, put out fake videos in total hysteria to make
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:17.920]  it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:22.640]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:24.360]  within three months.
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:27.720]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:34.000]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means or the ultimate
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  style.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.320]  Well, Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:41.680]  Myself Alex Jones, David and I, no one sure are covering this heavily.
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:45.640]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:47.640]  were behind the hysteria.
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:55.880]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:39:04.960]  COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:06.560]  have died.
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:11.880]  Probably by the time I finish this talk, Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar.
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:15.280]  Part of the establishment for close to 50 years.
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:22.120]  But now, boy, as his brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public dementia on the
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:25.640]  biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:28.200]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:33.400]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population.
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:36.200]  And not even one tenth of 1% have actually died.
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:41.240]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:44.600]  emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:46.800]  How is anyone even putting up with this?
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:49.400]  It is beyond bizarre.
[1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:52.400]  The planets have aligned globally.
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:53.600]  They've aligned nationally.
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:58.560]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:04.560]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:05.560]  of our species.
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:10.400]  So that's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:16.240]  dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and track and control every
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:21.040]  aspect of our lives, literally grainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:27.160]  because they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:29.840]  and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:33.960]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:39.280]  life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:42.280]  credits and through a social credit score.
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:44.160]  This is their plan.
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:53.040]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say, no, we must embrace God.
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:41:06.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:10.360]  You are listening to the most demonized, most lied about program on earth.
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:11.360]  Wow.
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:12.840]  And it's because of what we cover.
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:16.840]  We cover the verboten, the forbidden, the secret.
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:20.600]  And we do it with the evidence and the facts and the history.
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.720]  All right, I want to go to like six calls during this segment.
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:27.600]  I want to get to everybody and then just continue on the next hour.
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:30.680]  Catherine in Virginia.
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:31.680]  Welcome.
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  Thanks for holding.
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:34.240]  Hi, Alex.
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:36.120]  Thank you for taking my call real quick.
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:42.680]  I just wanted to say that those who thought President Trump was angry and aggressive forget
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:48.240]  that he just came face to face with one of the key coup players who plotted to impeach
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:52.160]  and died and ultimately was willing to execute him.
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:53.160]  That's right.
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:57.960]  He was there with a globalist Russian Chycom agent that hates this country, that's trying
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:03.080]  to destroy his family and has to sit there while the little attack dog is on his leg
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:07.760]  and then Biden sitting over there laughing at him, you're absolutely right.
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:08.760]  That's all I wanted to say.
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:09.760]  I know you have other callers.
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:10.760]  Thank you.
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:11.760]  No, no, Catherine.
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:12.760]  That's beautifully said.
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:15.120]  What other pearls of wisdom do you have for us?
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:20.440]  You're one of the few people that understand what it's like to be so publicly defamed and
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:21.440]  vilified.
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:27.200]  I can't imagine if you came face to face with someone you could identify as the one behind
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:30.040]  the threats against you, your family, your nation.
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:35.760]  I thought Trump under the circumstances did remarkably well not to walk across the stage
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:37.640]  and just pummel the hell out of Biden.
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:40.480]  Well, that's why he looked better than four years ago.
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:41.480]  He did.
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:46.960]  He was very strong, but they were constantly interrupting him and constantly, fake fact
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:47.960]  checking him.
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:54.480]  I mean, nobody could do as good as he did last night other than he could have just jammed
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:57.640]  talking points in at him and basic things.
[1:42:57.640 --> 1:42:58.640]  You're not getting our guns.
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:00.280]  America's awake to you scum.
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:01.840]  It's over for you.
[1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:04.320]  That's the stuff his advisors tell him don't do.
[1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:06.880]  I agree with Robert Barnes who said he's in too big a bubble.
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:08.760]  He's got too many people saying be polished.
[1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:10.800]  No, folks don't want polished.
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:12.480]  They want brass knuckles.
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:15.280]  God bless you, Catherine.
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:19.600]  You know, the people that attack me, I don't even hate them because they're under Satan's
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:21.440]  control.
[1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:27.960]  I just, I'm more sad than anything.
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:33.840]  But the things that they've done to me and my family, I've never read about in books.
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:37.080]  I mean, it's new stuff under the sun.
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:41.560]  The level of evil, the level of manipulation, the level of delusion.
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:43.560]  Really what it is is crazy.
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.560]  People that are evil, maybe high functioning psychopaths, but they're still crazy.
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:49.560]  They got screws loose.
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:58.920]  I mean, they come up with stuff that no sane person would do and here's what I want to
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:01.960]  say on one of your calls.
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:05.520]  The level of tyranny we're already living under is astounding.
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:06.840]  It's astonishing.
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:09.640]  It's stupefying.
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:19.680]  The things already going on in this country are just horrifying and the arrogance of the
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:23.600]  people pushing it and the low level minions that aren't even getting power out of it.
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:25.000]  In fact, they're being enslaved.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:26.160]  They're being destroyed.
[1:44:26.160 --> 1:44:28.040]  They're having their future taken out from under them.
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:31.920]  The left is running around saying we want the dollar to die to get Trump.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:35.760]  That's like saying they want to burn their house down to get somebody that lives across
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:36.760]  town.
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:43.280]  Look, they have a satanic energy about them and it doesn't make sense because it doesn't
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:46.400]  make sense.
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:55.400]  They're a death cult and look, if I could run off the countryside somewhere with my children
[1:44:55.400 --> 1:45:03.320]  and get away from this system, I would do it, but you can't get away from it.
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:06.200]  You can't get away from the system.
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:07.200]  It's coming.
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:08.200]  It's coming fast.
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:09.200]  You can have to fight, folks.
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:10.200]  I'll just be honest.
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:16.120]  If I could run to some country and have another 50 years and 40 years and I would leave, there's
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:17.120]  nowhere to go.
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:21.760]  Our backs against the wall.
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:29.680]  And it just makes me sick because when I was not as knowledgeable, I could war game things
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:34.520]  and think, well, we'll defeat the enemy, we'll crush them in the fight, but they're soulless
[1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:35.520]  nobodies.
[1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:40.560]  So they're like non-player characters and so it doesn't even do anything.
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:42.040]  It's just ridiculous.
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:43.760]  It's all a loss.
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:44.920]  It's all a fraud.
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:45.920]  It's all empty.
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:46.920]  It's all pointless.
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:50.840]  It's all stupid, but it's all because the devil wants to destroy us.
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:57.040]  And once you figure out, oh, there's an entity, oh, it's real, then everything makes sense.
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:01.200]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:04.120]  Instead of taking six calls, I'm not only taking one.
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:05.120]  Let's talk to Sean in Ohio.
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:07.160]  Sean, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:10.160]  Hey, Alex, hey, man, we love you.
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:11.960]  We appreciate you for your work, man.
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.960]  I appreciate you, brother.
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:19.120]  Trump needs to just come out and expose this whole COVID thing.
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:23.560]  The leftist is running laps behind him, just waiting and waiting until Nancy Pelosi gets
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:24.560]  her chance to poke her head.
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:25.560]  No, I agree.
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.560]  I gave Trump bad advice eight months ago and I said, you better get ahead of this.
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:30.560]  It could be deadly.
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:35.080]  I know it's man-made, but you need to say it's serious so that they don't have to
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:39.160]  blame you politically for not responding, which was true at one political level.
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:43.080]  But he should have just attacked it and destroyed it up front, but we didn't have all the total
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:44.080]  facts yet.
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:45.080]  We had a good idea.
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:48.320]  So nobody's been purposely wrong here.
[1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:51.440]  But yeah, now it's time to destroy the whole thing.
[1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:54.920]  Not go, oh, we did the best job ever, we whatever, because they've made it political.
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:56.120]  He needs to destroy fouts.
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:46:58.560]  He destroyed gates, destroyed them all.
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:46:59.560]  That's my point.
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:01.080]  Why didn't he do that yesterday on stage?
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:04.840]  Why didn't he just come out and just put a border right there?
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:07.640]  It would tank the dollar.
[1:47:07.640 --> 1:47:11.000]  It would tank the stock market and he understands we're in an economic war.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.680]  So I know what he's doing and I'm not even saying I disagree.
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:14.680]  Here's the thing.
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:17.720]  I want frontal attacks until I think about the consequences.
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:22.320]  And so that's why I'm a surrogate.
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:25.120]  All of us are surrogates for President Trump, we decide to be.
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:28.480]  We can be the attack dogs, whereas in some cases he can't.
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:29.480]  Does that make sense?
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:30.480]  Yes, sir.
[1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:36.200]  And one last thing, a big problem I'm having over here in this little town of Ohio is just
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:37.720]  nobody cares, man.
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:41.680]  Like everybody, I'm 29 years old and all my peers, like I try to get them to watch the
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:42.680]  debate and everything.
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:45.560]  Just nobody cares about none of this stuff, but it seems like the mass majority could
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:48.680]  just care less until hell comes raining down.
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:50.800]  And then they'll buy whatever the system says to get out of it.
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  You're absolutely right.
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:54.320]  But there's always followers.
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:57.440]  Leaders are only a few percentage points, so don't get down because the average young
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:47:58.440]  person isn't informed.
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:02.520]  Well, there are a lot of young people that are.
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:05.800]  But I would just plant the seeds with them and they'll laugh now, they'll cry later,
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:09.760]  but then you'll have the effect you need to get them to actually wake up when the chips
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:11.480]  are down.
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:15.960]  Everything is about planting seeds, then they'll come to fruition.
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:19.680]  They'll laugh about it today, but if they didn't hear you say, don't take the vaccine,
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:20.680]  you're going to get sick.
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:24.600]  Then when they take it and have a convulsion and their feet are numb and they start bleeding
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:29.200]  out their ass and, you know, they're going to go, oh my God, it was the vaccine.
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:32.440]  And then when they're dying five years later from the cancer, they'll warn everybody and
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:33.840]  then their life will have value.
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.160]  If you don't tell them it's the vaccine, they won't even know what kills them.
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:38.240]  You understand that?
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:41.360]  So, so we don't want them to die, but they're going to die.
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:45.040]  They're going to kill themselves with the vaccine to slowly kill them and Bill Gates
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:47.680]  in the hospitals will suck the money out of them before they die.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:50.680]  You need to let them know who killed them before they before they died.
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:53.000]  I don't mean that in a sick way.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  That way their life has value.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:57.080]  You need to let them know now, they'll laugh now and they'll cry later.
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:48:58.080]  God bless you.
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:04.000]  I'm going to go to break and come back with more calls.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.240]  If I don't do this, we won't be on air.
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:10.400]  And plus, these are great products.
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:13.560]  We've got the high quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K, the highest quality you're going
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:17.480]  to find out of the tongue, winter sun with free shipping, infowarstore.com.
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:25.200]  We have the info wars emergency election sale and quite frankly, there's a strategist.
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:30.840]  I really should just sell out of everything we've got now before the election in 33 days
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:34.360]  because word is they're just going to show everybody's bank accounts down and everything
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:35.360]  else.
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:36.920]  And you notice they're going to have a total internet kill switch goes in.
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:39.400]  They had the election where no one's allowed to say Trump really won.
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:44.520]  And the real digital kill switch martial law goes in in 33 days.
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:48.400]  The real everything else was just a prelude, so you just think, oh, this is just one more
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:49.760]  level of it when it happens.
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:50.920]  They're normalizing it.
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:53.320]  So it's a good chance.
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:57.320]  It's your last chance to get an info wars t-shirt, get a book, get a water filter, get
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:58.480]  eight pack power stack.
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:49:59.480]  It's selling out.
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:00.760]  We can't even get the ingredients anymore.
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:03.120]  That's 60% off free shipping.

[1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:12.160]  shipping on all that.
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:17.440]  And they sent out on power pack X2 and X3, they also have the X3 spray, the first truly
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:22.040]  atomic iodine spray that's topical in for internal ingestion available, prostaguard
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.720]  with the high quality zinc and salt palm metal 1995.
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:27.040]  That's incredible deal.
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:32.200]  Plus free shipping info wars store.com, vitamin refusions, got all the vitamins and minerals
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:33.200]  for adults and children.
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:34.200]  It's great.
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:39.360]  It's massively discounted plus free shipping info wars store.com we have Biden for nursing
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:40.360]  home t-shirt.
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:41.720]  That won't be available after the election.
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:42.720]  That is a collector's item.
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:43.720]  It's all there.
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:46.600]  And the only way we're able to stay on air is you getting products you already need.
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:51.640]  And I just want to get as much money as I can and be able to put it to some side bank
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:57.360]  accounts so that we're able to continue operating into the future.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:00.880]  And it's just ridiculous what's been going on.
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:01.880]  And it's a prelude.
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:03.280]  They're going to take your internet away.
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:04.520]  They're going to take your bank accounts away.
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:05.520]  It's already happened to us a bunch.
[1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:08.040]  We had to move around just ongoing.
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:10.360]  And this is this is Terry.
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:12.360]  You saw Nazi Germany, but it's going to see American people.
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:15.480]  And it's run by George Soros, Nazi collaborator.
[1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:21.960]  And so everything that the Nazis did, now the Rothschilds are doing to us because we
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:22.960]  beat Hitler.
[1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:23.960]  I guess they're mad about it or something.
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:24.960]  I don't know.
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:25.960]  I haven't figured it out yet.
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:26.960]  But info wars.
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:27.960]  It's because we're Christians.
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:28.960]  That's what it is.
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:31.960]  infowarstore.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:32.960]  Get it for us products.
[1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:33.960]  We still can.
[1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:34.960]  It's not just us.
[1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:35.960]  It's a trouble.
[1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:36.960]  It's everybody folks.
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:37.960]  It's all going down.
[1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:44.360]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:45.360]  everybody.
[1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:50.240]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, Communist Chinese have come out and said they're
[1:51:50.240 --> 1:51:51.240]  going to contest the election.
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:55.200]  They know that Trump's going to win a landslide and the destabilization that that's going
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:00.680]  to cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy and going into the future.
[1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:04.760]  Even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election, the Democrats have said they're
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:11.880]  going to break away politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities and basically
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:16.160]  use that as a pretext of sabotage, the republic even more.
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:22.360]  So until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:26.720]  that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed, it's just going
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:27.720]  to continue to happen.
[1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:33.880]  And so that's the big problem here is that we have systemic dug in corruption by people
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:38.880]  that hate the country's very existence.
[1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:53.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:52:53.880 --> 1:53:05.400]  The Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:10.160]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[1:53:10.160 --> 1:53:16.880]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:42.520]  The information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:54:08.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:34.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in Arizona, Joseph, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:42.480]  Hello, basically it starts with, I believe that someone's feeding him lines and I say
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:51.000]  this because good quite often during the debate, I guess I should say, he was touching his
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:56.840]  ear or doing simple signs over and over after he got off track.
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:02.840]  Then he would get back on track, shuffle his notes and touch his ear again after he was
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:05.360]  flurrying words and mispronouncing stuff.
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:10.880]  So I would put that out there and he went back for his mask after forgetting it, being
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:19.120]  reminded by one of his agents, you know, that's kind of suspicious.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:20.560]  Brother the whole thing's suspicious.
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:25.280]  I mean, he's a globalist criminal that sold the country out.
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:30.000]  I mean, if Trump couldn't even talk, I would still support him for his record.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  But I think that Trump won the debate.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.280]  What did you think?
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:36.520]  It was pretty funny.
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:39.000]  I was laughing pretty much all the time during it.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Yeah.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.080]  And look, I know folks wanted to be more vicious, but he got a lot of good points in.
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:46.080]  Thank you for the call, brother.
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:47.080]  Glad you called.
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:51.320]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:57.760]  Let's talk to Mike in Kentucky, Mike, you're on the air for Mikey.
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:55:58.760]  Hey, Alex.
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:55:59.760]  Hey, brother.
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:04.280]  I was calling in and talk about the Biden situation.
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:09.040]  I don't know if people seen it last night, but it was when he was talking about condemning
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:12.880]  the rioting and everything in the cities.
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:18.120]  He said he didn't hold public office, you know, so I can call if I want to.
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  You don't have to hold.
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:20.880]  Well, that's a total cop out.
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:22.720]  He's the Democrat nominee.
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:24.880]  They're doing it because they say they hate Trump.
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:26.440]  That is the biggest criminal cop out.
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:27.440]  I'm glad you raised that.
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:30.880]  Oh, I don't hold office so I don't condemn it.
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:31.880]  Wow.
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:35.480]  Oh, and, you know, I don't have to hold a seat in the office to be able to call in,
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:37.480]  you know, to condemn rioting.
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:41.760]  Well, by the way, you do hold an office when you're the nominee.
[1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:46.120]  I mean, you're the guy running for president and you don't condemn burning down and shooting
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:47.600]  people in the head for no reason.
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:52.600]  You've been in office 47 years.
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:53.600]  It's ridiculous.
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:55.960]  You're absolutely right.
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:57.960]  What would you like to have seen Trump say?
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:00.120]  I would have just said this man wants your guns.
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:01.520]  This man wants your children.
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:03.160]  This man is a Chinese agent.
[1:57:03.160 --> 1:57:04.160]  He's your enemy.
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:05.480]  You want to save the country?
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:06.480]  Vote for me.
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:07.480]  We turn the economy around.
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:08.720]  They wreck it with their fear of Hungary.
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:10.160]  They want to keep us shut forever.
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:11.840]  They want to bankrupt this country.
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:12.840]  Don't let them do it.
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:14.640]  But notice they didn't get any opening statements.
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:18.600]  They didn't get any, you know, you both have five minutes.
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.520]  Notice it wasn't a real debate style.
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:22.400]  Was Chris Wallace controlling everything?
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:28.320]  I totally agree, he should have bought up the CDC, hid the numbers, and I really thought
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:29.920]  he was going to on that, you know, but...
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:31.920]  Well, he was being interrupted the whole time.
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:36.080]  There's a lot of things I was hoping he was going to say, but he didn't, but like you
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:39.760]  said, he's got his people telling him to play his part.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:40.760]  So...
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:41.760]  That's right.
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:42.760]  All right, Mikey, thank you so much.
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:47.520]  Now, we've got Jim Hoff to the Gateway Pundit, which I think did the best job article-wise
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:48.960]  covering every facet of it.
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:54.400]  I literally read like 15 articles last night, about 20 today, got a huge stack of Gateway
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:55.400]  Pundit articles right here.
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:59.680]  We're going to look at different angles of this, and we're going to get his take.
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:00.840]  How do you think Trump did?
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:04.480]  And we're also going to get, you know, his view on what he thinks would happen in the
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:05.480]  next debates.
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:06.480]  But here's my view.
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.480]  We're going to break right now for 60 seconds, come back to Jim Hoff.
[1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:16.000]  Telemundo 66%, they had a CNN focus group, only one lady out of a group of people thought
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  Biden won, clearly he won.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.480]  A lot of people are pissing, he didn't attack enough.
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:26.600]  Well, you try having Chris Wallace attached to your leg, interrupting you constantly,
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:28.680]  and Joe Biden stumbling around.
[1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:31.360]  So Trump is the man in the arena.
[1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:33.720]  We salute him, we're very, very excited.
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:37.680]  And the biggest tell that Trump won, hands down, is the Democrats don't want any more
[1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:38.680]  debates now.
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:47.440]  Let me write back with Jim Hoff to getwithpundit.com, stay with us.
[1:58:47.440 --> 1:58:53.600]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from
[1:58:53.600 --> 1:59:02.360]  COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million
[1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:06.840]  people have died, 200 million people have died.
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:09.880]  Only by the time I finish this talk.
[1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:14.520]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:19.800]  COVID-19, when it's not even 200,000 in reality, he would honestly say 6 million have lung
[1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:21.560]  scarring and heart damage.
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:22.560]  It's all made up.
[1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:23.560]  But you know where you got it?
[1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:26.600]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:31.440]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already.
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:36.520]  Of course, it's.000, and then add a number, because the numbers vary.
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:41.200]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[1:59:41.200 --> 2:00:02.280]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[2:00:02.280 --> 2:00:15.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:27.320]  Well, he is a hard guy to get on.
[2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:28.320]  We really appreciate his work.
[2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:29.320]  He's Jim Hoffman.
[2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:30.320]  Alex Jones, your host.
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:32.640]  He's with us for two segments, and we're going to go back to your calls and a bunch
[2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:33.640]  of news.
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:36.360]  Jim Hoffman has had great coverage over at gatewaypunna.com.
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:39.000]  We covered the event live last night, the debate.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:45.760]  Wow, to see Trump having to debate two people, to see him interrupting five times more, but
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:47.280]  still Trump clearly won.
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:49.680]  We would have liked to see Trump double get a word in.
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:54.520]  Edgewise, Jim Hoffman, you're an astute fellow, and then also canvassing the Internet.
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:57.640]  What do you think the biggest takeaway is from what we saw?
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:00.480]  This was hugely anticipated presidential debate.
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:06.120]  I know the most anticipated in my lifetime, I guess Kennedy versus Nixon in 1960 might
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  have been as big.
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  This was huge.
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:13.360]  Yeah, I think Trump did pretty well.
[2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:17.120]  All things considered, I was disgusted with Chris Wallace.
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:18.960]  His behavior was just atrocious.
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:24.880]  I've never seen a debate moderator that biased, and truly he threw himself in the ring, and
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:26.880]  that was disgusting.
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:29.240]  I'm one of the people that will never watch that guy again.
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:32.720]  I didn't really watch him much anyway, and to tell you the truth, Alex, I've known he's
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:37.880]  a never-Trumper since 2015, and I haven't watched his show since then.
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:41.400]  This was his moment.
[2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:44.400]  What's interesting is, I think Trump accomplished one thing.
[2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:50.800]  He wanted to expose Joe Biden, and he absolutely did that.
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:53.100]  Joe Biden looked unhinged.
[2:01:53.100 --> 2:01:55.040]  He looked flustered.
[2:01:55.040 --> 2:01:57.640]  He was mean.
[2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:06.120]  His name-calling was certainly not presidential, and he also looked disheveled and disheveled.
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:10.760]  Well, let's say, he looks like a crazy old man that shoots the kids and catches them
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:12.280]  in the bumpkin batch.
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:16.040]  Right, and that's, I think, what Trump's goal was, obviously.
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:18.280]  I think the other big takeaway was this morning.
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:23.440]  I wasn't sure how things went, and then we saw, of course, as you mentioned, the poll
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:31.200]  from the Hispanic poll, which was amazing, and then this morning, when I saw all of these
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:35.960]  Democrats, and I put up a list of a few of them, who were like, ah, this should be the
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:36.960]  last debate.
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:37.960]  We don't need any more debates.
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:39.280]  Yeah, this is really bad.
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:40.280]  We don't need debates.
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:42.360]  Alex said it tells you everything you need to know.
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:46.440]  Trump accomplished what he needed to do, and I think for your viewers, too, Alex, and I
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:50.320]  know you remember this, but Trump's first debate against Hillary, he was pretty much
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:51.320]  milked toast.
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:55.520]  It wasn't until the second and third debates that he really, you know, came on strong and
[2:02:55.520 --> 2:02:56.520]  did exceptional.
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:01.840]  That's what I said at the start of the broadcast, is Trump's a late bloomer, and he kind of
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:04.560]  50-50 first debate, destroyed her second and third debate.
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:05.760]  I think the Democrats know that.
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:07.880]  That's why they don't want more debates.
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:12.960]  Absolutely, and Joe Biden was exposed, and good for Trump, because he was asking Joe
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:15.280]  Biden the only hard questions.
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:19.800]  Chris Wallace refused to, and in fact, we saw Chris Wallace interrupt President Trump
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:24.680]  when he was trying to get some answers from Joe Biden about what he plans for this country,
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:30.360]  which of course, as we've been reporting at Gateway Pundit, this guy is dangerous.
[2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:37.080]  His Democrat party is out of their minds, and so good for Trump for trying to get some
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:42.520]  straight answers from Joe, even though, you know, Biden wasn't, you know, he just wasn't
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:43.520]  honest.
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:44.520]  He wasn't honest about his son.
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:46.480]  He wasn't honest about his record.
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:51.320]  He wasn't honest about his intentions, and that's, you know, I should disqualify the
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:52.320]  guy.
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:58.040]  I like how you did an article on James Woods and his takeaway and some other people, because
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:00.280]  it brought up some really good bullet points.
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:05.440]  What do you think the biggest zinger or zingers of the night were?
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:10.200]  I think the biggest zinger was when, well, there's two points that we reported on last
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:11.200]  night.
[2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:15.880]  One is when Trump asked Joe Biden, because again, Chris Wallace wanted to do this, but
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:21.760]  when he asked Joe Biden, so name a police force or a police union that supports you,
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:27.560]  and he couldn't, of course he couldn't, because he's not, you know, he's for the Antifa mob.
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:29.040]  He's not for the police.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:31.720]  So that was one zinger.
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:37.080]  And then Joe Biden stepping all over himself with the Green New Deal, he's trying to have
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:38.080]  it both ways.
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:39.080]  It just doesn't work out.
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:44.920]  He's not smart enough to, you know, to come across, and so I thought that was pretty important.
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:50.400]  The other thing, too, is he was asked a question about why he didn't call the Portland mayor
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:55.600]  or the Oregon governor, and he said, well, I'm not in office, and I think that was just
[2:04:55.600 --> 2:05:00.880]  a huge mistake for him, because it shows you this guy isn't up for the job, you know?
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:05.160]  So I think those were some key moments last night.
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:10.000]  I totally agree with you, and of course, when you're the nominee, that is an office.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:14.960]  You're running for the highest office in the land, you've been in government 47 years,
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:20.200]  the country's on fire, and to cop out, and to, and to go, oh, well, I don't get involved
[2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:23.480]  in that when he knows that he's collecting the money from Black Lives Matter.
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:26.480]  He knows Soros is running this, was very transparent.
[2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:27.480]  Right.
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:35.960]  And also, he had time to meet with Jacob Blake, the rapist in Minnesota, but he couldn't
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:41.440]  call the Portland mayor, so, you know, there you have it.
[2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:44.160]  What do you think Trump missed out and didn't do?
[2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:47.080]  I mean, I would have just said, hey, you want to take the guns.
[2:05:47.080 --> 2:05:50.600]  You guys are the ones that totally shut this country down.
[2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:51.920]  You're the ones that don't want to reopen.
[2:05:51.920 --> 2:05:52.920]  You're the enemy.
[2:05:52.920 --> 2:05:54.120]  If people want prosperity, vote for me.
[2:05:54.120 --> 2:05:57.640]  I didn't like how they didn't get to have, you know, opening statements in their own
[2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:58.800]  little time to say something.
[2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:00.360]  I think this wasn't really a debate.
[2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:04.440]  I think it was two guys ganging up on the president.
[2:06:04.440 --> 2:06:06.520]  I agree with you 100 percent.
[2:06:06.520 --> 2:06:10.440]  And I think, you know, it's interesting, too.
[2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:16.320]  You know, Trump was just nominated for his third Nobel Peace Prize the day of the debate.
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:17.320]  None of this came up.
[2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:18.320]  None of his foreign policy.
[2:06:18.320 --> 2:06:22.040]  I know that there will probably talk about this later is what they say.
[2:06:22.040 --> 2:06:24.360]  Trump didn't get to talk much about the economy.
[2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:25.360]  Exactly.
[2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:27.840]  He lied about the economy.
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:32.120]  So there was a lot of, you know, gaps that can be covered in the next two debates.
[2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:36.320]  Well, that's easy to say, because if he had like a few minutes to just say, hey, I want
[2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:37.320]  to bring America back.
[2:06:37.320 --> 2:06:38.320]  I want to bring us together.
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:39.320]  I'm a populist.
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:40.320]  I'm a classic Americana.
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:41.680]  I want to get us out of these useless wars.
[2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:42.680]  We've been doing it.
[2:06:42.680 --> 2:06:46.920]  I'm all about filling my promises, you know, please vote for me and just humanize himself
[2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:51.560]  because he won the debate, but they were able, though, he got some good shots in, but they
[2:06:51.560 --> 2:06:56.840]  were just able to filibuster and blockade and change the subject.
[2:06:56.840 --> 2:07:03.320]  And I mean, again, I think Megyn Kelly was destroyed by her moderation of the debate
[2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:04.320]  four years ago.
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:05.320]  That ended her career.
[2:07:05.320 --> 2:07:06.320]  Right.
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:07.320]  And I think Chris Wallace descended his career.
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:11.160]  It's great to have CNN fawning after you and in the New York Times saying how you're
[2:07:11.160 --> 2:07:12.160]  a great guy.
[2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:13.960]  I mean, that's not where America is.
[2:07:13.960 --> 2:07:14.960]  Right.
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:16.560]  I 100% agree.
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:19.080]  And I think he also exposed Fox News.
[2:07:19.080 --> 2:07:23.800]  We know, Alex, that there are some shows there that we love, some personalities we love,
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:27.120]  but the channel has really changed in the last four or five years.
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:31.360]  Maybe it's at Paul Ryan is on the board, um, but it certainly doesn't have the flavor
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:36.920]  of, uh, you know, uh, and even the, the panel they put on every time I point this out at
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:38.160]  every debate is horrible.
[2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:40.120]  They got these never Trumpers sitting on a panel.
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.120]  It's disgusting.
[2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:45.680]  And then most of the time now, even the supposed paid career, the pro Trump person is softball.
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:46.680]  They're weak.
[2:07:46.680 --> 2:07:47.680]  They lose on purpose.
[2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:51.680]  You can tell they've already pre debated before and they're just letting Juan Williams and
[2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:55.680]  them win debates that are so easy to win.
[2:07:55.680 --> 2:07:56.680]  It's awful.
[2:07:56.680 --> 2:07:58.000]  Who wants to listen to Juan Williams?
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.560]  What Fox viewer tunes in to listen to Juan Williams?
[2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:03.240]  I just, I just think it's, I think it's outrageous.
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:08.600]  And then they have Donna Brazil on of all people who, uh, fed Hillary Clinton the questions
[2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:13.160]  in the, in debates four years ago, and she's an expert now talking about, uh, last night's
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:14.160]  debate.
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:15.160]  Exactly.
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:21.320]  That's like hiring somebody that's been caught scamming, gambling in a football game or
[2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:22.320]  something.
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:25.240]  Uh, you know, a famous baseball player that's been caught rigging games and now you're going
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:29.320]  to bring him on as like the referee to, to, to, to stop any gambling.
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:30.320]  Right.
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:31.320]  Yeah.
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:32.320]  It wasn't going to happen.
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:35.680]  And of course, you know, I don't know if they even thought of that when they invited
[2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:39.960]  her on the panel, but, um, I, I certainly was the first thing I thought of when I saw
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:42.120]  her sitting there last night.
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:48.640]  So yeah, anyway, I think it was a, uh, as, as you can see, and I can see in, uh, your
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:52.400]  viewers see, uh, it was a outstanding night for Trump.
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:55.720]  And we know that because of the way the media is reacting today.
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:08:56.720]  I agree.
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:08:59.800]  You know, I've seen another thing against these folks, but some of the Twitter conservatives
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:03.440]  saying Trump did a horrible job and then Twitter pushing that as a trend.
[2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:06.400]  I mean, look, it's easy to get Twitter to promote you if you say negative things about
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:11.920]  the president, even from a loyal, I don't think that's accurate.
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:14.000]  I agree with you, Alex.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:19.960]  Um, again, um, he exposed Joe Biden to be an honorary old man who's, uh, just, uh, doesn't
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:26.360]  belong in the White House, uh, doesn't have any ambition, um, and, uh, it's even surprising
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:27.880]  that Joe got out of bed today.
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:31.920]  I think a lot of people are that need, then they call a lid because this was a, you know,
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:33.440]  this took a lot out of him.
[2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:36.160]  Oh, well, he actually got some video coming back of him today.
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.160]  You can barely talk.
[2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:39.160]  Jim Hofstra guest.
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:42.840]  Oh, look at the election itself, election fraud and so much more with him and that key
[2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:45.400]  point that Chris Wallace brought up to Trump about who doesn't be elected.
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:46.760]  I've got some bad news for you.
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:50.320]  Then I got some really bad news and then I've got some good news.
[2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:54.840]  The bad news is even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:58.680]  martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[2:09:58.680 --> 2:09:59.680]  That's the globalists.
[2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:01.280]  They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:06.280]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:11.160]  really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control,
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:15.320]  and like Australia is already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize what
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:17.040]  the left are doing.
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:18.040]  That's the really bad news.
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:22.040]  The good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and
[2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:25.480]  the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:27.320]  So bottom line, we're in the fight.
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:29.640]  We're starting to win, but it's serious.
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:34.280]  So pray to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word and buy products
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:35.280]  at InfoWarsTour.com.
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:40.080]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now.

[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:45.520]  Thank you so much.
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:49.760]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:52.800]  They give you about freedoms by increments.
[2:10:52.800 --> 2:10:56.200]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time and then the restrictions
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:11:00.000]  will be released, but they're not.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:04.120]  That for a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said,
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.440]  they will then slightly release it a little bit to only tighten it down even more later.
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:15.000]  This is called successive approximation, incrementalism, or the inchworm effect.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.480]  This is the most common way that the Salaterians take over, but there then becomes a point
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:21.680]  where the public wakes up.
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:25.680]  Under the incrementalism, he starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:30.720]  a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months that
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:32.240]  you saw in the previous 10 years.
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:35.720]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:41.240]  A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that once
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:48.680]  you pour and absolutely stick under their thumb forever.
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:12:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:07.080]  Welcome back, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Jim Hoft of the
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:11.080]  GatewayPunna.com, which has been a great sign for many years, but it's very influential
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:12.080]  in the White House.
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:15.040]  I know it's one of the publications that the President watches.
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:21.160]  I know that some of his key team are still, you know, patriots still have his ear watching
[2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:24.400]  because it's up to the minute and we're just so glad that Habit there is an asset for
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:26.720]  America and the world and all our families.
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:31.640]  And so I'm just hoping that Jim Hoft has been all over this can formulate a plan or help
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:36.480]  us formulate a plan here on air to counter the 79 days of hell, as I'm calling it.
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:37.640]  We're 33 off of the election.
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:38.920]  Everybody thinks, oh, that's it.
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:39.920]  It'll be over.
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:40.920]  No.
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:45.120]  The deep state has said, we're going to hold it up or use 20th Amendment, Pelosi will
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:47.640]  then have a vote on who the new president is.
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:51.160]  And they say, but as it says in war games, New York Times, they're doing this.
[2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:53.720]  And then Trump's like, oh, it looks like Maryland ballots can be fraudulent.
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:56.360]  Oh, look, Ilhan Omar got busted.
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:57.360]  That's only part of it.
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:02.880]  They're holding up the election so that he doesn't get seated at the inauguration is
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:03.880]  their admitted plan.
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:07.800]  And we're sitting here like a deer in the headlights watching this rapidly approaches.
[2:13:07.800 --> 2:13:12.560]  So watch Chris Wallace last night, it's a short clip where he tries to pin Trump down
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.520]  that, oh, we're going to contest the Democrats are, but if you can test their contesting
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:21.280]  and say you won, Zuckerberg, all of them, they're not going to let the president say
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:22.280]  it.
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:25.480]  They're going to implement, if you think censorship's been draconian, they're saying tens of millions
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:28.360]  of users will be blocked starting election day.
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:32.040]  Artie Facebook's curtailing Tucker Carlson, putting him on shadow ban.
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:37.560]  So it's here and Trump's biggest failure is in action on the censorship and the racketeering.
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.680]  And that's where he should be taken to the woodshed and he may lose the election because
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:41.680]  of it.
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:42.680]  Here's the clip.
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:43.960]  We'll get Jim off stake.
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:50.440]  Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:56.800]  in any civil unrest, and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:00.040]  election has been independently certified?
[2:14:00.040 --> 2:14:01.040]  President Trump, you go first.
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:06.480]  I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:07.480]  has to happen.
[2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:08.720]  I am urging them to do it.
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:09.720]  Okay.
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:13.280]  And then he just goes on to say they're engaged at Democrat fraud at the election level and
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:14.280]  voter fraud.
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:16.520]  So Jim, obviously we have a big audience.
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:17.520]  You've got a big audience.
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:19.280]  The audience knows what's going on.
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:21.520]  The audience of one, I think, is the most important.
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:27.120]  How do we get Trump to not just talk about obvious voter fraud, election fraud, mail-in
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:28.240]  ballots, 80 million of them?
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:31.760]  The Democrats admit Democrat courts, you know, ruling, they can hold it off.
[2:14:31.760 --> 2:14:33.120]  They admit that's their plan.
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:37.880]  I think he just needs to front and center, attack their plan so people know what's coming
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:39.360]  to get folks ready.
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:40.360]  You're a smart guy.
[2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:41.360]  You have the presidents here.
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:42.360]  I'm sure you know that.
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:43.760]  They really like you a lot.
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.040]  They listen to you.
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:46.040]  What does Trump need to do?
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:49.560]  I quite frankly don't know what to do.
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:52.080]  Well, I agree with you, Alex.
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:55.320]  Censorship was a big failing on this administration.
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:14:58.400]  They should have took control of this years ago.
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:05.000]  In fact, in March of 2018, the former Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, wrote to Facebook
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.280]  on Twitter and said that we're watching you.
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:09.280]  Well, he never did anything.
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:11.880]  And now Brad Parscale's out of the picture.
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:13.840]  We're monitoring the situation.
[2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:14.840]  Right.
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:21.600]  And from what happened to you, Alex, it's just unimaginable in this country what they've
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:24.680]  done to you and your organization.
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:28.360]  They've also, you know, hit us tremendously at Gateway Pundit.
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:33.760]  And like I've mentioned several times, a third of our traffic used to come from Facebook.
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:35.640]  Now it's down to about 8%.
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:39.400]  And you know, so we don't rely on it as much anymore.
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:40.400]  But it's tragic.
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:45.360]  And I wish the administration would have known and would have acted on this sooner because
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:47.200]  this is going to be a big problem.
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:51.680]  I hope he takes care of this in his second term.
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:54.320]  The other thing is this voter fraud.
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:59.040]  After last week, we wrote on Gateway Pundit, there were several stories about how Michigan
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:05.920]  and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and then North Carolina were moving.
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:13.040]  These courts were moving to push, you know, extended voting periods and ballot harvesting.
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:15.960]  It's all the battleground states and they're going to hold it up.
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:17.120]  Jim, I know you know this.
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:21.080]  They're officially saying they're going to hold it up and then Pelosi is going to vote
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:22.080]  on who the president is.
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:24.720]  I mean, what does Trump do about this?
[2:16:24.720 --> 2:16:25.720]  Right.
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:26.720]  Right.
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:27.720]  Well, I was very upset about this.
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:34.320]  I did reach out to the Trump campaign and I was able to get a few answers and what is
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:39.880]  a little bit of hope here is that I do see that they are starting to press back against
[2:16:39.880 --> 2:16:45.520]  these courts in these different states.
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:48.160]  They're having some success already.
[2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:53.480]  But this has to continue and it has to be taken care of before the election.
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:59.920]  I think there's a congressman out there we wrote about yesterday who also has a legislation
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:06.480]  where he's saying that the ballots need to be turned in and counted within 24 hours of
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:10.800]  election day, which would be on November 4th, they need to be counted.
[2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:12.560]  And I think that's being responsible.
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:19.520]  I don't think Americans want to have this dragged out process where Democrats are finding
[2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:24.320]  stacks of ballots in the trunks of cars and things like that.
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:27.640]  I think most Americans want to have law and order.
[2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:30.240]  I think you're right, Trump needs to push this.
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:32.640]  His campaign needs to push this harder.
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:37.360]  But I do see that they're starting to take some steps and they sent me some information
[2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:38.360]  on that.
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:39.480]  They actually have a website up.
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:40.680]  I don't remember it right now.
[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:41.680]  We've linked to it.
[2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:42.920]  Sure, to report fraud if you see it.
[2:17:42.920 --> 2:17:47.520]  I'm just saying it's good to expose the fraud, but they're going to use holding it off as
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:49.760]  the confusion, as the crisis.
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:54.480]  We need to get the Supreme Court ready to act, which is why this new nominee is so important.
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:55.480]  Absolutely.
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:57.400]  Yeah, that has to be taken care of.
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:02.800]  I see Lindsey Graham is doing the first committee vote on the 15th.
[2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:08.020]  And of course, the Senate isn't even scheduled to meet during this period because they're
[2:18:08.020 --> 2:18:11.880]  out for the election period till past November.
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:14.640]  I think you should call them back.
[2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:15.640]  Absolutely they'll have to.
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:20.240]  And they need to get this wonderful judge confirmed.
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:21.640]  Jim Hoff, last question.
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:23.320]  You were at the very front.
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:26.760]  And this one, a few areas where I thought it was a scam, a CHICOM scam to shut things
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:30.680]  down to win the trade war to shut down Hong Kong that was starting to get away from them.
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:32.360]  But I was still like, oh, it could be deadly.
[2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:33.360]  It looks like they're exaggerating.
[2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:34.600]  It looks like it's fake.
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:35.600]  You were up front.
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:39.440]  Your brother, a great scientist, the scientist you had on as writers.
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:41.440]  You've been totally vindicated about COVID.
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:44.560]  But now we're just inside this, now they got locked down too.
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:47.360]  Your comments on this whole situation.
[2:18:47.360 --> 2:18:51.360]  I think it's outrageous we were right.
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:55.920]  Also Alex, we reported last week that the U.S. is using different counting methods to
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:18:57.920]  make it look like we have 200,000 deaths.
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:02.960]  As you said, if we'd used counting methods like several countries, we'd have half as
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:07.520]  many deaths, which would make it a bad flu season.
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:09.280]  Those are the numbers that we're seeing.
[2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:12.400]  Of course, we're not going to hear that from our mainstream media.
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:16.080]  And I just don't think Americans are going to go for another round of this shutdown.
[2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:18.600]  I don't think the economy can handle it.
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:21.800]  And I certainly know that Donald Trump won't go for that.
[2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:23.640]  I agree with you.
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:27.600]  What else do you think the president can do, because I know this show gets to him, what
[2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:29.760]  you say gets to him, and he's more and more isolated.
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:33.480]  There's only a few people that are around him.
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:37.800]  In 60 seconds, Jim Hobbs, what else do you want to impart to President Trump?
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.960]  Yeah, I think it was important last night that he showed the difference between him
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:43.480]  and Joe Biden.
[2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:44.640]  Trump's a fighter.
[2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:46.440]  That's why we love him.
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:47.440]  That's why you love him.
[2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:50.200]  That's why I love him, because he doesn't take the crap.
[2:19:50.200 --> 2:19:52.960]  He throws it right back in people's faces.
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:57.880]  And I think there's going to be a big push from the people around him to tell him to
[2:19:57.880 --> 2:20:01.520]  calm down, tell him to be respectful, and to act presidential.
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:03.960]  Well, they only say this to Donald Trump.
[2:20:03.960 --> 2:20:07.520]  They never say this to anyone he's on stage with.
[2:20:07.520 --> 2:20:11.600]  So I hope he doesn't take that advice, because I think Americans want a fighter.
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:17.480]  I hope he's able to get, like he started to last night, I hope he's able to ask the questions
[2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:22.200]  if they're not being asked, and to promote his own record, because it's stellar.
[2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:24.600]  It's absolutely outstanding.
[2:20:24.600 --> 2:20:30.800]  And so, and I pray to God that Americans are going to see through that, and I do believe
[2:20:30.800 --> 2:20:31.800]  that they will.
[2:20:31.800 --> 2:20:32.800]  Oh, I think they are.
[2:20:32.800 --> 2:20:33.800]  I think we're going to see a landslide.
[2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:36.240]  We need the next debate opened up where they have time to say what they want, opening and
[2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:37.240]  closing statements.
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:55.720]  Thank you so much, sir, thanks, Alex, computer research scientists, engineers working with
[2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:54.280]  attorneys have conclusively proven and put out the reports of tablet magazine, documenting
[2:20:54.280 --> 2:20:59.920]  what any trained eye could already see as plain as day, communist Chinese working in
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:04.680]  tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States, as well as the
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:10.320]  media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:13.120]  the world in China earlier this year.
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:18.180]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened
[2:21:18.180 --> 2:21:19.880]  within three months.
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:23.240]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:29.520]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate
[2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:30.520]  style.
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:35.040]  All those of Watson has written about it at info wars dot com, myself Alex Jones, David
[2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:37.160]  I know and Troy are covering this heavily.
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:41.160]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN
[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:43.160]  were behind the hysteria.
[2:21:43.160 --> 2:21:51.720]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years, and I've
[2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:58.600]  overseen well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I take my orders
[2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:05.600]  from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates, I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controlled everything
[2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:06.600]  you do.
[2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:09.600]  And he now says, you're going to take the shots.
[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:15.440]  And of course, in England, they are now saying, what I told you, you will not be allowed to
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:16.440]  travel.
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:19.440]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:26.800]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:35.600]  to five COVID shots a year for adults, two for baby, baby, much more manageable.
[2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:44.400]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine, I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:48.520]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them,
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:52.840]  to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:56.960]  whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park, they have to look
[2:22:56.960 --> 2:23:01.440]  at us, the common people, they have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the
[2:23:01.440 --> 2:23:02.440]  scum.
[2:23:02.440 --> 2:23:05.160]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting mussels on us.
[2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:09.360]  That gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go, what we can do, bankrupting
[2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:15.240]  Main Street, bankrupting small towns, all of it is a vertical integration, consolidation
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:19.720]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender, which is taking sterilant
[2:23:19.720 --> 2:23:21.960]  vaccines day one.
[2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:26.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over, playtime's over, they used all the entertainment
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:31.440]  and garbage to put us into a trance and now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:35.320]  You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open, the question is, what are we going
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:36.320]  to do about it?
[2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:40.480]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify
[2:23:40.480 --> 2:24:08.280]  your enemy now.
[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:13.400]  We're going right back to your phone calls, Alberto, Ron, Dave, David, Vincent, Jersey,
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:17.960]  Reed, Gio and Matthew before investigative journalist John Rappport takes over later
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:18.960]  in the next hour.
[2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:25.560]  One of your calls heard a moment, Roger Stone sent us an exclusive response, will premiere,
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:30.840]  coming up the start of the next segment on his view on how Trump did in the debate last
[2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:31.840]  night.
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:35.240]  We thank Roger for his important contribution.
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:42.640]  Well, it's an ongoing hearing right now as former disgraced FBI Director James Comey
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:49.680]  testifies to the Judiciary Committee on the illegal spying on President Trump's campaign
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:50.680]  even once he was president.
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:54.600]  And of course, Comey twice lied to Congress and said there was no surveillance by the
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:25:00.360]  FBI during the campaign or once he was president-elect or president, he should be indicted, you talk
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:07.560]  about a perjury to Congress, this is open and shut, but constitutional lawyer Ted Cruz
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:12.920]  took him to the woodshed and knocked it out of the park, this just happened a few minutes
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:13.920]  ago.
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:20.280]  All right, let's shift to another topic on May 3, 2017.
[2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:24.800]  In this committee, Chairman Grassley asked you point blank, quote, Have you ever been
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:29.800]  an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:31.400]  or the Clinton investigation?
[2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:35.200]  You responded under oath, quote, Never.
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:40.160]  He then asked you, quote, Have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:45.440]  source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton administration?
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:48.760]  You responded again under oath, No.
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:55.160]  Now as you know, Mr. McCabe, who works for you, has publicly and repeatedly stated that
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:26:00.240]  he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were directly aware of it and
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:02.920]  that you directly authorized it.
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  Now what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:09.920]  true.
[2:26:09.920 --> 2:26:11.920]  One or the other is false.
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:13.160]  Who's telling the truth?
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:16.080]  I just can only speak to my testimony.
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:20.840]  I stand by what the testimony you summarized that I gave in May of 2017.
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:26.000]  So your testimony is you've never authorized anyone to leak and Mr. McCabe, if he says
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:27.640]  contrary, is not telling the truth.
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:28.640]  Is that correct?
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:32.320]  Again, I'm not going to characterize Andy's testimony, but mine is the same today.
[2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:33.320]  All right.
[2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:37.160]  I'm going to make a final point because my time has expired.
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:39.680]  This investigation of the president was corrupt.
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.560]  The FBI and the Department of Justice were politicized and weaponized.
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:50.120]  And in my opinion, there are only two possibilities that you were deliberately corrupt or woefully
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:51.720]  incompetent.
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:55.720]  And I don't believe you were incompetent.
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:27:02.080]  This has done severe damage to the professionals and the honorable men and women at the FBI
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:06.360]  because law enforcement should not be used as a political weapon.
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:12.280]  And that is the legacy you've left.
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:15.640]  That's called truth Veritas out of the park.
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:19.520]  That's why I love Ted Cruz, man, when he got dirty with the never Trumpers against Trump.
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.240]  I just, it was terrible, but he's a real asset.
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:25.120]  He'd be a great president.
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:28.320]  He would run circles around these globalists.
[2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:29.320]  That's why they're scared too.
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:30.880]  They know Rand Paul's coming up.
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:31.880]  Ted Cruz is coming up.
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:34.200]  Well, that'd be a good ticket.
[2:27:34.200 --> 2:27:35.200]  Cruz Paul.
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:38.520]  I just love this country.
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:39.520]  Oh man.
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:40.520]  All right.
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:44.880]  Let's go to your phone calls here.
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:47.880]  So it doesn't matter if Comey never gets in trouble for his crimes.
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:48.880]  He's hated.
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:51.000]  I don't know who he is.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:54.960]  He's a disgusting creature, but I know Trump's lawyers.
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:59.960]  I know people inside the system that that are around these people and they say Alex,
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:07.320]  you don't understand the average Harvard FBI agent or prosecutor is literally an idiot
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:12.160]  that actually thinks Nazis are everywhere and actually thinks Trump's a Russian agent.
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:18.760]  They are super low IQ, man, because the globalist criminals pick idiots.
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:19.960]  Now Comey's not an idiot.
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:20.960]  He's smart.
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:30.280]  He's evil, but they literally have morons, folks, morons, that when the FBI gets ordered
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:36.840]  to swat team a medical doctor prescribing vitamin C as a preventative for COVID, totally
[2:28:36.840 --> 2:28:41.560]  legal, totally legitimate, like saying, take water with you into the desert.
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:44.920]  The FBI gets freaked out in court once it comes out that it was totally legal.
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:52.480]  The FBI doesn't even know you need vitamin C when Fauci says go swat team them.
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  They do it.
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:57.480]  I'm not saying all FBI are that dumb, but man, you just cannot underestimate how stupid
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:58.480]  the government is.
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:28:59.480]  I mean, it is.
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:05.040]  I always think there is conspiracy at the top, but at low level, it's just like Barney
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:06.720]  five or something, man.
[2:29:06.720 --> 2:29:07.720]  It's crazy.
[2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:08.720]  I'm ranting.
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:09.720]  I'm ranting.
[2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:10.720]  I'm ranting.
[2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:11.720]  I'm ranting.
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:20.360]  It's just like you know stuff and you tell people, I think you're showing off and you
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:22.920]  made it up.
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:26.760]  And I just keep projecting my intelligence on the people, but you know, I project intelligence
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:28.120]  onto who has it.
[2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:29.120]  It's the grassroots.
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:32.280]  It's the hardworking people that live in the real world.
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:38.320]  It's these Ivy League people that are two, three generations of Ivy League that my buddy
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:39.320]  calls them aliens.
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:44.560]  Meaning they don't know how to do it is like when George Bush senior 15 years after scanners
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:45.560]  came out.
[2:29:45.560 --> 2:29:49.640]  He's at a grocery store and he goes, what's that?
[2:29:49.640 --> 2:29:56.120]  Because the dude doesn't go to the grocery store his whole life.
[2:29:56.120 --> 2:29:58.060]  That's the Ivy Leaguers folks.
[2:29:58.060 --> 2:29:59.320]  People bring them their food.
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:00.480]  They make them their food.
[2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:05.720]  So they go to your calls, who's been on the longest?
[2:30:05.720 --> 2:30:07.120]  Is it Dave?
[2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:12.920]  Yeah, it's, it's Dave, Dave in California and then Alberto and others.
[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:13.920]  You're on the air.
[2:30:13.920 --> 2:30:14.920]  Welcome.
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:15.920]  Alex.
[2:30:15.920 --> 2:30:21.000]  This is Dave, Hollywood Dave and CIA mind controlled Los Angeles pleasure to talk to
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  you.
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:28.200]  First off, I would like to congratulate you on exposing Joe Biden's blood doping.
[2:30:28.200 --> 2:30:30.200]  Oddly enough, I'm working on a script here.
[2:30:30.200 --> 2:30:35.400]  I'm sort of a Hollywood insider on a movie called blood deal and that is the elitist
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:38.360]  use of blood doping and so forth.
[2:30:38.360 --> 2:30:42.320]  And we know that this goes not only through the government, but Silicon Valley.
[2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:45.200]  Hey, we ought to get your number out to talk to you all fair.
[2:30:45.200 --> 2:30:47.880]  You know, you were the number one thing I get hit on the street with now.
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:51.000]  It's not when are you on on Joe Rogan next?
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:53.040]  That's usually what I'm asked for last year.
[2:30:53.040 --> 2:30:55.560]  It's Adrena Chrome and blood doping.
[2:30:55.560 --> 2:30:58.560]  People really have gotten aware of this, haven't they?
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:30:59.640]  Now here's the problem.
[2:30:59.640 --> 2:31:04.400]  We don't have the propaganda machine that they do to create the films to get out such
[2:31:04.400 --> 2:31:05.400]  it.
[2:31:05.400 --> 2:31:06.400]  What a magnificent film.
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:08.480]  Doesn't everyone want to see an Adrena Chrome film?
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:09.480]  I do.
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:14.600]  I want to see an elitist film about the actual blood doping that's occurring.
[2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:18.120]  It can be based on truth and of course a little bit of Hollywood fiction.
[2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:19.920]  We don't have the propaganda machine.
[2:31:19.920 --> 2:31:20.920]  I'm a Hollywood insider.
[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:22.680]  I've been here for 20 years.
[2:31:22.680 --> 2:31:26.960]  I can tell you, these people love Alistair Crowley.
[2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:28.320]  They conduct rituals.
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:32.200]  They make sacrificial altars and so forth.
[2:31:32.200 --> 2:31:35.640]  This has been going on for a long time, Alex, as you know.
[2:31:35.640 --> 2:31:37.600]  The power here is dark.
[2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:43.920]  I am a survivor solely because, let's say, my spiritual beliefs have kept me from getting
[2:31:43.920 --> 2:31:45.840]  mind controlled and brainwashed.
[2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:51.400]  I can tell you the musicians, the actors I've been around, they are completely in this Marxist.
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:54.920]  They are completely brainwashed and they're not stupid people.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:31:56.480]  They know exactly what's happening.
[2:31:56.480 --> 2:31:59.640]  They know exactly that the Democrats are going to steal the election.
[2:31:59.640 --> 2:32:03.160]  They are going to do everything that we absolutely think they're not going to do.
[2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:04.400]  Look at what's already happened.
[2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:06.400]  Look at the control globally that they have taken.
[2:32:06.400 --> 2:32:07.400]  Well, that's it.
[2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:08.400]  Jim Halsey, smart guy.
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:09.400]  You heard his confidence.
[2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:13.400]  I was talking to high-level White House people two weeks ago and last week and they're like,
[2:32:13.400 --> 2:32:15.640]  oh, but the Supreme Court will stop it.
[2:32:15.640 --> 2:32:20.280]  Oh, yeah, but the point is the Democrats are going ahead with this and even if the Supreme
[2:32:20.280 --> 2:32:23.720]  Court says they're wrong, they're saying they're going to secede states.
[2:32:23.720 --> 2:32:24.720]  Okay.
[2:32:24.720 --> 2:32:25.720]  They won't get away with it.
[2:32:25.720 --> 2:32:26.720]  Great.
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:27.720]  We need to address that.
[2:32:27.720 --> 2:32:31.200]  The Speaker of the House is saying we're going to have states secede.
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:32.520]  We need to get ahead of that.
[2:32:32.520 --> 2:32:34.640]  You know what I mean?
[2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:37.960]  Saying that the White Supremes are the main problem when BLM is burning down the cities
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:42.920]  and here they are in the debate, getting Trump to denounce the KKK and Antifa, but not BLM.
[2:32:42.920 --> 2:32:47.240]  Can you, as if we like the KKK exactly and like Kyle Rittenhouse calling him a White
[2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:48.240]  Supremes.
[2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:50.720]  What's the sick definition by Biden?
[2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:52.840]  They got Trump to agree.
[2:32:52.840 --> 2:32:53.840]  Okay.
[2:32:53.840 --> 2:32:58.560]  Now, Trump did what he had to do last night, but he needs to be more reserved.
[2:32:58.560 --> 2:33:02.200]  He needs to step in and calmly debase everything.
[2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:03.200]  No, I agree.
[2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:05.560]  He needs to not even respond to their fake question.
[2:33:05.560 --> 2:33:07.680]  Start to answer and then just attack.
[2:33:07.680 --> 2:33:09.000]  That's number one debating thing.
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:12.560]  When you're getting a fake debate, when you're getting double teamed, you don't respond to
[2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:13.560]  their crap.
[2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:14.560]  You savage them.
[2:33:14.560 --> 2:33:16.560]  And he took a Wallace.
[2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:17.560]  I'm not debating you.
[2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:18.560]  Be quiet.
[2:33:18.560 --> 2:33:19.560]  It's my time.
[2:33:19.560 --> 2:33:20.560]  He should have done that.
[2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:26.880]  Again, that's Trump's style, he'll, he'll, he always is nice up front when he gets attacked.
[2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:28.360]  He comes back a lot harder.
[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:29.360]  Great call, Dave.
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:30.360]  All right.
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:31.360]  And we got to really move quick now because I got all these callers.
[2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:32.360]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:33.360]  I'm going to get to everybody.
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:38.480]  Alberto's up next and Ron and, oh my gosh, David's been holding a long time and Jerry
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:42.600]  and Gio and we'll get to everybody.
[2:33:42.600 --> 2:33:46.960]  We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:49.760]  killing millions of people via starvation.
[2:33:49.760 --> 2:33:54.080]  But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well.
[2:33:54.080 --> 2:33:58.000]  The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.880]  He's the most unpopular person on earth.
[2:34:00.880 --> 2:34:02.520]  People know he's not a doctor.
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:04.280]  People know he's a eugenicist.
[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:09.600]  The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses,
[2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:11.600]  polio, sterilants and more.
[2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:13.680]  It's even in the associated press.
[2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:19.040]  So now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:24.680]  global government and the beach top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type
[2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:28.600]  of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing.
[2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:34.200]  So remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:37.720]  we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:40.760]  They are the enemies of humanity.
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:43.280]  They want you dead.
[2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:47.720]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:55.040]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions,
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:56.440]  above the family.
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:58.640]  They want total corporate power.
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:03.880]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn.
[2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:11.240]  It's based on a novel set in the year 2020 and in the book you have megacorporates that
[2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:15.200]  control the planet and there are no longer nation states.
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.400]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:24.760]  If you actually read what the most group of the CFR, the July commission say in the year
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:27.240]  2020, that is their end game.
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:28.720]  That is their goal.
[2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:33.760]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:34.760]  people.
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:35.760]  See us as channel.
[2:35:35.760 --> 2:35:40.520]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy, communist China as their model.
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:43.520]  We must reject it now.
[2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:46.880]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:48.880]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[2:35:48.880 --> 2:35:52.680]  Is your city too safe?
[2:35:52.680 --> 2:35:54.680]  Well, not anymore.
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:57.320]  Introducing Democrats.
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:02.880]  Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant
[2:36:02.880 --> 2:36:05.680]  violence and even homelessness.
[2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:10.720]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:17.080]  No more pesky law and order, when Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[2:36:17.080 --> 2:36:21.800]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:27.920]  Plug weight, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:32.520]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:43.360]  Bring in chaos right to your front door.
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:48.400]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:49.400]  GPS location.
[2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:55.800]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:01.560]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:06.960]  don't just track your location but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:11.480]  relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:17.160]  apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:23.040]  Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:25.120]  systems to be saved forever.
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:29.080]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:30.420]  based on information.
[2:37:30.420 --> 2:37:33.600]  This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:39.440]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:46.320]  tracks infowarstore.com.
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:38:08.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show 33 days, 33 days until 79 days of hell, get ready.
[2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:15.600]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:23.140]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:38:23.140 --> 2:38:25.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:33.500]  All right, I said I go to the exclusive Rodgers don't video this segment.
[2:38:33.500 --> 2:38:35.860]  I don't want to get through the callers that have been holding.
[2:38:35.860 --> 2:38:39.820]  I'll take two segments the next hour they head over to John Rappaport is always very informative
[2:38:39.820 --> 2:38:40.820]  extremely important.
[2:38:40.820 --> 2:38:47.580]  So remember, I know you know all this stuff, you know, as much as I do or more.
[2:38:47.580 --> 2:38:51.100]  Remember only way we reach new people when you share the articles, the videos, and you
[2:38:51.100 --> 2:38:52.180]  were doing a kick ass job.
[2:38:52.180 --> 2:38:54.460]  I'm willing to lose my life to quarterback this.
[2:38:54.460 --> 2:38:56.340]  In fact, it's an extreme honor.
[2:38:56.340 --> 2:38:57.340]  I don't have a death wish.
[2:38:57.340 --> 2:38:58.340]  I love life.
[2:38:58.340 --> 2:38:59.340]  I don't want to die.
[2:38:59.340 --> 2:39:00.340]  But I have no fear.
[2:39:00.340 --> 2:39:05.620]  I only have fear of failure and watching this evil unfold and again, everybody says to
[2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:07.340]  me on the street, they go, aren't you vindicated?
[2:39:07.340 --> 2:39:08.840]  You must really feel good.
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:09.840]  It all came true.
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:11.740]  I said, I'm like, no, it doesn't feel good.
[2:39:11.740 --> 2:39:17.980]  I'm going to start crying here on air folks, but you know, I don't like having to think
[2:39:17.980 --> 2:39:21.260]  about what we're going to have to do when they start trying to come inject us and take
[2:39:21.260 --> 2:39:25.580]  our kids away because the people we're going to have to stand up to the people we're going
[2:39:25.580 --> 2:39:32.940]  to have to deal with are just idiots, but nevertheless, I'm not rolling over to you.
[2:39:32.940 --> 2:39:38.620]  So if Diane's what you're looking for, you came to the right place and I don't like this
[2:39:38.620 --> 2:39:41.500]  part of my brain starting to turn on, but you know, it's all turning on with you too.
[2:39:41.500 --> 2:39:42.500]  And you all know it.
[2:39:42.500 --> 2:39:47.140]  My God, during the break, there's an article on them, fours.com that made me so pissed.
[2:39:47.140 --> 2:39:51.780]  And the video will play it next hour before Rapaport comes on.
[2:39:51.780 --> 2:39:56.820]  COVID police crashed 10 year old girl's birthday party and shut it down.
[2:39:56.820 --> 2:40:00.060]  Can't have six friends over your birthday party, but your church can't be open.
[2:40:00.060 --> 2:40:04.300]  But the left, the BLM and the sports games, they can all happen.
[2:40:04.300 --> 2:40:05.300]  This is just martial law.
[2:40:05.300 --> 2:40:07.380]  This is martial law training.
[2:40:07.380 --> 2:40:12.380]  And it's leftist jurisdictions where they finally get control higher.
[2:40:12.380 --> 2:40:16.980]  These little SJW police who won't respond to a rape or a murder.
[2:40:16.980 --> 2:40:22.100]  They're scared of thugs and criminals.
[2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:26.380]  They love though creeping out on you and your family.
[2:40:26.380 --> 2:40:39.060]  And so it's been our acquiescence that's let these people do this problem as they run
[2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:45.140]  psyops, you know, the minute we start rising up physically to defeat them, they'll blow
[2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:47.620]  up a daycare center and say, we did it.
[2:40:47.620 --> 2:40:53.780]  So that's why we have to have our rules of engagement absolutely spelled out clearly.
[2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:57.260]  And I'm not saying it's time for violence, but they're coming with inoculations.
[2:40:57.260 --> 2:40:59.540]  They're coming with it all.
[2:40:59.540 --> 2:41:08.020]  And I'm going to go to your calls.
[2:41:08.020 --> 2:41:11.940]  Separately it's a symbiotic relationship, a non zero sum game, a win-win, a 360 win
[2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:14.100]  is the term I coined.
[2:41:14.100 --> 2:41:15.900]  You need high quality storeable food.
[2:41:15.900 --> 2:41:16.900]  You need to get it.
[2:41:16.900 --> 2:41:18.020]  You need water filtration.
[2:41:18.020 --> 2:41:22.260]  They have the best system at preparewithalex.com.
[2:41:22.260 --> 2:41:25.180]  And that's the my patron supply line under contracts.
[2:41:25.180 --> 2:41:29.860]  They have to sell it on a certain price on their site and the same price with distributors.
[2:41:29.860 --> 2:41:30.860]  They never do discounts.
[2:41:30.860 --> 2:41:33.860]  You notice we've had them as a sponsor 13 years or 14 years old.
[2:41:33.860 --> 2:41:36.900]  They're the biggest company now that they've got quality people figured it out.
[2:41:36.900 --> 2:41:37.900]  They get it to you.
[2:41:37.900 --> 2:41:38.900]  You like it.
[2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:39.900]  It's got great packaging.
[2:41:39.900 --> 2:41:43.340]  You know, great ingredients.
[2:41:43.340 --> 2:41:46.820]  It was an eight week wait and everybody got their stuff early.
[2:41:46.820 --> 2:41:47.820]  Said eight weeks.
[2:41:47.820 --> 2:41:49.660]  It was six weeks.
[2:41:49.660 --> 2:41:50.780]  Other places said they had food.
[2:41:50.780 --> 2:41:53.420]  They didn't, they lied to you or they had crap.
[2:41:53.420 --> 2:41:56.900]  They're down to a week or so to ship your food now.
[2:41:56.900 --> 2:41:59.100]  But they're going to have to go up in price in a few months because they're already having
[2:41:59.100 --> 2:42:02.980]  to buy out months ahead and the supply chain is breaking down.
[2:42:02.980 --> 2:42:06.500]  So they extended the other sale, $150 off a three month supply.
[2:42:06.500 --> 2:42:10.700]  People said, hey, we want the bigger food supplies, 300 off the six months, 600 off
[2:42:10.700 --> 2:42:17.420]  the year supply, 40 off the Alexa pure water filtration system, 25 off the ready hour wireless
[2:42:17.420 --> 2:42:22.700]  solar power charger and 28 led light that is such a valuable thing to have.
[2:42:22.700 --> 2:42:24.300]  It's a great unit.
[2:42:24.300 --> 2:42:34.100]  So it's all there at preparewithalex.com or triple eight, 411-035-0888-411-0350.
[2:42:34.100 --> 2:42:35.100]  And that funds our operation.
[2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:39.300]  Then we have the other big sale going as well in fours emergency election sale total blowout
[2:42:39.300 --> 2:42:44.220]  up to 60% off free shipping, winter sun, all of it, vitamin, mineral fusion, eight pack
[2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:45.220]  power stack.
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:46.220]  It's all selling out.
[2:42:46.220 --> 2:42:47.220]  It's all selling out.
[2:42:47.220 --> 2:42:49.500]  And literally, it's not a gimmick.
[2:42:49.500 --> 2:42:56.500]  People know behind the scenes here, we are, you know, I put a mortgage on my house.
[2:42:56.500 --> 2:43:01.500]  I'm liquidating everything I've got and we're going to continue on, you know, for months
[2:43:01.500 --> 2:43:04.940]  of the new year, even if they shut our bank accounts down, we've got backup plans because
[2:43:04.940 --> 2:43:07.020]  we know martial law and total hell's coming.
[2:43:07.020 --> 2:43:10.140]  I mean, it's more than a 50% chance we're going to have a civil war.
[2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:11.140]  Okay.
[2:43:11.140 --> 2:43:15.500]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, we are this just get ready people.
[2:43:15.500 --> 2:43:18.100]  Everything you've seen is, is anything about what you're about to witness.
[2:43:18.100 --> 2:43:19.100]  Okay.
[2:43:19.100 --> 2:43:22.900]  And by the grace of God, maybe we bypass most of us, but I think you all know we're not.
[2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:26.500]  I mean, you know what you're, you got children, folks, you got discernment, you know, you
[2:43:26.500 --> 2:43:29.100]  got your spidey sense on right now.
[2:43:29.100 --> 2:43:30.100]  We're in deep crap.
[2:43:30.100 --> 2:43:32.140]  And I just want to get ready for it.
[2:43:32.140 --> 2:43:34.980]  So thank you all for your support, but your word of mouth is even more important than
[2:43:34.980 --> 2:43:35.980]  getting the products.
[2:43:35.980 --> 2:43:38.980]  Just tell folks about the show, let them know America's under attack, let them know the
[2:43:38.980 --> 2:43:39.980]  global star.
[2:43:39.980 --> 2:43:41.380]  Now they're ready to hear the truth.
[2:43:41.380 --> 2:43:43.180]  I'm done talking about that.
[2:43:43.180 --> 2:43:48.020]  All right, Alberto in California, then we'll go to everybody else like David in Michigan.
[2:43:48.020 --> 2:43:49.020]  Alberto, thanks for holding.
[2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:50.020]  Go ahead.
[2:43:50.020 --> 2:43:51.020]  Alex.
[2:43:51.020 --> 2:43:52.020]  Love you, my brother.
[2:43:52.020 --> 2:43:53.020]  Love you, brother.
[2:43:53.020 --> 2:43:54.020]  We're prepared.
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:43:56.020]  We're prepared because of you.
[2:43:56.020 --> 2:43:59.260]  Um, last night, you know, me and my wife were excited about watching the debates.
[2:43:59.260 --> 2:44:05.420]  We were expecting, uh, Trump to just slap Joel around politically for an hour and a half.
[2:44:05.420 --> 2:44:06.420]  And he did good, man.
[2:44:06.420 --> 2:44:11.220]  He did great, but we felt like he wasn't calling out the hoaxes, kind of echoing what
[2:44:11.220 --> 2:44:16.740]  everybody else is saying, um, the whole climate change hoax, the mass coax.
[2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:18.100]  And that's a good point.
[2:44:18.100 --> 2:44:20.380]  He played along with, we've cut our carpet.
[2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:23.860]  No, call the whole fraud out, China makes zero cuts.
[2:44:23.860 --> 2:44:24.860]  Why do we make cuts?
[2:44:24.860 --> 2:44:25.860]  It's made up.
[2:44:25.860 --> 2:44:26.860]  I agree.
[2:44:26.860 --> 2:44:28.580]  Now he dropped the ball on a bunch of stuff.
[2:44:28.580 --> 2:44:29.580]  Exactly.
[2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:33.900]  And we felt like he was dancing around the topic and we're the boots on the ground trying
[2:44:33.900 --> 2:44:36.380]  to expose this hoax.
[2:44:36.380 --> 2:44:39.820]  And you know, it just kind of, it kind of kills the morale, you know, for that.
[2:44:39.820 --> 2:44:41.740]  And he's just giving legitimacy to their narrative.
[2:44:41.740 --> 2:44:44.700]  Well, that's what Robert Barnes who will be joining us probably tonight or tomorrow.
[2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:46.220]  I said, he's right.
[2:44:46.220 --> 2:44:52.580]  Trump is too surrounded by establishment people now and they're trying to tell him, look presidential.
[2:44:52.580 --> 2:44:55.180]  Well, I mean, did Biden look presidential?
[2:44:55.180 --> 2:44:56.620]  Did Chris Wallace know?
[2:44:56.620 --> 2:44:57.620]  Because they're a little globalist.
[2:44:57.620 --> 2:44:58.620]  He needed to attack them.
[2:44:58.620 --> 2:44:59.620]  I agree.
[2:44:59.620 --> 2:45:01.100]  I still think overall he did some good stuff.
[2:45:01.100 --> 2:45:02.420]  I'm not going to just get on the bandwagon.
[2:45:02.420 --> 2:45:03.420]  He sucked.
[2:45:03.420 --> 2:45:07.380]  But no, your point about the carbon tax, the climate change, he knows that's a fraud.
[2:45:07.380 --> 2:45:09.420]  Just attack it as a fraud.
[2:45:09.420 --> 2:45:11.260]  They're trying to get Democrat voters over.
[2:45:11.260 --> 2:45:13.740]  No, they don't, they're not going to vote for you.
[2:45:13.740 --> 2:45:14.740]  Get your grassroots out.
[2:45:14.740 --> 2:45:15.740]  Anything else, Alberto?
[2:45:15.740 --> 2:45:21.180]  Yeah, you know, just, you know, another thing too is he could have just gone after Chris
[2:45:21.180 --> 2:45:22.180]  Wallace.
[2:45:22.180 --> 2:45:24.660]  He did a little bit, but he should have just called them on the carpet.
[2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:27.500]  Hey, why are you softballing the pitches to Joe?
[2:45:27.500 --> 2:45:28.500]  Call them out on Antifa.
[2:45:28.500 --> 2:45:29.700]  Call them out on BLM.
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:30.700]  Have them, have them.
[2:45:30.700 --> 2:45:32.580]  Are you going to have your people leave violence?
[2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:33.580]  Like, are you kidding?
[2:45:33.580 --> 2:45:35.300]  You're the ones with the Democrats burning down a country.
[2:45:35.300 --> 2:45:36.300]  You're a joke.
[2:45:36.300 --> 2:45:37.300]  No, I agree.
[2:45:37.300 --> 2:45:38.300]  I would have destroyed Chris Wallace.
[2:45:38.300 --> 2:45:40.140]  I would have annihilated Joe Biden.
[2:45:40.140 --> 2:45:42.140]  I mean, you would have too.
[2:45:42.140 --> 2:45:43.140]  And you know what?
[2:45:43.140 --> 2:45:44.980]  I think you've nailed it so many times.
[2:45:44.980 --> 2:45:46.860]  He needs to do a fireside chat.
[2:45:46.860 --> 2:45:50.460]  He needs to level with the American people because if he wants to go after that swing
[2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:54.260]  vote, he wants to go to those people that are asleep, the leftists forget about them.
[2:45:54.260 --> 2:45:55.260]  They're never going to wake up.
[2:45:55.260 --> 2:45:56.260]  You know, you might.
[2:45:56.260 --> 2:46:00.420]  Why do you think he won the CNN poll like 10 to 1 in the Telemundo poll, though?
[2:46:00.420 --> 2:46:04.020]  Because I mean, I mean, clearly people thought he won just not as good as he should have.
[2:46:04.020 --> 2:46:06.660]  Well, you know, I'll tell you, I'm a Latino.
[2:46:06.660 --> 2:46:08.900]  I speak Spanish.
[2:46:08.900 --> 2:46:10.420]  My parents are from El Salvador.
[2:46:10.420 --> 2:46:12.100]  They're total Trump supporters.
[2:46:12.100 --> 2:46:15.700]  And let me tell you, they're Trump supporters with all the lies they're hearing from Telemundo
[2:46:15.700 --> 2:46:17.900]  and you need to be stealing all those other stuff.
[2:46:17.900 --> 2:46:22.100]  So if he would just do a fireside chat, just level with the American people, there's going
[2:46:22.100 --> 2:46:23.740]  to be more Hispanics that are going to wake up.
[2:46:23.740 --> 2:46:28.540]  I know a bunch of them that have woken up through the life because they can see it.
[2:46:28.540 --> 2:46:29.540]  They're good people.
[2:46:29.540 --> 2:46:31.260]  And they know a lie when they hear one.
[2:46:31.260 --> 2:46:33.060]  They see the truth when it's true.
[2:46:33.060 --> 2:46:39.180]  And a lot of them are actually pro, you know, a wall and pro, you know, strong, you know,
[2:46:39.180 --> 2:46:42.580]  they get any country has to have borders and the idea that we shouldn't have it's insane.
[2:46:42.580 --> 2:46:43.580]  God bless you, Alberto.
[2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:44.580]  We love you.
[2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:47.180]  All right, let's go to who's the longest here.
[2:46:47.180 --> 2:46:48.180]  David in Michigan.
[2:46:48.180 --> 2:46:50.180]  Thanks for holding brother on the air.
[2:46:50.180 --> 2:46:51.180]  How are you doing?
[2:46:51.180 --> 2:46:52.180]  Alex?
[2:46:52.180 --> 2:46:53.180]  This is David.
[2:46:53.180 --> 2:46:56.980]  I'm just calling cause I'm a truck driver out of Michigan.
[2:46:56.980 --> 2:47:05.820]  And last night I was listening to my local radio station, WSW and they linked into the
[2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:09.100]  CBS live stream.
[2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:16.980]  And before the debate, they were saying that there's only 6% of the American public that
[2:47:16.980 --> 2:47:19.220]  was undecided.
[2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:23.940]  And this is over a month before the actual election.
[2:47:23.940 --> 2:47:31.940]  And going back, if you look at the numbers, 30 days to 60 days before an election, the
[2:47:31.940 --> 2:47:36.940]  undecideds are anywhere between 10 to 20%.
[2:47:36.940 --> 2:47:40.220]  So the undecideds are very low.
[2:47:40.220 --> 2:47:41.740]  And I just think that.
[2:47:41.740 --> 2:47:43.220]  I totally agree with you.
[2:47:43.220 --> 2:47:47.180]  And I think Kiss in the House, I think conservatives are mad because he played along with some
[2:47:47.180 --> 2:47:49.620]  of their pet projects like he's going to get Democrats to vote for him.
[2:47:49.620 --> 2:47:50.620]  He's not.
[2:47:50.620 --> 2:47:51.620]  Yeah.
[2:47:51.620 --> 2:47:59.220]  And of course, of that 6%, only three of those are actually going to vote.
[2:47:59.220 --> 2:48:15.660]  So just being involved in the political process for so long, I am in my mid-30s, but I've
[2:48:15.660 --> 2:48:22.620]  been active since I was in high school and just most people are just dumb.
[2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:23.620]  Are you?
[2:48:23.620 --> 2:48:24.620]  Well, they're just not awake.
[2:48:24.620 --> 2:48:25.620]  They're in a trance.
[2:48:25.620 --> 2:48:27.420]  Are you smelling a Trump victory or defeat?
[2:48:27.420 --> 2:48:29.660]  I think he is going to win by...
[2:48:29.660 --> 2:48:30.660]  I agree.
[2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:32.540]  They're going to still contest it.
[2:48:32.540 --> 2:48:37.820]  I've come to you many times and asked for your support and you've always come through.
[2:48:37.820 --> 2:48:39.140]  And Info Wars has come through.
[2:48:39.140 --> 2:48:40.540]  We've never sold out.
[2:48:40.540 --> 2:48:41.540]  We've never backed down.
[2:48:41.540 --> 2:48:43.380]  We've always told the truth.
[2:48:43.380 --> 2:48:50.220]  We've made mistakes, but 98% of the time or so, we're dead on and the enemy knows that.
[2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:53.580]  Info Wars is a thought leader, not just here, but around the world.
[2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:58.500]  And that's why the Chai comms, Hollywood, the globalist want us off the air because
[2:48:58.500 --> 2:49:03.420]  their global plan of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay
[2:49:03.420 --> 2:49:04.420]  on air.
[2:49:04.420 --> 2:49:08.460]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now, they're going to shut Info Wars down
[2:49:08.460 --> 2:49:10.660]  and shut everybody else down as well.
[2:49:10.660 --> 2:49:11.660]  You already know that.
[2:49:11.660 --> 2:49:12.660]  It's out of the open.
[2:49:12.660 --> 2:49:13.660]  It's all in the hand.
[2:49:13.660 --> 2:49:18.740]  Count the cost, focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading
[2:49:18.740 --> 2:49:21.900]  the word that overrides the censors, your financial support getting to products at
[2:49:21.900 --> 2:49:23.740]  InfoWars.com and your prayer.
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:25.140]  I'm praying for you.
[2:49:25.140 --> 2:49:26.140]  Please pray for us.
[2:49:26.140 --> 2:49:27.140]  Let's do this together.
[2:49:27.140 --> 2:49:28.140]  We're going to win.
[2:49:28.140 --> 2:49:29.860]  We are winning, but it's not going to be easy.
[2:49:29.860 --> 2:49:31.340]  The enemy is trying to take it all from us.
[2:49:31.340 --> 2:49:32.980]  Let's not let them succeed.
[2:49:32.980 --> 2:49:39.860]  Remember the global lockdowns you're witnessing, the Black Lives Matter, antifer riots and
[2:49:39.860 --> 2:49:45.760]  racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:51.420]  billionaires led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course Tim Cook and
[2:49:51.420 --> 2:49:57.260]  others. They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in
[2:49:57.260 --> 2:50:00.140]  their companies and they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually
[2:50:00.140 --> 2:50:05.020]  leveraging that against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against
[2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:09.780]  local government and police and the mayors are again they're playing their
[2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:13.660]  political game try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States
[2:50:13.660 --> 2:50:17.780]  in Western Europe show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for
[2:50:17.780 --> 2:50:21.540]  billions on the dollar that's why I'm so angry at these globalists because when
[2:50:21.540 --> 2:50:24.980]  you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in their councils and have
[2:50:24.980 --> 2:50:29.660]  decided to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must
[2:50:29.660 --> 2:50:41.540]  be dealt with it's us or them period you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:50:41.540 --> 2:51:02.020]  there's a war on for your mind let me host Alex Jones and now in number four
[2:51:02.020 --> 2:51:06.820]  today we're just had a great job last night up until like 11 night or so
[2:51:06.820 --> 2:51:11.340]  covering the lives of eight yeah I was still disappointing you know watching
[2:51:11.340 --> 2:51:15.580]  Trump next to that enemy not seeing Trump just literally politically
[2:51:15.580 --> 2:51:21.100]  non-violently garot him chop his head off politically lovingly
[2:51:21.100 --> 2:51:24.740]  non-violently it's just it's not enough it's just like this is the enemy this
[2:51:24.740 --> 2:51:27.620]  is the globalist thought his light out so you're a globalist or enemy of
[2:51:27.620 --> 2:51:32.380]  America and just devastated him right there we have this video coming up next
[2:51:32.380 --> 2:51:39.220]  segment COVID police crashed 10 year old girls birthday party you're like that's
[2:51:39.220 --> 2:51:45.540]  humiliating that's authoritarian that's the point and we have the Rogers show
[2:51:45.540 --> 2:51:50.820]  an exclusive right now let's go back to calls let's talk to Geo on the great
[2:51:50.820 --> 2:51:55.460]  state of Florida in the great state of Florida go ahead hey Alex hey thanks for
[2:51:55.460 --> 2:52:00.620]  taking my call thank you brother do man appreciate you brother so much from you
[2:52:00.620 --> 2:52:06.940]  that no college could could equal I've learned this in your show well I've
[2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:11.500]  learned a lot from a lot of people I'm just passing on brother you know I got
[2:52:11.500 --> 2:52:14.980]  to say Chris Wallace has got to be the worst moderator I've ever seen I just
[2:52:14.980 --> 2:52:20.020]  hope next time Trump makes it a point to focus on the socialism and how it's
[2:52:20.020 --> 2:52:24.460]  taken over the Democrat Party but all in all everything Trump did everything he
[2:52:24.460 --> 2:52:28.620]  wanted to do you know but they really they really think was stupid Chris
[2:52:28.620 --> 2:52:32.220]  Wallace has denounced the white supremacist and and did you notice how
[2:52:32.220 --> 2:52:39.060]  he sneaked in the word proud boys yeah and he wasn't even the proud boys aren't
[2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:43.340]  white supremacist and he wasn't even a proud boy I would just lie on top of
[2:52:43.340 --> 2:52:48.780]  lie definitely definitely you know I feel heartbroken for what my country's
[2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:54.500]  heading because I know even when Trump does win this BS is not gonna stop but
[2:52:54.500 --> 2:52:59.620]  I gotta tell you Alex almost every I'm Puerto Rican almost every Puerto Rican I
[2:52:59.620 --> 2:53:04.300]  know and not just Puerto Rican other Hispanics here in Orlando will be will
[2:53:04.300 --> 2:53:10.140]  be voting for Trump there's a I I never would have thought I was about to say the
[2:53:10.140 --> 2:53:14.380]  numbers show that why do you think suddenly Hispanics last year woke up
[2:53:14.380 --> 2:53:18.780]  the Trump because was it the lie of the Democrats and people investigated it or
[2:53:18.780 --> 2:53:26.140]  I mean what caused that big awakening I I don't know but it's it's great to see
[2:53:26.140 --> 2:53:32.060]  it because I remember 2015 2016 I lost a lot of friends family members turned
[2:53:32.060 --> 2:53:38.020]  their backs on me you know but a lot of them are starting to come back they're
[2:53:38.020 --> 2:53:42.260]  starting to realize you know I wasn't I wasn't the crazy one they're starting
[2:53:42.260 --> 2:53:45.940]  to see the Democratic Party for what you know what I'm told I think it's a very
[2:53:45.940 --> 2:53:49.460]  no matter where you're brown black or white or what a color you got red blood
[2:53:49.460 --> 2:53:53.340]  everybody knows the COVID lockdowns exaggerated and they know the Democrats
[2:53:53.340 --> 2:53:57.300]  are doing to make us poor and everybody just gets fundamentally we're in danger
[2:53:57.300 --> 2:54:00.460]  if these people get elected
[2:54:01.100 --> 2:54:06.540]  true true hey Alex I wanted to ask you about something else I got a little
[2:54:06.540 --> 2:54:13.020]  issue you want me up to the vaccine so vaccines and garbage they put in them my
[2:54:13.020 --> 2:54:16.820]  oldest daughter went to the first round of shots when she was born but hasn't
[2:54:16.820 --> 2:54:20.940]  been vaccinated ever since now the problem that I'm having is finding a
[2:54:20.940 --> 2:54:26.100]  doctor that will be willing to see my daughters because they don't have their
[2:54:26.100 --> 2:54:33.740]  shots is there a network of doctors do you know of a way to find a doctor how
[2:54:33.740 --> 2:54:37.460]  to go about I totally agree please get Dr. Sherry Tim pity back on producers to
[2:54:37.460 --> 2:54:43.780]  do that I know that we had the same doctor when my son was born 18 years ago
[2:54:43.780 --> 2:54:50.460]  and I with my new daughters I've been divorced about a year ago a new lady
[2:54:50.460 --> 2:54:54.660]  bought the chain of things here in Austin and she called my wife in and
[2:54:54.660 --> 2:54:58.620]  said you don't take vaccines get out of here I fire you and got off on it even
[2:54:58.620 --> 2:55:02.180]  though the owner of the company new vaccines had poisons in it and was an
[2:55:02.180 --> 2:55:10.540]  anti-vaccine place of this pediatrics you know place got bought up and you
[2:55:10.540 --> 2:55:16.780]  can just search engine doctors or pediatricians that don't push vaccines
[2:55:16.780 --> 2:55:23.940]  or pediatricians that that that are anti-vaccine and you should get it in
[2:55:23.940 --> 2:55:27.340]  your area it might be an hour away because they're harassing so many the
[2:55:27.340 --> 2:55:30.460]  daughters and threaten their licenses but that's a great question brother and
[2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:34.060]  we should cover more of that thank you so much none of my children have a single
[2:55:34.060 --> 2:55:37.900]  damn shot in their bodies and they're all superstars we're right back stay with
[2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:47.100]  us remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of
[2:55:47.100 --> 2:55:53.340]  independent people all over the world the globalist have a plan for total
[2:55:53.340 --> 2:55:59.460]  vertical integration absolute authoritarianism to where you are a
[2:55:59.460 --> 2:56:07.180]  captive of their devices of their control but that is only a means to an end
[2:56:07.180 --> 2:56:11.420]  once they have the electronic straightjacket in place they are on
[2:56:11.420 --> 2:56:15.420]  record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your
[2:56:15.420 --> 2:56:20.220]  family and worse many but the vaccine is being pushed by the United Nations
[2:56:20.220 --> 2:56:26.140]  actually give people polio and actually give people cancer most cancer is viral
[2:56:26.140 --> 2:56:31.180]  that's a big secret but the secret is beginning to come out it's even in the
[2:56:31.180 --> 2:56:37.500]  Associated Press remember all of these banned videos and reports are banned on
[2:56:37.500 --> 2:56:42.780]  video but only you can share them and save humanity
[2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:54.060]  I'm up here in space I'm looking down on you my laser trace crashing through the
[2:56:54.060 --> 2:57:02.540]  lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:11.340]  remember how they told you there wasn't a world government remember they told
[2:57:11.340 --> 2:57:16.140]  you nobody was watching you nobody was spying on you but it turns out it's all
[2:57:16.140 --> 2:57:21.100]  true it's all real it turns out that people running the planet have advanced
[2:57:21.100 --> 2:57:25.740]  knowledge and technology that they're using against us and it turns out
[2:57:25.740 --> 2:57:31.500]  there's an ancient book that combined all the knowledge of the ancients
[2:57:31.500 --> 2:57:34.540]  and that they've gone and dug and researched everywhere the bible says
[2:57:34.540 --> 2:57:38.540]  there's an ancient buried city and it's been accurate and it matches the roman
[2:57:38.540 --> 2:57:41.740]  histories and the greek histories the egyptian histories
[2:57:41.740 --> 2:57:48.540]  and they say a fallen creature was marooned on this planet
[2:57:48.540 --> 2:57:53.740]  it has a mission to destroy humanity you look at what's going on and what big
[2:57:53.740 --> 2:57:58.300]  tech says and wow if it didn't prophecy they just
[2:57:58.300 --> 2:58:02.620]  decided to take it as a owner's manual but let's shift here before we take a
[2:58:02.620 --> 2:58:06.300]  few final calls roger stone just sent us about an
[2:58:06.300 --> 2:58:09.260]  hour ago this exclusive video his response to the
[2:58:09.260 --> 2:58:12.460]  trump debate how he thought trump did how he thought
[2:58:12.460 --> 2:58:17.100]  joe biden did so here's roger stone exclusively for info wars dot com telling
[2:58:17.100 --> 2:58:20.860]  you what he thinks is former trump advisor of how
[2:58:20.860 --> 2:58:25.660]  the president did last night in cleveland ohio
[2:58:25.660 --> 2:58:30.300]  well i think i've probably watched every televised presidential campaign
[2:58:30.300 --> 2:58:34.380]  debate since the earliest debate in 1960 most
[2:58:34.380 --> 2:58:38.860]  definitely a seminal moment certainly in the career of both
[2:58:38.860 --> 2:58:43.260]  john f kennedy and richard nixon tonight's debate was quite
[2:58:43.260 --> 2:58:49.740]  extraordinary joe biden who was i think had very low expectations
[2:58:49.740 --> 2:58:53.180]  coming into the debate mostly set by the republicans who
[2:58:53.180 --> 2:58:56.860]  kept repeating how stupid he was or how out of it he was
[2:58:56.860 --> 2:59:00.140]  which by the way i think is true but i wouldn't have talked about it
[2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:02.620]  i would have hoped that he would have shown it
[2:59:02.620 --> 2:59:06.540]  basically was a very scripted very tightly scripted
[2:59:06.540 --> 2:59:11.020]  he clearly had been coached to chuckle a smile whenever trump hit him with the
[2:59:11.020 --> 2:59:14.780]  hardest blows but he caused his own problems because he
[2:59:14.780 --> 2:59:19.420]  would deny things that were provably true he kept calling stories
[2:59:19.420 --> 2:59:22.620]  discredited look there's nothing discredited here
[2:59:22.620 --> 2:59:28.300]  his reprobate son whose two priorities in life were getting high and hooking up
[2:59:28.300 --> 2:59:32.940]  usually with paid talent uh got 1.4 billion dollars from the central
[2:59:32.940 --> 2:59:36.780]  chinese communist bank uh and uh you'll notice chris
[2:59:36.780 --> 2:59:41.820]  wallis listed topics he didn't even touch on china but trump had the bravado to
[2:59:41.820 --> 2:59:45.580]  bring it up joe biden can't laugh this one off by
[2:59:45.580 --> 2:59:49.980]  calling the president a clown disrespectful or telling the president of
[2:59:49.980 --> 2:59:55.660]  the united states shut up this guy is this close to a breakdown
[2:59:55.660 --> 3:00:00.700]  trump was his pugnacious self uh counter punching effectively when he
[3:00:00.700 --> 3:00:04.460]  absolutely had to i frankly think that the cheapest shot
[3:00:04.460 --> 3:00:09.580]  here was joe biden knowingly repeating the myth
[3:00:09.580 --> 3:00:13.420]  the president donald trump denigrated fallen soldiers
[3:00:13.420 --> 3:00:17.740]  that's a lie that was reported by jeff goldberg remember him
[3:00:17.740 --> 3:00:22.380]  he's the guy who told us sanham hussein had weapons of mass destruction
[3:00:22.380 --> 3:00:28.540]  for the discredited atlantic magazine i know firsthand everything they reported
[3:00:28.540 --> 3:00:33.340]  about my case was false so why in the world would
[3:00:33.340 --> 3:00:38.860]  biden dignify uh a a rumor based on four non-existent
[3:00:38.860 --> 3:00:43.900]  anonymous sources donald trump swatted that one down i was a little concerned
[3:00:43.900 --> 3:00:47.980]  that he wouldn't catch it and counter attack but he made it very clear the
[3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:54.220]  president never said any such thing it's a dirty trick how much time lapsed
[3:00:54.220 --> 3:00:57.820]  between atlantic having their magazine article up on the net
[3:00:57.820 --> 3:01:02.460]  and joe biden having a tv commercial about it paid for by his campaign
[3:01:02.460 --> 3:01:06.700]  this is roger stone and this is the stone cold truth
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:13.020]  the president probably was not wise to listen to his campaign advisors who
[3:01:13.020 --> 3:01:16.860]  suggested that he accept the three debate program
[3:01:16.860 --> 3:01:20.460]  of the presidential commission on debates because
[3:01:20.460 --> 3:01:23.740]  it's not appointed by the president it's not a commission
[3:01:23.740 --> 3:01:28.620]  it's most certainly not about open debate if it were the libertarian and green
[3:01:28.620 --> 3:01:31.740]  party candidates who will both be on the ballot in a
[3:01:31.740 --> 3:01:37.260]  sufficient number of states to theoretically win the 270 electoral
[3:01:37.260 --> 3:01:41.020]  votes necessary to become president would have been included
[3:01:41.020 --> 3:01:45.020]  instead what you got was a format that turned into a
[3:01:45.020 --> 3:01:49.260]  two-to-one match because essentially chris wallis who
[3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:52.060]  used to be a journalist before he joined fox
[3:01:52.060 --> 3:01:57.740]  ran interference for crazy joe now a lot of my friends say that donald trump the
[3:01:57.740 --> 3:02:02.140]  president interrupted other speakers too often but
[3:02:02.140 --> 3:02:06.300]  wallis interrupted trump whenever he was about to make a key point
[3:02:06.300 --> 3:02:12.860]  far more than trump interrupted anyone this was a slugfest
[3:02:12.860 --> 3:02:16.220]  biden had clearly rehearsed all of his answers
[3:02:16.220 --> 3:02:19.580]  and he'd been taught that when trump got punched him to
[3:02:19.580 --> 3:02:24.380]  grin and try to laugh it off it didn't work
[3:02:24.380 --> 3:02:27.740]  the uh trump got to the essential question of
[3:02:27.740 --> 3:02:32.380]  why the chinese central bank the communist control bank
[3:02:32.380 --> 3:02:35.740]  would wire one billion dollars to hunter
[3:02:35.740 --> 3:02:42.220]  biden days after joe and hunter visited china in air force two
[3:02:42.220 --> 3:02:48.060]  i think overall uh that this was a clear cut victory for the president
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:02:51.100]  the president defeated chris wallis in the debate
[3:02:51.100 --> 3:02:55.180]  and joe biden came in third this is roger stone
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:02:59.260]  with the stone cold truth all right thanks roger for sending us that
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:02.300]  information there's joe biden in the corner of the office joe
[3:03:02.300 --> 3:03:05.580]  you little clowny now seriously we're having some fun here
[3:03:05.580 --> 3:03:10.140]  that's called satire us at age is fact-checked a satire article for the
[3:03:10.140 --> 3:03:13.660]  babel on beach we've got to explain to them what satire is
[3:03:13.660 --> 3:03:17.020]  ron in florida thanks for holding my friend go ahead
[3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:21.580]  hey alex this is uh ron yes sir welcome
[3:03:21.580 --> 3:03:25.340]  people have to understand what's going on we're being uh played is like getting
[3:03:25.340 --> 3:03:30.380]  a rabbit distracted and somebody from behind kind of grab it
[3:03:30.380 --> 3:03:33.580]  um i was an nyp officer for over 20 years
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:37.180]  um i was around when he put the lpr license plate readers all around the
[3:03:37.180 --> 3:03:41.980]  city um and uh it's getting real
[3:03:41.980 --> 3:03:46.620]  scary right now i have too much i had to sign a form that we couldn't tell you
[3:03:46.620 --> 3:03:49.580]  say a lot but um all i could say is that the
[3:03:49.580 --> 3:03:52.220]  patrons out there think they're going to be home and they're going to come to
[3:03:52.220 --> 3:03:54.780]  your house they're not they're going to pull you over
[3:03:54.780 --> 3:03:57.900]  the tracking you guys and they're going to take you out they're going to do a
[3:03:57.900 --> 3:04:00.780]  felony stop and they're going to take you out you're not going to be home to
[3:04:00.780 --> 3:04:03.820]  protect your wife and kids the kids are going to be that's right
[3:04:03.820 --> 3:04:07.420]  exactly for folks who don't know it's all license plate and cell phone tracking
[3:04:07.420 --> 3:04:10.620]  and they'll have special units to basically pull you over even run your
[3:04:10.620 --> 3:04:14.460]  ass over with an armored car and that's it that's correct and as you see the
[3:04:14.460 --> 3:04:19.020]  Chicago mayor already opened her mouth she said i have the chief of police
[3:04:19.020 --> 3:04:22.220]  who's sworn to take a oath to the new world order
[3:04:22.220 --> 3:04:26.060]  these are the guys are going to do it you know i forgot that pull up work pull up
[3:04:26.060 --> 3:04:30.460]  where she said my chief of police light flip took to the new order it's
[3:04:30.460 --> 3:04:35.020]  literally the u.n keep lining up brother all right so now
[3:04:35.020 --> 3:04:38.780]  um they're doing that now you see the shooting school shooting stopped
[3:04:38.780 --> 3:04:42.620]  magically uh mass shootings out magically
[3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:47.100]  now they got their fences up around the schools now you need to show your id
[3:04:47.100 --> 3:04:50.460]  before you get into a parking lot they buzz you in then you have to show your
[3:04:50.460 --> 3:04:53.980]  id again to get into the school now is that going to stop a shooter they're
[3:04:53.980 --> 3:04:57.660]  stopping the parents for picking up their kids
[3:04:57.660 --> 3:05:01.660]  it's plain as day what they're doing is all a distraction
[3:05:01.660 --> 3:05:06.460]  and at the same time they're building now on decommission train tracks
[3:05:06.460 --> 3:05:10.060]  decommission magic word they're building container ship
[3:05:10.060 --> 3:05:16.380]  yards all around royal communities why is container ships being built
[3:05:16.380 --> 3:05:20.460]  in royal communities now they're not going to bring army trucks or any troops
[3:05:20.460 --> 3:05:25.500]  in broad daylight they're going to hide it in containers
[3:05:25.500 --> 3:05:28.940]  people have to wake up wow listen you got to come on as a guest tomorrow because
[3:05:28.940 --> 3:05:31.660]  everything you're saying is stuff i already know but i never get into an
[3:05:31.660 --> 3:05:35.660]  error because it's it's sophisticated and scary when they did that big
[3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:39.660]  martial law takeover drill in 2015 and spun it that i said it was a takeover
[3:05:39.660 --> 3:05:43.180]  then no it wasn't it was it was it they had people hidden in cattle
[3:05:43.180 --> 3:05:47.260]  cars and in containers and you're you're absolutely right about what you're
[3:05:47.260 --> 3:05:51.580]  talking about to give your heads up another alex is
[3:05:51.580 --> 3:05:55.340]  look at all the courthouses around the united states
[3:05:55.340 --> 3:05:58.700]  look at the superior courts they're building helipads
[3:05:58.700 --> 3:06:02.540]  right now on top of them merit jade helm
[3:06:02.540 --> 3:06:05.500]  well i wasn't part of jade helm i was what i just yeah i was talking about jade
[3:06:05.500 --> 3:06:10.700]  helm yeah you just said it part of some parts of it running around the city
[3:06:10.700 --> 3:06:15.180]  taking up judges taking them as a mock going around to their
[3:06:15.180 --> 3:06:18.620]  residents taking them to the courthouse and i'm saying why we're taking them to
[3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:22.380]  the courthouse and they're gonna do they're gonna build a helipad on top
[3:06:22.380 --> 3:06:26.620]  now we were escorting special hold on hold on listen we got john revport
[3:06:26.620 --> 3:06:32.060]  coming up and i'm not gonna forget this ron can you come on 11 30 tomorrow
[3:06:32.060 --> 3:06:35.980]  well don't hang up ron i'm gonna come back to you i
[3:06:35.980 --> 3:06:39.820]  got ports ready but i'm gonna come back and finish this ron
[3:06:39.820 --> 3:06:44.300]  the renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being
[3:06:44.300 --> 3:06:49.980]  replaced by scientific tyranny that's establishing a
[3:06:49.980 --> 3:06:55.340]  form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are
[3:06:55.340 --> 3:06:59.340]  above the law the public isn't even considered to be
[3:06:59.340 --> 3:07:04.380]  as valuable as a cow in fact humans are seen as garbage it's going to be
[3:07:04.380 --> 3:07:09.740]  taken out and removed that is the post-human extremist plan
[3:07:09.740 --> 3:07:13.980]  that is the public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built
[3:07:13.980 --> 3:07:19.660]  with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're
[3:07:19.660 --> 3:07:23.820]  slowly killed and any future generations that
[3:07:23.820 --> 3:07:26.700]  happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds
[3:07:26.700 --> 3:07:30.380]  will be a mere shadow of what humans once were
[3:07:30.380 --> 3:07:34.460]  this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass
[3:07:34.460 --> 3:07:39.180]  vandalism against god's creation humanity this is the essence of evil
[3:07:39.180 --> 3:07:43.420]  the way the psychological warfare operation works is very very simple
[3:07:43.420 --> 3:07:47.420]  they get you about freedoms by increments always promising it's only
[3:07:47.420 --> 3:07:51.020]  gonna be a short period of time and then the restructions will be
[3:07:51.020 --> 3:07:55.500]  released but they're not the ever significant amount of time always
[3:07:55.500 --> 3:07:59.260]  four or five times longer than what they said they will then slightly release it
[3:07:59.260 --> 3:08:02.460]  a little bit to only tighten it down even more later
[3:08:02.460 --> 3:08:06.620]  this is called successive approximation incrementalism
[3:08:06.620 --> 3:08:10.060]  or the inchworm effect this is the most common way that the
[3:08:10.060 --> 3:08:13.100]  talitarians take over but there then becomes a point
[3:08:13.100 --> 3:08:16.540]  where the public wakes up under the incrementalism
[3:08:16.540 --> 3:08:20.460]  he starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down
[3:08:20.460 --> 3:08:24.380]  and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days weeks or months that
[3:08:24.380 --> 3:08:28.060]  you saw in the previous 10 years and that's the period we're in
[3:08:28.060 --> 3:08:32.140]  globally right now a world government shy combat
[3:08:32.140 --> 3:08:35.820]  globalist corporate takeover of the planet that once you poor and
[3:08:35.820 --> 3:08:40.060]  absolutely sick under their thumb forever
[3:08:42.060 --> 3:08:46.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:46.860 --> 3:08:55.260]  i had chills running up my spine when ron was talking because
[3:08:55.260 --> 3:08:59.740]  everything he was talking about was secret and stuff i know
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:03.260]  stuff i haven't really gotten into because i'm trying to scare him let's just
[3:09:03.260 --> 3:09:07.100]  say we want to get control of our government
[3:09:07.100 --> 3:09:10.620]  because we were a big rich powerful country and boy did we build

[3:09:36.300 --> 3:09:40.540]  thank you alex great to be here as always
[3:09:40.540 --> 3:09:47.420]  our wednesday con fabs got a lot to cover today
[3:09:47.420 --> 3:09:51.020]  we'll get a little bit into the debate last night
[3:09:51.020 --> 3:09:55.900]  later but i have to punch up something that i covered last week which is
[3:09:55.900 --> 3:09:58.780]  extremely important
[3:09:59.260 --> 3:10:04.540]  another revelation that was presented by major media and then totally
[3:10:04.540 --> 3:10:09.260]  buried and ignored by major media an opinion piece
[3:10:09.260 --> 3:10:15.100]  written in the new york times about a week ago
[3:10:15.100 --> 3:10:18.860]  peter doshi and eric topol
[3:10:18.860 --> 3:10:25.180]  authors the clinical trials of the upcoming covid vaccine
[3:10:25.180 --> 3:10:29.660]  okay that's what we're talking about the three major
[3:10:29.660 --> 3:10:35.420]  trials it's a horse race which companies vaccine is going to be approved
[3:10:35.420 --> 3:10:39.900]  and unleashed on the public
[3:10:39.900 --> 3:10:45.900]  and those of you watching can see this times article on the screen
[3:10:46.700 --> 3:10:49.980]  so the three major companies are fiser moderna
[3:10:49.980 --> 3:10:53.580]  and astrazeneca and what the times piece
[3:10:53.580 --> 3:10:59.340]  revealed is that the clinical trials to prove
[3:10:59.340 --> 3:11:04.780]  that these vaccines are effective are completely misguided
[3:11:04.780 --> 3:11:09.660]  and headed in the wrong direction and are basically meaningless
[3:11:09.660 --> 3:11:14.700]  because what they're trying to prove is that the vaccine could be
[3:11:14.700 --> 3:11:23.180]  effective in preventing listen up a mild case of covid-19
[3:11:23.180 --> 3:11:27.100]  not a serious case not a life-threatening case
[3:11:27.100 --> 3:11:30.860]  not a case that could send somebody to the hospital or kill them
[3:11:30.860 --> 3:11:35.660]  but a mild case like for example cough
[3:11:35.660 --> 3:11:38.620]  chills and fever
[3:11:39.260 --> 3:11:44.860]  a case that would cure itself cause no real harm
[3:11:44.860 --> 3:11:48.780]  doesn't need a vaccine in the first place
[3:11:48.780 --> 3:11:54.460]  even if you believe in conventional vaccine theory
[3:11:55.100 --> 3:11:59.660]  therefore these three major clinical trials
[3:11:59.660 --> 3:12:03.260]  of these major companies and moderna by the way is
[3:12:03.260 --> 3:12:09.980]  Fauci's favorite will prove absolutely nothing after a year or so
[3:12:09.980 --> 3:12:15.180]  they each have about 30 to 40,000 volunteers
[3:12:16.380 --> 3:12:19.980]  and it doesn't matter what vaccine they're testing
[3:12:19.980 --> 3:12:25.420]  what the outcome of the clinical trial is etc etc
[3:12:25.420 --> 3:12:30.780]  they're designed to prove nothing useful to anybody no matter what they
[3:12:30.780 --> 3:12:34.220]  believe or don't believe about vaccines
[3:12:34.220 --> 3:12:40.140]  they're designed to prove that only protection is given
[3:12:40.140 --> 3:12:45.980]  against a mild case of covid-19 which if it exists at all
[3:12:45.980 --> 3:12:50.620]  does not harm anybody and does not need a vaccine
[3:12:50.620 --> 3:13:00.380]  it's up to people like you and me to let the FDA know
[3:13:00.380 --> 3:13:06.620]  that this is completely insane because the FDA is the agency that's going to
[3:13:06.620 --> 3:13:09.980]  be providing what's called emergency
[3:13:09.980 --> 3:13:13.420]  authorization for this vaccine to be shot into
[3:13:13.420 --> 3:13:16.700]  350 million people in the United States
[3:13:16.700 --> 3:13:21.980]  and perhaps many other people in other countries as well
[3:13:23.020 --> 3:13:27.180]  I hope you're getting what I'm saying here by the way John I'm sitting here
[3:13:27.180 --> 3:13:29.580]  while you're talking and I never interrupt you
[3:13:29.580 --> 3:13:32.460]  this is so bombshelled I read this you're right
[3:13:32.460 --> 3:13:35.260]  they're admitting that the vaccine is only for something that doesn't
[3:13:35.260 --> 3:13:38.220]  basically exist somebody that doesn't actually get sick because they're
[3:13:38.220 --> 3:13:40.780]  going to keep calling flues and everything covid-19
[3:13:40.780 --> 3:13:45.020]  they're admitting that it's for something that doesn't even kill you
[3:13:45.020 --> 3:13:48.300]  so that they never get judged on the fact that other people die
[3:13:48.300 --> 3:13:52.060]  they're admitting it's worthless because it's based on a whole fraud anyways
[3:13:52.060 --> 3:13:55.020]  so at the base level this totally discredits it
[3:13:55.020 --> 3:13:58.060]  this is just this is incredible sorry to interrupt but you've got to join
[3:13:58.060 --> 3:14:02.140]  during the first show tomorrow yeah it's it's unbelievable
[3:14:02.140 --> 3:14:06.140]  absolutely unbelievable and I'm trying to spread the word about this
[3:14:06.140 --> 3:14:12.220]  so people would be motivated to contact the FDA and warn them that we're
[3:14:12.220 --> 3:14:16.380]  watching we're on notice we're putting you on notice FDA
[3:14:16.380 --> 3:14:20.940]  that you can't approve in any fashion whatsoever
[3:14:20.940 --> 3:14:24.700]  this vaccine from any of these companies
[3:14:24.700 --> 3:14:28.220]  and if the three again we go to the horse race idea
[3:14:28.220 --> 3:14:33.340]  Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca trying to get to the finish line and get approval
[3:14:33.340 --> 3:14:37.900]  for their vaccine now if all of a sudden all three of
[3:14:37.900 --> 3:14:41.420]  these horses are cut out of the race
[3:14:41.420 --> 3:14:47.980]  okay because the revelation is is broadcast to enough people around the
[3:14:47.980 --> 3:14:52.940]  world who know now this is a total farce phony
[3:14:52.940 --> 3:14:58.460]  ridiculous insane irrelevant means nothing
[3:14:58.460 --> 3:15:02.140]  doesn't matter what the outcome is or what vaccine you're testing
[3:15:02.140 --> 3:15:06.460]  you're only trying to prove that it's effective
[3:15:06.460 --> 3:15:11.420]  in cases that don't matter that cure themselves that are horrible because again
[3:15:11.420 --> 3:15:15.180]  explain the data set if it doesn't hurt you anyways you
[3:15:15.180 --> 3:15:18.860]  can't prove it protected you it's a placebo
[3:15:18.860 --> 3:15:23.900]  exactly you can't prove it protected you you can't prove it's effective
[3:15:23.900 --> 3:15:28.700]  you can't prove it does anything and that's the way these protocols in the
[3:15:28.700 --> 3:15:34.620]  clinical trials are set up it's not just an accident
[3:15:34.620 --> 3:15:39.660]  that they're designed this way i could go into a lot more detail about how the
[3:15:39.660 --> 3:15:44.380]  vaccine companies decided to use this protocol
[3:15:44.380 --> 3:15:49.500]  but i just want to cut to the chase here it doesn't matter
[3:15:49.500 --> 3:15:56.460]  it's worthless useless and all they have to do
[3:15:56.460 --> 3:16:04.540]  is show that in 150 cases out of 30 or 40 000 volunteers
[3:16:04.540 --> 3:16:11.020]  that the vaccine in heavy quotes protects against a case of COVID-19
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:17.900]  150 cases that's the way it's set up but those cases are not relevant
[3:16:17.900 --> 3:16:21.100]  they don't mean anything it's like somebody has a sniffle
[3:16:21.100 --> 3:16:24.460]  or a cough or a little chill or a bit of fever
[3:16:24.460 --> 3:16:29.020]  that's all that these trials are being designed
[3:16:29.020 --> 3:16:33.580]  to show to test to prove it's like let's set up a test
[3:16:33.580 --> 3:16:37.900]  that proves that if you cross the street in the middle of the night
[3:16:37.900 --> 3:16:43.260]  when there's no traffic that you won't get in an accident and be run over
[3:16:43.260 --> 3:16:49.740]  hey we did it so let's now you know unleash this on the public no
[3:16:49.740 --> 3:16:55.500]  stop it tell the FDA and i'm talking to scientists here too and lawyers and
[3:16:55.500 --> 3:17:02.220]  doctors and everybody to put the FDA on notice
[3:17:02.220 --> 3:17:06.540]  they already know what's going on at the FDA believe me
[3:17:06.540 --> 3:17:10.300]  they may be crazy and they may be criminals which they are
[3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:13.740]  but they're not completely stupid they know what's happening with these
[3:17:13.740 --> 3:17:16.540]  clinical trials and they're trying to pretend
[3:17:16.540 --> 3:17:20.060]  that it's it doesn't exist and it's not a problem there's nothing's going to
[3:17:20.060 --> 3:17:24.300]  happen everything's okay they know better we know
[3:17:24.300 --> 3:17:28.140]  better now and we have to force them especially
[3:17:28.140 --> 3:17:35.580]  scientists to stand up we need a new coronavirus task force
[3:17:35.580 --> 3:17:41.820]  of scientists computer research scientists engineers working with
[3:17:41.820 --> 3:17:45.020]  attorneys have conclusively proven and put out the
[3:17:45.020 --> 3:17:48.300]  failed reports at tablet magazine documenting what
[3:17:48.300 --> 3:17:51.820]  any trained eye could already see as plain as day
[3:17:51.820 --> 3:17:55.660]  communist chinese working in tandem with the united nations
[3:17:55.660 --> 3:17:59.100]  and the democratic party in the united states as well as the media
[3:17:59.100 --> 3:18:03.020]  put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like
[3:18:03.020 --> 3:18:06.940]  day of the dead into the world in china earlier this year
[3:18:06.940 --> 3:18:10.940]  then the un put out standardized rules designed to keep the west locked down
[3:18:10.940 --> 3:18:15.500]  when china reopened within three months this is the greatest strategic
[3:18:15.500 --> 3:18:20.780]  coup ever this is 21st century warfare being carried out
[3:18:20.780 --> 3:18:23.980]  through psychological means or the ultimate style
[3:18:23.980 --> 3:18:26.540]  paul joseph watchin has written about it at info wars
[3:18:26.540 --> 3:18:30.620]  dot com myself alex jones david i know insurer covering this heavily
[3:18:30.620 --> 3:18:34.060]  this is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist
[3:18:34.060 --> 3:18:37.740]  china and the un were behind the hysteria
[3:18:37.740 --> 3:18:45.100]  hello my name is dr falchi and i've been at the n i h and cdc for 45 years
[3:18:45.100 --> 3:18:49.180]  and i've overseen well you know the age pandemic and
[3:18:49.180 --> 3:18:55.660]  so many other things and i take my orders from bill gate doctor bill gates i mean
[3:18:55.660 --> 3:19:00.140]  he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do
[3:19:00.140 --> 3:19:03.820]  and he now says you're going to take the shots
[3:19:03.820 --> 3:19:07.740]  and of course in england they are now saying what i told you
[3:19:07.740 --> 3:19:11.820]  you will not be allowed to travel leave your home until you take
[3:19:11.820 --> 3:19:19.100]  all the shots doctor gates i mean bill gates your owner your master
[3:19:19.100 --> 3:19:22.780]  says you are to take four to five covid shots a year
[3:19:22.780 --> 3:19:28.940]  for adult two for baby here baby may be much more manageable
[3:19:28.940 --> 3:19:32.300]  just like bill gates give you polio and vexie
[3:19:32.300 --> 3:19:37.980]  i'm dr falchi reminding you that we owe you
[3:19:37.980 --> 3:19:41.100]  if you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and
[3:19:41.100 --> 3:19:45.260]  control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many people on
[3:19:45.260 --> 3:19:48.780]  the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain
[3:19:48.780 --> 3:19:53.100]  top or an national park they have to look at us the common people they have to
[3:19:53.100 --> 3:19:56.940]  look at the proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they love the
[3:19:56.940 --> 3:20:00.220]  lockdown putting muzzles on us that gives them a big thrill
[3:20:00.220 --> 3:20:04.220]  controlling where we can go what we can do bankrupting main street
[3:20:04.220 --> 3:20:07.740]  bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration
[3:20:07.740 --> 3:20:12.220]  consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender
[3:20:12.220 --> 3:20:15.340]  which is taking sterilant vaccines day one
[3:20:15.340 --> 3:20:19.420]  ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over
[3:20:19.420 --> 3:20:22.460]  they used all the entertainment garbage to put us into a trance
[3:20:22.460 --> 3:20:26.540]  and now the spider's moving in for the kill you know this i know this
[3:20:26.540 --> 3:20:29.900]  it's all out in the open the question is what are we going to do about it
[3:20:29.900 --> 3:20:33.340]  well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify the
[3:20:33.340 --> 3:20:37.980]  enemy identify your enemy now
[3:20:37.980 --> 3:20:44.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:57.180 --> 3:21:01.660]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:21:01.660 --> 3:21:05.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now
[3:21:05.740 --> 3:21:10.540]  your host john rabba board
[3:21:13.260 --> 3:21:20.460]  continuing here with the covid vaccine so established that as alex said
[3:21:20.460 --> 3:21:23.740]  basically it's a placebo that they're testing
[3:21:23.740 --> 3:21:29.820]  it's not designed to protect anybody from anything
[3:21:29.820 --> 3:21:33.340]  that's how they think they're going to get approval for it
[3:21:33.340 --> 3:21:37.980]  but it's worthless useless the fda already knows this
[3:21:37.980 --> 3:21:41.020]  talking about the three major clinical trials
[3:21:41.020 --> 3:21:45.580]  now underway each one with about 30 to 40 000 volunteers
[3:21:45.580 --> 3:21:49.900]  moderna fiser astrazeneca
[3:21:50.540 --> 3:21:55.340]  the federal government has also set up and i wrote a piece about this
[3:21:55.340 --> 3:22:01.500]  last week a new vaccine court it's buried in one of their
[3:22:01.500 --> 3:22:07.260]  documents and i quoted the document it's especially for covid
[3:22:07.260 --> 3:22:11.740]  it's just like the vaccine court they already have now
[3:22:11.740 --> 3:22:17.740]  for childhood injuries or death suffered from vaccinations where the
[3:22:17.740 --> 3:22:22.380]  parents have to go into a nightmare scenario
[3:22:22.380 --> 3:22:26.940]  and try to get compensated for their children's destruction
[3:22:26.940 --> 3:22:31.740]  through vaccination because of course the companies that manufacture the
[3:22:31.740 --> 3:22:34.700]  vaccines don't have any liability whatsoever and
[3:22:34.700 --> 3:22:39.900]  that was all established in 1986 well now the federal government has set up
[3:22:39.900 --> 3:22:44.300]  another court just like that to prepare for the covid
[3:22:44.300 --> 3:22:50.780]  vaccine where if anybody's injured children adults whatever killed by the
[3:22:50.780 --> 3:22:54.380]  vaccine the relatives will have to go
[3:22:54.380 --> 3:22:59.580]  through this nightmare red tape insanity to try to prove
[3:22:59.580 --> 3:23:04.860]  that it was the vaccine that did it and then try to get compensation from the
[3:23:04.860 --> 3:23:10.380]  federal government okay they set it up
[3:23:10.380 --> 3:23:14.060]  they expect vaccine injuries in other words
[3:23:14.060 --> 3:23:19.660]  and death from the vaccine that's why they set up the court
[3:23:19.660 --> 3:23:24.700]  so that proves they know what's going to happen
[3:23:24.700 --> 3:23:29.500]  you don't set up a court unless you expect people to appear at the court
[3:23:29.500 --> 3:23:34.540]  trying to get money compensation for injury death
[3:23:34.540 --> 3:23:39.980]  caused in this case by the covid vaccine
[3:23:42.380 --> 3:23:45.660]  i could spend the whole hour talking about these clinical trials because it's
[3:23:45.660 --> 3:23:51.420]  so important these could be stopped they could be derailed
[3:23:51.420 --> 3:23:56.300]  they could be destroyed these clinical trials on the basis of the truth
[3:23:56.300 --> 3:24:01.180]  if enough people including scientists and lawyers and doctors and the public
[3:24:01.180 --> 3:24:05.020]  puts the FDA on notice we know what's happening
[3:24:05.020 --> 3:24:09.820]  these trials are completely insane they prove nothing
[3:24:09.820 --> 3:24:13.180]  do not even think of trying to approve a vaccine
[3:24:13.180 --> 3:24:17.260]  based on these clinical trials
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:24.860]  the media will show you something like the new york times
[3:24:24.860 --> 3:24:28.620]  then they'll take it away they'll show you something
[3:24:28.620 --> 3:24:33.020]  that's mind boggling then they'll take it away as if it doesn't matter as if
[3:24:33.020 --> 3:24:35.980]  that we don't need to follow up on this are you kidding
[3:24:35.980 --> 3:24:39.820]  sure it's a gigantic global scandal and it could change everything
[3:24:39.820 --> 3:24:43.180]  bring down the whole house of cards of covid and collapse
[3:24:43.180 --> 3:24:49.820]  the whole insane operation to destroy the planet yes it could do that if we
[3:24:49.820 --> 3:24:53.180]  the media wanted to pursue the story but no
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:56.140]  we're just going to give you a peek and a glimpse and then we're going to
[3:24:56.140 --> 3:24:58.860]  forget about it and move on to the next story
[3:24:58.860 --> 3:25:02.700]  they do this time and time and time and time again
[3:25:02.700 --> 3:25:07.100]  i've been at this for 38 years i've seen it happen over and over
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:11.100]  and i'm going to give you another another brain buster
[3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:14.700]  right now which i've discussed here on the show before
[3:25:14.700 --> 3:25:19.500]  but i'm going to punch it up more today this was another piece from the new
[3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:24.300]  york times about i'm going to say three weeks a month ago
[3:25:24.300 --> 3:25:31.500]  in which the times reported on a large study done in three
[3:25:31.500 --> 3:25:38.540]  states that showed that up to get this 90 percent
[3:25:38.540 --> 3:25:42.860]  of all us covid cases
[3:25:42.860 --> 3:25:50.380]  are not cases are based on false positives are based on incorrect results
[3:25:50.380 --> 3:25:57.100]  of the diagnostic test for the virus called the pcr test up to
[3:25:57.100 --> 3:26:03.420]  there it is not for those of you who are watching up to 90 percent
[3:26:03.420 --> 3:26:10.060]  of all covid cases in america could very well be false positives in other
[3:26:10.060 --> 3:26:16.220]  words they're not cases at all so you could subtract
[3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:19.820]  90 percent of the figure that they're
[3:26:19.820 --> 3:26:22.460]  promoting
[3:26:22.460 --> 3:26:27.260]  right off the bat forget about other methods which
[3:26:27.260 --> 3:26:30.780]  i've gone into in detail about rigging case numbers
[3:26:30.780 --> 3:26:34.700]  falsely inflating them and so on and so forth
[3:26:34.700 --> 3:26:41.900]  this is just straight ahead here it is the test produces spits out false
[3:26:41.900 --> 3:26:46.460]  positive like coins in a rig slot machine
[3:26:46.460 --> 3:26:53.500]  there it was in the new york times did Fauci
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:26:58.380]  uh white house the coronavirus task force pay any attention to this
[3:26:58.380 --> 3:27:03.660]  did they suddenly grab on to this and and grab it like it was a
[3:27:03.660 --> 3:27:09.740]  life raft in a stormy sea and saying we can get to shore now
[3:27:09.740 --> 3:27:16.380]  we're safe look up to 90 percent of all us covid cases are fake
[3:27:16.380 --> 3:27:21.980]  they're false they don't exist you getting what i'm saying here
[3:27:21.980 --> 3:27:27.420]  but now if you actually read the new york times article
[3:27:27.420 --> 3:27:31.020]  what do they do after the first few paragraphs
[3:27:31.020 --> 3:27:35.500]  of revelation they turn around and they say
[3:27:35.500 --> 3:27:40.540]  what are we going to do now what do we need now we need
[3:27:40.540 --> 3:27:49.180]  more testing we need to change the method of testing
[3:27:49.180 --> 3:27:55.180]  set the parameters of the test differently etc
[3:27:56.780 --> 3:28:03.020]  really really you're not going to look back
[3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:08.540]  new york times and say what we just revealed in this very article
[3:28:08.540 --> 3:28:15.180]  is enough to torpedo the entire us phony covid operation and destroy it
[3:28:15.180 --> 3:28:19.820]  and bring down the entire house of cards because
[3:28:19.820 --> 3:28:24.060]  thus far since all of this insanity began
[3:28:24.060 --> 3:28:31.260]  and case counting began again up to 90 percent of all covid cases
[3:28:31.260 --> 3:28:37.660]  are likely to be false not cases at all no they don't do that
[3:28:37.660 --> 3:28:43.420]  they don't do that at all not at all they show you a glimpse
[3:28:43.420 --> 3:28:47.660]  they take it away they're playing a game
[3:28:47.660 --> 3:28:53.580]  they show you a glimpse they take it away do other major media outlets
[3:28:53.580 --> 3:28:58.700]  suddenly grab on to that new york times piece and run with it and go down into
[3:28:58.700 --> 3:29:02.380]  the rabbit hole set their hounds loose on Fauci and
[3:29:02.380 --> 3:29:08.460]  everybody else all these you know wretched evil
[3:29:08.460 --> 3:29:13.820]  destroyers and back them up against the wall and say look at this
[3:29:13.820 --> 3:29:19.020]  here's the data the true data that you refuse to acknowledge
[3:29:19.020 --> 3:29:25.260]  why why are you avoiding this why and press them and don't lay it up
[3:29:25.260 --> 3:29:30.220]  and just give it to them
[3:29:30.220 --> 3:29:35.820]  they don't do that of course of course
[3:29:35.820 --> 3:29:39.340]  and i've got one more blockbuster like this that i'll
[3:29:39.340 --> 3:29:45.100]  share with you after the break a third one
[3:29:47.500 --> 3:29:52.620]  media operations are set up
[3:29:52.620 --> 3:29:57.740]  to move along to the next story the world ended monday
[3:29:57.740 --> 3:30:01.900]  today a singer decided that she was going to
[3:30:01.900 --> 3:30:05.420]  do too much cocaine and she ended up in the hospital
[3:30:05.420 --> 3:30:11.180]  that's their that's the way they are that's what they do
[3:30:11.180 --> 3:30:20.460]  they're insane by any definition they're complete criminals by any definition
[3:30:20.460 --> 3:30:25.100]  they don't ever say stop the presses wait a minute
[3:30:25.100 --> 3:30:28.460]  let's go to the white house let's go to congress
[3:30:28.460 --> 3:30:36.460]  set the reporters loose dig they don't do
[3:30:37.340 --> 3:30:41.500]  you notice that over and over again the united nations are supposed controllers
[3:30:41.500 --> 3:30:44.140]  and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to
[3:30:44.140 --> 3:30:48.060]  disagree with has come out and said nothing can treat or
[3:30:48.060 --> 3:30:51.900]  prevent covid-19 ladies and gentlemen that's a total lie
[3:30:51.900 --> 3:30:56.300]  you get a lot of sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin d3
[3:30:56.300 --> 3:30:59.980]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of
[3:30:59.980 --> 3:31:02.780]  vitamin d3 if you have zinc and vitamin c as well
[3:31:02.780 --> 3:31:06.300]  that's why people get the blues and these colds in the winter because that's
[3:31:06.300 --> 3:31:09.420]  on vitamin d levels plunge now i've pointed this out
[3:31:09.420 --> 3:31:13.020]  and the media has called me a scammer for saying
[3:31:13.020 --> 3:31:15.900]  that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals
[3:31:15.900 --> 3:31:20.220]  will now vouch he's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin d3
[3:31:20.220 --> 3:31:24.940]  and see he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die
[3:31:24.940 --> 3:31:28.300]  without zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the
[3:31:28.300 --> 3:31:32.220]  reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have
[3:31:32.220 --> 3:31:34.780]  been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their
[3:31:34.780 --> 3:31:40.140]  vitamins it's the evening of september 26 2020
[3:31:40.140 --> 3:31:47.020]  and i just got done watching the horrible footage of thousands of riot
[3:31:47.020 --> 3:31:51.740]  police with trejans beating thousands of peaceful people
[3:31:51.740 --> 3:31:54.700]  in trefalgar square protesting the covid
[3:31:54.700 --> 3:31:59.900]  martial law lockdown an iron curtain is descending over the
[3:31:59.900 --> 3:32:05.180]  world from the united nations even more evil than the old soviet union
[3:32:05.180 --> 3:32:08.780]  and it's a model of communist china we're not facing incremental tyranny
[3:32:08.780 --> 3:32:15.900]  we're facing absolute 100 commitment to evil because the system
[3:32:15.900 --> 3:32:19.100]  thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid and it's making this move and
[3:32:19.100 --> 3:32:22.700]  whether it's australia the u k or the us black lives matter funded by soros can
[3:32:22.700 --> 3:32:26.540]  run around and kill cops and burn things down in their heroes and oh nobody's
[3:32:26.540 --> 3:32:30.140]  worried about the covid bs but when it's patriots saying we have rights we have
[3:32:30.140 --> 3:32:33.980]  dignity they get viciously attacked all the videos are at info wars dot com of
[3:32:33.980 --> 3:32:41.100]  david like speaking of more and perhaps most cruelly of all
[3:32:41.100 --> 3:32:45.580]  if donald trump has his way the complications from covid 19
[3:32:45.580 --> 3:32:52.940]  which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people
[3:32:52.940 --> 3:32:57.100]  have died probably by the time i finish this talk
[3:32:57.100 --> 3:33:01.340]  joe biden has always been a congenital liar part of the establishment for
[3:33:01.340 --> 3:33:06.540]  close to 50 years but now boy his brain degenerates
[3:33:06.540 --> 3:33:12.540]  we are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage of the world the 2020
[3:33:12.540 --> 3:33:17.580]  election there are 370 million people in the united states if 200 million died
[3:33:17.580 --> 3:33:21.100]  from covid that'd be more than half of the population
[3:33:21.100 --> 3:33:23.900]  when not even one tenth of one percent have actually died
[3:33:23.900 --> 3:33:27.500]  but him putting these giant lies and these incredibly
[3:33:27.500 --> 3:33:31.500]  brain damage statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a
[3:33:31.500 --> 3:33:37.180]  trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre
[3:33:37.180 --> 3:33:42.220]  the planets have aligned globally they've aligned nationally they've aligned
[3:33:42.220 --> 3:33:46.300]  financially culturally but most importantly spiritually
[3:33:46.300 --> 3:33:50.460]  we are living at a point in human development that will decide
[3:33:50.460 --> 3:33:54.140]  the entire future destiny of our species so that's why
[3:33:54.140 --> 3:33:57.580]  big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist
[3:33:57.580 --> 3:34:01.580]  is trying to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed
[3:34:01.580 --> 3:34:05.260]  make us alone and traction control every aspect of our lives
[3:34:05.260 --> 3:34:08.860]  literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward
[3:34:08.860 --> 3:34:11.580]  because they do not want us to take our birthright
[3:34:11.580 --> 3:34:16.380]  not just of americana but of true christendom and the renaissance and the
[3:34:16.380 --> 3:34:19.100]  enlightenment they are trying to create a new
[3:34:19.100 --> 3:34:21.820]  dark age where they have all the high technology and
[3:34:21.820 --> 3:34:24.620]  life extension and we are walled off in a
[3:34:24.620 --> 3:34:27.980]  technocracy that controls us through carbon credits
[3:34:27.980 --> 3:34:31.900]  and through a social credit score this is their plan
[3:34:31.900 --> 3:34:35.260]  we must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no
[3:34:35.260 --> 3:34:38.380]  we must embrace god
[3:34:38.380 --> 3:34:51.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:35:01.820 --> 3:35:07.500]  John Rappaport back here so the third giant blockbuster actually came out of
[3:35:07.500 --> 3:35:13.420]  the cgc itself centers for seas control back in the out on six weeks eight weeks
[3:35:13.420 --> 3:35:18.860]  ago when they announced that only six percent
[3:35:18.860 --> 3:35:27.020]  of all the covert deaths in america could be said by their science
[3:35:27.020 --> 3:35:35.180]  to emanate solely and indisputably from the virus 94 percent
[3:35:35.180 --> 3:35:41.260]  involved people who had other what they call comorbidities
[3:35:41.260 --> 3:35:48.700]  meaning serious medical conditions prior to any of this
[3:35:48.700 --> 3:35:52.540]  and then i put in parentheses which alone could account for their death and
[3:35:52.540 --> 3:35:59.740]  have nothing to do with the virus so you could subtract 94 percent of the
[3:35:59.740 --> 3:36:06.380]  covert deaths from the figures that are being promoted now
[3:36:06.380 --> 3:36:10.620]  to find out what the official count ought to be
[3:36:10.620 --> 3:36:15.420]  and then you could reduce that even further because of other factors that
[3:36:15.420 --> 3:36:19.900]  i've gone into before in other words other fakery that i've gone into
[3:36:19.900 --> 3:36:27.020]  such as doctors writing covert 19 death on death certificates of patients who
[3:36:27.020 --> 3:36:31.580]  you know died from obviously other causes
[3:36:31.580 --> 3:36:37.820]  but the hospitals get extra money they need the money etc etc
[3:36:39.180 --> 3:36:46.140]  where is that revelation from the cgc why isn't the press hammering on that
[3:36:46.140 --> 3:36:50.780]  why isn't the coronavirus task force being held to account for that
[3:36:50.780 --> 3:36:53.820]  why aren't reporters from the new york time i mean
[3:36:53.820 --> 3:36:58.940]  these press outlets mind you you know if you think
[3:36:58.940 --> 3:37:03.340]  you know what a press outlet looks like
[3:37:03.340 --> 3:37:07.020]  you need to go into one of these buildings if you can and see how many
[3:37:07.020 --> 3:37:13.260]  reporters they actually have on tap or who are now at home
[3:37:13.260 --> 3:37:19.740]  doing it you know virtually these are the hounds
[3:37:19.740 --> 3:37:25.660]  they are never set loose almost never set loose on the story
[3:37:25.660 --> 3:37:30.860]  with the command you go to the bottom of the rabbit hole on this one baby and you
[3:37:30.860 --> 3:37:34.940]  give us everything you can find and we're going to print it
[3:37:34.940 --> 3:37:41.980]  they could take 50 of these people who once upon a time in their lives
[3:37:41.980 --> 3:37:47.180]  wanted to tell the truth maybe when they were 16 18 23
[3:37:47.180 --> 3:37:50.860]  who knows but at one time that's what they wanted
[3:37:50.860 --> 3:37:58.380]  now with layers of crust and cynicism and booze and pills and lying
[3:37:58.380 --> 3:38:04.620]  and scumbaggery and so forth they've been reduced to a shell of their former
[3:38:04.620 --> 3:38:07.740]  selves but somewhere in their souls is still the
[3:38:07.740 --> 3:38:12.060]  spark of that desire to tell the truth and if an editor
[3:38:12.060 --> 3:38:15.820]  got them in a newsroom and sat them down and said okay this is what you've been
[3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:19.740]  waiting all your lives for and you're going to shake off all the crap that's
[3:38:19.740 --> 3:38:23.260]  accumulated around you and you're going to go for it now
[3:38:23.260 --> 3:38:28.300]  because we have data the clinical trials of the vaccine are complete
[3:38:28.300 --> 3:38:31.980]  fakery they're not aimed to prove any kind of
[3:38:31.980 --> 3:38:37.420]  serious protection against anything number two up to 90 percent of all
[3:38:37.420 --> 3:38:43.180]  covid cases in america are fake cases false positive meaningless
[3:38:43.180 --> 3:38:49.580]  number three even by official estimates only six percent of all official
[3:38:49.580 --> 3:38:54.060]  covid death numbers could be said to be coming from the virus
[3:38:54.060 --> 3:38:58.780]  even by conventional viral theory with these three
[3:38:58.780 --> 3:39:03.820]  factors ladies and gentlemen of press you are going to go out
[3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:08.940]  hell bent and you are going to find the truth and we are going to lead with it
[3:39:08.940 --> 3:39:13.340]  on page one every friggin day until something happens
[3:39:13.340 --> 3:39:16.380]  you're going to go to the white house you're going to go to congress
[3:39:16.380 --> 3:39:20.540]  you're going to go to the fda you're going to go to the cdc
[3:39:20.540 --> 3:39:24.140]  you're going to pursue these
[3:39:24.380 --> 3:39:29.740]  criminals to the wall you're going to back them up and you're going to force
[3:39:29.740 --> 3:39:34.540]  them to confess and roll over on each other
[3:39:34.540 --> 3:39:37.900]  this is what you're going to do and if you don't do it
[3:39:37.900 --> 3:39:40.860]  you're going to get fired
[3:39:43.100 --> 3:39:47.820]  for the past 30 years i've been saying at any moment in time
[3:39:47.820 --> 3:39:51.340]  a media outlet could do that if they wanted to
[3:39:51.340 --> 3:39:55.740]  and no they wouldn't go broke in fact they would be selling newspapers off the
[3:39:55.740 --> 3:40:00.540]  rack like there's no tomorrow because people as it turns out are intensely
[3:40:00.540 --> 3:40:06.220]  interested in this kind of thing oh yeah you bet intensely interested
[3:40:06.220 --> 3:40:11.180]  and so our television audiences intensely interested in this kind of thing
[3:40:11.180 --> 3:40:15.100]  you bet you they are and even if the drug companies
[3:40:15.100 --> 3:40:17.660]  decided that they were going to take all their money
[3:40:17.660 --> 3:40:21.900]  for ads and walk away new advertisers would come on board seeing
[3:40:21.900 --> 3:40:25.660]  what the ratings are like look at Fauci look at
[3:40:25.660 --> 3:40:29.740]  look at his face look at his manner look at his
[3:40:29.740 --> 3:40:34.220]  oh it's all so casual we're destroying the planet it's all so
[3:40:34.220 --> 3:40:38.140]  easy to do and the facts and the figures and this and that
[3:40:38.140 --> 3:40:45.660]  and now imagine that he's got 50 relentless hounds that have a brain
[3:40:45.660 --> 3:40:51.420]  and have a purpose suddenly from media instead of the criminal worm like
[3:40:51.420 --> 3:40:56.700]  media that we have climbing through putrid garbage to report
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:41:01.020]  lies day after day and Fauci was faced with these people
[3:41:01.020 --> 3:41:07.980]  all the time day and night every day just imagine and the result
[3:41:07.980 --> 3:41:13.900]  well that's what we're doing with our limited resources that's what
[3:41:13.900 --> 3:41:19.340]  independent journalists and media outlets like this one are doing
[3:41:19.340 --> 3:41:24.780]  night and day every day all the time
[3:41:24.780 --> 3:41:31.180]  and people are waking up to reality to the truth
[3:41:31.740 --> 3:41:38.540]  and it's the worms of major media that crawl along in the garbage and spew
[3:41:38.540 --> 3:41:42.460]  their excrement that are covering all of the truth up
[3:41:42.460 --> 3:41:48.620]  and keeping it from the people because if the truth were known
[3:41:48.620 --> 3:41:52.780]  we would be free we would be out there all of us
[3:41:52.780 --> 3:41:58.620]  everybody living their lives no masks no lockdowns no business
[3:41:58.620 --> 3:42:03.260]  closures no bankruptcies no lives destroyed by
[3:42:03.260 --> 3:42:09.260]  suicide and drug addiction owing to the economic destruction
[3:42:11.180 --> 3:42:17.660]  in the last few minutes not that this audience necessarily needs this at all
[3:42:17.660 --> 3:42:23.980]  because you've been getting it in great quantity
[3:42:23.980 --> 3:42:30.620]  but you do have to ask yourself don't you if the true dimension and purpose of
[3:42:30.620 --> 3:42:35.740]  this entire COVID operation is really to conceal
[3:42:35.740 --> 3:42:41.020]  beneath a cover story about a virus the economic and human destruction and
[3:42:41.020 --> 3:42:44.860]  lockdown of life across the planet
[3:42:44.860 --> 3:42:48.940]  then what are the people who are running this
[3:42:48.940 --> 3:42:55.100]  operation really trying to do what are they really trying to do
[3:42:55.100 --> 3:42:59.100]  and the answer is as plain as a nose on your face
[3:42:59.100 --> 3:43:03.580]  they're trying to destroy civilization destroy humanity
[3:43:03.580 --> 3:43:09.100]  destroy the individual destroy freedom destroy centuries of struggle that
[3:43:09.100 --> 3:43:14.860]  produced the idea and the reality of individual freedom and
[3:43:14.860 --> 3:43:20.780]  substitute technocratic slavery and a brave new world
[3:43:21.580 --> 3:43:28.620]  engineering it depopulating it putting everyone who's left
[3:43:28.620 --> 3:43:34.780]  into slots control surveillance wall to wall in real
[3:43:34.780 --> 3:43:41.660]  time moment to moment it's not a secret that that's where
[3:43:41.660 --> 3:43:48.700]  they're going all you do is open up news stories and
[3:43:48.700 --> 3:43:53.260]  you see the truth it's where china is going it's where big tech is going
[3:43:53.260 --> 3:43:57.420]  it's where bill gates is growing has been going there for a long time
[3:43:57.420 --> 3:44:01.100]  this is what they want a stimulus response
[3:44:01.100 --> 3:44:06.780]  empire they provide stimulus to get the response they want from people
[3:44:06.780 --> 3:44:10.780]  behavior control mind control operant conditioning
[3:44:10.780 --> 3:44:15.260]  it goes under many names it amounts to the same thing
[3:44:15.260 --> 3:44:19.180]  you can live you can survive
[3:44:19.740 --> 3:44:23.580]  we your controllers will allow you to survive
[3:44:23.580 --> 3:44:30.220]  as long as we can define you with insert very tight parameters
[3:44:30.220 --> 3:44:34.220]  and surveil you and watch you and know you and predict you and
[3:44:34.220 --> 3:44:40.380]  profile you and control your behavior you want money you want energy you want
[3:44:40.380 --> 3:44:43.820]  time you want a certain limited amount of freedom
[3:44:43.820 --> 3:44:49.340]  to travel to go into buildings etc etc then you have to do exactly what we
[3:44:49.340 --> 3:44:52.540]  say that is the world that we're building on the
[3:44:52.540 --> 3:44:56.700]  ashes of the wreckage that we are creating under the viral cover story
[3:44:56.700 --> 3:45:01.740]  called covert that's what we're doing that's what we've been doing
[3:45:01.740 --> 3:45:05.820]  we are against freedom we hate freedom we want to destroy freedom
[3:45:05.820 --> 3:45:10.220]  freedom is a threat freedom is undesirable
[3:45:10.220 --> 3:45:13.500]  freedom is unpredictable freedom is uncontrollable
[3:45:13.500 --> 3:45:20.860]  freedom is glory freedom is reality freedom is freedom
[3:45:20.860 --> 3:45:26.860]  we controllers hate freedom
