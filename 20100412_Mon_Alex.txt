[00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.272]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.053]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:09.834]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:11.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:12.935]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:17.137]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:21.239]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:34.817]  Welcome, my friends, welcome!
[00:00:34.817 --> 00:00:39.061]  We are steaming into the middle of April 2010.
[00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.443]  It is Monday, the 12th day of April 2010.
[00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:49.449]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours today.
[00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:59.278]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaeffer is going to be joining us from Ireland via video Skype, coming up in the middle of the next hour for 30 minutes to talk about a host of issues.
[00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:06.311]  Including last week's massacre videos that were released, several have now been released.
[00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:11.555]  Jim Tucker, they believe they've discovered, and he's always been right in the past, the location.
[00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:19.902]  Some had thought it was going to be in England, but now it has been identified to be on the continent of Europe in Spain.
[00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:24.510]  And he's also got his Inside Bilderberg group sources.
[00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:32.472]  We'll talk to him about what is on the agenda for Bilderberg 2010 in Spain.
[00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:37.873]  So that is coming up in the last hour with Jim Tucker of American Free Press.
[00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:40.694]  Okay.
[00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:47.116]  I have an unusual amount of news to cover today and I'm going to attempt to cover it all.
[00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:50.317]  Yesterday I said I would get into the President of Poland
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:00.204]  Kaczynski dying over the weekend with a large portion of the Polish leadership flying into Russia.
[00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:08.507]  But I have to be honest with you, he was enemies with the Russians, he was enemies now with NATO and with the EU.
[00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:18.111]  And if I had dead reckoning and past evidence and a lot of other factors going in, probably foul play.
[00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:19.032]  Probably foul play.
[00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:30.703]  So we'll break down what happened with that coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:43.487]  But the lesson to government is don't put the majority of your executive branch and the head of your central bank and others who've just said no to the European Union takeover of your country
[00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:46.406]  Don't put them all on one aircraft.
[00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:55.889]  And the aircraft was having technical difficulties coming in, it missed the runway four times, it was out of fuel, and did an emergency landing.
[00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.630]  And that could have just been the case.
[00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.371]  Or they could have set up a mechanical malfunction.
[00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.021]  But because governments are so good at covering things up, we don't know what the truth is.
[00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:14.622]  They've also been staging or trying to stage missile systems in Poland for NATO.
[00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:19.264]  Russia had reasons to want to get rid of the aircraft.
[00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:35.030]  And one of the twins that ran the country, his brother was the Prime Minister, the Kaczynski twins, big TV movie actors, in Poland.
[00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:40.410]  So that is some of what is coming up today.
[00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.535]  Also, provocateurs openly announced plans to stage Tea Party violence and disruptions.
[00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:54.980]  This being different anarchist groups who always wear big communist red stars around their necks or red armbands.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.245]  They're communists who call themselves anarchists and who call for leftist policies and big government.
[00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:06.068]  With anarchists like these, who needs the sex pistols?
[00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:15.697]  This is about as pro-anarchy as Mao Zedong.
[00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:22.339]  And we've got the media and the whole system really gearing up to stage events against the Tea Parties.
[00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:25.620]  And now they're saying, we're Confederate soldiers terrorists.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.521]  I'm going to get into this today.
[00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.423]  I've also seen an article that equates Confederate soldiers to terrorists.
[00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:34.404]  Corporate media connects Atari members to U.S.
[00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:34.944]  military.
[00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:38.512]  So that demonization is in full swing.
[00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:39.672]  That's coming up.
[00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:41.293]  I want to get into the attack on the Internet.
[00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:50.116]  It's now crystal clear how governments worldwide are going after the Internet and why they need to start shutting down the Internet as we know it.
[00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.436]  That is all coming up.
[00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:58.578]  We'll also get into Obama's move for the replacement of Stevens and Ginsburg.
[00:04:58.578 --> 00:05:00.019]  Big news on the Supreme Court front.
[00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.479]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:06.054]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.054 --> 00:05:14.917]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:19.538]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.538 --> 00:05:30.362]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:40.511]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:45.956]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:53.442]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:56.205]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:02.564 --> 00:06:05.085]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:06.345]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:10.286]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.507]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.507 --> 00:06:18.388]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:24.630]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.016]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:35.220]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.504]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:45.449]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.392]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.954]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:52.075]  It's here.
[00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:58.901]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:07.569]  UtopiaSilver.com believes, as the Declaration of Independence states, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:16.756]  The only lawful purpose of any government is to protect and secure the rights of the people, and no man or government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God.
[00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:25.363]  Among these rights are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness, and America's government has ceased to be the protector of liberty and of the people's God-given rights.
[00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:29.787]  But we the people can return America to greatness if we are willing to stand
[00:07:29.787 --> 00:07:29.987]  I'm good.
[00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:06.385]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.667]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:13.704]  Okay, let me launch straight into the news.
[00:08:13.704 --> 00:08:14.564]  There's a lot of it.
[00:08:14.564 --> 00:08:16.965]  Obviously, it's extremely important.
[00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:23.188]  Many different factors are converging right now with the establishment of world government and the growing resistance to it.
[00:08:23.188 --> 00:08:36.093]  I also want to get into unbelievable developments across the board with the states going into bankruptcy, the counties, the cities going into bankruptcy, as the taxes only go up and up and as the services are cut.
[00:08:36.093 --> 00:08:39.014]  We are definitely being transformed into Mexico.
[00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:42.276]  We are definitely being transformed into Greece.
[00:08:42.276 --> 00:08:51.221]  We are definitely on the road to being totally taken over, like we've seen with hundreds of other countries in the last several centuries.
[00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:54.743]  This is economic warfare, toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[00:08:54.743 --> 00:09:00.967]  And if we can't identify who is doing this, we have no hope of reversing this trend.
[00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:03.469]  But the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:08.652]  I'm seeing mainstream news reports on CNN, MSNBC, Fox,
[00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:12.874]  Talking about criminal activity by the central banks.
[00:09:12.874 --> 00:09:15.395]  Discussing how they create money out of nothing.
[00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:17.236]  How they engineered the crisis.
[00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:21.697]  The media is now starting to admit, okay, you're not going to get free health care.
[00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:25.979]  This just cuts your care and basically raises your taxes.
[00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:32.862]  So, as the public begins to learn just how serious this is, the mainstream media is being forced.
[00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:41.944]  Not all the time, but at least a little bit to admit what's going on or they'll lose all credibility.
[00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:46.908]  And I want to go into a story that I mentioned yesterday, but into more detail.
[00:09:46.908 --> 00:09:49.050]  What your TV is telling you to do.
[00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:53.715]  And I coined the term over a decade ago, propaganda placement.
[00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:59.518]  They have now coined a term for what they've been doing for a long time, behavior placement.
[00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:16.609]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal, and it dovetails with Comcast's win over FCC reignites net neutrality debate, and also in England last week, digital economy bill, nine things you can't do anymore from CNET News.
[00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:36.446]  Cnet UK and Cnet of course is part of CBS so this is mainstream media admitting what's going on and it basically says the end of free speech, the end of the internet as we know it and they're now moving to do the exact same thing here in the United States.
[00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:37.647]  So when I read these articles
[00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:41.969]  This is from Executive Management Briefing.
[00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:43.869]  This is from CBS News.
[00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:45.870]  This is from Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.491]  This is not Alex Jones saying all of this.
[00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:55.993]  This is the mainstream media admitting what's going on, but reporting it dryly like it's no big deal.
[00:10:55.993 --> 00:11:00.074]  And I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to read the quotes today, a transcript from Glenn Beck.
[00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:07.967]  Last week, Glenn Beck, net neutrality pits free speech against free press.
[00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.472]  And he runs a straw man operation here.
[00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:31.256]  Hundreds and hundreds of people have filed in the last month, and the public comment period, where individuals can file, think tanks, law firms, universities, organizations, governments, corporations, hundreds and hundreds have filed.
[00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:34.198]  And it doesn't close until later in the month.
[00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:38.722]  What the 26th is the last day to be able to file.
[00:11:38.722 --> 00:11:45.389]  Glenn Beck went in and found one Marxist group that put a filing in and said it's a Marxist plan!
[00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:48.512]  Net neutrality is a Marxist plan!
[00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:49.433]  It's Marxist!
[00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:53.877]  That's abusing your listeners.
[00:11:53.877 --> 00:11:58.081]  That's treating your listeners and your viewers like morons.
[00:11:58.081 --> 00:11:59.683]  And that's why I can't stand Beck.
[00:11:59.683 --> 00:12:01.765]  I try to not watch him.
[00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:02.666]  I try to not listen.
[00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:03.747]  I try to not attack him.
[00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.369]  I just try to ignore it.
[00:12:05.369 --> 00:12:07.311]  But he is the leader.
[00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:12.436]  He's the biggest fish in the pond, posing as a patriot, and on every issue.
[00:12:13.328 --> 00:12:15.450]  He's for the value-added tax.
[00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.612]  And I got a call last night and I went and checked it.
[00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:22.115]  Sure enough, last week he was saying he's against the value-added tax now.
[00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:23.537]  Obama's value-added tax.
[00:12:23.537 --> 00:12:26.399]  He has his own value-added tax he wants.
[00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:31.003]  Look, shutting down the Internet is not conservative or libertarian.
[00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:37.175]  Pushing value-added taxes is not conservative or libertarian.
[00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:43.979]  Calling for the expansion of the Patriot Act and the police state of new wars is not constitutional.
[00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:46.880]  Alright, I'm not even going to go there yet.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.202]  When I cover this, I will.
[00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:54.865]  A little bit, but I've basically already covered that facet.
[00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:57.187]  Here's the New York Times headline.
[00:12:57.187 --> 00:13:01.729]  Kaczynski often a source of tension with EU.
[00:13:01.729 --> 00:13:02.390]  This was April 10th.
[00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:12.608]  One day before his airplane crashed.
[00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:16.351]  Or actually, the day it crashed.
[00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:26.041]  And it said, President Kaczynski, who died Saturday in a plane crash in Western Russia, rose from childhood fame as an actor to become president of Poland.
[00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:26.301]  He was 60.
[00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:42.652]  Half of an unusual tandem of power, Mr. Kaczynski was elected President in 2005 from the Nationalist Conservative Law and Justice Party, led by his identical twin, whom he later appointed Prime Minister.
[00:13:42.652 --> 00:13:55.542]  Now, Kaczynski had called for putting missile systems and radar, NATO systems, in Poland.
[00:13:55.542 --> 00:13:56.583]  That had angered Russia.
[00:13:59.022 --> 00:14:13.168]  But separately, in the last three weeks, his entire government began to figure out that almost all the supermarkets that were small or Polish-owned have shut down.
[00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:15.529]  Most of the Polish factories have shut down.
[00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:18.191]  In just a few years, they've been part of the European Union.
[00:14:19.444 --> 00:14:42.162]  And that basically this was a system for the private central banks to prey on Poland like Greece and Poland was next to be fully bankrupted and basically have all their tax money go to debt to the private banks like Nigeria or Greece or Argentina.
[00:14:42.162 --> 00:14:47.365]  And so they came out and began criticizing and said we're going to devalue our currency.
[00:14:48.775 --> 00:15:00.487]  Generally, that's not a good thing, but that would have been good for their own domestic farming and industry and construction.
[00:15:00.487 --> 00:15:08.636]  Because they really are an old-world country next to a fully developed, high-tech, first-world Western Europe.
[00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:12.577]  And they could not compete in this system.
[00:15:12.577 --> 00:15:22.826]  And having to have their currency tied to the Euro as part of EU integration was clearly destroying their economy and very unpopular.
[00:15:22.826 --> 00:15:30.293]  And so it didn't matter that Kaczynski was a lapdog of NATO and the New World Order.
[00:15:30.293 --> 00:15:37.419]  As soon as he began to become a true nationalist and do some things that were good for his people, he's dead.
[00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:47.084]  And there was a major split forming between the Kaczynski twins and his government and NATO and the West.
[00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:48.225]  And here's the headline.
[00:15:48.225 --> 00:15:51.448]  Kaczynski often a source of tension within the EU.
[00:15:51.448 --> 00:16:01.936]  And one big EU nation like Poland breaking off and doing what Iceland has done the last month and saying no would bring down the euro.
[00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:02.876]  And that's actually what
[00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.858]  George Soros is saying in Reuters today.
[00:16:07.858 --> 00:16:11.641]  Well, that problem is solved because Kaczynski is dead.
[00:16:11.641 --> 00:16:14.462]  And it could have been a malfunction in the aircraft.
[00:16:14.462 --> 00:16:17.244]  It could have been an accident.
[00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:17.824]  I don't know.
[00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:22.827]  I want to get Tarpley on the next few days to get his take.
[00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:26.168]  It could have been NATO and the EU killing him.
[00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:29.350]  They did announce that they were going to kick the bankers out last week, and he's dead.
[00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.391]  Five days later, he announced it last Monday.
[00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:32.732]  Five and a half days later, he's dead.
[00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:39.294]  Or it could have been the Russians.
[00:16:39.294 --> 00:16:48.421]  But why would they blow his plane up now when for the last five years he's been a thorn in their side and now he was beginning to get closer to Russia again?
[00:16:48.421 --> 00:16:50.502]  He was swinging back towards Russia.
[00:16:50.502 --> 00:16:51.002]  But Russia
[00:16:52.011 --> 00:17:10.507]  Could have said look, you've got almost the entire opposition to us from the Polish government on one airplane, over 100 government officials, right at 100, it's 100 counting the crew, they're saying 80 plus officials, and we cannot miss this opportunity, and they plant a small bomb
[00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:15.166]  Somewhere inside the aircraft to depressurize it or in fuel tanks.
[00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.788]  We don't know.
[00:17:16.788 --> 00:17:20.953]  But we do know the plane came in at an erratic, overdriven speed.
[00:17:20.953 --> 00:17:23.897]  It missed the runway three times.
[00:17:23.897 --> 00:17:26.341]  The pilot, it's confirmed, was dumping fuel.
[00:17:29.076 --> 00:17:33.597]  And the fact that NATO, the EU, and the Russians aren't releasing a lot of this information.
[00:17:33.597 --> 00:17:36.697]  We know there was some type of malfunction.
[00:17:36.697 --> 00:17:41.658]  There was fog on the airfield, reportedly, though I saw video of 30 minutes after and saw no fog.
[00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:44.819]  But fog can dissipate quickly.
[00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:49.220]  Just like they said with the senator from Minnesota.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.660]  That there was supposedly fog and snow, but there wasn't.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.521]  We know that guy was a big thorn in the side right when the war was kicking off.
[00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:07.244]  So all of this is going on and in comes the aircraft and crashes.
[00:18:07.244 --> 00:18:11.289]  Now I want to know why there isn't just a smoldering black hole in the ground.
[00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:17.538]  Because with Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, it's a hole in the ground and an engine five miles away.
[00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:29.449]  I want to know why it didn't disappear like Wiley Coyote when he's swinging from cliff to cliff and he just disappears into a rock face with a silhouette etched into the side.
[00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:45.883]  I want to know why when they blew up the old Cowboys Irving Stadium, why they didn't just light it on fire with a Bic lighter and why it didn't just collapse.
[00:18:48.342 --> 00:18:50.863]  Clock runs out for the Cowboys legend.
[00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:56.204]  Thousands cheer, reflect as Irving Icahn crumbles into lore.
[00:18:56.204 --> 00:19:04.885]  Texas stadiums, Cowboys fabled home field, now rubble within a minute.
[00:19:04.885 --> 00:19:16.848]  We're gonna pull some video of that up when we go live on TV and ask the question, why did it collapse into its own footprint?
[00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:22.959]  Why?
[00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:25.620]  Why didn't they just use a big lighter?
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.601]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane and it fell into its own footprint.
[00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:30.602]  How did this stadium fall into its own footprint?
[00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:34.984]  I mean, why did they need to use explosives?
[00:19:34.984 --> 00:19:40.466]  If you can just light something on fire, I mean, you just light a paper cup, put it up against a pillar, the whole stadium would fall down.
[00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:44.188]  Of course, it's asinine.
[00:19:44.188 --> 00:19:46.469]  But my gut tells me that NATO
[00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:49.854]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:04.364]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:04.076]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:04.076 --> 00:21:08.217]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:21:08.217 --> 00:21:10.477]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:10.477 --> 00:21:15.658]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:15.658 --> 00:21:17.479]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:19.019]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:20.499]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:23.560]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.245]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:29.245 --> 00:21:38.595]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:21:38.595 --> 00:21:40.917]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.221]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:03.118]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:03.118 --> 00:22:05.340]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.664]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.664 --> 00:22:13.769]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.769 --> 00:22:17.974]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:18.274 --> 00:22:20.735]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:23.496]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:26.418]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:26.418 --> 00:22:34.021]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:39.746]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.746 --> 00:22:42.608]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:46.291]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:47.372]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:47.372 --> 00:22:48.693]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.693 --> 00:22:50.215]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.270]  You worry.
[00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.291]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:05.832]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:23:05.832 --> 00:23:07.912]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:23:07.912 --> 00:23:09.533]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:13.114]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:23:13.114 --> 00:23:18.356]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:21.657]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:23:22.165 --> 00:23:23.846]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:23:23.846 --> 00:23:26.708]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:23:26.708 --> 00:23:30.010]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:38.456]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:23:38.456 --> 00:23:43.159]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:23:57.375 --> 00:24:04.639]  They came and took it all away.
[00:24:27.113 --> 00:24:33.296]  I don't think so.
[00:24:43.663 --> 00:24:44.763]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:24:44.763 --> 00:24:47.564]  You know, I'm going to get into the economy in the next segment.
[00:24:47.564 --> 00:24:57.187]  I want to finish up with the death of the senior leadership of the ruling party in Poland Saturday in a plane crash.
[00:24:57.187 --> 00:25:05.390]  Flying into Russia for a memorial of Stalinist purges.
[00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.551]  And I wanted to go back in time.
[00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:09.651]  Was Ron Brown assassinated?
[00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:11.272]  Remember they were flying into Serbia.
[00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:28.049]  Back in 1997, Ron Brown had told reporters, if I go down, he said, if I go down, he said, I'm going to take the administration with me.
[00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:45.483]  And he had been involved as the head of the Commerce Department, Commerce Secretary, in the Communist generals from China, corporations, the huge payoffs, Communist generals being given government offices, being given government codes.
[00:25:46.423 --> 00:25:52.090]  Just absolute sellout to the Communist Chinese by Bill Clinton.
[00:25:52.090 --> 00:26:03.783]  Missile secrets, MIRV technology, so that when an ICBM launches from northern China and comes over the ice caps to hit the United States, that's the shortest route.
[00:26:04.284 --> 00:26:07.866]  When it comes back into the atmosphere, the nose cone pops open.
[00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:13.809]  Instead of firing one nuclear weapon at a city, it can fire as many as 20.
[00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:30.777]  Or it can have 10 warheads and 10 dummies, so that even if you have anti-missile laser batteries, particle beam batteries, anti-missile missile batteries, missile-to-missile batteries, ground-to-air anti-missile systems, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:33.467]  That's the type of stuff they sold out to the Chinese.
[00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.336]  The computers, secrets, just everything.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:47.564]  And Ron Brown was in a lot of trouble, and his aircraft blew up and crashed into mountains, and then it was reported that many of the bodies had bullet holes in them.
[00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:49.925]  That was actually in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:49.925 --> 00:27:04.069]  Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Steve Cogswell, a medical doctor, forensic pathologist, and deputy medical examiner with the Air Force Institute of Pathology, has released photos and x-rays which show .45 caliber wounds in the head of
[00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:20.674]  The bodies of Mr. Brown and others.
[00:27:20.674 --> 00:27:27.456]  So we have all of this unfolding, and the media then came out and said that the Air Force were conspiracy theorists.
[00:27:27.456 --> 00:27:31.818]  Now, how would you shoot people in the head on board an aircraft?
[00:27:31.818 --> 00:27:31.998]  Well,
[00:27:33.854 --> 00:27:54.369]  They have the Hi-Lo and the He-Lo in different systems where special forces are trained to kill everybody on board an aircraft, depressurize, blow the door, remote control the aircraft into a designated target, and jump out and fly down to the ground, basically, with their parachutes.
[00:27:54.369 --> 00:27:56.790]  This is the type of hit that went on.
[00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.692]  People are like, well, why do they have bullet wounds in them?
[00:27:58.692 --> 00:27:59.773]  Why have they been shot up?
[00:28:00.723 --> 00:28:04.825]  And so, something similar could have been done on board this aircraft.
[00:28:04.825 --> 00:28:09.728]  That's just one of the ways that they could have killed the Polish senior leadership.
[00:28:09.728 --> 00:28:19.973]  And it could have been an inside job from their own government, or it could have been pilot error and a malfunction, and so he missed the airfield four times in the fog, and on the fourth time came in and crashed and everybody was killed.
[00:28:19.973 --> 00:28:22.774]  But I'm basically done talking about that now, at least for now.
[00:28:22.774 --> 00:28:26.576]  We'll get Tarpley on to pop in for 30 minutes or so in the next few days to
[00:28:28.988 --> 00:28:29.808]  To discuss that.
[00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:54.980]  If you hear any construction noise during the show, I've told them not to be held up by the fact that we're about 60, 70 yards away from where they're building, but it is part of the same complex, and you can actually hear them with huge drills putting metal pylons in for part of the construction, so if I sound distracted,
[00:28:56.695 --> 00:29:00.217]  I don't know if you can hear it, but we've been having this problem the last few weeks.
[00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:12.023]  The city and zoning and other issues and permits held us up for almost six months, but the studio is now rapidly being built and should be done in the next month and a half or so.
[00:29:13.044 --> 00:29:16.226]  So we're very, very excited about that.
[00:29:16.226 --> 00:29:24.472]  When we come back, the strange case of the Naked Body Scanner protest contest.
[00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:31.758]  $15,000, three prizes, one for $10,000, another contest for $3,000, and a third contest for $2,000.
[00:29:31.758 --> 00:29:38.062]  I have been saying we've had past contests, and these have been incredible successes,
[00:29:39.847 --> 00:29:42.730]  Why have we only had a handful, maybe 10-15 entries?
[00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:49.316]  Well, I got my answer last night when I became very suspicious that no entries were coming in.
[00:29:49.316 --> 00:29:50.217]  We discovered what happened.
[00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:51.118]  We'll tell you when we come back.
[00:29:51.118 --> 00:29:52.379]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.379 --> 00:29:54.901]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.901 --> 00:29:57.584]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:04.493]  And you're subject to public police action.
[00:30:04.493 --> 00:30:05.754]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.754 --> 00:30:09.476]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.476 --> 00:30:11.918]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:11.918 --> 00:30:17.782]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:24.026]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:30.429]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:34.590]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:38.892]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.892 --> 00:30:44.834]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:48.396]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.396 --> 00:30:50.357]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.357 --> 00:30:50.797]  It's here.

[00:31:01.553 --> 00:31:05.496]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.757]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.757 --> 00:31:10.699]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.699 --> 00:31:12.921]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:18.785]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:31:18.785 --> 00:31:24.989]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:31.431]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:35.614]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:35.614 --> 00:31:39.897]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:45.862]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:48.804]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:51.369]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:52.491]  It's here.

[00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:01.600]  Attention!
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:16.959]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:18.461]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silicone,
[00:32:19.602 --> 00:32:20.162]  I think so.
[00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.672]  I was a highway man Along the coach roads I did ride
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:33.636]  With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.062]  All right, we're back live.
[00:33:38.062 --> 00:33:42.626]  I'm gonna get into the global economy or national economy.
[00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:48.051]  The private central bank's announcing, look, the 28 trillion we've stolen isn't enough the last year and a half.
[00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:53.036]  We want value-added taxes, sales taxes, green taxes on every facet of your life.
[00:33:53.036 --> 00:33:57.439]  And we're gonna say who can have a business, who can have a factory, and who can't.
[00:33:57.439 --> 00:33:58.040]  This is a
[00:33:59.401 --> 00:34:02.524]  Classical despotism that's being set up.
[00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:09.229]  We'll also get into the attacks on the internet and free speech now taking very clear form and shape.
[00:34:09.229 --> 00:34:15.313]  Another name on President Obama's Supreme Court shortlist is Janet Napolitano.
[00:34:15.313 --> 00:34:17.735]  Total police state thug.
[00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:19.236]  She wants naked body scanners.
[00:34:19.236 --> 00:34:20.417]  She wants the Patriot Act.
[00:34:20.417 --> 00:34:22.379]  She wants secret arrest and torture.
[00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:25.081]  She agrees with all the things that Bush's people did.
[00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:29.405]  And so now she is being empowered.
[00:34:29.405 --> 00:34:36.429]  We got Cass Sunstein, White House regulations are openly calling for an end to free speech, arresting people that criticize the government.
[00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:37.770]  He's on the list.
[00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:43.072]  No doubt about these tyranny-filled individuals and where they're going.
[00:34:43.072 --> 00:34:44.593]  Okay.
[00:34:44.593 --> 00:34:49.856]  So, about a month ago, we launched the Naked Body Scanner protest officially.
[00:34:51.603 --> 00:35:11.657]  And $10,000 for the best public protest, and then you've got to shoot video of that against the naked body scanners, or you could produce your own theatrical piece illustrating it, or your own cartoon, your own animated... I mean, the sky was the limit.
[00:35:11.657 --> 00:35:12.558]  You could do whatever you wanted.
[00:35:13.407 --> 00:35:20.270]  And then there was a second prize for 3,000 for the best poster contest against naked body scanners.
[00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:27.193]  And then of course you had to post those in public areas that were legal and lawful and videotape that and then post it to the web.
[00:35:27.193 --> 00:35:31.314]  That way the people see the posters you put up locally, local news covers it.
[00:35:31.314 --> 00:35:37.577]  We're now getting news stations calling us from Shreveport, Louisiana and other cities where these are popping up all over the place.
[00:35:37.577 --> 00:35:42.039]  Then the video you post to the web, people get the message, then other people get the idea.
[00:35:42.699 --> 00:35:48.080]  And see how powerful it is to leaflet and pamphlet their area on whatever political issue.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.722]  We're educating the public how to take effective action at a guerrilla information warfare level.
[00:35:53.722 --> 00:36:04.884]  And then the third prize is $2,000 for the best video taking my past predictions and showing how it has come true.
[00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:10.266]  Because I don't have the staff, the money, the time to mark down all the predictions we've made, how accurate they've been.
[00:36:11.306 --> 00:36:22.610]  That's important to then show the uninitiated, those that weren't listening to the show a year ago or five years ago, who weren't listening and don't know that I predicted much of what's now happening.
[00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:28.933]  This is a way to show them that we know what we're talking about and is a great way to inform people.
[00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:38.136]  I can't tell you how many folks told me they woke up because they were listening to my radio show in July and August leading up to 9-11 eight years ago.
[00:36:41.724 --> 00:36:53.355]  And I can't tell you how many people were watching my Axios TV show that it re-aired several times where I predicted they would blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their CIA asset Osama Bin Laden.
[00:36:53.355 --> 00:36:58.320]  That woke a lot of people up seeing me make that prediction and then seeing it actually happen.
[00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:03.072]  Now, we've had, I don't know, three other contests in the past.
[00:37:03.072 --> 00:37:09.457]  They have all been incredibly, wildly, unbelievably successful.
[00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:13.520]  The most successful was the Obama poster contest.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:25.990]  We put out the posters, told people they should post them, just as a political idea to point out that Obama is a tyrant, not a saint, a jokerized image of Obama.
[00:37:27.037 --> 00:37:29.538]  Same thing was done with Bush, and we supported that.
[00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:33.580]  And the media started saying, this is racist, this is evil, this is bad.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.101]  Trying to demonize free speech.
[00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:36.982]  You can't be against government-run healthcare.
[00:37:36.982 --> 00:37:38.463]  You can't be against banker bailouts.
[00:37:38.463 --> 00:37:40.224]  You can't be against open borders.
[00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:42.885]  You can't be against anti-Second Amendment legislation.
[00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:43.706]  You're racist.
[00:37:43.706 --> 00:37:50.769]  Trying to play the race card to create racial divisions and to divide the country against ourselves while the elite rule over us.
[00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:51.790]  Divide and conquer.
[00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:52.870]  Balkanization.
[00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.511]  The great game.
[00:37:56.351 --> 00:37:59.954]  And so, we had the contest on, what was it, $5,000 for the best video?
[00:38:05.189 --> 00:38:06.570]  of people posting signs.
[00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:15.075]  It was on hundreds of TV stations, hundreds of newspapers in the US, in Japan, in England, in Mexico, in Brazil.
[00:38:15.075 --> 00:38:20.658]  I mean, it was just all over a huge, gigantic, devastating success.
[00:38:20.658 --> 00:38:26.802]  InfoWars.com got posted everywhere, images of Obama as the Joker, and the media went from saying,
[00:38:27.102 --> 00:38:33.824]  We're gonna arrest you if you do this, and is this terrorism to just shutting up about it and saying, okay, it's your right to free speech?
[00:38:33.824 --> 00:38:48.889]  Because when they tried to oppress people, and actually arrested a few people who were posting these in Florida and other areas, it blew up in their face, and everybody started going out and posting more of the signs, and they got smart and backed off.
[00:38:48.889 --> 00:38:51.270]  The establishment got smart and backed off.
[00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.711]  Because they knew this was turning into something mega-huge, not just huge.
[00:38:56.198 --> 00:38:59.300]  So, we've had our, I guess, fourth contest in the last few years.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.903]  $15,000 in prizes.
[00:39:02.903 --> 00:39:10.569]  You know, never had any type of contest with this much money on the line.
[00:39:10.569 --> 00:39:15.152]  And we literally probably got, I don't know, 15 entries.
[00:39:16.249 --> 00:39:24.415]  And then I was talking to Watson last week and he said, Alex, I've got people sending me contest videos because as the videos come in, we post them.
[00:39:24.415 --> 00:39:31.060]  As the flyers come in, we post them to create a snowball domino effect where other people see it and decide to join the contest.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.361]  And we had nothing to promote.
[00:39:33.226 --> 00:39:39.150]  Well, an example of how computers are great, but computers can also give you a blind spot.
[00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.473]  We have spam software on our email system.
[00:39:43.473 --> 00:39:49.397]  So if it sees the same term over and over and over and over and over again, it begins to block it.
[00:39:49.397 --> 00:39:52.580]  Or if it has a term like naked in it, it's
[00:39:54.011 --> 00:40:00.398]  Software we bought, and it's similar software that blocks InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:11.910]  There's all these software packages, they sell governments, they sell corporations, they now want to install internet wide in the US, England's now moving to do it, Italy's doing it, Australia's moving to do it.
[00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.253]  This shows you how easy they can curtail the web.
[00:40:15.117 --> 00:40:18.460]  I mean, on the average software, they've got thousands of terms.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.022]  Now they're trying to add hundreds of thousands of terms.
[00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:35.916]  Because people put naked body scanner protest video contest entry in there, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of the contest videos went into the junk folder, went into the trash folder.
[00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:40.840]  And last night I was sitting here, it was the day after the contest closed, April 10th,
[00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:45.144]  It was April 11th, and I'm saying something is wrong.
[00:40:45.144 --> 00:40:52.251]  There's no way every one of our other contests has been a giant success, and we're not getting any entries.
[00:40:52.251 --> 00:40:54.453]  Normally, most of the entries come in the last three or four days.
[00:40:55.273 --> 00:41:03.935]  We went and looked in the junk folder that we didn't have access to, it was deeper in the system, and there were hundreds and hundreds of videos.
[00:41:03.935 --> 00:41:06.375]  Incredible videos!
[00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:07.995]  Amazing videos!
[00:41:07.995 --> 00:41:10.256]  Off the chart, powerful!
[00:41:10.256 --> 00:41:19.537]  Protests, demonstrations, groups of actors getting together, building whole airport sets.
[00:41:19.537 --> 00:41:22.238]  I salute you, I commend you, I thank you.
[00:41:22.238 --> 00:41:23.058]  Now here's the problem.
[00:41:24.016 --> 00:41:28.761]  If I post, and we've been going through these since last night, we already have over a hundred.
[00:41:28.761 --> 00:41:29.902]  And there's hundreds more to go through.
[00:41:29.902 --> 00:41:31.724]  And I've got a limited staff.
[00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:36.842]  If we post, say, 30-40 videos at a time, no one's going to watch them.
[00:41:36.842 --> 00:41:40.385]  They'll watch the first few and they'll get a few 10,000 hits.
[00:41:40.385 --> 00:41:45.149]  If I had time every day to just post one of these, each one would get hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:58.921]  That's the whole point of the contest, is to create a viral swell, a viral, but a good viral, stream of anti-naked body scanner videos to overturn this system.
[00:42:00.393 --> 00:42:02.434]  And to teach people how to be political activists.
[00:42:02.434 --> 00:42:10.896]  So now, I've got to, all this week, maybe into next week, dole out the videos.
[00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:11.677]  Dole them out.
[00:42:11.677 --> 00:42:27.262]  Maybe 10, 15 a day, and then it's up to you to go up to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, grab the videos, post them on your site, get them out to everybody, because people put a lot of work into this, so that it has the main effect.
[00:42:28.291 --> 00:42:30.653]  But thank God we discovered the problem.
[00:42:30.653 --> 00:42:37.179]  So I apologize that that happened, but that's just what, you know, goes on and happens when you're getting flooded with thousands of emails a day.
[00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:41.023]  But you live, you learn.
[00:42:41.023 --> 00:42:50.832]  And so, number one, I had said that we had to have your entry by the end of April 10th, or Saturday night.
[00:42:50.832 --> 00:42:51.313]  Had to be in.
[00:42:53.502 --> 00:43:01.368]  And I had also said that I would then judge them in the next five days and announce the winner on Thursday.
[00:43:01.368 --> 00:43:03.290]  I will not announce the winner this Thursday.
[00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.092]  I will announce it next Thursday.
[00:43:06.092 --> 00:43:10.015]  A, because I need to dole these videos out so they all get seen by people.
[00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:16.440]  Again, if I post a hundred and something at one time, no one's going to watch but the top few.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.842]  It's like giving people 20 books to read in one day.
[00:43:18.842 --> 00:43:19.443]  You can't do it.
[00:43:21.289 --> 00:43:23.591]  And it's a chore just to watch them, and they're so good.
[00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:25.332]  There's so many of them.
[00:43:25.332 --> 00:43:30.216]  So we're going to dole these out this week and through the first few days of next week.
[00:43:30.216 --> 00:43:38.803]  Every day you'll see videos and posters and the incredible work of our listeners posted in this contest.
[00:43:38.803 --> 00:43:40.445]  And that'll also give me more time.
[00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:43.098]  To try to watch them all.
[00:43:43.098 --> 00:43:45.779]  I spent hours last night when I got home trying to watch them.
[00:43:45.779 --> 00:43:48.560]  I mean, there are just so many, and they're so good.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:56.122]  And so we will announce the winner, not this Thursday, but next Thursday, of the three contests, because we have to go through hundreds of videos.
[00:43:56.122 --> 00:44:01.724]  We would have had the last few weeks as they came in to watch them, but they were going into a computer black hole.
[00:44:01.724 --> 00:44:07.786]  Now we found them in the black hole, we found the pot of gold in the InfoWar, but now we need to
[00:44:09.366 --> 00:44:19.290]  Not just go to the first bar we see with a pot of gold and just, you know, pour this down the gullets of the first people we see.
[00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.511]  We've got to make sure we don't squander this political gold.
[00:44:22.511 --> 00:44:27.113]  We've got to make sure it's deployed properly out there to the people.
[00:44:27.113 --> 00:44:31.614]  So, I had been complaining the last few weeks about, I don't know why we're not getting any entries.
[00:44:31.614 --> 00:44:35.436]  I don't know why this is such a disaster.
[00:44:35.436 --> 00:44:37.216]  I don't know why the few entries we've gotten are
[00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:43.070]  Not as good as what we've seen in the past.
[00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.230]  Some are pretty good.
[00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:50.613]  Well now, let me tell you, this is a bigger success than anything we've ever done, as far as the content goes.
[00:44:50.613 --> 00:44:53.934]  As far as the material goes.
[00:44:53.934 --> 00:44:58.396]  But it is the biggest failure we've ever had via deployment.
[00:44:58.396 --> 00:45:00.357]  But we're going to fix that now.
[00:45:00.357 --> 00:45:01.997]  And you're going to help us fix that.
[00:45:01.997 --> 00:45:04.938]  Because Kurt Nimmo in the next hour is going to post 10 or 15 entries.
[00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:09.575]  This doesn't mean these are the best entries or the worst entries.
[00:45:09.575 --> 00:45:15.137]  It just is the first 15 out of the 100 pluses that we've already plowed through since last night.
[00:45:15.137 --> 00:45:18.239]  We've got hundreds more to plow through.
[00:45:18.239 --> 00:45:25.122]  And so every day on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, right through the weekend, right through Tuesday, I've got to cut it off then.
[00:45:26.672 --> 00:45:42.557]  Uh, and then I'll pick the ten I think are the best and repost those for extra attention, and I will announce the winners not this Thursday, but next Thursday, for all three of the amazing contest entries.
[00:45:42.557 --> 00:45:47.838]  Okay, I just spent about eight minutes on that, but it's very, very, very important.
[00:45:50.686 --> 00:45:52.047]  So, I never doubted you.
[00:45:52.047 --> 00:45:53.128]  I mean, it was a real mystery.
[00:45:53.128 --> 00:45:56.810]  I'm like, why have the other contests been such raging successes?
[00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.052]  Why is this such a dud?
[00:46:00.052 --> 00:46:02.514]  It's not a dud.
[00:46:02.514 --> 00:46:02.894]  Not a dud.
[00:46:04.522 --> 00:46:06.444]  And I apologize, but it's really nobody's fault.
[00:46:06.444 --> 00:46:08.206]  It's just you live, you learn.
[00:46:08.206 --> 00:46:09.848]  And I commend everyone.
[00:46:09.848 --> 00:46:14.532]  And I just want to say incredible, incredible, incredible job.
[00:46:14.532 --> 00:46:22.641]  There's a whole bunch of them that are people with hidden cameras in the airports showing police abuse and harassment of citizens.
[00:46:22.641 --> 00:46:23.461]  There's videos.
[00:46:24.841 --> 00:46:33.346]  Where they set up naked body scanners on the side of the road, mock naked body scanners and illustrate this to the public that they're coming to the streets near you.
[00:46:33.346 --> 00:46:34.407]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:46:34.407 --> 00:46:37.569]  I mean, I can't believe the quality of these.
[00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:41.971]  It's just so many good ones, so many great ones, so many amazing ones.
[00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:42.792]  So I thank you.
[00:46:42.792 --> 00:46:44.312]  I salute you.
[00:46:44.312 --> 00:46:45.993]  I appreciate you.
[00:46:45.993 --> 00:46:48.335]  And again, just amazing job.
[00:46:54.255 --> 00:46:59.538]  Okay, let's get into the economy now.
[00:46:59.538 --> 00:47:02.220]  Here's just a smattering of the articles in front of me.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:02.520]  U.S.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.281]  faces difficult tax choices.
[00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:10.805]  Bernanke says we must raise taxes or the economy will implode.
[00:47:10.805 --> 00:47:12.506]  So we're being held hostage.
[00:47:12.506 --> 00:47:13.126]  Here's another one.
[00:47:13.126 --> 00:47:16.728]  Klamath Falls may try four-day school week to save money.
[00:47:16.728 --> 00:47:19.390]  Seattle Times.
[00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:23.332]  All over the country they're announcing public employees
[00:47:26.274 --> 00:47:30.837]  Government employees have to work five days a week but be paid for four.
[00:47:30.837 --> 00:47:36.221]  Police departments are laying off in many cities and counties more than half their officers or sheriff's deputies.
[00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:39.304]  But the taxes only go up, see?
[00:47:39.304 --> 00:47:40.965]  This is what it's like to be a slave.
[00:47:40.965 --> 00:47:42.206]  This is tyranny.
[00:47:42.206 --> 00:47:43.887]  Everything goes to the bankers.
[00:47:43.887 --> 00:47:48.931]  Klamath Falls may try four-day school week to save money.
[00:47:48.931 --> 00:47:54.395]  CNN Money reports 33 states out of money to fund jobless benefits.
[00:47:57.722 --> 00:48:01.464]  Ohio officials tell residents to arm themselves amid police cuts.
[00:48:01.464 --> 00:48:08.207]  They've cut from 112 sheriff's deputies to 49 sheriff's deputies.
[00:48:08.207 --> 00:48:12.349]  A rise in violent crime evokes City's Unruly Past, New York Times.
[00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:15.510]  Total gun ban for the citizens in New York.
[00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.331]  Their crime rate just explodes.
[00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:23.114]  And their answer will be more cops to take more guns from innocent citizens.
[00:48:23.114 --> 00:48:25.695]  Greek bonds drop a seventh day.
[00:48:25.695 --> 00:48:25.775]  Bond
[00:48:28.507 --> 00:48:34.652]  Spread widens on budget woes out of Bloomberg.
[00:48:34.652 --> 00:48:38.355]  Soros warns Europe of disintegration.
[00:48:38.355 --> 00:48:40.256]  But that's not as big a problem now.
[00:48:40.256 --> 00:48:44.259]  Poland isn't going to pull out of the Euro because the President's dead.
[00:48:44.259 --> 00:48:48.182]  He announced last week they weren't going to go along with the Euro and were going to devalue their currency.
[00:48:48.182 --> 00:48:49.883]  That means getting out of the Euro.
[00:48:49.883 --> 00:48:53.546]  And he went, bye-bye, bye-bye, Bertie.
[00:48:53.546 --> 00:48:54.407]  Bye-bye.
[00:48:54.407 --> 00:48:56.729]  I'm sure it's just an accent, of course.
[00:48:59.251 --> 00:49:08.059]  World stocks drop as Greek debt crisis intensifies.
[00:49:08.059 --> 00:49:08.739]  There's another one.
[00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:13.043]  Greece in market storm as debt fears hit fever pitch.
[00:49:13.043 --> 00:49:14.825]  That's French News Agency.
[00:49:14.825 --> 00:49:15.465]  There's another one.
[00:49:15.465 --> 00:49:19.489]  New York Times interest rates have nowhere to go but up.
[00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:19.949]  That's right.
[00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:23.533]  The bankers gave you all that quote free credit.
[00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:24.654]  Low credit.
[00:49:27.014 --> 00:49:29.536]  And now they're jacking the credit cards up, in many cases about 30%.
[00:49:29.536 --> 00:49:32.319]  They're jacking up all the other interest rates.
[00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:35.722]  But the bankers still get 0% money.
[00:49:35.722 --> 00:49:39.105]  And then when the government borrows it from the private banks, out of nothing...
[00:49:41.198 --> 00:49:59.978]  The government then raises taxes on you, which further destroys the economy, and makes more people go bankrupt and go on welfare, which further bankrupts the government, and as the states go bankrupt, they go deeper into debt to the federal government, itself in debt to the bankers, and we wake up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[00:49:59.978 --> 00:50:02.440]  The plan is going superbly.
[00:50:03.562 --> 00:50:05.243]  Superbly.
[00:50:05.243 --> 00:50:09.044]  And the Republican leadership won't tell you it's the bankers raping you and the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:09.044 --> 00:50:11.385]  The Democrats won't tell you that.
[00:50:11.385 --> 00:50:15.867]  They won't tell you the insurance companies are owned by the same private big eight banks.
[00:50:15.867 --> 00:50:19.909]  Really, it's big four, but there's a few other large ones.
[00:50:19.909 --> 00:50:21.089]  Six one way, half dozen another.
[00:50:21.089 --> 00:50:25.211]  Let's just say the top global 15 banks.
[00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.772]  Not in the U.S., it's really less than eight.
[00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:30.623]  And, uh, everything is going superbly right now.
[00:50:30.623 --> 00:50:44.312]  And, of course, they won't tell you that it's the insurance companies owned by the banks that just are gonna force now 30-plus million Americans to buy their overpriced healthcare, and they get to cut the quality of the care, and cut what the doctors are paid, so more doctors will leave, but it doesn't matter.
[00:50:45.439 --> 00:50:47.800]  Everything is going wonderful.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.142]  Schenectady mayor considers options martial law over police laws.
[00:50:52.142 --> 00:50:55.244]  Oh, we don't have police anymore, we'll just put the army on the streets.
[00:50:55.244 --> 00:50:59.426]  And we've been quietly conditioned all these years to have military on the streets.
[00:51:01.494 --> 00:51:07.499]  You can't live without food, can't live without water, you can't live without being prepared, and you can't live without StandBirds.

[00:52:00.871 --> 00:52:03.174]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.174 --> 00:52:05.477]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:08.802]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.802 --> 00:52:13.908]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.908 --> 00:52:18.114]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.414 --> 00:52:20.755]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.755 --> 00:52:23.636]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.636 --> 00:52:26.558]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.558 --> 00:52:34.161]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.481 --> 00:52:39.882]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.882 --> 00:52:42.723]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.723 --> 00:52:46.423]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.423 --> 00:52:47.504]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.504 --> 00:52:48.844]  You're everyone else.

[00:53:59.137 --> 00:53:59.597]  It works!
[00:54:14.299 --> 00:54:33.491]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real
[00:54:35.595 --> 00:54:39.258]  The needle tears the hole.
[00:54:39.258 --> 00:54:41.099]  The old familiar pain.
[00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:45.142]  The old familiar sting.
[00:54:45.142 --> 00:54:45.802]  Try to kill it.
[00:54:45.802 --> 00:54:49.685]  Try to kill it all away.
[00:54:49.685 --> 00:54:50.866]  But I remember.
[00:54:50.866 --> 00:54:55.809]  But I remember everything.
[00:54:55.809 --> 00:54:56.850]  We are back live.
[00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:02.794]  I'm going to get back into the economy and then open the phones up for your calls on any subject you wish to discuss.
[00:55:02.794 --> 00:55:04.195]  The toll free number to join us is 800-
[00:55:06.974 --> 00:55:18.120]  I want to break down how this implosion of the economy is going to unfold and how it's been done in countless countries over and over again.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:28.286]  This is a tried and trusted system of economic slash military domination.
[00:55:28.286 --> 00:55:33.989]  But it is now time for individuals out there
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.161]  To choose sides.
[00:55:39.161 --> 00:55:44.844]  You're a cop, you're in the military, you're a bureaucrat, you're a business owner, you're a school teacher.
[00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:46.484]  It's time to get smart.
[00:55:46.484 --> 00:56:02.891]  It's time to face the facts, get out of denial, world government's out in the open, it's all admitted, tyranny's being set up, it's scientific, it's incremental, and whether, and I say this a lot, but I want it to really sink in.
[00:56:04.178 --> 00:56:16.903]  Whether you see yourself with the New World Order or not, in 99.99% of the time, you are targeted by the globalists as well.
[00:56:16.903 --> 00:56:26.488]  You are compartmentalized, you are brainwashed, you're downloaded through the media and the culture, a false paradigm.
[00:56:26.488 --> 00:56:29.569]  And then you play out your role in that niche.
[00:56:32.674 --> 00:56:37.759]  The New World Order is not good for you.
[00:56:37.759 --> 00:56:42.024]  And this is an incredible adventure we're living in right now.
[00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:49.171]  When the destiny of humanity is truly being charted and the choice is being made by all of us.
[00:56:49.171 --> 00:56:53.736]  That's a lot more important than basketball or Las Vegas or partying or acting cool.
[00:56:58.632 --> 00:57:01.574]  And you know, people ask me constantly, they say, what's the biggest solution?
[00:57:01.574 --> 00:57:02.474]  What's the biggest solution?
[00:57:02.474 --> 00:57:08.498]  We talk about states' rights, and we talk about sovereignty, and we talk about suing corrupt government officials.
[00:57:08.498 --> 00:57:12.120]  But the biggest issue is education.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.401]  People are now ready to be awakened.
[00:57:14.401 --> 00:57:16.223]  People now know something's wrong.
[00:57:16.223 --> 00:57:18.424]  They're ready to hear the truth.
[00:57:18.424 --> 00:57:19.965]  You see the indicators of that everywhere.
[00:57:21.553 --> 00:57:24.755]  And I always say, my films are one of the best tools.
[00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:26.876]  I mean, how many of you were woken up by my films?
[00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:30.919]  How many people have you woken up with my documentaries?
[00:57:30.919 --> 00:57:36.302]  A film like Fall of the Republic is life and death.
[00:57:36.302 --> 00:57:42.926]  It shows you who the bankers are, how they're operating, what their master plan is, what they're currently doing, how they're criminal, and how to stop them.
[00:57:43.979 --> 00:57:49.203]  Somebody watches that two-hour, twenty-minute film, they understand the whole ball of wax!
[00:57:49.203 --> 00:57:55.347]  All the propaganda, all the brainwashing of their life, they're given the truth!
[00:57:55.347 --> 00:58:00.070]  Take Common Sense, put out by Thomas Paine.
[00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.791]  People don't really read anymore.
[00:58:01.791 --> 00:58:06.755]  And these videos, these documentaries, are the Common Sense pamphlets of 1774, 1775, 1776, in 2010.
[00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:27.163]  And so I tell you again, go to InfoWars.com, order the highest quality DVDs, order Invisible Empire, order Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA, make copies of them and get them out to everyone you know, especially Fall of the Republic.
[00:58:27.163 --> 00:58:30.245]  I mean, I watched that film and I can't believe I made it, it's so powerful.
[00:58:30.245 --> 00:58:31.526]  But it's just the truth.
[00:58:31.526 --> 00:58:33.327]  And we chart the whole thing.
[00:58:33.327 --> 00:58:36.350]  Now is the time to expose these globalists.
[00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:38.892]  Now is the time to get these films out.
[00:58:38.892 --> 00:58:39.692]  This is history.
[00:58:42.679 --> 00:58:46.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.901]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.901 --> 00:58:57.542]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:57.542 --> 00:59:02.683]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.683 --> 00:59:09.425]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:15.480]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.803]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:59:19.718 --> 00:59:24.501]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:28.323]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:59:28.323 --> 00:59:29.564]  Others don't.
[00:59:29.564 --> 00:59:31.706]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:31.706 --> 00:59:33.507]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.507 --> 00:59:36.389]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:40.471]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:48.076]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:59:48.076 --> 00:59:48.937]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.815 --> 00:59:56.217]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.217 --> 01:00:06.423]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.423 --> 01:00:07.724]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.724 --> 01:00:09.505]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.266]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.266 --> 01:00:12.847]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.847 --> 01:00:13.628]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.372 --> 01:00:18.575]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.575 --> 01:00:22.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:45.965]  We are now into the second hour.
[01:00:45.965 --> 01:00:54.134]  We have Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer of Able Danger joining us via video Skype from Ireland, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:00:54.134 --> 01:01:00.381]  And in the last hour, Jim Tucker has discovered the location of Bilderberg 2010 in Spain.
[01:01:00.381 --> 01:01:02.643]  He'll have a lot of important intel for us.
[01:01:03.524 --> 01:01:09.654]  He is the omnibudsman, the great-grandfather of the anti-Bilderberg movement.
[01:01:09.654 --> 01:01:15.864]  He covered it for 20-plus years when they were still denying it even existed, and writing articles about him saying it was insane.
[01:01:17.372 --> 01:01:32.616]  I just had the New York Times last year write an article saying that Bilderberg Group didn't exist, and then I was out in Chantilly in 2008 in Virginia, having a full schizophrenic breakdown, and there were no men with sunglasses, no black sedans, no hotel.
[01:01:32.616 --> 01:01:36.237]  I was just completely insane.
[01:01:36.237 --> 01:01:42.199]  Kind of like the news announces world government on one program, and the next program comes on and says, kooks believe in it, it doesn't exist.
[01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:46.660]  They say, we're taking over with world government, but if you don't like it, it doesn't exist, and you're evil.
[01:01:52.534 --> 01:01:54.195]  Let's go ahead and go to William in New York.
[01:01:54.195 --> 01:01:57.015]  William, you're on the air.
[01:01:57.015 --> 01:01:58.636]  Wilson, go ahead.
[01:01:58.636 --> 01:02:00.136]  Yeah, good afternoon.
[01:02:00.136 --> 01:02:02.297]  Alex, it's Wilson.
[01:02:02.297 --> 01:02:04.958]  I don't only get the chance to call, but I'm glad I'm the first caller.
[01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:05.558]  I'm very special.
[01:02:05.558 --> 01:02:06.939]  I feel special.
[01:02:06.939 --> 01:02:15.341]  I just want to start off by saying I'm so glad that throughout time, you know, at first I always trusted in what you said and always believed what you said.
[01:02:15.341 --> 01:02:16.202]  You know, I remember on 9-11,
[01:02:17.729 --> 01:02:19.570]  I've seen what you have to say about it.
[01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.470]  And some people say, no it's wrong.
[01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:23.651]  And I had a feeling in my heart it was right.
[01:02:23.651 --> 01:02:25.991]  And then with global warming, you're saying it's wrong.
[01:02:25.991 --> 01:02:28.172]  And people say, how could you say global warming is fake?
[01:02:28.172 --> 01:02:29.652]  Are you crazy?
[01:02:29.652 --> 01:02:37.374]  And then like, throughout time, just the knowledge and the facts, everything just brought me to knowing that everything was true.
[01:02:37.374 --> 01:02:42.756]  And my wife, I always try to make her study, you know, the more important things.
[01:02:42.756 --> 01:02:45.257]  But then she gets sidetracked by this 2012, 2012.
[01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:51.671]  What do you personally think about the end of the world in 2012?
[01:02:51.671 --> 01:03:03.800]  My next film, after I put out the next Fall of the Republic that's in production right now, the next film I'm going to make is going to be on the 2012 hoax.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.261]  And so it is a hoax.
[01:03:09.699 --> 01:03:17.445]  But within the hoax, the system is planning to stage all sorts of calamities and crises.
[01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:26.192]  And the globalists have said for more than 50 years that 2012 is a very important number to them because they're obsessed with numerology and with astrology.
[01:03:26.192 --> 01:03:29.974]  And so it's a very important date for a cultist globally.
[01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:31.375]  But if you look at the Mayan calendar,
[01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:36.657]  They just believe that's the end of an age and a new hearth is lit.
[01:03:36.657 --> 01:03:39.058]  And you know, the sun is the hearth.
[01:03:39.058 --> 01:03:42.619]  And so that a new age is beginning, it doesn't mean the end of the world.
[01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:44.220]  So that's a lie as well.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:51.642]  Even if you believe that what the Mayans are saying is true, and that it has some validity, when you actually look at what they said, it isn't.
[01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.389]  Okay, okay.
[01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:23.562]  And I was going to say, I know you're going to have an upcoming interview with Ron Paul for an hour.
[01:04:23.562 --> 01:04:35.892]  I was going to say, if you could ask him this question for me, if he would have won the presidential election in 2008, who would he have chosen as Secretary of Treasury and so forth?
[01:04:35.892 --> 01:04:37.533]  That's a great question.
[01:04:37.533 --> 01:04:43.038]  So when Ron Paul's back on in the near future, we'll get that nailed down.
[01:04:43.038 --> 01:04:44.779]  I appreciate your call, good to hear from you.
[01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:46.321]  Alright, we're going to come back.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.607]  You know, now I've really put my foot in it because 2012 is such a big issue.
[01:04:51.607 --> 01:04:53.752]  You ask me what I think of it, I tell you.
[01:04:53.752 --> 01:04:57.780]  And I'd rather cover a big subject like that and back it up with all my evidence.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.383]  But I'll do that in an upcoming documentary.
[01:05:01.107 --> 01:05:04.111]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:09.437]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.437 --> 01:05:11.500]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.506]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:17.688]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.688 --> 01:05:18.409]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:20.670]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:21.750]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.951]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:25.291]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:26.812]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.812 --> 01:05:32.074]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.074 --> 01:05:35.215]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.655 --> 01:05:39.478]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.478 --> 01:05:40.698]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.698 --> 01:05:41.619]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.619 --> 01:05:42.720]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.640]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.741]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.803]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:12.366]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:07:12.366 --> 01:07:15.229]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[01:07:15.229 --> 01:07:20.995]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.

[01:08:02.535 --> 01:08:04.797]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.797 --> 01:08:08.260]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:23.171]  I want it to burn in.
[01:08:23.171 --> 01:08:24.993]  I want it to sink in for everybody.
[01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:33.201]  Then we've got front row seats to the open takeover by a criminal superclass of the planet.
[01:08:33.201 --> 01:08:52.050]  I mean, I think about all their environmental laws and how this week Obama has announced they're going to implement unilateral taxes and reductions on greenhouse emissions in all sorts of industries and factories and coal-fired power plants.
[01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:53.411]  No law, they're just doing it.
[01:08:54.523 --> 01:09:11.064]  And how this is going to run more industry, more jobs out of the country, raise the prices of energy, raise the prices of products, and how Mexico and India and China and scores of other nations have to make zero cuts, but we do, and pay taxes to these dirty bankers.
[01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.646]  And they're only getting started.
[01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:16.779]  They decide what type of house you can have.
[01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.081]  They decide what type of home inspection you get.
[01:09:19.081 --> 01:09:31.672]  You know, they admit, all over the country, billions of dollars in federal funds to the cities and counties to where, oh, we'll give you a $3,000 rebate if you get a new washer and dryer.
[01:09:31.672 --> 01:09:35.075]  But, we've got to do a home inspection first.
[01:09:36.297 --> 01:09:42.002]  And then you read and they admit that this is to condition you for the mandatory home inspections.
[01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:44.205]  It's just setting the precedent.
[01:09:44.205 --> 01:09:46.527]  Many cities and states already have it.
[01:09:46.527 --> 01:09:47.928]  It's all dog training.
[01:09:47.928 --> 01:09:53.533]  It's all incremental bringing you into bondage.
[01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:56.556]  Bankrupting everything by design to drive you into poverty.
[01:09:56.556 --> 01:09:59.099]  And that makes me so angry at these people.
[01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:01.832]  I want to get more into the economy.
[01:10:01.832 --> 01:10:08.555]  I want to get more into another name on President Obama's Supreme Court shortlist.
[01:10:08.555 --> 01:10:12.877]  Oh yes, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.
[01:10:12.877 --> 01:10:14.317]  Total thug.
[01:10:14.317 --> 01:10:18.879]  She's four warrantless wiretapping, secret arrest, torture, naked body scanner.
[01:10:18.879 --> 01:10:21.560]  She'll make a great justice.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.883]  Every person they've put forward is like a Herman Goering
[01:10:28.635 --> 01:10:31.137]  Joe Stalin clone or something.
[01:10:31.137 --> 01:10:34.360]  It's just, when does it end?
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:41.326]  Also, provocateurs openly announced plans to stage Tea Party violence.
[01:10:41.326 --> 01:10:50.214]  We're also going to get into teen suicide puts spotlight on high-tech bullying.
[01:10:50.214 --> 01:10:51.676]  Another way they want to censor the internet.
[01:10:53.493 --> 01:10:53.773]  Alex, hello.
[01:10:53.773 --> 01:10:54.654]  Good afternoon.
[01:11:16.423 --> 01:11:19.504]  Hey, listen, first-time caller, I've been listening to you for quite a while.
[01:11:19.504 --> 01:11:28.208]  I really admire your dedication and just your mind and how well you can speak and how knowledgeable you are.
[01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:36.192]  The Ron Brown, you know, you were talking about Ron Brown earlier and it caused me to Google Ron Brown's body.
[01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:41.634]  Well, have you ever heard of a documentary, I can't find it, free online called Megafix?
[01:11:41.634 --> 01:11:43.075]  No.
[01:11:43.075 --> 01:11:45.016]  Okay, it has to do with the Ron Brown.
[01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:46.188]  Yes.
[01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:19.435]  CNN had it on, but they blocked out with a black box.
[01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:25.839]  They didn't want, you know, people to see the actual footage of it.
[01:12:25.839 --> 01:12:27.401]  I gotta admit, I'm a little bit nervous.
[01:12:27.401 --> 01:12:28.842]  I apologize.
[01:12:28.842 --> 01:12:29.822]  There's so many things here.
[01:12:29.822 --> 01:12:36.928]  Have you heard of a video called Operation Hollywood by David L. Rob?
[01:12:36.928 --> 01:12:40.270]  Yes, I believe I watched it years ago.
[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.871]  Years ago?
[01:12:40.871 --> 01:12:42.312]  Yeah, I guess that's...
[01:12:42.893 --> 01:12:44.057]  An old news law?
[01:12:44.057 --> 01:12:44.498]  I don't know.
[01:12:44.498 --> 01:12:46.123]  I kind of blew this call.
[01:12:46.123 --> 01:12:46.424]  Sorry.
[01:12:47.106 --> 01:12:47.527]  No, you didn't.
[01:12:47.527 --> 01:12:49.348]  You brought up some important issues.
[01:12:49.348 --> 01:12:58.354]  And for those that don't know, I was bringing up the death of President Kaczynski, the Polish president flying into Russia with a large percentage of the leadership of the government.
[01:12:58.354 --> 01:13:05.118]  He had announced that he wasn't going to go along with the EU takeover of his country and his plane crashes.
[01:13:05.118 --> 01:13:06.479]  And here's the New York Times.
[01:13:06.479 --> 01:13:12.843]  Kaczynski, often a source of tension within the EU, but the Russians didn't like him either.
[01:13:12.843 --> 01:13:14.264]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:16.446]  But then I was going over Ron Brown, the fact that
[01:13:17.266 --> 01:13:29.397]  The Air Force head pathologist said that many of the bodies had bullet holes, including Ron Brown, who was the Secretary of Commerce, involved in all this corruption.
[01:13:29.397 --> 01:13:31.980]  He said, if I go down, everybody is going down.
[01:13:34.053 --> 01:13:34.353]  Yes, hello?
[01:13:34.353 --> 01:13:34.633]  What's new?
[01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:05.367]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:14:05.367 --> 01:14:06.768]  I'm alright.
[01:14:06.768 --> 01:14:08.449]  Alright, I'm glad you took my call today.
[01:14:08.449 --> 01:14:10.091]  I'm a huge fan.
[01:14:10.091 --> 01:14:13.894]  I've, uh, ordered almost all your videos, and, uh... Well, thank you for the support.
[01:14:13.894 --> 01:14:14.474]  God bless you.
[01:14:14.474 --> 01:14:16.236]  What's on your mind?
[01:14:16.236 --> 01:14:27.285]  Um, well, you know, I was reading the news about this, the Polish plane crash, and I think there's just too many people of high-level importance on one plane that seemed to crash.
[01:14:27.285 --> 01:14:31.028]  And, you know, I know that things do happen by accident, but, uh,
[01:14:31.795 --> 01:14:34.077]  You know, I'd like to look into this a little more.
[01:14:34.077 --> 01:14:45.485]  Well, if you look at many of these big airliner crashes in every case, in the big prominent cases, the entire leadership of the Egyptian military was on board.
[01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:49.067]  You know, the entire leadership of this government, that government.
[01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:51.769]  And it's just constantly happening, constantly.
[01:14:51.769 --> 01:14:55.152]  It was the same thing with TWA Flight 800.
[01:14:55.152 --> 01:14:56.513]  It was full of a bunch of spies.
[01:14:57.333 --> 01:15:00.814]  And then, oh, a Navy cruiser accidentally shot a missile into it.
[01:15:00.814 --> 01:15:02.215]  They tried to cover that up.
[01:15:02.215 --> 01:15:03.915]  Give me a break.
[01:15:03.915 --> 01:15:12.758]  They love to blow people out of the sky because it's so easy to then cover it up through the TSA investigation.
[01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.799]  Yes, and, uh, you know, I feel sorry for the people of Poland.
[01:15:15.799 --> 01:15:22.721]  You know, I understand their leader that, you know, Prime Minister that passed away was doing things that were in their country's best interest and, uh,
[01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:30.155]  I guess the people at New World Order like to target is people who stand up for their nation and their people.
[01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:31.836]  Well, yeah, people that actually have power.
[01:15:31.836 --> 01:15:38.021]  I mean, if Poland pulled out of the euro, it would be over for the euro.
[01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:42.225]  And the bankers are like, no, no, we run you, we own you.
[01:15:42.225 --> 01:15:45.007]  Their economy is just shutting down and the bankers love it.
[01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.182]  Because now they get to social engineer.
[01:15:48.182 --> 01:15:53.204]  See, having the banking monopoly over the issuance of currency and credit is only the beginning of the power.
[01:15:53.204 --> 01:16:02.169]  Then you get into the ideology, the fervent religious belief in extermination and mass murder and death and culling the population, and then it becomes crystal clear.
[01:16:02.169 --> 01:16:05.130]  Being slaves to the bankers is only the beginning.
[01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:06.411]  Thank you, Ryan.
[01:16:06.411 --> 01:16:07.911]  You can get back now to the soccer game.
[01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.432]  Sounded like kids happily playing in the background.
[01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:12.613]  Let's talk to Tony in Niagara Falls.
[01:16:12.613 --> 01:16:13.434]  Tony, you're on the air.
[01:16:14.352 --> 01:16:15.313]  Hi Alex, it's Tony.
[01:16:15.313 --> 01:16:16.154]  How are you?
[01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:17.675]  Good!
[01:16:17.675 --> 01:16:19.096]  Just a couple things.
[01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:24.841]  First thing is, I took your advice and started my own site called WesternNewYorkTruthers.org.
[01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:25.261]  Good!
[01:16:25.261 --> 01:16:32.207]  And we already got a thousand users and we're going to be marching on Tax Free Day downtown in Buffalo, New York.
[01:16:32.207 --> 01:16:41.214]  Also, another thing I'd like to tell you about is, I know it's old news, but the vandalism for the Representative Slaughter's office in Niagara Falls here.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:53.863]  Um, is on Main Street, the busiest street, um, in Niagara Falls, and there's a donut shop across the street, um, that literally there's police at all the time.
[01:16:53.863 --> 01:17:05.245]  So, as well as me, as other residents in town are very skeptical about the vandalism because there would not be any type of vandalism without someone seeing it.
[01:17:05.245 --> 01:17:07.166]  But yet, no one has seen anything.
[01:17:08.826 --> 01:17:10.129]  Well, it could have been done at night.
[01:17:10.129 --> 01:17:13.557]  I don't know the specifics of that case, though I read about it.
[01:17:13.557 --> 01:17:18.888]  Look, the Democrats have been caught over and over again attacking their own offices.
[01:17:18.888 --> 01:17:18.989]  And...
[01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:24.096]  NAACP affiliated groups have been caught doing it over and over again.
[01:17:24.096 --> 01:17:25.356]  And most of this is staged.
[01:17:25.356 --> 01:17:30.717]  I mean, we have the video of the supposed N-word spitting incident, and none of it's real.
[01:17:30.717 --> 01:17:32.317]  It was all fake.
[01:17:32.317 --> 01:17:35.218]  And so I appreciate your call, Tony.
[01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:38.438]  There's no doubt most of this is fake, and that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:17:38.438 --> 01:17:46.340]  Now we have the big anarchist groups out in the open, saying they're going to come out and do bad things, posing as Tea Party people.
[01:17:47.293 --> 01:17:49.795]  See, false flagging is elementary.
[01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:52.397]  It's been done for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:17:52.397 --> 01:17:58.341]  I mean, you all know about employees that have done something bad and blamed it on somebody else.
[01:17:58.341 --> 01:17:59.722]  Or you know about bosses that have done it.
[01:17:59.722 --> 01:18:02.664]  You know about people burning down their own house to get the insurance money.
[01:18:02.664 --> 01:18:04.145]  That's an inside job.
[01:18:04.145 --> 01:18:06.226]  Most crime is an inside job.
[01:18:06.226 --> 01:18:10.990]  Most crime.
[01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:14.012]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in New Jersey.
[01:18:14.012 --> 01:18:14.853]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:18:14.853 --> 01:18:16.614]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:18:16.943 --> 01:18:18.764]  Good sir!
[01:18:18.764 --> 01:18:20.526]  I have something I found online.
[01:18:20.526 --> 01:18:28.352]  You was talking yesterday about the problem with the vaccines and you woke me up about a little over a year ago.
[01:18:28.352 --> 01:18:34.257]  So I started researching all this and I run across a material safety data sheet and I'm a truck driver.
[01:18:34.257 --> 01:18:40.102]  Hazardous material has to have a material safety data sheet on thimerosal.
[01:18:40.102 --> 01:18:45.446]  It says use of substance, pharmaceutical production and analysis, hazardous
[01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.938]  Identification, very toxic.
[01:18:48.938 --> 01:19:05.372]  By inhalation contact the skin is swallowed and it tells it's not supposed to be mixed with strong oxidizing agents, strong acids, strong bases, aluminum reducing agents and it says danger of accumulative effects.
[01:19:06.847 --> 01:19:10.991]  Tell you what, stay there, stay there, because we should pull this up ourselves.
[01:19:10.991 --> 01:19:15.055]  I mean, I covered this last year, but I'm going to come back to you and let you finish up.
[01:19:15.055 --> 01:19:18.219]  Same thing with sodium fluoride, with all these things.
[01:19:18.219 --> 01:19:20.421]  And it's not just listeners.
[01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:27.948]  I have family that I've talked to, or that other members of my family have talked to, who have babies.
[01:19:27.948 --> 01:19:29.950]  And we say, please don't vaccinate your baby.
[01:19:31.243 --> 01:19:34.986]  And it's just they laugh like I'm some kind of moron.
[01:19:34.986 --> 01:19:36.848]  And, uh, oh, the doctors say it's good.
[01:19:36.848 --> 01:19:39.270]  You know, when I was a kid, it was three or four vaccines.
[01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:42.512]  Now it's 56 shots and growing.
[01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:49.959]  And they give a baby one of the most deadly, dangerous, admitted vaccines, the hepatitis shot at birth.
[01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:53.081]  And it just savages these babies.
[01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:57.505]  And, uh, you know, these yuppies think it's cute and they wonder why their kid later can't talk.
[01:19:57.505 --> 01:19:59.487]  And is crapping their diapers when they're 12 years old.
[01:20:02.153 --> 01:20:06.755]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[01:21:01.826 --> 01:21:03.588]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.588 --> 01:21:04.149]  April 12th, 2010.

[01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.594]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.

[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.020]  U.S.
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.685]  treasuries are a safe haven in volatile times, but what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:32.368]  government overextends itself?
[01:21:32.368 --> 01:21:36.794]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:53.660]  800-822-1291.
[01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:10.404]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[01:24:10.404 --> 01:24:20.628]  Thank God the human body is so strong that despite the fact they pump us full of the cancer viruses and the mercury, it's only affecting 1 in 68 children.
[01:24:20.628 --> 01:24:24.489]  It was 1 in 20 plus thousand a few decades ago that got autism.
[01:24:26.232 --> 01:24:30.897]  And it is the cumulative effect of the toxins, of the chemicals.
[01:24:30.897 --> 01:24:43.471]  And then it turns out in 2009, early 2010, record low numbers of seasonal flu, and of course H1N1, less than 10% of the public supposedly contracted it, and most of them didn't even get sick.
[01:24:43.471 --> 01:24:46.614]  But in five different major government studies,
[01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:56.918]  They have found conclusively a 60 plus percent increase in people getting H1N1 and getting sick from it, if they had already taken the seasonal flu shot.
[01:24:56.918 --> 01:25:01.120]  And in many of the seasonal flu shots, I noticed that H1N1 was one of the viruses.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:06.002]  They put a bunch of different viruses, flu viruses, RNA, in there.
[01:25:06.002 --> 01:25:11.403]  But, look, I remember five, six years ago, the media would say there is no mercury in shots.
[01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:12.344]  And it was a bait and switch.
[01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:23.137]  Federal regulators said, okay, every vaccine company needs to make small lots available that do not have thimerosal, the mercury additive.
[01:25:23.137 --> 01:25:26.900]  And so then the media would say, there is no mercury, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.423]  Then people would read the inserts, and so that hoax got exploded.
[01:25:30.423 --> 01:25:31.884]  They'd say, of course it's in there.
[01:25:31.884 --> 01:25:39.870]  And then people would actually read the real insert from the seasonal flu, NH1N1, and it said it can cause Guillain-Barre, other neurological disorders.
[01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:48.852]  Does have thimerosal, can sterilize you, can reduce fertility, can cause other autoimmune disorders, can cause death.
[01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:51.034]  And people are like, what?
[01:25:51.034 --> 01:26:04.721]  And so now they had an article over the weekend in the AP, CDC says people are getting apathetic about viruses and won't take their shots and there's all these crazy people that don't because the government won't take it.
[01:26:04.721 --> 01:26:07.423]  I've had three children and I put my money where my mouth is.
[01:26:08.613 --> 01:26:12.376]  None of them have had one single injection.
[01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:15.878]  Not one single injection.
[01:26:15.878 --> 01:26:18.100]  Despite all the fear-mongering.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.841]  Your child could get hepatitis.
[01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.142]  Your child could get whooping cough.
[01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:30.508]  Your child could... And then Dr. Dina Dell and others get up on TV and radio and say, well, let me tell you, we need to arrest the people that don't vaccinate their kids because then they endanger everybody else.
[01:26:30.508 --> 01:26:31.349]  Wait a minute.
[01:26:31.349 --> 01:26:33.010]  If you've already had the vaccine,
[01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:42.915]  If you've already had the vaccine, and you're supposedly protected, why can't I be stupid if I want and not take it?
[01:26:42.915 --> 01:26:45.217]  This is part of the medical tyranny.
[01:26:45.217 --> 01:26:49.819]  But yes, if you read the hazardous materials sheet on thimerosal, it's in the vaccines.
[01:26:49.819 --> 01:26:59.185]  And the thimerosal's nothing compared to... Nothing compared to the cancer viruses, which they found in the new vaccines this year.
[01:26:59.185 --> 01:27:00.566]  Let's go ahead and go back to Brian.
[01:27:00.566 --> 01:27:03.688]  Brian, finish your point, though, about the hazardous materials sheet.
[01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:09.776]  Well, I missed one thing on the substances to be avoided.
[01:27:09.776 --> 01:27:14.240]  It talks about not mixing it with certain things, and one of the things it names is aluminum.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:26.130]  When you go to the CDC and get the ingredients, six out of ten of the products that contain thimerosal contain some form of aluminum.
[01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:29.473]  So they say not to mix it, but yet they do it anyway.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.001]  So you know they're doing things on purpose.
[01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:36.802]  And Brian, we're supposed to just shut up and not warn anybody.
[01:27:36.802 --> 01:27:42.364]  We're weirdos, Brian, because we get upset about kids being brain damaged by design.
[01:27:42.364 --> 01:27:46.425]  We should only get upset about our football team losing, Brian.
[01:27:46.425 --> 01:27:49.746]  Well, that's a good thing I don't watch much sports no more.
[01:27:49.746 --> 01:27:52.507]  And I'll tell you one more thing.
[01:27:52.507 --> 01:27:54.208]  If you want to know about
[01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:59.492]  Uh, deindustrialization of America.
[01:27:59.492 --> 01:28:00.713]  Ask a truck driver.
[01:28:00.713 --> 01:28:11.180]  After deregulation in the 80s, and as of today, we've had hundreds of trucking companies, thousands of trucking companies go out of business in the last two years.
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.581]  I mean, the freight is going away.
[01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:20.226]  And only the, because the commerce is going away, and only the megacorporations can pay all the fines and fees and regulations.
[01:28:21.445 --> 01:28:22.586]  That is correct.
[01:28:22.586 --> 01:28:23.646]  But listen, I interrupted you.
[01:28:23.646 --> 01:28:31.129]  Go back to the hazardous materials sheet on thimerosal mercury, because you were getting to that part about the cumulative effect, and that's what's key.
[01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:32.630]  Okay.
[01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:35.731]  It says, other notes.
[01:28:35.731 --> 01:28:40.273]  No, it says, above other notes, it says, danger of cumulative effects.
[01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:49.017]  And then the other note says, mercury compounds have a cytotoxic and protoplasmotoxic effect.
[01:28:49.017 --> 01:28:50.958]  Intoxication symptoms
[01:28:51.664 --> 01:29:10.440]  It says acute contact with eyes causes several lesions, swallowing, and inhalation of dust, damages, mucus, membranes, and it just goes through a long paragraph of all the problems it has.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:19.288]  Long-term exposure leads to disorders, damage of the nervous system, which is autism, since it is cumulative.
[01:29:19.835 --> 01:29:23.937]  And magically, our kids have mercury poisoning symptoms.
[01:29:23.937 --> 01:29:28.479]  They're being injected with it, and the media just says, shut up, conspiracy kooks.
[01:29:28.479 --> 01:29:30.300]  And the cops say, shut up, kooks.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.561]  I'm going to give my child extra shots.
[01:29:32.561 --> 01:29:37.183]  Sure, Jimmy's 12 and can't talk, but I love the government.
[01:29:37.183 --> 01:29:39.384]  The government wouldn't hurt me.
[01:29:39.384 --> 01:29:42.065]  Billy's 14, and he's got cancer.
[01:29:42.065 --> 01:29:43.565]  But that's all right.
[01:29:43.565 --> 01:29:44.686]  I love the government.
[01:29:45.859 --> 01:29:47.400]  How dare you, Brian!
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.340]  Know how to read!
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.441]  You need more mercury shots!
[01:29:51.441 --> 01:29:52.842]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.842 --> 01:29:55.383]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.383 --> 01:29:58.044]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.703 --> 01:30:03.005]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:30:03.005 --> 01:30:05.407]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:30:05.407 --> 01:30:08.609]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:30:08.609 --> 01:30:13.733]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:30:13.733 --> 01:30:18.237]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:18.237 --> 01:30:20.699]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:20.699 --> 01:30:23.141]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:23.141 --> 01:30:26.003]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:30:26.363 --> 01:30:34.312]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:30:34.312 --> 01:30:39.679]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:30:39.679 --> 01:30:42.041]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:45.966]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:30:46.246 --> 01:30:47.328]  And I got news for you.
[01:30:47.328 --> 01:30:48.651]  You're everyone else.
[01:30:48.651 --> 01:30:50.153]  Invisible Empire.

[01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:01.998]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.998 --> 01:31:07.584]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.584 --> 01:31:12.589]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.589 --> 01:31:17.635]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:18.155 --> 01:31:23.399]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.399 --> 01:31:25.701]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:31:25.701 --> 01:31:30.505]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.505 --> 01:31:31.626]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.626 --> 01:31:34.708]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:34.708 --> 01:31:37.991]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:38.311 --> 01:31:41.494]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:41.494 --> 01:31:43.716]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:43.716 --> 01:31:44.657]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.657 --> 01:31:44.857]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.857 --> 01:31:48.300]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.042]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:05.797]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:32:05.797 --> 01:32:08.541]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:32:08.541 --> 01:32:13.887]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:32:13.887 --> 01:32:15.088]  Friends, I hope that you will
[01:32:15.248 --> 01:32:18.349]  Order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:33:16.349 --> 01:33:20.373]  And then I'm going to get into the implosion of the economy by design.
[01:33:20.373 --> 01:33:28.060]  How this unfolding situation will show itself unless we stand up and say no.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.482]  The planned setup of the tea parties.
[01:33:32.372 --> 01:33:36.954]  The stage terror events that we know are in the works to be blamed on the American people.
[01:33:36.954 --> 01:33:38.335]  It is all coming up.
[01:33:38.335 --> 01:33:41.777]  Plus, every few days I see mainstream news articles like this.
[01:33:41.777 --> 01:33:44.618]  This is from Popular Science.
[01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:49.781]  Intel wants brain implants in its customers' heads by 2020.
[01:33:49.781 --> 01:33:55.304]  Now, I remember back in 2000 reading Pentagon reports that were declassified.
[01:33:56.345 --> 01:34:12.539]  How they said they would incrementally roll out digital devices until the point by 2020, now only 10 years away, that you won't be able to get a job unless you have implantable microchips in you.
[01:34:12.539 --> 01:34:16.483]  And they say, look, we'll pitch it as if it's societally cool.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:29.949]  And for security, and to have government jobs, and we'll just say, well, if you don't want the microchip in your brain, it's a very quick, easy surgery, you don't have to have a job here.
[01:34:29.949 --> 01:34:39.155]  And we'll pitch it as if it gives sight to the blind, because it has all these good dual uses, but all of it is being engineered to control society.
[01:34:39.155 --> 01:34:43.158]  This is popular science, by the way.
[01:34:43.158 --> 01:34:43.599]  Oh boy.
[01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:53.627]  Truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[01:34:53.627 --> 01:34:58.089]  Before I go to John, John, Tom, Jim, and others, let me give you the toll-free number.
[01:34:58.089 --> 01:34:58.729]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:59.149]  I get very angry.
[01:35:07.793 --> 01:35:22.002]  By what I see from the government, it's arrogance, it's hatred of the public, it's abuse of the public, the way the culture has changed in government, that the public's a bunch of scum to be fed on.
[01:35:22.002 --> 01:35:27.286]  You know, we don't even attempt to demonize police on this radio show.
[01:35:27.286 --> 01:35:30.087]  If we wanted to, there's just endless fodder.
[01:35:30.087 --> 01:35:31.909]  But this morning I happened to get into
[01:35:33.618 --> 01:35:41.960]  Some YouTube channels with literally hundreds of videos from local news of police beating people up in wheelchairs for no reason.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.901]  They'll say, get up!
[01:35:43.901 --> 01:35:45.801]  The guy says, I have no legs.
[01:35:45.801 --> 01:35:52.583]  The cops go, taser him, didn't follow the order!
[01:35:52.583 --> 01:36:00.325]  I'd only seen a few of those, but I decided to search engine the term police attack man in wheelchair, or police taser man in wheelchair, and there were
[01:36:01.687 --> 01:36:07.008]  Dozens and dozens of them, I couldn't even watch them.
[01:36:07.008 --> 01:36:12.330]  I couldn't watch these people crying and saying, it broke my bones when they threw me on the concrete.
[01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:14.771]  And the cops on video going, get up!
[01:36:14.771 --> 01:36:15.791]  I told you, get up!
[01:36:15.791 --> 01:36:19.192]  And the guy goes, I don't have no legs!
[01:36:19.192 --> 01:36:20.312]  Don't you see?
[01:36:20.312 --> 01:36:26.534]  And to watch them attacking and then to see the police departments defending it.
[01:36:27.574 --> 01:36:35.200]  And then remember that guy, that mentally deficient Polish immigrant was flying here where his mother lives in Canada?
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:45.428]  And they kept him for more than 18 hours in a confinement area and he couldn't speak English or French and he didn't know why they were, so he started waving his arms and just argued.
[01:36:45.428 --> 01:36:53.415]  And so they tasered him, jumped on him, broke his neck, killed him, and the Royal Mountain Police said, that's okay, good job.
[01:36:53.415 --> 01:36:57.018]  Then a few days later, the same cop that jumped on his neck
[01:36:59.864 --> 01:37:03.566]  Then the police thought the public was so dumb they said, well, we didn't break his neck.
[01:37:03.566 --> 01:37:04.587]  We didn't kill him.
[01:37:04.587 --> 01:37:06.568]  His neck just got broken somehow.
[01:37:06.568 --> 01:37:11.191]  That cop was drunk driving and killed somebody on a motorcycle and has now been finally charged.
[01:37:11.191 --> 01:37:19.436]  But I mean, I just happened to see that video and then right next to it the other video and it showed the video of the cops jumping on this guy's head and they were just enjoying it.
[01:37:19.436 --> 01:37:23.319]  I was watching other videos of them beating up some military guy.
[01:37:24.448 --> 01:37:31.553]  Just because he asked questions and they pull out a baton and start beating him in the legs and laughing and other cops are joking while they're doing it.
[01:37:31.553 --> 01:37:35.797]  And then they charged the military guy.
[01:37:35.797 --> 01:37:44.603]  And I'm telling you, they've hired a bunch of sadistic, psychopathic bullies who think it's manly to just beat people up.
[01:37:44.603 --> 01:37:46.425]  And we've turned into Soviet Russia.
[01:37:46.425 --> 01:37:48.186]  Does that mean all the police are like this?
[01:37:48.186 --> 01:37:49.487]  Absolutely not.
[01:37:49.487 --> 01:37:52.649]  Good cops are aware of what's going on.
[01:37:52.649 --> 01:37:52.910]  But
[01:37:56.032 --> 01:38:03.437]  You know, there's some good places to eat around 6th Street, but I won't go down there.
[01:38:03.437 --> 01:38:14.824]  I've told the story a few years ago, they were having some movie events here in town, and I got invited by some Hollywood producers, oh, just go have a few drinks with us over here on 6th Street at some bars.
[01:38:14.824 --> 01:38:23.030]  So we go in this mainline bar, and it's not even a rough bar, it's, it's, it's, there's this big giant steroid head
[01:38:24.594 --> 01:38:26.055]  Bouncer.
[01:38:26.055 --> 01:38:28.697]  And he's saying, ID, ID, ID.
[01:38:28.697 --> 01:38:31.039]  And so I show him my ID.
[01:38:31.039 --> 01:38:32.380]  And I didn't give him a dirty look or anything.
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:33.661]  And he says, you think you're tough, boy?
[01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:34.701]  You think you're ready for something?
[01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:35.602]  You want something right now?
[01:38:35.602 --> 01:38:37.423]  He may not know who I was.
[01:38:37.423 --> 01:38:39.285]  And I just looked at the guy and didn't say anything.
[01:38:39.285 --> 01:38:45.309]  And then him and this other steroid head laughed at me after I went in.
[01:38:45.309 --> 01:38:51.714]  And the whole thing is, as a man, I don't have those type of homicidal intentions towards somebody unless they're threatening my life.
[01:38:53.285 --> 01:38:56.749]  I mean, I'm not out here just running around looking for somebody to fight.
[01:38:56.749 --> 01:39:05.720]  But I'm telling you, then we walked out of the bar an hour later and I saw cops with shaved heads and black gloves and huge arms and tattoos.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.962]  I'm not saying tattoos are bad.
[01:39:06.962 --> 01:39:09.064]  I'm just saying that, you know, they were thuggish looking.
[01:39:10.493 --> 01:39:17.518]  Strutting around, going up to good-looking girls, demanding their IDs on the street, flirting with them, giving crazy, dirty looks at people.
[01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:20.139]  I mean, you know what crazed thugs look like.
[01:39:20.139 --> 01:39:22.141]  And I was like, I'm never coming down here again.
[01:39:22.141 --> 01:39:32.247]  And I've been down there a few times when radio stations want to interview me downtown, or they're having some event, or I have a film screening, but I don't go down there to eat anymore.
[01:39:32.247 --> 01:39:35.950]  Because I guess they have special units of like steroid cops down there, and
[01:39:42.748 --> 01:39:47.733]  And I've been to quite a few third world countries and I've seen the cops act a little bit like that.
[01:39:47.733 --> 01:39:50.936]  You know, thuggish and on power trips and a crazed look in their eyes.
[01:39:50.936 --> 01:39:58.624]  I mean, I've been in Honduras and it's the only place I've seen cops act like American cops.
[01:39:58.624 --> 01:40:03.289]  I mean, Honduras is a cesspit of evil and third world wickedness.
[01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:05.732]  And we are, for all intents and purposes,
[01:40:07.967 --> 01:40:17.889]  The greatest nation in history, the most wealthy nation in history, because we had a monocum of liberty, more than anybody else, sinking into a cesspit.
[01:40:17.889 --> 01:40:20.129]  And then I think about these cops.
[01:40:20.129 --> 01:40:29.371]  I probably watched more than 20 videos this morning, and didn't even really get ready for the show because of it, because I usually spend two or three hours getting ready, and I spent like an hour of the three hours just watching videos.
[01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:31.371]  I was mesmerized by it.
[01:40:31.371 --> 01:40:37.512]  And I saw a video of cops in a car chase,
[01:40:39.215 --> 01:40:56.147]  And they make the guy flip his car, and he flies out the window, and he clearly has broken all his bones as a ragdoll, and the cops run up and start piling on him, beating him, hitting him in the head, and that's what they want to do!
[01:40:56.147 --> 01:40:57.728]  I mean, this is what they enjoy.
[01:40:57.728 --> 01:40:58.609]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:40:58.609 --> 01:41:04.273]  That same killer instinct you've got, the real power are little 125, 130-pound egghead nerds.
[01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:11.492]  Who have 150, 160, 170, 180 IQs.
[01:41:11.492 --> 01:41:18.635]  And they work in eugenics societies and they run the world government.
[01:41:18.635 --> 01:41:21.417]  And they hate everyone.
[01:41:21.417 --> 01:41:23.158]  And they're elitist.
[01:41:23.158 --> 01:41:28.781]  And they are putting cancer viruses in your shots, poison in your water, mercury in your vaccines.
[01:41:28.781 --> 01:41:35.985]  They've designed GMO food to attack your organs and to attack your sexual organs.
[01:41:37.822 --> 01:41:45.829]  And so you drive around having a crazed hatred of the public and you're on a seething power trip, you're bosses.
[01:41:45.829 --> 01:41:50.433]  You're like a little dragon, a little seven foot tall dragon who thinks he's tough.
[01:41:50.433 --> 01:41:56.658]  And he's sitting there snarling and biting and snapping and hurting basically sheep.
[01:41:56.658 --> 01:42:04.185]  And then that little dragon who thinks he's the biggest thing in the world looks over his shoulder and there's a thousand foot dragon standing behind him.
[01:42:07.389 --> 01:42:08.750]  And you know what that dragon likes to eat?
[01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:10.230]  It likes to eat little dragons.
[01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:15.152]  And it reaches down and it grabs you and drops you right into its mouth.
[01:42:15.152 --> 01:42:19.034]  Hell awaits.
[01:42:19.034 --> 01:42:30.338]  And so you think you're getting away with it, the swaggering, the little gang culture and the squeezing the public, the setting the public up, doing all the things.
[01:42:30.338 --> 01:42:31.979]  You think it's cute?
[01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:36.941]  I don't know why they like to attack people in wheelchairs.
[01:42:40.615 --> 01:42:41.155]  I don't know why.
[01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:51.877]  I know somebody in Austin they attacked in a wheelchair.
[01:42:51.877 --> 01:42:53.958]  They told him, get up and walk.
[01:42:53.958 --> 01:42:59.279]  And the guy said, I'm paralyzed from the chest down.
[01:42:59.279 --> 01:43:01.739]  And so they beat him up.
[01:43:01.739 --> 01:43:03.220]  I don't have to watch YouTube videos.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.200]  I know somebody they beat up.
[01:43:05.148 --> 01:43:06.610]  And you know what?
[01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:09.873]  The cop that beat that guy up has been made a commander.
[01:43:09.873 --> 01:43:12.396]  They're like, my god, you beat up people in wheelchairs!
[01:43:12.396 --> 01:43:14.318]  You're more vicious than anyone we've ever seen!
[01:43:14.318 --> 01:43:17.842]  You're gonna be police chief, probably!
[01:43:17.842 --> 01:43:21.146]  Because that's the spirit they want.
[01:43:21.146 --> 01:43:24.950]  Now, there are some good departments, there are some good sheriffs out there.
[01:43:31.618 --> 01:43:36.644]  But the police have been told you can do whatever you want, we're going to back you up.
[01:43:36.644 --> 01:43:38.747]  Go hog wild on the public.
[01:43:38.747 --> 01:43:45.776]  And how can police in 800 plus cities engage in discrimination every day?
[01:43:45.776 --> 01:43:46.597]  How can they
[01:43:48.268 --> 01:44:00.859]  Knowingly, let illegal aliens go for drunk driving, for not having driver's license, for not paying their tickets, for all sorts of other crimes, and admit this on the news, and then just squeeze their fellow citizens.
[01:44:00.859 --> 01:44:06.664]  Just squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.
[01:44:06.664 --> 01:44:15.612]  You've been dressed up in Darth Vader outfits and given high-tech weapons and trained on how to take on the American people and for riot control because your bosses
[01:44:17.532 --> 01:44:29.360]  Are scientific criminals deploying a scientific tyranny upon humanity?
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:35.024]  And separately, the Federal Guard is being trained to go after you when you're done with us.
[01:44:35.024 --> 01:44:36.545]  And I just, you need to understand that.
[01:44:36.545 --> 01:44:41.068]  You need to let that sink in real good, that what you're hearing here is the truth.
[01:44:41.068 --> 01:44:44.350]  And the fact that these departments almost always defend cops
[01:44:47.346 --> 01:44:51.009]  I mean, I watched a video where they pull over this soccer mom.
[01:44:51.009 --> 01:44:51.710]  She gets out.
[01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:52.931]  She's polite.
[01:44:52.931 --> 01:44:54.452]  She says, officer, look at my bag.
[01:44:54.452 --> 01:44:55.112]  Look at my car.
[01:44:55.112 --> 01:44:55.993]  I don't have a cell phone.
[01:44:55.993 --> 01:44:57.855]  I wasn't talking on a cell phone.
[01:44:57.855 --> 01:45:00.056]  He says, fine, I'm going to get you for speeding.
[01:45:00.056 --> 01:45:04.760]  And she said, I had it on cruise control.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:08.784]  And she says, I want to see your squad car video.
[01:45:08.784 --> 01:45:09.864]  Not aggressively.
[01:45:09.864 --> 01:45:11.546]  He just pulls a Taser out and tasers her.
[01:45:20.885 --> 01:45:23.207]  They enjoy it.
[01:45:23.207 --> 01:45:31.132]  They enjoy getting some foreigner who can't speak English at an airport.
[01:45:31.132 --> 01:45:32.693]  White cops killing a white guy.
[01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:43.120]  For some reason, foreigners of any other color are off limits, but in most of these videos I see.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.001]  And they, you know, they kill him.
[01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:45.881]  And then they laugh about it.
[01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:46.482]  He's dead!
[01:45:46.482 --> 01:45:47.182]  Ha ha!
[01:45:47.182 --> 01:45:47.703]  I'm tough!
[01:45:48.527 --> 01:45:52.508]  You know, maybe the cops will start sticking on the side of their squad cars how many citizens they've killed.
[01:45:52.508 --> 01:45:55.969]  Kind of like in World War II, how many Japanese Zeros you shot down.
[01:45:55.969 --> 01:45:58.790]  You know, have the sticker of how many kills you've had.
[01:45:58.790 --> 01:46:11.734]  In fact, we showed this when they had a raid, what, three years ago on those Mormons with the CPS.
[01:46:11.734 --> 01:46:16.136]  On the news, it showed the armored vehicle and it had how many kills it had on the side.
[01:46:20.126 --> 01:46:23.991]  See, you have a military culture.
[01:46:23.991 --> 01:46:30.439]  For the Marines, or the Army, and kill, kill, kill, kill the enemy, what makes the grass grow, blood, blood, blood.
[01:46:30.439 --> 01:46:36.166]  And then you bring those guys back, and you make them cops, and you militarize them.
[01:46:37.642 --> 01:46:39.503]  And I've had judge advocate generals on.
[01:46:39.503 --> 01:46:41.964]  I've had top former lawyers for the Pentagon on.
[01:46:41.964 --> 01:46:42.825]  They agree.
[01:46:42.825 --> 01:46:50.589]  They have forged the police into a paramilitary army against the people for the robbery of the people.
[01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:53.811]  Our land, our treasure, everything we are, everything we'll ever be.
[01:46:53.811 --> 01:47:00.654]  We know what oppression and despotism and tyranny and serfdom and feudalism is, and this is it.
[01:47:00.654 --> 01:47:00.935]  I mean, I'm...
[01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.656]  Look at an InfoWars.com right now.
[01:47:03.656 --> 01:47:09.439]  All over the country, they're having warrantless checkpoints now, where they don't even have any pretense of probable cause.
[01:47:09.439 --> 01:47:18.524]  Just searching people's vehicles, but they won't do it on the border.
[01:47:18.524 --> 01:47:21.925]  It's sick.
[01:47:21.925 --> 01:47:25.767]  Alright, I'm gonna get to the news after your calls, but let's go ahead and go back to your calls here.
[01:47:25.767 --> 01:47:27.488]  Let's talk to John in Rhode Island.
[01:47:27.488 --> 01:47:28.188]  John, you're on the air.
[01:47:28.188 --> 01:47:28.749]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:29.622 --> 01:47:30.602]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:47:30.602 --> 01:47:32.003]  Good, buddy.
[01:47:32.003 --> 01:47:36.124]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with a free leftist newspaper called The Phoenix.
[01:47:36.124 --> 01:47:39.545]  I know they do it in Providence and a few other major cities.
[01:47:39.545 --> 01:47:41.285]  No, I'm not familiar with it.
[01:47:41.285 --> 01:47:46.047]  But they had a cover piece this week was Tea for Terrorism.
[01:47:46.047 --> 01:47:48.667]  Nice little demonization piece for the tea parties.
[01:47:48.667 --> 01:47:55.029]  They have a nice big picture of the Hattari people and Oklahoma City and a tea party rally.
[01:47:55.029 --> 01:47:58.230]  And at the same time, they couldn't help but take a shot at you.
[01:47:59.619 --> 01:48:03.458]  And they said, quote, there's little difference between your site...
[01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:09.193]  Which is permanently linked from the Drudge Report, among others, to an hardcore hate site.
[01:48:09.193 --> 01:48:10.113]  I just wanted to let you know.
[01:48:10.113 --> 01:48:10.293]  Well, no.
[01:48:10.293 --> 01:48:12.214]  I mean, I'm going to talk about that in the next hour.
[01:48:12.214 --> 01:48:26.542]  But it is the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL Talking Point issued last year that I am the number one enemy and that I am calling for killing police and IRS workers ahead of them staging a stack event in the Pentagon event.
[01:48:26.542 --> 01:48:27.663]  They're going to stage more.
[01:48:27.663 --> 01:48:28.723]  Those are clearly staged.
[01:48:28.723 --> 01:48:30.004]  We've gone over all the evidence of that.
[01:48:30.004 --> 01:48:32.986]  The people just tuned in in previous broadcasts and articles we've written.
[01:48:33.886 --> 01:48:41.070]  And the national main communist newspaper did the same thing two weeks ago on me.
[01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:49.715]  And the anarchist, which aren't anarchists at all, I don't mean the general anarchists on the street, I mean the mainline national anarchist groups are saying the same thing.
[01:48:49.715 --> 01:48:58.760]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox last week wrote two articles on me saying I'm calling for violence, no evidence, just I'm the enemy.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:04.002]  And they're singling me out to have a bunch of cops come kill me.
[01:49:04.002 --> 01:49:12.147]  And they'll, like a bunch of morons, high-five each other and go give their kids some more shots and drink some more fluoride water.
[01:49:12.147 --> 01:49:13.688]  And then that's what they're doing.
[01:49:13.688 --> 01:49:15.569]  They're just setting me up.
[01:49:15.569 --> 01:49:18.531]  And because they can't stand it that I know, they're a bunch of terrorists.
[01:49:18.531 --> 01:49:20.131]  But go ahead.
[01:49:20.131 --> 01:49:24.614]  Well, what scares me, too, is you're talking about the police getting more and more brutal.
[01:49:24.614 --> 01:49:28.236]  The ADL does workshops with the police.
[01:49:29.037 --> 01:49:32.801]  The ADL runs most police departments for 30 years.
[01:49:32.801 --> 01:49:37.525]  And they've been convicted in court for stealing the police intel files.
[01:49:37.525 --> 01:49:38.686]  Oh yeah, that was in what, 92?
[01:49:38.686 --> 01:49:40.447]  Yeah.
[01:49:40.447 --> 01:49:43.590]  San Francisco.
[01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:46.232]  I mean, is this online too?
[01:49:46.232 --> 01:49:46.732]  Can I read it?
[01:49:46.732 --> 01:49:49.074]  What's the T for terrorism?
[01:49:49.074 --> 01:49:54.359]  Go to ThePhoenix.com, spelled like the city, slash Talking Politics.
[01:49:54.359 --> 01:49:56.381]  The guy's name is David S. Bernstein.
[01:49:59.124 --> 01:50:03.545]  Well, I mean, he probably works for the ADL, so, you know.
[01:50:03.545 --> 01:50:08.727]  So it says there's a little difference between me and the hate on the hate.
[01:50:08.727 --> 01:50:12.328]  They try to tie you with Fox, actually.
[01:50:12.328 --> 01:50:18.710]  Yeah, well, that's the direct talking point of George Soros and Media Matters.
[01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:20.851]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:20.851 --> 01:50:23.952]  This whole article is just disgusting.
[01:50:23.952 --> 01:50:25.212]  You really have to see it for yourself.
[01:50:26.363 --> 01:50:31.406]  Well, coming up next hour, some of these groups are openly saying what we already know they've been doing.
[01:50:31.406 --> 01:50:34.947]  Going to the tea parties with racist signs.
[01:50:34.947 --> 01:50:36.148]  Things like that for the media.
[01:50:36.148 --> 01:50:40.910]  And the media knows who to meet and they show up, set their camera up with their operative and stage it.
[01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:45.553]  But that's why CNN and MSNBC and other channels have almost no viewers now.
[01:50:46.638 --> 01:50:52.427]  I mean, when I say this radio show a day has more viewers than Anderson Cooper, it does.
[01:50:52.427 --> 01:50:58.077]  This show has more viewers than Anderson Cooper, but there's all this prestige.
[01:50:58.077 --> 01:50:59.178]  Oh, look at the aster.
[01:51:01.823 --> 01:51:03.123]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:08.725]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.725 --> 01:51:13.726]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.726 --> 01:51:19.308]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:19.308 --> 01:51:23.989]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.537 --> 01:51:31.642]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.642 --> 01:51:32.763]  And here's the best part.

[01:54:04.113 --> 01:54:12.258]  Okay, coming up at the bottom of the next hour, we're going to get into what's happening with the economy, Obama's Supreme Court picks.
[01:54:12.258 --> 01:54:16.882]  He's looking at Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, and others.
[01:54:16.882 --> 01:54:26.008]  We're also going to get into provocateurs' openly announced plans to stage Tea Party violence to demonize the Tea Parties and claim that they're violent.
[01:54:26.008 --> 01:54:33.773]  We have a full court press claiming that I'm calling for violence on every major news channel out there, Southern Poverty Law Center, you name it.
[01:54:34.433 --> 01:54:36.394]  Why is that happening?
[01:54:36.394 --> 01:54:38.215]  But until the bottom of the hour, Lt.
[01:54:38.215 --> 01:54:38.515]  Col.
[01:54:38.515 --> 01:54:41.776]  Anthony Schaefer joins us via video Skype from Ireland.
[01:54:41.776 --> 01:54:42.117]  Lt.
[01:54:42.117 --> 01:54:42.357]  Col.
[01:54:42.357 --> 01:54:50.720]  Anthony Schaefer is a Bronze Star recipient with more than 25 years of experience in the intelligence community, including directing the Defense Intelligence Agency Task Force Stratus-Ivy.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:55:02.526]  Under his lead, Stratus-Ivy conducted some of the most daring and innovative human intelligence collection and information operation ever undertaken by the Department of Defense, as well as providing information to support the SOCOM program AbleDanger.
[01:55:03.386 --> 01:55:11.688]  And currently he is a senior fellow at the External Communications Director of Special Lecturer at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington, D.C.
[01:55:11.688 --> 01:55:20.991]  He instructs classes in psychology of terrorism and intelligence analysts, and he's also a contributor to many mainstream television programs out there.
[01:55:20.991 --> 01:55:22.231]  Good to have you on.
[01:55:22.231 --> 01:55:27.813]  Now, Colonel Schaffer, can you tell us why you're in Ireland, or is that classified?
[01:55:28.482 --> 01:55:30.503]  No, it's just vacation.
[01:55:30.503 --> 01:55:36.904]  Getting a few days away before the build-up for the book is probably the best way of describing what I'm doing.
[01:55:36.904 --> 01:55:43.606]  Well, you're nice to spend time with us on your vacation there on the Emerald Isle.
[01:55:43.606 --> 01:55:54.710]  Let's start off, there's a lot of subjects to cover with the WikiLeaks video coming out last week with the video of the Apaches and the kids in the van and the Reuters reporter.
[01:55:54.710 --> 01:55:55.690]  Right.
[01:55:57.523 --> 01:55:58.043]  Well, what do you want?
[01:55:58.043 --> 01:56:01.867]  You want me to talk about my assessment of it, or do you want to talk about your assessment of it?
[01:56:01.867 --> 01:56:03.468]  Your assessment of it.
[01:56:03.468 --> 01:56:15.778]  Well, first off, I think that the fact that there was a FOIA in on that video by Reuters, and the Army had resisted releasing it, that was indicative, I think, of what was on the video.
[01:56:15.778 --> 01:56:18.541]  I don't think people really want to have it out there.
[01:56:18.541 --> 01:56:20.683]  As I understand it now, the video's been confirmed as authentic.
[01:56:21.323 --> 01:56:22.644]  And that's the second problem with it.
[01:56:22.644 --> 01:56:26.788]  I think that it's not so much a problem that the Weekly Leaks folks got it.
[01:56:26.788 --> 01:56:32.213]  I think it's a fact that the Army didn't stand up at the time this happened and said, hey, some mistakes were made here.
[01:56:32.213 --> 01:56:33.914]  And let me be clear on why I'm saying that.
[01:56:33.914 --> 01:56:37.958]  And I'm going to say this clearly as an academic, not as an Army Reserve officer.
[01:56:37.958 --> 01:56:40.240]  I'm saying this clearly as an academic.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.103]  There are, from my background and experience from having been in combat,
[01:56:44.804 --> 01:56:58.051]  My understanding of the rules of warfare, especially in this case, the ROE, the specific rules of engagement for this specific period, which I understand are essentially the ones you can find on the internet.
[01:56:58.051 --> 01:57:03.794]  The 2006 rules of engagement are still valid for the most part, and this incident occurred in 2007.
[01:57:03.794 --> 01:57:12.039]  Based on those two factors plus the video, what is seen on the video, there are two clear rules of engagement violations
[01:57:12.699 --> 01:57:14.441]  That I can see.
[01:57:14.441 --> 01:57:20.687]  First, the first clear violation comes right after the attack begins.
[01:57:20.687 --> 01:57:24.070]  And I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the Apache drivers here.
[01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:32.379]  I mean Alex, there's a lot of things going on and I've been told by both former Bush White House executives and folks who were in Iraq.
[01:57:32.981 --> 01:57:37.467]  There are things happening before and after that video regarding combat operations.
[01:57:37.467 --> 01:57:41.373]  Essentially the fog of warfare, the heat of battle, whatever you want to call it.
[01:57:41.373 --> 01:57:47.262]  Yeah, later in the full video they do find some guys with guns going in a building and they fire a Hellfire missile into it.
[01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:56.436]  Well, and I've got to say, I've not seen that part of the video, but I'm just trying to make sure that people understand that there were things going on before and after this video.
[01:57:56.436 --> 01:58:01.860]  So there was essentially an adrenaline rush going on, and I think everybody who was there on the scene.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:03.221]  So you can't discount that.
[01:58:03.221 --> 01:58:03.842]  I've been there.
[01:58:03.842 --> 01:58:06.964]  I understand the fact that you get so focused on what's going on.
[01:58:06.964 --> 01:58:11.308]  It's hard to take a step back and look hard at what's going on.
[01:58:11.308 --> 01:58:14.370]  So giving the benefit of the doubt, Alex, to the Apache drivers,
[01:58:15.211 --> 01:58:20.515]  They misidentified the Reuters journalists with their cameras.
[01:58:20.515 --> 01:58:25.359]  So that's the first mistake, and I think that's forgivable by the fact that it was the heat of battle.
[01:58:25.359 --> 01:58:27.501]  All right, Colonel Schaefer, we got a break.
[01:58:27.501 --> 01:58:29.302]  We're back in one minute with the next hour.
[01:58:29.302 --> 01:58:30.363]  We'll be with us for 30 minutes.
[01:58:30.363 --> 01:58:34.487]  We'll continue where you left off at that point.
[01:58:34.487 --> 01:58:35.768]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:35.768 --> 01:58:39.190]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:39.190 --> 01:58:42.873]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:42.873 --> 01:58:44.074]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.357 --> 01:58:51.421]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.421 --> 01:58:54.443]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.443 --> 01:58:59.747]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.747 --> 01:59:01.808]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.808 --> 01:59:06.812]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.812 --> 01:59:07.992]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.992 --> 01:59:08.733]  When do you want it?
[01:59:09.113 --> 01:59:10.996]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.996 --> 01:59:12.077]  When will you need it?
[01:59:12.077 --> 01:59:14.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:15.622]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.622 --> 01:59:17.144]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:17.144 --> 01:59:22.411]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.411 --> 01:59:25.536]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.976 --> 01:59:29.799]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.799 --> 01:59:31.020]  How much will you need?
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:31.940]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:33.041]  How much do you want?
[01:59:33.041 --> 01:59:33.962]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.962 --> 01:59:35.063]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:35.063 --> 01:59:38.125]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:38.125 --> 01:59:39.886]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:39.886 --> 01:59:40.807]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:54.108 --> 01:59:56.490]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.490 --> 02:00:05.678]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.678 --> 02:00:06.999]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:08.761]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.761 --> 02:00:10.522]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.522 --> 02:00:12.103]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.103 --> 02:00:13.665]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.665 --> 02:00:17.848]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.848 --> 02:00:21.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.623 --> 02:00:30.084]  Well, a lot of the footage is comparable to video games.
[02:00:30.084 --> 02:00:31.345]  But this isn't a video game.
[02:00:31.345 --> 02:00:32.365]  This is life and death.
[02:00:32.365 --> 02:00:37.766]  And some said, well, hey, these people were in a war zone, these Reuters reporters, this van full of kids.
[02:00:37.766 --> 02:00:40.787]  You know, that's their problem.
[02:00:40.787 --> 02:00:46.049]  But the war zone is a urban built-up area in a major city in Iraq.
[02:00:47.129 --> 02:00:53.214]  And the Pentagon blocked this being released, and this is the type of stuff that happens in war, in modern war.
[02:00:53.214 --> 02:00:56.156]  So then you have to ask, is this then a just war?
[02:00:56.156 --> 02:01:02.241]  Before you go invade a country and knowing there's going to be this type of collateral damage, you better make sure your nation is under threat.
[02:01:02.241 --> 02:01:09.647]  We know they lied about WMDs and everything else, but Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, it was by Tony Schaefer, is our guest.
[02:01:09.647 --> 02:01:10.707]  Very nice to be joining us.
[02:01:10.707 --> 02:01:12.189]  You got cut off by the break.
[02:01:12.189 --> 02:01:14.110]  This is a short segment as well.
[02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:16.232]  Continue with the points you were making.
[02:01:16.991 --> 02:01:20.672]  All right, well, and I agree with your point on the whole justification of the war thing, Alex.
[02:01:20.672 --> 02:01:21.792]  You and I talked about it a little bit.
[02:01:21.792 --> 02:01:27.374]  I think, frankly, you and I talked about this, and I'll say it for the benefit of your listeners.
[02:01:27.374 --> 02:01:30.575]  I think there's other ways we could have taken care of Iraq without a full-blown invasion.
[02:01:30.575 --> 02:01:33.256]  With that said, though, I think that's a topic for another day.
[02:01:33.256 --> 02:01:44.159]  But back to this specific video, giving the benefit of the doubt to the Apache drivers in the heat of the moment, I think there could have been justification regarding the misidentification of
[02:01:44.839 --> 02:01:48.963]  The, uh, the bags as either weapons or RPGs, maybe.
[02:01:48.963 --> 02:01:51.585]  I'm pretty dubious, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
[02:01:51.585 --> 02:01:57.550]  The mistakes I saw, which were the clear violations, Alex, were first off, right after they got clearance to fire.
[02:01:57.550 --> 02:02:03.755]  Once they fired, uh, they should have essentially stopped then and paused and tried to figure out what was going on.
[02:02:03.755 --> 02:02:09.680]  And one of the things, one of the clear rules that were broken is it says once you, once someone is down, you quit shooting.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.862]  They didn't quit shooting, they made sure these guys were dead.
[02:02:12.262 --> 02:02:15.383]  Now, as an intelligence officer, I said this on the air, that's stupid.
[02:02:15.383 --> 02:02:20.545]  As an intelligence officer, you want to capture people to find out what their affiliation is, why they were doing what they were doing.
[02:02:20.545 --> 02:02:22.426]  Clearly, this was not good common sense.
[02:02:22.426 --> 02:02:31.269]  This is not something... and frankly, if I were the commander and I saw this on the battlefield, I would have stopped those soldiers right there and either... and done something, because that's not the way you should conduct yourself.
[02:02:32.113 --> 02:02:44.182]  Now let's fast forward to the ban, and this is something I think has become a very big point of contention, which I frankly think is a huge mistake both for the PR war and another clear violation of the rules of engagement.
[02:02:44.182 --> 02:02:50.787]  When the Reuters reporter was on the ground crawling away, they were waiting, they were trying to egg him on, hoping he'd pick up a weapon.
[02:02:50.787 --> 02:02:57.933]  As I said before, once a person's down, you're obligated to go in there and render aid and try to capture them and find out what's going on.
[02:02:58.593 --> 02:03:05.739]  When the van shows up to give him aid, and Alex, I've watched the video at least three times to make sure I understood it correctly.
[02:03:05.739 --> 02:03:16.128]  First off, if you look at the video carefully, you see people are in the van and there is no indication from the van at any point in time that it was a threat.
[02:03:16.128 --> 02:03:22.154]  And this is where it clearly states that you have to have a clearly defined threat before you fire and use deadly force.
[02:03:23.114 --> 02:03:26.878]  In this case, it was very clear there was no threat from that van.
[02:03:26.878 --> 02:03:30.101]  That van was there to render aid for that individual.
[02:03:30.101 --> 02:03:31.482]  Now, there's reports out on this.
[02:03:31.482 --> 02:03:32.863]  I'm not sure if you found copies yet or not.
[02:03:32.863 --> 02:03:34.044]  I've been able to read the reports.
[02:03:34.044 --> 02:03:35.526]  I don't have a copy of them.
[02:03:35.526 --> 02:03:47.216]  Something called AR-15-6, Army Regulation 15-6 Investigative Reports, which are essentially a fact-finding investigation directed by the commander to go through and assess what happened.
[02:03:47.216 --> 02:03:48.998]  Within the reports related to this incident,
[02:03:49.498 --> 02:03:56.229]  It talks about the fact that there were vehicles out that day, four-door sedans, running weapons to insurgents.
[02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:59.854]  Well, it's very clear from the video that that was not a four-door sedan, it was fired on.
[02:03:59.854 --> 02:04:04.541]  So, apparently in the investigation they tried to say, well, we misidentified the van.
[02:04:05.382 --> 02:04:06.883]  I don't think that's possible.
[02:04:06.883 --> 02:04:10.584]  I think the van is very clearly identified as a van, not as a four-door sedan.
[02:04:10.584 --> 02:04:18.746]  So, in my professional judgment, both on my experience in Afghanistan, having been in urban warfare, having to make no-shoot decisions,
[02:04:20.807 --> 02:04:26.370]  And on the rules of engagement, the two clear violations were continuing to fire once the individuals were down.
[02:04:26.370 --> 02:04:31.573]  And of course, firing on the van when there was no hostile threat indicated, as a matter of fact, it was the contrary.
[02:04:31.573 --> 02:04:36.496]  It indicated, for the most part, that those people were trying to render aid to that individual.
[02:04:36.496 --> 02:04:42.960]  Which, again, as an intelligence officer, they could have monitored that van, they could have followed it, and as you see in the video,
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:43.680]  U.S.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.482]  forces show up within minutes of the incident to secure the area.
[02:04:47.482 --> 02:04:48.823]  Colonel Schaefer, stay there.
[02:04:48.823 --> 02:04:50.004]  Long segment coming up.
[02:04:50.004 --> 02:04:54.366]  Let's get your conclusion on this and then talk about the nature of modern warfare.
[02:04:54.366 --> 02:04:55.087]  Period.
[02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:55.587]  Straight ahead.
[02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:02.252]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.252 --> 02:05:07.838]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.838 --> 02:05:12.865]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:12.865 --> 02:05:17.911]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:05:18.431 --> 02:05:23.654]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:23.654 --> 02:05:25.975]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:05:25.975 --> 02:05:30.778]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:30.778 --> 02:05:31.898]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:31.898 --> 02:05:34.960]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:38.242]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:38.582 --> 02:05:41.765]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:41.765 --> 02:05:43.987]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:43.987 --> 02:05:44.928]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:44.928 --> 02:05:45.328]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:45.328 --> 02:05:48.571]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:48.571 --> 02:05:50.313]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:02.469 --> 02:06:06.430]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:15.293]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:15.293 --> 02:06:19.914]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:19.914 --> 02:06:30.737]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:31.377 --> 02:06:40.886]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:40.886 --> 02:06:46.331]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:46.331 --> 02:06:53.817]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:53.817 --> 02:06:56.580]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:02.413 --> 02:07:04.554]  You're subject to public police action.
[02:07:04.554 --> 02:07:05.814]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.814 --> 02:07:09.736]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.736 --> 02:07:11.977]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.977 --> 02:07:17.839]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.839 --> 02:07:24.061]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.501 --> 02:07:30.486]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.486 --> 02:07:34.670]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.670 --> 02:07:38.953]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.953 --> 02:07:44.898]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.898 --> 02:07:48.461]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:50.442]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.442 --> 02:07:50.883]  It's here.

[02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:12.811]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.811 --> 02:08:14.351]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.351 --> 02:08:18.553]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.553 --> 02:08:23.375]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.375 --> 02:08:25.836]  Well, our trusted Bilderberg sleuth,
[02:08:26.856 --> 02:08:31.259]  Jim Tucker has discovered and confirmed the city it is to be in, in Spain.
[02:08:31.259 --> 02:08:34.361]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[02:08:34.361 --> 02:08:40.325]  For the next 25 minutes, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer is our guest.
[02:08:40.325 --> 02:08:44.808]  And you can check out the website c4ads.org.
[02:08:44.808 --> 02:08:55.856]  He's got a new book coming out very soon that's going to have a lot of new revealing information about how the army was stopped from killing bin Laden and other senior leadership of al-Qaeda in the months and weeks before 9-11.
[02:08:56.676 --> 02:08:57.677]  I don't
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:20.961]  Because, you know, I've seen old gun pod footage of fighter pilots in Vietnam.
[02:09:20.961 --> 02:09:25.183]  They weren't giggling and snickering and this bloodlust.
[02:09:25.183 --> 02:09:27.483]  And we see footage of some of the troops.
[02:09:27.483 --> 02:09:32.025]  It's a minority, you know, getting off on shooting dogs or throwing dogs off cliffs.
[02:09:32.025 --> 02:09:34.026]  They've two, three, four tours.
[02:09:34.026 --> 02:09:35.786]  Something a military's never been forced to do.
[02:09:35.786 --> 02:09:39.187]  You know, some of these guys are coming back and are completely bonkers.
[02:09:39.187 --> 02:09:43.989]  But I think for the average citizen to see these gun pod footage,
[02:09:44.489 --> 02:09:56.353]  Shows them what is an everyday thing going on out there, and the way people are now disconnected from what soldiers for thousands of years have faced, killing their enemy, right up looking them in the eyes.
[02:09:56.353 --> 02:10:02.515]  And we see the ground troops show up, and they show empathy for the children that are in the minivan that's been shot to hell.
[02:10:04.356 --> 02:10:08.259]  The helicopter pilot and the gunner say, ah, shouldn't be in a war zone.
[02:10:08.259 --> 02:10:15.404]  And so we see not just the people on the ground being dehumanized, but we see the people in the helicopters being dehumanized.
[02:10:16.434 --> 02:10:26.399]  Well, I agree with you, and this is one of those things where, again, if I were the commander and I witnessed that, those soldiers would have been relieved on the spot because, like I said, that is exactly the point.
[02:10:26.399 --> 02:10:32.221]  All combat, especially the people I've been in combat with, do not conduct themselves in that manner.
[02:10:32.221 --> 02:10:38.024]  Anytime you have to take a life, you need to be reverent in the fact that you are doing it.
[02:10:38.744 --> 02:10:45.010]  And as you mentioned, my book, The Dark Side of the Force, is coming out later this year, last day of August.
[02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:56.220]  And, you know, one of the first incidents in that book I talk about, my first combat convoy, I have to make a choice about shooting or not shooting an 8-year-old kid who throws a Sun Juice
[02:10:57.861 --> 02:11:23.960]  Empty box in front of the vehicle in front of me and I and I would have been right to shoot the kid by the rules of engagement I didn't and this is one of those things was a win-win for the Taliban if I shot the kid that's good because you know we shot a kid and that's that's a score for them and if I didn't shoot him that makes me less less likely to shoot a kid next time if he does have a bomb in his hand so this is the nature of modern warfare it's one of those things where there's no right answers but if you pick the right
[02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:27.501]  If you pick the wrong answer, it's going to be hurtful no matter what.
[02:11:27.501 --> 02:11:28.921]  And let's not kid ourselves.
[02:11:28.921 --> 02:11:31.322]  This is a war of images.
[02:11:31.322 --> 02:11:33.623]  A war of information.
[02:11:33.623 --> 02:11:35.683]  And, you know, you have Infowars.com.
[02:11:35.683 --> 02:11:39.764]  That is a brilliant way of displaying information relating to what is really going on.
[02:11:39.764 --> 02:11:43.585]  This is one of those things, Alex, we have to be better than the adversary.
[02:11:43.585 --> 02:11:48.767]  If you recall, the Taliban came out with a 29-point code of conduct last year.
[02:11:49.407 --> 02:11:49.707]  I think?
[02:12:05.233 --> 02:12:08.216]  I'm sorry, 69 point code of conduct.
[02:12:08.216 --> 02:12:09.598]  This is where we're better than they are.
[02:12:09.598 --> 02:12:11.920]  And frankly, this is one of the points I'd like to say.
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:17.945]  I'm not speaking for the Army, but the Army and the DOD is actually going to relook this now because it's the right thing to do.
[02:12:17.945 --> 02:12:22.710]  We need to look at the circumstance of why, why was it the soldiers were so apt to shoot that day?
[02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:26.894]  Clearly, it's not only a training issue, it's a psychological issue.
[02:12:26.894 --> 02:12:32.959]  And let's not forget, Alex, that we have record number of suicides from post-traumatic stress.
[02:12:32.959 --> 02:12:37.363]  I think this is why you're seeing such a great number of post-traumatic stress issues.
[02:12:37.363 --> 02:12:40.666]  Because people are not doing the right thing, necessarily.
[02:12:40.666 --> 02:12:45.430]  Commanders are obligated to train and equip their soldiers to win.
[02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:47.652]  But then also, they're responsible for holding them back.
[02:12:47.652 --> 02:12:48.613]  Because, as you point out,
[02:12:49.153 --> 02:12:51.795]  Through our history, we have been better than this.
[02:12:51.795 --> 02:12:53.877]  We're obligated to try to pull people back.
[02:12:53.877 --> 02:12:55.538]  And we also had Vietnam.
[02:12:55.538 --> 02:12:58.541]  We had the Malay Massacre.
[02:12:58.541 --> 02:13:01.984]  So we have had a record of people going off the reservation.
[02:13:01.984 --> 02:13:03.325]  I'd like to believe that's the exception.
[02:13:03.325 --> 02:13:07.909]  But we've got to be better about the way we conduct modern warfare because things like this do matter.
[02:13:07.909 --> 02:13:10.771]  And it shapes the Al-Qaeda battle space.
[02:13:10.771 --> 02:13:13.173]  This video will help Al-Qaeda recruit.
[02:13:13.173 --> 02:13:14.174]  And we both know that.
[02:13:14.963 --> 02:13:16.806]  Okay let's expand on this though.
[02:13:16.806 --> 02:13:26.438]  Take a movie like Apocalypse Now with Colonel Kurtz who's gone completely insane and so the military sends out a special operator to kill him.
[02:13:29.923 --> 02:13:40.688]  But now I read John Yoo memos, I read Alberto Gonzalez memos, guys that have never been in the military, never been in combat, and they're saying we can crush children's genitals, we can torture children.
[02:13:40.688 --> 02:13:42.688]  The military's given this.
[02:13:42.688 --> 02:13:48.211]  The Pentagon hires jail guards and people who've been fired from federal jails for abuse.
[02:13:49.151 --> 02:13:54.055]  General Togumbo's own report says raping children, raping people with acid.
[02:13:54.055 --> 02:13:55.556]  I mean, this is in the Army report.
[02:13:55.556 --> 02:13:57.337]  Far worse than those images.
[02:13:57.337 --> 02:14:12.708]  Why on earth would the Pentagon accept directives from the Bush White House knowing that once this was implemented, this would absolutely destroy morale and turn us into the Nazis in the eyes of the world?
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.261]  Well, I think that's the answer.
[02:14:15.261 --> 02:14:18.924]  The answer to your question is within your question.
[02:14:18.924 --> 02:14:23.107]  I think a lot of those policies were established for retribution more than actual intelligence collection.
[02:14:23.107 --> 02:14:27.770]  The Army put out a policy a few years ago saying we will follow a very strict regimen of
[02:14:29.992 --> 02:14:35.480]  Basically techniques, non-intrusive, non-violent techniques to break people.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:43.471]  Again, I cite from my book, there's two chapters about an FBI special agent and I working to interrogate and break.
[02:14:43.471 --> 02:14:46.314]  I mean, we didn't touch him once, but within three days we were able to break him.
[02:14:47.155 --> 02:15:01.701]  But by use of really good investigative and interrogation techniques not and I think based on my experience You can get people to talk you don't have to teach them touch them You don't have to torture them, but in a lot of times as you know you know
[02:15:02.261 --> 02:15:03.402]  Let's take Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[02:15:03.402 --> 02:15:04.003]  He confessed
[02:15:17.398 --> 02:15:20.662]  After 100 plus water boardings, they finally threatened his family.
[02:15:20.662 --> 02:15:24.286]  You know, they finally said, well, something bad's gonna happen to your kids and wife if you don't.
[02:15:24.286 --> 02:15:29.373]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till four years after he was arrested.
[02:15:29.373 --> 02:15:33.558]  He almost confessed to sinking the Titanic or killing Kennedy.
[02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:35.059]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:15:35.899 --> 02:15:42.044]  Well, I think this brings up an excellent problem for the prosecutions we're now going to face for the 9-11 terrorists.
[02:15:42.044 --> 02:15:44.946]  I mean, I'm sorry, the detainees at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:15:44.946 --> 02:15:51.291]  Which is similar to anybody who has something to do with 9-11 regarding the techniques you just mentioned.
[02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:54.293]  Anytime you torture someone, Alex, the fact is this.
[02:15:54.293 --> 02:15:58.276]  They're going to tell you whatever you want to know to make the pain stop.
[02:15:58.276 --> 02:15:59.737]  And that's been proven over and over again.
[02:16:00.077 --> 02:16:03.878]  So again, it's one of those things where I think there are some other very advanced techniques.
[02:16:03.878 --> 02:16:13.041]  One of the 9-11 conspirators were broken by very complex techniques relating to the fact that he was a pedophile.
[02:16:13.041 --> 02:16:18.022]  So in this one instance, they used the idea that his personal conduct
[02:16:18.562 --> 02:16:25.311]  Was directly in contrast and contradiction to his personal beliefs relating to a law and his faith.
[02:16:25.311 --> 02:16:35.764]  So enough of hitting him on that, not hitting him literally, but hitting him with the idea of the disconnect between his personal conduct and his personal beliefs is what broke him eventually.
[02:16:36.184 --> 02:16:37.205]  And this is the idea.
[02:16:37.205 --> 02:16:42.008]  You need to get inside these people's heads, these individuals' heads, and break them without touching them.
[02:16:42.008 --> 02:16:49.273]  So when you look at the interrogation program, I personally turned down a seat in that program.
[02:16:49.273 --> 02:16:55.997]  I talk about that a little bit in my book, about being given a tour of one of the secret prisons and then saying, you know, I've been asked, what do you think?
[02:16:55.997 --> 02:17:01.140]  It's like, look, I basically said, just to read ahead in the book here, I want nothing to do with this.
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:03.502]  And frankly, that's the problem.
[02:17:03.502 --> 02:17:04.983]  I think when you have
[02:17:06.043 --> 02:17:11.206]  A policy set up by an administration, Alex, the Army or the military is obligated to follow it.
[02:17:11.206 --> 02:17:18.009]  And that's one of those things where you have lawyers, hopefully lawyers who are smart enough to understand that you can't arbitrarily decide to start breaking U.S.
[02:17:18.009 --> 02:17:26.133]  laws and I frankly read the memos done by the Bush White House lawyers as being illegal, approving illegal activities.
[02:17:26.753 --> 02:17:33.317]  Which, frankly, you know, we as soldiers are obligated to try to resist illegal orders.
[02:17:33.317 --> 02:17:35.118]  And you were told that in your training.
[02:17:35.118 --> 02:17:38.560]  It is your obligation to not follow illegal orders.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:50.767]  It becomes a very fine line between following orders which are given by lawful authority, which we're trained to do, or trying to find a way to not follow or disabuse yourself of illegal orders.
[02:17:51.007 --> 02:17:57.112]  Well, I mean, you just talked about it being illegal, and clearly it is illegal on the face of it, and immoral.
[02:17:57.112 --> 02:18:03.818]  But now we have Obama continuing snatch and grab, more black sites have been exposed all over Europe and Asia.
[02:18:03.818 --> 02:18:11.465]  We know this is intensifying, not subsiding, and so I guess they got away with it, so now it's secret policy in the CIA.
[02:18:12.426 --> 02:18:20.030]  Speaking as an academic, every administration who comes in tends to take on the tools which the previous administration used and were successful in using.
[02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:28.875]  So frankly, you know, I don't believe there's going to be any great difference between the Bush White House and the Obama administration on a number of these policy issues.
[02:18:28.875 --> 02:18:33.238]  And let's cite, for example, Alex, the Kill Capture program.
[02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:40.202]  I've said on Fox News a couple different times recently that the Obama administration's been, their default position is killing people.
[02:18:40.602 --> 02:18:44.985]  That's something I find totally idiotic as an intelligence officer.
[02:18:44.985 --> 02:18:48.387]  The idea is you need to capture people and find out what they know.
[02:18:48.387 --> 02:18:53.430]  So because they don't want to deal with the issues relating to what do we do with detainees?
[02:18:53.430 --> 02:18:56.092]  Do we put them on trial in a civilian court?
[02:18:56.092 --> 02:18:57.693]  Do we do military tribunals?
[02:18:57.693 --> 02:19:03.537]  Because they don't want to deal with that, now the default position is killing people, which you've read about recently with the issue of Al-Awlaki.
[02:19:04.437 --> 02:19:13.183]  Apparently, according to the news reports over the past two weeks, there is now essentially a death warrant been issued for him to be killed, if possible, by U.S.
[02:19:13.183 --> 02:19:15.244]  or Yemeni forces on site.
[02:19:15.244 --> 02:19:20.428]  So this is something clearly that I think is a bit... I think we should be defaulting.
[02:19:20.428 --> 02:19:23.129]  Our default position should be capturing these individuals.
[02:19:23.129 --> 02:19:25.611]  And if we really can't, then I think we need to look at it.
[02:19:25.611 --> 02:19:27.852]  But we should be capturing them.
[02:19:27.852 --> 02:19:32.656]  And frankly, the other problem with this is that in the extremist belief, Alex,
[02:19:33.516 --> 02:19:35.277]  Being a martyr is a great thing.
[02:19:35.277 --> 02:19:39.018]  I think we need to avoid giving them that opportunity to be a martyr.
[02:19:39.018 --> 02:19:43.639]  This includes Al-Awlaki and this includes Bin Laden, if he's still alive.
[02:19:43.639 --> 02:19:46.600]  Well, I mean Osama Bin Laden, let's cut right to the chase.
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:49.861]  He trained in the 80s, worked with the CIA.
[02:19:49.861 --> 02:19:54.382]  We know the Muslim brigades have been used to destabilize countries the West doesn't like.
[02:19:54.382 --> 02:19:57.703]  They were used against the Soviets, they're being used against the Russians.
[02:19:57.703 --> 02:20:00.664]  Today, it's a convenient boogeyman out there.
[02:20:02.044 --> 02:20:09.847]  We know the underwear bomber was allowed on the plane, protected, given a visa by the U.S., an unnamed intelligence agency told the State Department this.
[02:20:09.847 --> 02:20:11.288]  This is on record.
[02:20:11.288 --> 02:20:13.749]  And then we get the internal Homeland Security documents.
[02:20:13.749 --> 02:20:20.211]  Most of Homeland Security now and NORTHCOM is set up for the American people, returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives.
[02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:22.753]  Law enforcement gave us those documents last year.
[02:20:22.753 --> 02:20:24.553]  They were confirmed to be accurate.
[02:20:24.553 --> 02:20:29.375]  And the Pentagon was hopping mad and so was Homeland Security that we got them.
[02:20:29.375 --> 02:20:30.756]  But when we really look at this,
[02:20:31.656 --> 02:20:31.936]  All right.
[02:21:01.976 --> 02:21:03.977]  We know the Russians have staged terror.
[02:21:03.977 --> 02:21:06.559]  We know our own government has Operation Northwoods.
[02:21:06.559 --> 02:21:13.222]  What can you say about government actually being behind some of the terrorism in history?
[02:21:13.222 --> 02:21:16.684]  Well, Alex, I gotta stick with what I know to be the fact.
[02:21:16.684 --> 02:21:20.986]  I mean, some of these references you've mentioned I have not read.
[02:21:20.986 --> 02:21:22.367]  I can't speak to things I don't know.
[02:21:22.367 --> 02:21:23.388]  Do you know about Northwoods?
[02:21:24.161 --> 02:21:25.922]  Well, I don't know much about that.
[02:21:25.922 --> 02:21:27.283]  I've not studied that.
[02:21:27.283 --> 02:21:35.349]  But what I will say is that there's clearly, as of late, a tendency to start looking at internal threats more than external.
[02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:41.113]  Now, I cut my teeth as a lieutenant doing counterterrorism stuff in Germany back in the mid-eighties.
[02:21:41.833 --> 02:21:51.865]  And it was very clear then, and I'm not sure what changed between then and now in many aspects, but I know back then we were very much concerned about the Soviets funding radical groups within Germany.
[02:21:51.865 --> 02:21:59.014]  As a matter of fact, my first counter-terrorism operations were focused on the RAF sports group Hoffman and things like that.
[02:21:59.574 --> 02:22:05.858]  Whereas very clearly a third party, a third organization being the Soviet Union, was funding a lot of that activity.
[02:22:05.858 --> 02:22:11.461]  As noted by the fact that once the Cold War ended, a lot of these groups faded off into the distance and never came back.
[02:22:11.461 --> 02:22:19.866]  I think that we have to be very cognizant of the fact that there is some real, you know, energy been given now to our government looking internally.
[02:22:19.966 --> 02:22:32.594]  And I think in some cases it is not warranted by the fact that yes, you're going to have veterans coming back with clear psychological problems, but the way to deal with that is by giving them the treatment they need, not treating them as adversaries.
[02:22:32.594 --> 02:22:39.118]  I think that's one of the things that has been trending lately is to look at people who have come back and have problems as an internal enemy.
[02:22:39.118 --> 02:22:42.981]  But more than that, what are your Pentagon associates saying about the fact that
[02:22:44.021 --> 02:22:47.203]  I mean, as you admit, more of this is being swung around internally.
[02:22:47.203 --> 02:22:49.164]  From my research, I mean, here's an example.
[02:22:49.164 --> 02:23:07.216]  It came out in the Baltimore Sun that Ron Paul and myself and others, and we ended up getting the secret army document, which they confirmed was real, so there's good guys in the military sent it to us, that when I go out and have an in-the-fed rally, they've got military army intelligence watching me, and it says in the memo, don't let them know you're with the army.
[02:23:08.037 --> 02:23:10.283]  They may be terrorists and may kill you.
[02:23:10.283 --> 02:23:14.855]  So they're teaching the army that I'm like some vampire that's gonna try to tear their throat out?
[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:24.302]  There's a number of legal problems with that, and one of the things I came up against during Able Danger, which was the issue of posse comitatus, and I think it's a very good law for a number of reasons.
[02:23:24.302 --> 02:23:32.403]  First off, as you just mentioned, it is illegal for the Army to be augmenting directly civil law enforcement operations.
[02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:33.723]  That is clearly illegal.
[02:23:33.723 --> 02:23:43.665]  So that's one of those things that I know people like Senator Arlen Specter were very much against the idea of allowing folks to be used for purposes of law enforcement, and there's good reasons for it.
[02:23:44.305 --> 02:23:54.434]  And this is something that harkens back to the 1960s, where it was equally a bad idea then to use military intelligence folks for civil law enforcement, and I think it's the same thing now, if this is going on.
[02:23:54.434 --> 02:24:00.220]  Now, I don't know of anyone within my circle of associates and friends who have been involved in that.
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.741]  It's not to say I don't know what's happening.
[02:24:02.741 --> 02:24:03.722]  I personally don't know.
[02:24:03.722 --> 02:24:04.622]  I've not been involved.
[02:24:04.622 --> 02:24:07.264]  I don't know any one of my intelligence friends who've been involved.
[02:24:07.264 --> 02:24:17.890]  But I know there's been contingency planning done to look at how the military could be brought in to support civil unrest, support the civil authorities during times of civil unrest.
[02:24:17.890 --> 02:24:22.973]  Now that's something that I know has been kicked around a lot over the past 30 years, frankly.
[02:24:22.973 --> 02:24:26.235]  The idea of coming in at a time of crisis to actually... Rex 84!
[02:24:26.235 --> 02:24:27.436]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:24:28.176 --> 02:24:37.647]  I mean, I literally, in the last 10 years, have had guys get out, they're obviously military in plain clothes, and even threaten me in parking lots.
[02:24:37.647 --> 02:24:40.831]  I have national news everywhere saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not.
[02:24:40.831 --> 02:24:44.315]  Does it sound to you, Colonel, like they're trying to set me up for something?
[02:24:45.051 --> 02:24:47.552]  Well, it sounds like any other whisper campaign.
[02:24:47.552 --> 02:24:53.174]  I mean, Alex, as you know, I was victimized by a whisper campaign by the Pentagon as well when I first broke ranks.
[02:24:53.174 --> 02:24:59.357]  I think there's something else that you need to look at here regarding the fact that when, you know, there's something called CEPA.
[02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:00.217]  Are you familiar with CEPA?
[02:25:00.757 --> 02:25:09.605]  The counterintelligence, yeah, that, everything that I've heard about that was, I hate to use this as a term, but it was like Darth Vader's Vanguard.
[02:25:09.605 --> 02:25:13.669]  The fact that those people were, they had no interest in counterintelligence.
[02:25:13.669 --> 02:25:18.114]  They were essentially, as I understand it, Steve Cambone's Dirty Tricks folks.
[02:25:18.114 --> 02:25:25.561]  And they, in one case, they were surveilling a Secret Service special agent whose father
[02:25:26.121 --> 02:25:27.342]  Well, it's getting really creepy.
[02:25:45.351 --> 02:25:55.535]  And that's one of those things that I think that this is why I spoke out against the use of blackwater contractors as some form of mercenary.
[02:25:55.535 --> 02:26:01.497]  And this is where there's been a real gray area, Alec, that we have to look at by the fact that I think that there's some real
[02:26:02.457 --> 02:26:08.982]  Uh, loopholes that have been used by the military and by the intelligence organizations to hire folks who serve in these roles.
[02:26:08.982 --> 02:26:11.184]  It's a very murky gray area.
[02:26:11.184 --> 02:26:15.607]  And, for example, in Afghanistan, the CIA, Babatel recently denied it.
[02:26:15.607 --> 02:26:19.030]  I was there to handle two of the KIAs from CIA.
[02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:21.471]  Or there was Blackwater back in 2003.
[02:26:21.471 --> 02:26:29.858]  So, there's, this is a loophole that a number of organizations have used to hire people off the street who have military background to do things which I think,
[02:26:30.798 --> 02:26:34.059]  If they were shown to be in the light of day, they would be shown to be illegal.
[02:26:34.059 --> 02:26:40.602]  And this is where people have tried to get around posse comitatus, ways of trying to influence the thinking of adversaries.
[02:26:40.602 --> 02:26:45.744]  You know, frankly, some people just don't appreciate people like you and others who speak out.
[02:26:45.744 --> 02:26:47.445]  And I think that's... But, Carl, now we're learning!
[02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:48.025]  We're good to go.
[02:27:07.199 --> 02:27:18.103]  It's just for the general public out there, I don't think they realize that this whole black op or slash contractor, they may be contractors, are just out there really intimidating people, surveilling people.
[02:27:18.103 --> 02:27:19.183]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[02:27:19.183 --> 02:27:27.366]  I can't wait till August to have you on to really, really go over the book in detail and I hope people will order it because I know I'm going to read it and it's going to be extremely informative, Colonel Schaefer.
[02:27:27.366 --> 02:27:31.247]  But in closing, shifting gears out to what happened in Poland.
[02:27:31.567 --> 02:27:38.478]  Do you think it's suspicious that the almost entire leadership of the Polish government's aircraft went down?
[02:27:39.619 --> 02:27:40.579]  Well, I get it.
[02:27:40.579 --> 02:27:41.500]  There's two parts to it.
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:47.982]  First, you know, it's like the old, whenever someone had a cold in Soviet leadership, you know, that was a bad sign.
[02:27:47.982 --> 02:27:52.304]  I think, you know, a cold is not a cold when it comes to Soviets.
[02:27:52.304 --> 02:27:55.085]  This may be something that people need to look at as well.
[02:27:55.085 --> 02:28:06.249]  From what I understand, the Polish president was very independent, and I think that the fact that everybody went down together in these questionable circumstances, you've got to look at that very hard.
[02:28:09.051 --> 02:28:13.993]  The Tupelov, which crashed, frankly, has a horrible, horrible record.
[02:28:13.993 --> 02:28:21.757]  When I flew back from Afghanistan, I flew through Tashkent, and the airline that I was supposed to fly back on flew a lot of those.
[02:28:21.757 --> 02:28:26.780]  Fortunately for me, they had pretty much grounded all the Tupelovs, and were now using Boeing aircraft.
[02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:30.802]  So that aircraft by itself has had a hugely poor safety record.
[02:28:30.802 --> 02:28:33.283]  But it is stupid to put that much leadership in one aircraft.
[02:28:33.883 --> 02:28:34.803]  Well, you never do it.
[02:28:34.803 --> 02:28:36.844]  I mean, I think that's the mistake.
[02:28:36.844 --> 02:28:39.766]  That's an amateur mistake, Alex.
[02:28:39.766 --> 02:28:41.386]  You should never make that mistake.
[02:28:41.386 --> 02:28:49.950]  Especially when you have basically the entire military general staff, pretty much every major officer within the government and the civilian side.
[02:28:49.950 --> 02:28:52.371]  You've got to ask yourself, why would they do that?
[02:28:52.371 --> 02:28:56.233]  Especially with an aircraft, as I mentioned, with that kind of poor safety record.
[02:28:56.673 --> 02:28:58.174]  Colonel, we've only got one minute left.
[02:28:58.174 --> 02:29:00.216]  You wanted to make a comment on the bombing in Ireland.
[02:29:00.216 --> 02:29:01.777]  What's your take on that?
[02:29:01.777 --> 02:29:10.905]  Well, you know, I think it's, frankly, from what I've seen from being here just a little bit of time, is that there's still a great deal of dissension within Northern Ireland.
[02:29:10.905 --> 02:29:12.546]  I think there's some chaos there.
[02:29:12.546 --> 02:29:16.189]  I think that as things settle in, you're going to see a few things like this.
[02:29:16.189 --> 02:29:20.652]  But I think the good news is, if there's any good news, is the fact that I think things have been reduced.
[02:29:20.652 --> 02:29:22.514]  You don't have these mass bombings.
[02:29:22.514 --> 02:29:24.716]  If nothing else, there was no casualties in this.
[02:29:25.316 --> 02:29:26.817]  I think it was meant to send a message.
[02:29:26.817 --> 02:29:32.540]  So, at least here, I believe, I think they're on a downhill run of terrorism being an effective tool.
[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:37.302]  I'm hoping that people understand that, you know, that things here are pretty much settled, I think.
[02:29:37.302 --> 02:29:39.043]  But in other places, they're not.
[02:29:39.043 --> 02:29:44.406]  I think that, you know, anytime we look at terrorism, we have to look realistically at long-term threats.
[02:29:44.406 --> 02:29:47.667]  Another thing that I'd like to bring up briefly, we can talk about another time, is Al Qaeda.
[02:29:47.667 --> 02:29:51.549]  President Obama made a statement which I think is very accurate about... Hold on, Colonel!
[02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:53.090]  Hold on, let me at least say bye to him!
[02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:54.631]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.638 --> 02:30:01.399]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.399 --> 02:30:08.041]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.041 --> 02:30:13.182]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.182 --> 02:30:21.904]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:21.904 --> 02:30:24.205]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:28.267]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:30:30.413 --> 02:30:34.996]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:30:34.996 --> 02:30:38.818]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:30:38.818 --> 02:30:40.059]  Others don't.
[02:30:40.059 --> 02:30:42.220]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:44.001]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:46.883]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:46.883 --> 02:30:53.507]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.507 --> 02:30:56.209]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:56.209 --> 02:30:58.590]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:59.451]  Others don't.
[02:31:01.479 --> 02:31:04.502]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.502 --> 02:31:09.827]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:11.568]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.568 --> 02:31:16.873]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.873 --> 02:31:18.074]  How much do you want?
[02:31:18.074 --> 02:31:19.195]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.195 --> 02:31:21.077]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:21.077 --> 02:31:22.158]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.158 --> 02:31:24.360]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:25.701]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.701 --> 02:31:26.982]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.202 --> 02:31:32.463]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.463 --> 02:31:36.044]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:36.044 --> 02:31:39.865]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.865 --> 02:31:41.085]  How much will you need?
[02:31:41.085 --> 02:31:42.006]  We don't know.
[02:31:42.006 --> 02:31:43.086]  How much do you want?
[02:31:43.086 --> 02:31:44.026]  All you can get.
[02:31:44.026 --> 02:31:45.126]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:45.126 --> 02:31:48.187]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:32:00.851 --> 02:32:02.012]  What's your home worth?
[02:32:02.012 --> 02:32:04.133]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:32:04.133 --> 02:32:07.174]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[02:33:04.625 --> 02:33:07.647]  Colonel Tony Schaffer has been really nice giving us his time.
[02:33:07.647 --> 02:33:09.187]  He's on vacation in Ireland.
[02:33:09.187 --> 02:33:13.249]  We're gonna let him go here in just a few minutes, but putting bookends on this.
[02:33:13.249 --> 02:33:16.291]  Get into your Al-Qaeda point, but what is Al-Qaeda?
[02:33:16.291 --> 02:33:22.134]  We know it's a Brzezinski computer file at the CIA in 1979.
[02:33:22.134 --> 02:33:29.077]  We know it's a term used to try to simplistically label, I guess, Wahhabist sects out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:33:29.077 --> 02:33:30.198]  We know those do exist.
[02:33:30.678 --> 02:33:38.281]  We know there's different factions in Saudi Arabia and Princeton, where you've got different princes fighting with each other.
[02:33:38.281 --> 02:33:47.164]  So we know there's a lot of different groups and organizations, but it just came out last week in federal documents that one of the ringleaders of the Mumbai attack was a, quote, U.S.
[02:33:47.164 --> 02:33:50.746]  government agent and helped lead the attack.
[02:33:50.746 --> 02:33:54.947]  And so I keep going back to that over and over again.
[02:33:54.947 --> 02:33:56.588]  I mean, what is al-Qaeda today?
[02:33:57.967 --> 02:34:08.475]  Well, I think we have to look at this realistically because if the intelligence community is doing its job, Alex, they're going to have people who will hopefully have access to the organization.
[02:34:08.475 --> 02:34:17.262]  The problem is, and this is what's happened with Cap Chapman, I think a lot of the CIA's activities lately have been focused on wishful thinking.
[02:34:17.262 --> 02:34:20.724]  I think they recruit people thinking they're going to work for the U.S.
[02:34:20.724 --> 02:34:22.786]  and they're true believers.
[02:34:22.786 --> 02:34:24.287]  There's really no level of
[02:34:26.028 --> 02:34:26.488]  Absolutely.
[02:34:26.488 --> 02:34:27.029]  Absolutely.
[02:34:42.339 --> 02:34:44.720]  And then they get triple-crossed back, essentially.
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:48.862]  Peter Lance did a great book on this, called Triple Cross, where it talks about Ali Mohammed.
[02:34:48.862 --> 02:34:53.485]  That very thing happened there, where the guy was doubled and tripled back against us.
[02:34:53.485 --> 02:34:55.126]  And I think that's what we're seeing here a lot of.
[02:34:55.126 --> 02:34:58.307]  And we're not being smart as we should to detect when they've been double-crossed.
[02:34:58.307 --> 02:35:00.068]  Well, Dana Rupp was running short on time.
[02:35:00.068 --> 02:35:03.990]  A few months ago, that CIA base in Central Asia getting blown up.
[02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:05.911]  Was that a double-cross?
[02:35:05.911 --> 02:35:06.931]  Oh, a triple-cross, absolutely.
[02:35:06.931 --> 02:35:10.613]  That guy never left his true belief in al-Qaeda.
[02:35:10.613 --> 02:35:11.654]  And that's why those people died.
[02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:15.051]  So what is Al-Qaeda?
[02:35:15.051 --> 02:35:25.217]  Well, I think Al-Qaeda is essentially a franchise of terrorism that the radicals within the Muslim community have been able to use to sustain themselves and try and tie together.
[02:35:25.217 --> 02:35:29.919]  I think, for example, al-Awlaki is really the primary operational leader right now.
[02:35:29.919 --> 02:35:32.160]  He's the one who's actually able to plan things.
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:36.243]  So I think that he is realistically kind of the lead guy right now in Al-Qaeda.
[02:35:36.243 --> 02:35:38.604]  I think that's why the focus is so heavy on him.
[02:35:38.604 --> 02:35:41.786]  He's been able to pick up his franchise and do a lot with it.
[02:35:42.466 --> 02:35:45.196]  What about Obama saying he's worried about Al Qaeda getting nukes?
[02:35:45.196 --> 02:35:48.627]  I mean, that sounds as ridiculous as saying Saddam Hussein had nukes.
[02:35:49.451 --> 02:35:53.874]  Well, I can tell you that there's a great deal of effort going on to look at this issue realistically right now, Alex.
[02:35:53.874 --> 02:35:59.097]  I think that there's a good potential that that's where they want to go for their next big attack.
[02:35:59.097 --> 02:36:00.418]  And I don't think they've let down.
[02:36:00.418 --> 02:36:04.640]  So I know this may be hard for you and your listeners to accept.
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:06.842]  I believe that they are going in that direction.
[02:36:06.842 --> 02:36:10.064]  I believe that's where they're going next.
[02:36:10.064 --> 02:36:13.326]  Could the Russians, like Alexander Leavitt say, actually sell nukes?
[02:36:14.798 --> 02:36:19.397]  I believe there's people within the infrastructure who'd be willing to sell the nuclear weapon based on personal gain.
[02:36:19.397 --> 02:36:20.120]  Yeah, I do believe that.
[02:36:22.202 --> 02:36:24.464]  So, that's something to be cognizant of.
[02:36:24.464 --> 02:36:25.364]  I'm not saying it would happen.
[02:36:25.364 --> 02:36:27.786]  I think that that's something we need to be realistically looking at, though.
[02:36:27.786 --> 02:36:34.632]  Well, you're going to be able to talk about a lot more of this coming up in August when the book The Dark Side of the Force comes out.
[02:36:34.632 --> 02:36:36.253]  We look forward to speaking to you then.
[02:36:36.253 --> 02:36:37.434]  Thanks for the time.
[02:36:37.434 --> 02:36:38.575]  Thank you.
[02:36:38.575 --> 02:36:41.617]  All right, there goes Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer.
[02:36:41.617 --> 02:36:42.938]  Very interesting interview.
[02:36:42.938 --> 02:36:47.121]  Very interesting individual joining us from Ireland.
[02:36:47.121 --> 02:36:48.022]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:36:49.124 --> 02:37:04.508]  We got Jim Tucker coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour, and then I want to do a video game review, because more and more of these video games have a pro-New World Order or anti-New World Order message, and video games in many cases are bigger than the biggest Hollywood films.
[02:37:04.508 --> 02:37:08.729]  Some of these video game franchises have made over a billion bucks in the last two years.
[02:37:08.729 --> 02:37:12.730]  Things like Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, things like that.
[02:37:14.892 --> 02:37:19.335]  There's an InfoWars.com review of Half-Life 2 that's been out for a few years.
[02:37:19.335 --> 02:37:26.761]  But in this video game, they have DARPA control towers that mesmerize the public and people are microchipped.
[02:37:26.761 --> 02:37:29.283]  All of this is what is actually being promoted.
[02:37:29.283 --> 02:37:31.404]  I mean, that's mainstream information.
[02:37:31.404 --> 02:37:34.867]  You tell somebody, hey, the government can put up mine control towers.
[02:37:34.867 --> 02:37:37.228]  Well, DARPA has been talking about that in newspapers.
[02:37:37.228 --> 02:37:41.832]  I mean, they're openly talking about drugging the water supply on Fox News to make us
[02:37:42.572 --> 02:37:43.312]  We're passive.
[02:37:43.312 --> 02:37:44.372]  It's already going on.
[02:37:44.372 --> 02:37:45.973]  That's why we are so passive.
[02:37:45.973 --> 02:37:55.935]  The most aggressive, rebellious people ever in the history of the world, maybe some of the Greeks were more aggressive, but definitely some of the most aggressive people ever, will suddenly put up with anything.
[02:37:55.935 --> 02:37:59.576]  Because your food, your water, and other things are being spiked.
[02:37:59.576 --> 02:38:07.097]  It doesn't matter if you're Colonel Schaeffer, or a cop down the street, or Alex Jones, we're all under attack by this.
[02:38:07.097 --> 02:38:11.118]  And he wasn't even shocked by the fact that I talk about the Pentagon following us around.
[02:38:12.318 --> 02:38:23.584]  I'm going to end the Fed rallies, and then when I go to a Bilderberg meeting, I'm at my hotel five miles away, and the Feds waddle in and say, Jones, let's attack the State Department tonight together.
[02:38:23.584 --> 02:38:26.885]  I mean, the Feds know full well I'm not going to attack the State Department.
[02:38:26.885 --> 02:38:29.347]  They know full well I'm not going to attack the police.
[02:38:29.347 --> 02:38:41.653]  They know full well I'm trying to keep people from getting violent here, and that's what's making them mad, and that's why multiple major publications per day are lying and saying I'm calling for violence.
[02:38:43.650 --> 02:38:48.113]  And I'm going to get to that in a moment after we take some more of your phone calls.
[02:38:48.113 --> 02:38:52.676]  It's just driving me crazy to see this happening.
[02:38:52.676 --> 02:38:58.300]  They changed my computer around where my IMs are under a different icon.
[02:38:58.300 --> 02:38:59.380]  So I can see the call list.
[02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:01.582]  How do I pull that up?
[02:39:01.582 --> 02:39:04.964]  Somehow that got minimized in here because I won't be able to pull it up in there.
[02:39:04.964 --> 02:39:07.606]  I need to be able to pull it up here.
[02:39:08.601 --> 02:39:09.001]  Okay, good.
[02:39:09.001 --> 02:39:10.722]  You're in control of my computer.
[02:39:10.722 --> 02:39:12.243]  That's good.
[02:39:12.243 --> 02:39:13.464]  Okay, fresh list here.
[02:39:13.464 --> 02:39:16.286]  John Wyoming, Tom, Jim, Jimmy, Ryan, and others.
[02:39:16.286 --> 02:39:18.707]  Let's race through your calls.
[02:39:18.707 --> 02:39:20.088]  Let's talk to John in Wyoming.
[02:39:20.088 --> 02:39:22.249]  You're on the air, John.
[02:39:22.249 --> 02:39:23.270]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.590]  Welcome.
[02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:24.230]  Can you hear me?
[02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.651]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:24.651 --> 02:39:25.571]  Alex?
[02:39:25.571 --> 02:39:26.372]  Okay.
[02:39:26.372 --> 02:39:32.095]  A couple of years ago, I saw a great documentary on TV about post-World War II Europe.
[02:39:32.095 --> 02:39:38.099]  And Poland's leader at the time was a very patriotic man, just as this man who died the other day.
[02:39:38.994 --> 02:40:02.391]  and he was vehemently opposed to the allies turning over poland as well as all of eastern europe to joseph stalin after the end of the war and mysteriously one day he got aboard his plane which had been tampered with not by the russians but by the allies and it crashed on the island of malta killing this man it's now been declassified uh... that's uh...
[02:40:04.755 --> 02:40:08.936]  That our own government killed Patton because he didn't want to hand stuff over to the commies.
[02:40:08.936 --> 02:40:23.221]  And that's what Jesse Ventura was talking about from Fletcher Prouty, the head of Black Ops, in the book The Secret Team, that our government made a deal with the Soviets to divide up the world and have third world intractable wars to build up their own power bases.
[02:40:23.221 --> 02:40:24.102]  It's all staged.
[02:40:24.102 --> 02:40:29.563]  Now, there does appear to be a real split now between Russia and the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:40:29.563 --> 02:40:34.065]  You heard Schaefer allude to the Russians killing them, and they had reasons to kill them.
[02:40:34.485 --> 02:40:45.754]  But recently, the Kaczynski president and his twin, who's in the government, have been prime minister.
[02:40:45.754 --> 02:40:53.761]  They have come out, for those who just joined us, I covered it earlier, and said, we're not going along with the European Union, we may get out of it.
[02:40:53.761 --> 02:40:58.624]  In fact, here's the headline, New York Times, Kaczynski often at a source of tension with the EU.
[02:41:01.267 --> 02:41:02.988]  Iceland has said no to the takeover.
[02:41:02.988 --> 02:41:05.790]  Greece is going along with it, only partially.
[02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:14.498]  But if Poland says no to the banks taking them over and looting them, and this program of austerity, the whole European Union could implode.
[02:41:14.498 --> 02:41:17.540]  And that's not Alex Jones saying that, that's George Soros.
[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:22.364]  So, this is leaning towards it being a blackout by NATO.
[02:41:22.364 --> 02:41:24.766]  But it could be the Russians as well, or it could be natural.
[02:41:24.766 --> 02:41:25.067]  Go ahead.
[02:41:25.745 --> 02:41:37.653]  Well, I think that our people did him in much as they did the Polish leader in in 1945, who wasn't going to go along with that giveaway of Poland and all of Eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin.
[02:41:37.653 --> 02:41:38.634]  I mean, we spent 150,000 American lives
[02:41:40.851 --> 02:41:46.713]  to liberate Eastern Europe from Adolf Hitler, and then we turn around and give them to Joseph Stalin.
[02:41:46.713 --> 02:41:49.114]  That's like trading in syphilis for gonorrhea.
[02:41:49.114 --> 02:42:04.660]  I mean, either way you lose, because they were both brutal dictators, they were both mass murderers, and this man wasn't going along with it, and so they made sure his plane crashed into the island of Malta so he wouldn't be around to oppose this takeover by Stalin and Hitler.
[02:42:04.660 --> 02:42:05.721]  Now, I remember reading about that.
[02:42:05.721 --> 02:42:06.341]  Anything else, John?
[02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:09.872]  No sir, that'll do it, and hope you have a great day.
[02:42:09.872 --> 02:42:11.353]  You too, my friend.
[02:42:11.353 --> 02:42:14.575]  Yeah, I mean, people ask, why is Alex Jones still alive?
[02:42:14.575 --> 02:42:19.138]  Well, if they kill me, it just makes all my information and material that much more popular.
[02:42:19.138 --> 02:42:22.740]  It kind of highlights everything I've done.
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:34.909]  But somebody like a Polish president, who says, I don't like the Russians, but I'm starting to not like NATO and the EU, and you've destroyed our economy with globalization, and we're going to get out of this.
[02:42:35.968 --> 02:42:37.108]  Hello Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:42:37.108 --> 02:42:38.708]  Had a good vacation I hope.
[02:42:38.708 --> 02:42:39.729]  April 9th of this year
[02:43:05.106 --> 02:43:13.392]  Sheriff Arvin West of Hudspeth County told citizens to arm themselves because we can no longer protect them from spillover of border violence.
[02:43:13.392 --> 02:43:16.214]  That's the third largest county in the state of Texas.
[02:43:16.214 --> 02:43:23.880]  Let me stop you because we have an Ohio County doing it and a Michigan County saying arm yourselves.
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:31.906]  But a sheriff, and we've had a lot of South Texas sheriffs on, give me the name of the sheriff because I want to pull an article on this right now and I also want to get the sheriff on.
[02:43:31.906 --> 02:43:32.507]  Give me the name.
[02:43:33.579 --> 02:43:40.783]  Arvin, A-R-V-I-N, West of Hudspeth County, Texas.
[02:43:40.783 --> 02:43:43.025]  It borders El Paso.
[02:43:43.025 --> 02:43:44.786]  What's his name again?
[02:43:44.786 --> 02:43:46.807]  Arvin West.
[02:43:46.807 --> 02:43:51.270]  Okay, I thought you said Arvin West of... Okay, Arvin West, and where is he?
[02:43:51.270 --> 02:43:55.532]  Hudspeth County, H-U-D-S-P-E-T-H.
[02:43:55.532 --> 02:43:56.913]  It borders El Paso County.
[02:43:58.533 --> 02:44:04.756]  So what we should say is South Texas Sheriff says arm yourselves to protect yourselves?
[02:44:04.756 --> 02:44:06.977]  Well, it's more of a West Texas.
[02:44:06.977 --> 02:44:12.761]  It's the county that you go through before you get to El Paso County.
[02:44:12.761 --> 02:44:17.143]  Yeah, I just see that as South because it's down there by the border, but sure.
[02:44:17.143 --> 02:44:18.904]  Yeah, South, Southwest.
[02:44:18.904 --> 02:44:21.145]  Texas is on the border.
[02:44:21.145 --> 02:44:26.748]  Anyway, what I'm saying is he's telling people in that county to arm themselves because you can't protect them anymore.
[02:44:27.770 --> 02:44:40.613]  Also in the statement he said that Rick Perry had activated the Texas border violence spillover contingency plan in which he requested federal aid.
[02:44:40.613 --> 02:44:45.735]  Is that all that our government and our governor and the state of Texas is going to do?
[02:44:45.735 --> 02:44:47.115]  They're just going to let this continue?
[02:44:49.915 --> 02:44:53.976]  Well, remember last year, what was the Texas state senator we had on?
[02:44:53.976 --> 02:44:56.197]  We need to get him back on, I forget his name.
[02:44:56.197 --> 02:45:05.539]  He said martial law had secretly been declared last year on the Texas border because they believe Mexico will fully collapse into anarchy because of the drug war.
[02:45:05.539 --> 02:45:09.380]  If they decriminalize drugs, it would all end, like a storm blowing over.
[02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:14.983]  The drug war is meant, just like China was brought down with the drug war, it's meant to bring us down.
[02:45:14.983 --> 02:45:17.064]  And so there's no way they're going to stop.
[02:45:17.064 --> 02:45:29.932]  But I did get the article, it says Sheriff Arvin West of Hudspeth County, Texas tells citizens to arm themselves as you can no longer protect them from spillover border violence.
[02:45:29.932 --> 02:45:33.554]  So absolutely, and that's over on the border in West Texas by El Paso.
[02:45:37.748 --> 02:45:38.648]  Michael Burgess.
[02:45:38.648 --> 02:45:42.089]  Get Michael Burgess back on about this situation.
[02:45:42.089 --> 02:45:42.749]  Uh, good points.
[02:45:42.749 --> 02:45:44.909]  Anything else you want to add, Caller?
[02:45:44.909 --> 02:45:56.632]  Well, all I wanted to say was, uh, maybe the rest of us start thinking along these lines also because the obvious Rick Perry is not going to do anything and it's obvious that, uh, Perry Satoro is not going to do anything.
[02:45:56.632 --> 02:46:01.893]  I think he's going to let it get to a critical boiling point and then declare martial law and take our rights away.
[02:46:02.552 --> 02:46:12.935]  I agree with you, but again, martial law was covertly declared over a year ago, and that was even in some of the El Paso and other west and south Texas papers.
[02:46:12.935 --> 02:46:19.896]  And I remember six, seven years ago talking about rocket attacks, hand grenade attacks, 17,000 dead this year just on the border.
[02:46:19.896 --> 02:46:25.818]  I mean, it is just, I mean, once beautiful towns are just boarded up, high rises, totaled, and now
[02:46:26.718 --> 02:46:29.460]  It's getting like that in other cities in the state.
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:35.164]  But when there's a car bombing with the Mexican Mafia killing somebody in Dallas, it's a footnote to Dallas Morning News.
[02:46:35.164 --> 02:46:38.686]  Meanwhile, I'm here calling for nonviolence in the medias.
[02:46:38.686 --> 02:46:39.967]  Alex Jones is deadly!
[02:46:39.967 --> 02:46:42.148]  He wants to kill the government!
[02:46:42.148 --> 02:46:43.529]  Government, get him!
[02:46:43.529 --> 02:46:44.330]  Get him!
[02:46:44.330 --> 02:46:46.531]  Because we're here exposing their whole scam.
[02:46:46.531 --> 02:46:48.393]  I appreciate your call, Tom.
[02:46:48.393 --> 02:46:51.054]  Man, how many articles have I seen just the last few days?
[02:46:51.054 --> 02:46:54.477]  I'm looking for my stack here.
[02:46:55.852 --> 02:47:01.835]  Oh, it's in my economy stack, where finally the truth is coming out.
[02:47:01.835 --> 02:47:04.716]  The police are saying, all money goes to the banks now.
[02:47:04.716 --> 02:47:06.337]  They're firing more than half of us.
[02:47:06.337 --> 02:47:09.078]  Buy guns!
[02:47:09.078 --> 02:47:15.221]  But, I mean, you could have, look at New York, look at Chicago, more cops than any other cities per capita, highest crime rate.
[02:47:15.221 --> 02:47:18.443]  The cops, if they wanted to protect you, can't protect you.
[02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:22.630]  You can't have a cop in every house.
[02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:23.730]  You can disarm everyone.
[02:47:23.730 --> 02:47:25.051]  The criminals are still going to have guns.
[02:47:25.051 --> 02:47:27.151]  It's so elementary.
[02:47:27.151 --> 02:47:28.492]  It's so elementary.
[02:47:28.492 --> 02:47:37.434]  And on the YouTube videos of these local newscasts where the sheriffs are saying, arm yourselves, I see comments going, if we ban all guns, this would just end.
[02:47:37.434 --> 02:47:38.595]  Oh yes, ban all.
[02:47:38.595 --> 02:47:42.376]  Then the murderers would use pickaxes and daggers and clubs.
[02:47:44.099 --> 02:47:45.839]  I mean, it's asinine.
[02:47:45.839 --> 02:47:50.420]  The answer is more guns, more guns, more guns, more guns.
[02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:52.661]  And the American people have known this for over a year.
[02:47:52.661 --> 02:47:55.101]  What was it?
[02:47:55.101 --> 02:48:00.282]  14 million guns sold last year, another 3.5 million sold last time.
[02:48:00.282 --> 02:48:04.903]  That's almost 18 million guns in the last year and three months.
[02:48:04.903 --> 02:48:06.724]  18 million guns sold?
[02:48:06.724 --> 02:48:08.024]  The people know what's going on.
[02:48:10.635 --> 02:48:16.879]  I don't think some of the general public realizes just how bad it is and how crazy the times are and what we're going into.
[02:48:16.879 --> 02:48:18.140]  We're in a depression, folks.
[02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:21.382]  We've had a recession going for at least three years.
[02:48:21.382 --> 02:48:25.845]  Three quarters of a recession.
[02:48:25.845 --> 02:48:28.547]  With unemployment above 20% is a depression.
[02:48:28.547 --> 02:48:31.028]  Unemployment is not 10%, like the news says.
[02:48:31.028 --> 02:48:35.211]  Every major private firm says 22%.
[02:48:35.211 --> 02:48:36.032]  Makes me dizzy.
[02:48:36.032 --> 02:48:37.353]  It really gives me a headache.
[02:48:37.353 --> 02:48:39.074]  Jim in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:40.129 --> 02:48:41.550]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:43.051]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:43.051 --> 02:48:44.332]  All right.
[02:48:44.332 --> 02:48:52.677]  I'm from the People's Republic of Illinois, and I have one comment and one question.
[02:48:52.677 --> 02:48:55.119]  First, I want to give you a little background.
[02:48:55.119 --> 02:49:01.623]  I have a family member in federal law enforcement, but I'll tell you a bottom line.
[02:49:01.623 --> 02:49:06.126]  My wife got me a Romanian AK-47 for Valentine's Day.
[02:49:06.126 --> 02:49:08.548]  Nothing says love like an assault rifle.
[02:49:09.412 --> 02:49:15.236]  My comment is about this Polish, um, crash.
[02:49:15.236 --> 02:49:16.337]  You there?
[02:49:16.337 --> 02:49:17.898]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:17.898 --> 02:49:18.438]  All right.
[02:49:18.438 --> 02:49:20.099]  It seems a little suspicious to me.
[02:49:20.099 --> 02:49:31.987]  This is supposed to be the anniversary of essentially a Russian genocide of Polish, um, intelligence officers and whatever they are.
[02:49:31.987 --> 02:49:33.188]  And all of a sudden it crashes.
[02:49:33.188 --> 02:49:34.769]  That seems just a little, you know,
[02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:37.333]  It doesn't fit with me, Brian.
[02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:42.758]  No, no, I had thought that as well, but is it meant to be blamed on the Russians, or do the Russians do it?
[02:49:42.758 --> 02:49:43.218]  I don't know.
[02:49:43.218 --> 02:49:45.200]  I don't know either.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.642]  I'm just putting out the question.
[02:49:47.642 --> 02:49:51.145]  And, by the way, I want to hear you on Coast more.
[02:49:51.145 --> 02:49:54.547]  And WLS here in Chicago cuts it off after two hours.
[02:49:54.547 --> 02:49:56.309]  It's just pretty crappy.
[02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:58.631]  Okay, here's my question.
[02:49:58.631 --> 02:50:03.395]  I'm a little scared about Obama's latest statement
[02:50:04.404 --> 02:50:13.546]  About how he is concerned about these, uh, he didn't say suitcase, but essentially suitcase nukes in the hands of terrorists.
[02:50:13.546 --> 02:50:14.986]  No, I brought that up with Schaefer.
[02:50:14.986 --> 02:50:17.666]  He's saying the main threat is now nukes.
[02:50:17.666 --> 02:50:21.427]  And how many times have I said that's the way for revolutionaries to take over?
[02:50:21.427 --> 02:50:22.787]  Michael Savage agrees.
[02:50:22.787 --> 02:50:26.608]  Limbaugh has said there's no way Obama is going to get re-elected.
[02:50:26.608 --> 02:50:29.288]  The Democrats are going to have to stage a crisis.
[02:50:29.288 --> 02:50:30.769]  Let's just come out with it.
[02:50:30.769 --> 02:50:31.929]  The globalist banks
[02:50:32.609 --> 02:50:35.131]  are looking at setting off a nuke in this country.
[02:50:35.131 --> 02:50:45.660]  They will even go that far to get everybody scared, to bow down to Obama and do whatever they say, to then go off and launch new wars to try to get the economy going again.
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.322]  And I think this is a serious issue.
[02:50:47.322 --> 02:50:49.483]  In fact, it's in my stack, but I may not find it.
[02:50:49.483 --> 02:50:51.685]  Reprint, Obama worried about nuclear terrorism.
[02:50:51.685 --> 02:50:52.486]  It's AP.
[02:50:52.486 --> 02:50:54.087]  We'll come back, comment on that.
[02:50:54.087 --> 02:50:56.169]  Jim Tucker inside the Bilderberg Group.
[02:50:56.169 --> 02:51:00.473]  We know the location of the real enemies of humanity, the real illegitimate government straight ahead.
[02:51:03.467 --> 02:51:07.069]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.
[02:51:07.069 --> 02:51:10.972]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved once and for all.
[02:51:10.972 --> 02:51:12.232]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.

[02:51:53.313 --> 02:51:54.134]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[02:51:54.134 --> 02:51:54.514]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:52:01.793 --> 02:52:04.194]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:04.194 --> 02:52:06.495]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:06.495 --> 02:52:09.717]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.717 --> 02:52:14.819]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.819 --> 02:52:19.021]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.321 --> 02:52:21.783]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.783 --> 02:52:24.226]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.226 --> 02:52:27.469]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:35.076]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.416 --> 02:52:40.698]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.698 --> 02:52:43.658]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.658 --> 02:52:47.339]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.339 --> 02:52:49.760]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:51.241]  Invisible Empire.
[02:52:51.241 --> 02:52:59.223]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.468 --> 02:53:02.049]  Fact.
[02:53:02.049 --> 02:53:02.189]  Fact.
[02:53:31.388 --> 02:53:31.888]  We're good to go.
[02:54:13.211 --> 02:54:18.492]  Here's the headline, Obama, nuclear terrorism is the single biggest threat to U.S.
[02:54:18.492 --> 02:54:24.573]  But you get the internal homeland security documents, it's gun-owning, libertarian, constitutionalist Americans.
[02:54:24.573 --> 02:54:27.774]  You're the big threat to the bankers.
[02:54:27.774 --> 02:54:32.834]  You are the legitimate American people that are the power, that are the sovereigns in this country.
[02:54:32.834 --> 02:54:37.655]  Hence, you are the enemy of the bankers.
[02:54:37.655 --> 02:54:41.716]  And, well, we'll cover this in a moment.
[02:54:43.612 --> 02:54:53.918]  Then I'm going to continue with your calls and Jim Tucker and I promise to get into all these attacks on free speech and what's happening with the economy and a lot more.
[02:54:53.918 --> 02:54:57.600]  Before we go there, I'm very excited
[02:54:58.703 --> 02:54:58.843]  This is
[02:55:19.392 --> 02:55:27.336]  System Works, the Executive Orders, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the riot police and military attacking people at G20.
[02:55:27.336 --> 02:55:28.596]  It's an amazing film.
[02:55:28.596 --> 02:55:32.238]  Pre-order it today and start shipping out next week.
[02:55:32.238 --> 02:55:37.600]  If you order Invisible Empire, it arrived today.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:42.442]  We have thousands and thousands of the DVDs and we're going to start shipping them out tomorrow.
[02:55:42.442 --> 02:55:46.344]  So many people will get them on or before the 15th.
[02:55:46.344 --> 02:55:47.644]  UPS ships anywhere in the U.S.
[02:55:47.644 --> 02:55:48.165]  in four days.
[02:55:49.666 --> 02:55:52.008]  And I think it's five days all over Europe.
[02:55:52.008 --> 02:56:08.325]  The point is, if you want to order Invisible Empire, that's the history of the New World Order, their money laundering, their drug dealing, their white slavery, their pervert rings, how they use the roundtable groups to control, how they openly want a world government, this is a two-hour, 15-minute
[02:56:09.786 --> 02:56:18.270]  And they have expanded extras and your purchase of the films makes this radio show, the news websites, the TV studio we're building, everything possible.
[02:56:18.270 --> 02:56:20.671]  So it's also support in the InfoWars.
[02:56:20.671 --> 02:56:28.014]  So please visit InfoWars.com today and get Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Terror Storm, Fabled Enemies.
[02:56:28.014 --> 02:56:30.135]  They're all available.
[02:56:30.135 --> 02:56:32.876]  So it's not even a pre-order now.
[02:56:32.876 --> 02:56:36.898]  You can now officially order and it starts shipping tomorrow.
[02:56:36.898 --> 02:56:37.498]  The new film
[02:56:39.491 --> 02:56:48.259]  Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, and then it's basically not even a pre-order as we start shipping next week, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:56:48.259 --> 02:56:54.344]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and they will both premiere in the next week and a half at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:54.344 --> 02:57:00.410]  Thursday at 3 o'clock Central when this radio show ends, the first place it will be available in the highest quality.
[02:57:00.410 --> 02:57:02.231]  We've got DivX versions to burn to disk.
[02:57:03.252 --> 02:57:05.053]  That's one of the medium quality ones.
[02:57:05.053 --> 02:57:06.973]  All at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:57:06.973 --> 02:57:08.914]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.

[02:57:18.457 --> 02:57:21.838]  You can share the passcode with up to six people.
[02:57:22.458 --> 02:57:26.160]  Six people with the same passcode can log on simultaneously.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:28.320]  Just tell them, don't share this with anybody else.
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:29.721]  We can't afford the bandwidth.
[02:57:29.721 --> 02:57:35.643]  But I did turn it up to six a year ago or so, instead of three, so that you could share it with friends and family.
[02:57:35.643 --> 02:57:37.104]  Give them your username, passcode.
[02:57:37.104 --> 02:57:38.765]  They can watch the live show.
[02:57:38.765 --> 02:57:51.330]  They get access to the 64 kilobit audio streams, video streams, the 64 kilobit podcast, all my films, a bunch of other great documentaries, Paul Watson's book out of print, my book out of print.
[02:57:52.250 --> 02:57:54.091]  It's now six years up and running.
[02:57:54.091 --> 02:57:57.713]  We launched it in early April, six years ago.
[02:57:57.713 --> 02:58:04.538]  In 2004, we are now six years of PrisonPlanet.TV and we're adding more to it, upgrading it.
[02:58:04.538 --> 02:58:11.182]  We did an upgrade last year, we're doing another upgrade in the next few months, making PrisonPlanet.TV better and better and better.
[02:58:11.182 --> 02:58:14.664]  It's an armory of info weapon resistance.
[02:58:14.664 --> 02:58:17.746]  And it is the... It is the...
[02:58:20.643 --> 02:58:22.904]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:22.904 --> 02:58:24.605]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.195 --> 02:58:53.576]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:58:53.576 --> 02:58:55.876]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:58:55.876 --> 02:58:59.077]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:58:59.077 --> 02:59:04.198]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:59:04.198 --> 02:59:08.719]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:59:08.719 --> 02:59:11.160]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:59:11.160 --> 02:59:13.600]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:16.441]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:59:16.841 --> 02:59:24.789]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:59:24.789 --> 02:59:30.174]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:59:30.174 --> 02:59:32.517]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:59:32.517 --> 02:59:36.441]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:59:36.721 --> 02:59:37.801]  And I got news for you.
[02:59:37.801 --> 02:59:39.122]  You're everyone else.
[02:59:39.122 --> 02:59:40.642]  Invisible Empire.

[02:59:54.367 --> 02:59:56.748]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.748 --> 02:59:59.589]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.552 --> 03:00:16.993]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:16.993 --> 03:00:19.015]  We're getting Jim Tucker on the line.
[03:00:19.015 --> 03:00:24.579]  After working for various newspapers, Tucker started writing for the Spotlight in the 70s.
[03:00:26.089 --> 03:00:29.071]  He now works for American Free Press, the reincarnation of that paper.
[03:00:29.071 --> 03:00:38.739]  Tucker's efforts to infiltrate the 99 Bilderberg meeting at the hotel in Parque Centro, Portugal, were chronicled by British reporter John Ronson in his book Them.
[03:00:38.739 --> 03:00:41.782]  He's also been in Channel 4's Secret Rulers of the World.
[03:00:41.782 --> 03:00:44.364]  He published Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[03:00:44.364 --> 03:00:50.149]  Tucker is featured prominently in the film made by paleoconservative Alex Jones, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:00:52.082 --> 03:00:55.765]  And of course we are honored to have him with us today.
[03:00:55.765 --> 03:01:01.569]  He's also featured in the documentary film New World Order 2009.
[03:01:01.569 --> 03:01:11.216]  And Jim has identified, and he's always been accurate in the past, Jim has identified
[03:01:13.604 --> 03:01:15.906]  Builderberg meeting in Spain.
[03:01:33.288 --> 03:01:35.210]  People are commenting, well why don't they just have it in Japan?
[03:01:35.210 --> 03:01:37.212]  Why don't they just have it in Africa?
[03:01:37.212 --> 03:01:42.177]  No, they only have it in Western Europe, the Caribbean, or Canada or the US.
[03:01:42.177 --> 03:01:44.719]  They do three years in Europe, one year in the US.
[03:01:44.719 --> 03:01:46.741]  Three years in Europe, one year in the US.
[03:01:46.741 --> 03:01:52.027]  That's how it's been done since the 50s, and this is the group that set up the European Union.
[03:01:52.027 --> 03:01:55.010]  This is the group that set up this entire system.
[03:01:56.468 --> 03:02:03.931]  And so we're working on getting Jim on and that'll be coming up in the next segment, hopefully.
[03:02:03.931 --> 03:02:11.115]  I also want to continue with news, but right now let's go back to your calls.
[03:02:11.115 --> 03:02:12.735]  Let's talk to Jimmy in Michigan.
[03:02:12.735 --> 03:02:14.456]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[03:02:14.456 --> 03:02:15.657]  How you doing today, Alex?
[03:02:15.657 --> 03:02:15.997]  Good, sir.
[03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:23.893]  I talked to Michael Savage, and I finally made it on your show, on your website.
[03:02:23.893 --> 03:02:25.774]  It was amazing.
[03:02:25.774 --> 03:02:31.277]  You're the guy that called in and talked about how they set up the Hattari militia, and now they've released their best evidence.
[03:02:31.277 --> 03:02:33.318]  The guy's like, yeah, the government keeps pushing.
[03:02:33.318 --> 03:02:35.079]  We'll have to fight them someday.
[03:02:35.079 --> 03:02:37.320]  I mean, most Americans have talked like that.
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:39.141]  Boom, you go to prison.
[03:02:39.141 --> 03:02:40.922]  Right, I understand that.
[03:02:40.922 --> 03:02:45.465]  And I also would like to point out that Mike Meeks,
[03:02:46.385 --> 03:02:52.410]  Michael David Meeks is the one, one of the guys, I can speak for him because I've known him for over 30 years.
[03:02:52.410 --> 03:02:54.971]  I've broken bread with his family.
[03:02:54.971 --> 03:02:56.152]  He was welcome in my home.
[03:02:56.152 --> 03:03:00.235]  He was going to be best man at my wedding on the 8th of May.
[03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:01.576]  Uh, this is my friend.
[03:03:01.576 --> 03:03:03.438]  I've known him forever.
[03:03:03.438 --> 03:03:08.682]  There's no way that he would have ever been involved in any kind of conspiracy like this.
[03:03:08.682 --> 03:03:15.887]  He is the kind of guy that wanted to change things, but he was always doing it in a civil way.
[03:03:16.468 --> 03:03:21.895]  He ran for Republican Precinct Delegate and became one.
[03:03:21.895 --> 03:03:27.002]  And we've been talking about Ann Norlander for Secretary of State.
[03:03:27.849 --> 03:03:30.430]  Michael Bishop for Attorney General.
[03:03:30.430 --> 03:03:34.732]  We just started digging into the guys that are running... Well, look, look, look, look!
[03:03:34.732 --> 03:03:43.056]  The media is saying I'm calling for insurrection and violence when I'm not as a way to make us the bad guys and let the system have the moral high ground.
[03:03:43.056 --> 03:03:49.699]  And the best evidence they've got is the supposed leader, Stone, and he doesn't say anything you should go to prison for.
[03:03:49.699 --> 03:03:53.421]  I mean, talk show hosts say much more extreme things every day.
[03:03:54.241 --> 03:04:00.248]  And so clearly this whole thing is a setup to create the illusion there's all these violent militias out there.
[03:04:00.248 --> 03:04:01.309]  Exactly.
[03:04:01.309 --> 03:04:10.740]  And Mr. Potok, who's certainly welcome to his opinion, why doesn't he come and talk to one of us?
[03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:13.744]  I'll debate him anytime, anywhere, no problem.
[03:04:14.504 --> 03:04:33.385]  Well obviously they don't want the truth getting out and they want to continue with the illusion that anybody that criticizes the government is a terrorist that wants to murder people while the government uses more and more force against the citizens every day in this country and gets more and more oppressive and sells us on the idea of police dogs attacking old women at the G20.
[03:04:34.426 --> 03:04:48.309]  But I'd like to get your name and number and perhaps have you on as a guest to talk more about the Hattari and maybe get some of the other locals on with you that knew some of these people so we can dispel the propaganda.
[03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:56.030]  But I saw them being set up when that pale horse guy Sickles, and they admit one of the members is a Fed.
[03:04:56.030 --> 03:04:58.671]  And I don't know who it is, but I've had my suspicions.
[03:04:58.671 --> 03:04:59.091]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.223 --> 03:05:02.524]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.524 --> 03:05:08.107]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:05:08.107 --> 03:05:13.130]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:05:13.130 --> 03:05:18.694]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:05:18.694 --> 03:05:23.937]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:05:23.937 --> 03:05:25.798]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:05:26.238 --> 03:05:31.041]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[03:05:31.041 --> 03:05:32.161]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:32.161 --> 03:05:35.203]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:05:35.203 --> 03:05:38.845]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:05:38.845 --> 03:05:42.027]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:05:42.027 --> 03:05:44.248]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:05:44.248 --> 03:05:45.189]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:05:45.189 --> 03:05:45.389]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:05:45.389 --> 03:05:45.629]  Remember,
[03:05:53.974 --> 03:05:57.875]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:57.875 --> 03:06:01.116]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:06:01.116 --> 03:06:06.418]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:06:06.418 --> 03:06:09.178]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[03:06:09.178 --> 03:06:13.720]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:18.982]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[03:06:48.938 --> 03:06:50.360]  Shadow Government.

[03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:04.552]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:04.552 --> 03:07:09.874]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:09.874 --> 03:07:11.935]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:11.935 --> 03:07:16.938]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.938 --> 03:07:18.119]  How much do you want?
[03:07:18.119 --> 03:07:18.839]  When do you want it?
[03:07:19.219 --> 03:07:21.121]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:21.121 --> 03:07:22.182]  When will you need it?
[03:07:22.182 --> 03:07:24.403]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:24.403 --> 03:07:25.725]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.725 --> 03:07:27.266]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:27.266 --> 03:07:32.530]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.530 --> 03:07:35.653]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:36.113 --> 03:07:39.935]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.935 --> 03:07:41.155]  How much will you need?
[03:07:41.155 --> 03:07:42.056]  We don't know.
[03:07:42.056 --> 03:07:43.156]  How much do you want?
[03:07:43.156 --> 03:07:44.096]  All you can get.
[03:07:44.096 --> 03:07:45.177]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:45.177 --> 03:07:48.238]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:48.238 --> 03:07:50.439]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:50.439 --> 03:07:51.439]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:09.828]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.828 --> 03:08:12.812]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.614 --> 03:08:21.176]  Jim Tucker is our guest, definitely under government surveillance.
[03:08:21.176 --> 03:08:23.658]  He's been shot at before.
[03:08:23.658 --> 03:08:25.719]  Shot at at Bilderberg.
[03:08:25.719 --> 03:08:30.361]  I've had the feds come into my hotel and try to set me up for wanting to attack the State Department.
[03:08:30.361 --> 03:08:34.984]  In 2008 it did turn out that Hillary and Obama were at that meeting.
[03:08:34.984 --> 03:08:39.947]  His phone always works great at home, till they call him for an interview and his phone line was unintelligible.
[03:08:39.947 --> 03:08:41.228]  We've got him via cell phone.
[03:08:42.188 --> 03:08:45.852]  Jim Tucker is our guest now.
[03:08:45.852 --> 03:08:48.535]  We really appreciate him coming on with us.
[03:08:48.535 --> 03:08:52.819]  He's always been accurate in the past, but many others haven't been.
[03:08:52.819 --> 03:08:57.784]  But now we have identified where Bilderberg is.
[03:08:58.665 --> 03:09:01.667]  In 2010, Bilderberg found in Spain.
[03:09:01.667 --> 03:09:15.615]  He's also found where the Trilateral Commission is meeting before that and we'll find out if he knows what's on the agenda this year and if the Bilderberg boys are mad that their global warming hoax that they plan to fund their world government is in so much trouble.
[03:09:15.615 --> 03:09:16.796]  Jim Tucker, good to have you with us.
[03:09:18.044 --> 03:09:19.585]  Oh, it's a lot of fun as usual.
[03:09:19.585 --> 03:09:22.928]  Now, the Tylenol meeting comes first.
[03:09:22.928 --> 03:09:28.373]  That's Thursday, May 6th to Monday morning, May 10th.
[03:09:28.373 --> 03:09:31.055]  And that will be in Dublin, Ireland.
[03:09:31.055 --> 03:09:40.282]  The jury is in... They're staying at the Four Seasons Resort, which is a big spa place.
[03:09:40.282 --> 03:09:46.668]  And Bilderberg's meeting is a month later, as a typical fashion, from...
[03:09:48.115 --> 03:09:54.580]  Thursday, June 3 until Monday morning, June 7.
[03:09:54.580 --> 03:10:00.684]  They're meeting in a little town called Sitges, Spain.
[03:10:00.684 --> 03:10:02.425]  S-I-T-G-E-S.
[03:10:02.425 --> 03:10:05.447]  Which is about 20 miles from Barcelona.
[03:10:05.447 --> 03:10:11.692]  And they're sitting at the Atimar Hotel, which is a big, small place.
[03:10:11.692 --> 03:10:16.515]  And of course, we'll be there holding their hands for them.
[03:10:17.675 --> 03:10:40.066]  As far as their agenda is concerned this year, the heavy on their agenda this year, which is not at all unusual unfortunately, is their intention for Europeans and Americans to pay higher income taxes.
[03:10:40.066 --> 03:10:42.928]  Significantly higher income taxes because
[03:10:43.940 --> 03:10:44.321]  I think so.
[03:10:56.849 --> 03:11:00.432]  We're all poor together under their world government.
[03:11:00.432 --> 03:11:24.191]  And so this is what you're getting from your inside sources and for those that just joined us, Jim Tucker for more than 30 years has been exposing the highest level of the World Government Crime Council, the Bilderberg Group, 125 of the most powerful people in the world from Western Europe and North America meeting in secret and the information he's released years before things even happened from Bilderberg proves
[03:11:24.791 --> 03:11:31.398]  The fact that they are governing and controlling our planet to a very great extent.
[03:11:31.398 --> 03:11:40.146]  Now, a week ago you revealed that they are going to push for raising our taxes to the level of France basically.
[03:11:41.087 --> 03:11:42.148]  Yes, they manipulated the
[03:12:10.140 --> 03:12:15.944]  Worldwide depression, and now they're exploiting it for their own selfish reasons.
[03:12:15.944 --> 03:12:24.730]  They intend to keep it going for at least until late in the year 2011, late next year, uh, for their own purposes.
[03:12:24.730 --> 03:12:33.957]  And now we have Bernanke telling a private group of businessmen in Texas that, uh, these sources are difficult, quote, unquote, these sources are difficult.
[03:12:33.957 --> 03:12:37.960]  It always seems easier to put them off until the day they cannot be put off anymore.
[03:12:39.017 --> 03:12:43.962]  Uh, and he said that we've got to raise taxes and cut services.
[03:12:43.962 --> 03:12:54.070]  Uh, and he said that to a group of, uh, businessmen in Dallas, and their job is to be little messenger boys and go out and tell everybody in the world that we need to accept it.
[03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:58.214]  America gets so hungry, so desperate, they'll accept anything.
[03:12:58.214 --> 03:13:02.578]  But yet, he engineered, he and the other boys, uh, engineered the very
[03:13:10.236 --> 03:13:28.568]  Jim, what's it like for you to be laughed at for 20 years with the media saying Bilderberg didn't exist, and now the last 10 of that 30, now they admit open news, everyday, world government, global constitution, private banks to rule the planet with a global banking constitution.
[03:13:28.568 --> 03:13:30.249]  I mean, now it's right out in the open.
[03:13:31.996 --> 03:13:47.943]  Well, more so in Europe than in the United States because the blackout remains with the major newspapers like the Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Associated Press, and the broadcast networks.
[03:13:47.943 --> 03:14:00.568]  Now, there's been more exposure, as you've observed when you attended the meetings, by independent broadcast outlets like yourself, independent radio, TV stations, independent newspapers, not chain newspapers.
[03:14:01.363 --> 03:14:07.324]  And we had a lot of those reporters out in Chantilly and also a lot in Pipterio.
[03:14:07.324 --> 03:14:23.888]  Anytime they're in the Western Hemisphere, that is Canada or the United States, we get a great deal of reporting from these independent outlets, but not from the
[03:14:24.992 --> 03:14:34.261]  Major newspapers all attended over the years, including the top networks, broadcast networks.
[03:14:34.261 --> 03:14:39.106]  Lifetime promise to reveal nothing, never even use the word Billsburg.
[03:14:39.537 --> 03:14:49.883]  Well, Jim, we're seeing a lot of top globalists now calling for censoring the web, ending net neutrality, and basically restricting free speech.
[03:14:49.883 --> 03:14:51.985]  England just passed a law.
[03:14:51.985 --> 03:14:53.906]  A lot of other nations are passing laws.
[03:14:53.906 --> 03:14:56.187]  Australia, Italy.
[03:14:56.187 --> 03:14:57.408]  Is that on their agenda?
[03:14:57.408 --> 03:15:02.771]  Because we see globalist spokesmen at Davos, kind of a public Bilderberg meeting, calling for this.
[03:15:02.771 --> 03:15:08.074]  What other intel are you getting from your sources is going to be on the agenda at Bilderberg 2010?
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:22.883]  Well, as far as the free speech is concerned, they've never had a First Amendment in Europe, and in fact it's a crime to hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:15:22.883 --> 03:15:35.706]  Let's see, in the Netherlands, and in England, and in France, and in Germany, and other countries, it is a crime to hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:15:38.310 --> 03:15:58.319]  Of course, in our own country under the First Amendment, I can say the most horrible things about you, to you, but if it's not published by, if I'm not saying it to a third party or writing it to a third party, it's not libelous, it's not flatterous, because I've said it only to you.
[03:15:58.319 --> 03:16:03.502]  But they don't have that kind of, never have had that kind of free thought and
[03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:06.480]  In Europe.
[03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:09.401]  Oh, but you were asking more about the agenda this year.
[03:16:09.401 --> 03:16:15.263]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:16:15.263 --> 03:16:16.604]  What else is on their agenda?
[03:16:16.604 --> 03:16:28.228]  Even as we speak, the International Monetary Fund, as we've employed for it, is still involved in the World Treasury Department.
[03:16:32.748 --> 03:16:34.188]  They're laying down propaganda already.
[03:16:34.188 --> 03:16:40.770]  Unless we do something to fix our fiscal path, policies that will tilt the curve downward, you'll see these problems come forward.
[03:16:40.770 --> 03:16:45.031]  To this forum, we're fed economist Michael Moussa.
[03:16:45.031 --> 03:16:52.894]  To the Peterson, on April 8th, to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in calling for a tax hike here in Europe.
[03:16:52.894 --> 03:16:59.315]  And we're hearing from a lot of characters.
[03:16:59.315 --> 03:17:01.256]  I'm stumbling with my notes here as we speak.
[03:17:02.981 --> 03:17:11.567]  Well, while you dig around in your notes there, and again, Jim's been fighting these people forever, I mean, it's all over the BBC, London Guardian, Times of London.
[03:17:11.567 --> 03:17:19.413]  They say, a planetary government with the IMF and World Bank as the global treasury, and the private banks will govern the planet.
[03:17:19.413 --> 03:17:29.541]  I mean, this is openly being announced, and they say, we're going to raise all your taxes and cut your services, and now Bloomberg reports they're going to take everybody's pension funds and give it to the bankers.
[03:17:29.541 --> 03:17:32.083]  And if you don't like it, they'll just turn Northcom loose on you.
[03:17:34.363 --> 03:17:41.248]  Yes, as I said, in Europe there's a great deal of attention to major newspapers for a lot of years.
[03:17:41.248 --> 03:17:56.681]  In fact, I think as I've mentioned so many times before, it was about Helsinki about 1980-something, and we had in the spotlight the Band-Aid of American Free Press.
[03:17:56.681 --> 03:17:59.103]  We had the story earlier that year of their exact location.
[03:17:59.756 --> 03:18:14.124]  And we got letters from Europe saying, of course our circulation is hardly wall-to-wall in Europe, but it costs so much to send it by mail, so one person could share his paper with 10 other people to help out at a subscription.
[03:18:14.124 --> 03:18:17.706]  So we got letters from leaders saying, should we alert the local media?
[03:18:17.706 --> 03:18:19.087]  And I said, yes.
[03:18:22.204 --> 03:18:35.307]  When Kissinger and the other kids got off the airplane at Helsinki Airport and headed for their limousines, they were stunned to see all those cameras and reporters yelling questions.
[03:18:35.307 --> 03:18:43.148]  And a bunch of newspapers in London and Paris and throughout Europe gave heavy page one attention.
[03:18:43.148 --> 03:18:46.609]  Photographs, stories, raising the same questions we always raise.
[03:18:47.610 --> 03:18:48.772]  There's a great deal of help.
[03:18:48.772 --> 03:18:52.300]  We pool our information weekly, regularly, every evening.
[03:18:53.952 --> 03:19:20.198]  And again, before they would deny this, but you would get in there, steal their membership list, expose that a global government group is meeting in secret, and the decisions they make there are implemented, and you were saying on the agenda is to continue the global depression so they can consolidate power.
[03:19:21.263 --> 03:19:22.164]  Yes.
[03:19:22.164 --> 03:19:27.388]  We're not going to come out of this until late 2011.
[03:19:27.388 --> 03:19:30.811]  There might be a little perk here and there, as far as digging out.
[03:19:30.811 --> 03:19:31.352]  Nope.
[03:19:31.352 --> 03:19:32.873]  Not at all.
[03:19:32.873 --> 03:19:37.237]  But they do plan to bring us out of it, though.
[03:19:37.237 --> 03:19:39.299]  As soon as they're convenient.
[03:19:39.299 --> 03:19:45.905]  Now, you remember, it was not so many years ago that they decided we should have a little bit more prosperity.
[03:19:47.005 --> 03:19:47.646]  Stay there.
[03:19:47.646 --> 03:19:48.046]  Stay there, Jim.
[03:19:48.046 --> 03:19:51.751]  We're going to break and come back and talk about how they control gas prices.
[03:20:01.644 --> 03:20:08.328]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:20:08.328 --> 03:20:16.453]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:20:16.453 --> 03:20:24.617]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:20:24.617 --> 03:20:29.360]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:20:29.700 --> 03:20:34.923]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:20:34.923 --> 03:20:39.265]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:20:39.265 --> 03:20:40.345]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[03:22:10.294 --> 03:22:12.595]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.595 --> 03:22:17.757]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:18.437 --> 03:22:25.123]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.123 --> 03:22:31.088]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[03:24:06.858 --> 03:24:30.215]  Again, Jim Tucker has been working for major newspapers since the 40s and 50s, and he travels to these events, he climbs through gutters when he was younger, steals their membership list, proved this group exists, it's the most elite on the planet, now BBC and others have gotten their documents from the 50s when they planned to set up the European Union by stealth, and Jim has sources inside Bilderberg, and absolutely, he said in 2008, when gas was
[03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:38.514]  $60 a barrel, that Bilderberg was going to run it up to $150.
[03:24:38.514 --> 03:24:39.535]  Everybody laughed.
[03:24:39.535 --> 03:24:40.376]  That happened.
[03:24:40.376 --> 03:24:42.078]  Then he said they were going to drive it back down.
[03:24:42.078 --> 03:24:42.999]  That happened.
[03:24:42.999 --> 03:24:47.043]  So Jim, you've got your notes there from your Bilderberg source this year.
[03:24:47.043 --> 03:24:48.825]  What else is on their agenda?
[03:24:48.825 --> 03:24:50.727]  Because we're looking into their crystal ball right now.
[03:24:51.407 --> 03:24:53.128]  Okay, more bad news.
[03:24:53.128 --> 03:25:00.012]  Gas prices are going up, possibly over the next two years to $7 a gallon, like they pay in Europe.
[03:25:00.012 --> 03:25:03.634]  And they say so many times, Europeans pay $7 a gallon.
[03:25:03.634 --> 03:25:09.337]  Now, observe that there's a plentiful supply of oil.
[03:25:09.337 --> 03:25:12.539]  We've got more than enough oil coming out of everywhere.
[03:25:15.541 --> 03:25:23.843]  So, uh, there's no rationalization with this proposal to raise prices other than their arbitrary decision to raise prices.
[03:25:23.843 --> 03:25:33.025]  So, sadly, uh, your oil prices are going to be going up, uh, quite high in the next, uh, year.
[03:25:33.025 --> 03:25:37.986]  And that's from Bilderberg and Queen Beatrix, one of the owners of Dutch Rochelle and BP.
[03:25:37.986 --> 03:25:40.366]  She's one of the chief owners with the Queen of England.
[03:25:40.366 --> 03:25:41.746]  She's the Queen of the Netherlands.
[03:25:41.746 --> 03:25:43.867]  She wants more of our money.
[03:25:43.867 --> 03:25:44.067]  Yes.
[03:25:46.522 --> 03:25:48.323]  No, you'll notice it.
[03:25:48.323 --> 03:25:55.788]  They had the power do that a few years ago, when gas prices were about $5 a gallon.
[03:25:55.788 --> 03:26:14.999]  Bill Burkitt said it's time to bring down the price of gasoline, because Joe Sixpack may not get off of his scooter or his small car if we don't bring prices down right away, because once he gets used to that small car, or to his bicycle or motorbike,
[03:26:15.692 --> 03:26:17.613]  So what else is on the agenda?
[03:26:40.981 --> 03:26:45.082]  So they have the power to work it either way they want to.
[03:26:45.082 --> 03:26:49.043]  They're going to bring it back up now.
[03:26:49.043 --> 03:26:50.823]  Okay, and that's from your source.
[03:26:50.823 --> 03:26:52.504]  What other tidbits are on the agenda?
[03:26:52.504 --> 03:26:53.944]  What are they concerned about?
[03:26:53.944 --> 03:26:57.545]  What about war with Iran?
[03:26:57.545 --> 03:27:00.526]  Again, they're divided on that.
[03:27:00.526 --> 03:27:03.387]  The Americans and Israelis.
[03:27:06.238 --> 03:27:12.900]  I want to go to war to attack Iran.
[03:27:12.900 --> 03:27:17.201]  Most European Bilderbergs, not all of them, are opposed to invasion.
[03:27:17.201 --> 03:27:19.041]  They want to talk some more.
[03:27:19.041 --> 03:27:33.925]  So this is one of the few times they've been, did I speak for the United Voice on a single issue, that dates back to Bilderberg and Trilateral opposing the U.S.
[03:27:33.925 --> 03:27:34.485]  invasion of
[03:27:37.020 --> 03:27:38.461]  I don't think so.
[03:28:03.728 --> 03:28:08.206]  United States will invade Iraq in late summer or early fall at the latest of 2001.
[03:28:10.049 --> 03:28:19.031]  We were reporting an oral start, not far until 2002, probably about March.
[03:28:19.031 --> 03:28:20.231]  I read your paper at the time.
[03:28:20.231 --> 03:28:22.171]  It was 2002 they said it was going to happen.
[03:28:22.171 --> 03:28:23.932]  You said no, 2003.
[03:28:23.932 --> 03:28:26.292]  You had to follow the Berlin Wall.
[03:28:26.292 --> 03:28:30.333]  Hundreds of accurate predictions because you've infiltrated and have sources.
[03:28:30.333 --> 03:28:33.573]  We don't get into those modes of getting those sources.
[03:28:33.573 --> 03:28:35.894]  Continuing, what else are they planning?
[03:28:37.947 --> 03:28:43.530]  Well, that's about all the information I have now on the actual agenda.
[03:28:43.530 --> 03:28:47.031]  Of course, we'll be getting more as we work this story down the road.
[03:28:47.031 --> 03:28:54.795]  And a lot of this will be appearing in American Free Press' next edition goes out next Friday.
[03:28:54.795 --> 03:29:01.257]  I see you kept asking me how people subscribe.
[03:29:03.081 --> 03:29:03.981]  And this is a weekly newspaper.
[03:29:22.799 --> 03:29:24.539]  Yes, please, every Friday.
[03:29:51.926 --> 03:29:54.927]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.927 --> 03:30:01.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.309 --> 03:30:02.609]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.609 --> 03:30:08.190]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:30:08.190 --> 03:30:13.212]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:30:13.212 --> 03:30:18.253]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:30:18.793 --> 03:30:24.017]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:30:24.017 --> 03:30:26.338]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:30:26.338 --> 03:30:31.121]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:30:31.121 --> 03:30:32.262]  And here's the best part.
[03:30:32.262 --> 03:30:35.324]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:30:35.324 --> 03:30:38.606]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:30:38.926 --> 03:30:42.107]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:30:42.107 --> 03:30:44.327]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:30:44.327 --> 03:30:47.588]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:30:47.588 --> 03:30:53.149]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:30:53.149 --> 03:30:57.970]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:30:57.970 --> 03:31:00.351]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:01.872 --> 03:31:04.254]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:04.254 --> 03:31:06.576]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:06.576 --> 03:31:09.778]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.778 --> 03:31:14.903]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:14.903 --> 03:31:19.086]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:19.406 --> 03:31:21.869]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.869 --> 03:31:24.293]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.293 --> 03:31:27.557]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.557 --> 03:31:35.167]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.487 --> 03:31:40.871]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.871 --> 03:31:43.732]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:43.732 --> 03:31:47.415]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:47.415 --> 03:31:48.496]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.496 --> 03:31:49.836]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:49.836 --> 03:31:51.317]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:01.155 --> 03:32:03.277]  Hi, this is Steve Shank, eFoodsDirect.
[03:32:03.277 --> 03:32:08.681]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[03:32:08.681 --> 03:32:10.002]  Congratulations!
[03:32:10.002 --> 03:32:16.467]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[03:32:16.467 --> 03:32:21.511]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:32:21.511 --> 03:32:22.312]  Now something fun.
[03:32:22.892 --> 03:32:23.372]  I don't know.
[03:32:45.689 --> 03:32:46.870]  Oh, Lordy, my troubles so hard
[03:33:06.440 --> 03:33:09.244]  We're talking to an icon in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:33:09.244 --> 03:33:20.260]  You have these kings, these queens, the top 30 richest families, all meeting and he's snuck in, he's stolen their minutes.
[03:33:20.260 --> 03:33:21.762]  I've infiltrated, I've covered it.
[03:33:23.673 --> 03:33:25.495]  And it's world government.
[03:33:25.495 --> 03:33:26.255]  This is the group.
[03:33:26.255 --> 03:33:27.236]  And they tried to deny.
[03:33:27.236 --> 03:33:28.357]  Oh, there's no secret group.
[03:33:28.357 --> 03:33:29.958]  There's no New World Order.
[03:33:29.958 --> 03:33:35.662]  And now, they openly announce, OK, we're going to have a global treasury run by the private banks.
[03:33:35.662 --> 03:33:36.823]  We will levy the taxes.
[03:33:36.823 --> 03:33:41.827]  They've got all their banker spokesmen from England to Europe to Iceland to Greece to the U.S.
[03:33:41.827 --> 03:33:45.730]  saying, we've got to raise your taxes and we're going to cut your services.
[03:33:45.730 --> 03:33:47.592]  Everything goes to the banks.
[03:33:47.592 --> 03:33:52.996]  Remember, they made all this money up out of nothing through the private Federal Reserve System and similar central banks.
[03:33:54.817 --> 03:33:59.922]  They had an article a month ago in all the major papers in Australia.
[03:33:59.922 --> 03:34:02.245]  And the headlines were, in fact pull it up and put it on screen.
[03:34:04.198 --> 03:34:06.420]  Bank heads meet in secret in Australia.
[03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:08.723]  And you list the names, it's all Bilderberg group members.
[03:34:08.723 --> 03:34:10.365]  So they have other meetings.
[03:34:10.365 --> 03:34:14.749]  But this is their central mafia godfather commission meeting.
[03:34:14.749 --> 03:34:17.953]  I don't want to glaze over this Jim, then we're going to let you go, because I know you're a busy guy.
[03:34:17.953 --> 03:34:24.319]  You mentioned on their agenda is the IMF, from your source, this is also now in the news,
[03:34:25.140 --> 03:34:36.077]  Uh, as the World Treasury, and how angry are they about their Copenhagen Treaty, where the private banks would levy taxes on us and run our lives, being exposed by Climategate?
[03:34:37.995 --> 03:34:45.477]  They're angry if you ever see or hear one word spoken or see one word printed about Bilderberg, they're angry.
[03:34:45.477 --> 03:34:49.398]  They're used to, for 20 years, they're used to absolute secrecy.
[03:34:49.398 --> 03:34:59.221]  But their commitment to turning the International Monetary Fund into a World Treasury Department is unabated.
[03:34:59.221 --> 03:35:02.942]  A year ago, in Greece, they came up with that plan to
[03:35:03.832 --> 03:35:04.693]  We're good to go.
[03:35:30.290 --> 03:35:38.297]  Now Jim, every time I've had you on, I've asked you to really scan your memory from your Bilderberg sources.
[03:35:38.297 --> 03:35:39.918]  We'll just leave it at that.
[03:35:39.918 --> 03:35:47.985]  Anything else we should know about this area of Spain or what else is going to be on their agenda or anything else that we know they're concerned about?
[03:35:50.682 --> 03:35:53.944]  No, I've exhausted the preliminary information I have.
[03:35:53.944 --> 03:36:09.514]  Of course, I'll have a lot more when I get there, because now I'm getting a lot of help not only from European newspapers, but from some of the high officials themselves who have come forward privately to provide information.
[03:36:09.514 --> 03:36:12.796]  So we'll have a lot more as time goes by.
[03:36:17.094 --> 03:36:19.195]  I've just got exhausted the preliminary information I now have.
[03:36:19.195 --> 03:36:19.295]  Yes.
[03:36:19.295 --> 03:36:20.216]  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
[03:36:20.216 --> 03:36:21.117]  I couldn't hear you.
[03:36:47.069 --> 03:36:49.151]  I can't hear you.
[03:36:49.151 --> 03:36:49.772]  Can you hear me?
[03:36:49.772 --> 03:36:51.653]  I think we have to give up.
[03:36:51.653 --> 03:36:52.214]  I can't hear you.
[03:37:03.772 --> 03:37:10.158]  Yeah, Jim's regular phone line, you couldn't even hear him, and then his cell phone, you know, cell phones sometimes drop.
[03:37:10.158 --> 03:37:14.262]  I want to say bye to him, but, uh, well, I don't know how he keeps doing it.
[03:37:14.262 --> 03:37:21.128]  I mean, I saw him a few years ago at, um... Bilderberg in...
[03:37:22.369 --> 03:37:38.375]  Virginia and he'd be trying to get up out of a chair and his hips were hurting him so bad He's a he's a tough old bird, but that guy that guy just keeps going and he has a lot more energy once he gets to Bilderberg, you know, he Didn't chased around by secret police in Greece.
[03:37:38.375 --> 03:37:45.017]  That's some amazing footage That's all covered in endgame blueprint for global enslavement and
[03:37:48.442 --> 03:37:55.028]  Well actually that part, that's Canada and then Istanbul, Turkey.
[03:37:55.028 --> 03:38:02.194]  I guess we've got clips of what he's doing in the Obama deception from one of the other Bilderberg Group meetings.
[03:38:02.194 --> 03:38:06.438]  Okay, let me now go through a bunch of news that's important.
[03:38:06.438 --> 03:38:13.164]  For those out there that don't understand what net neutrality is, net neutrality is the internet as you know it.
[03:38:15.208 --> 03:38:38.868]  Net neutrality is being able to visit any website you want, you go by internet subscription, and you can visit MSNBC, you can visit InfoWars.com, you can visit BBC, you can visit the Drudge Report, you can visit your Little League football team website, you can visit a parks and recreation website, you can visit a dentist website, or a doctor's website, or the Easter Bunny's website if you so choose.
[03:38:38.868 --> 03:38:40.370]  Now, here is an article
[03:38:41.701 --> 03:38:43.842]  Out of Executive and Management Briefing.
[03:38:43.842 --> 03:38:47.903]  Comcast's win over FCC reignites net neutrality debate.
[03:38:47.903 --> 03:38:57.587]  The most immediate ramification of Comcast's net neutrality victory over the Federal Communications Commission this week is that ISPs might feel less inclined not to interfere in the traffic running over their networks.
[03:38:57.587 --> 03:39:04.130]  However, the implications range well beyond that, coloring every aspect of broadband marketplace.
[03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.950]  Now this is what
[03:39:07.150 --> 03:39:14.137]  China does, but the government is the big ISP basically, over the ISPs, and it decides what you can visit, what you can't.
[03:39:14.137 --> 03:39:15.458]  And they just put you in a blacklist.
[03:39:15.458 --> 03:39:17.240]  Australia's doing this.
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:18.281]  England's moving to do this.
[03:39:19.594 --> 03:39:24.558]  In fact, here is an article on that front out of cnetnews.uk.
[03:39:24.558 --> 03:39:26.560]  This is a CBS outfit.
[03:39:26.560 --> 03:39:30.303]  Digital Economy Bill, Nine Things You Can't Do Anymore.
[03:39:30.303 --> 03:39:32.404]  And it says, download from us.
[03:39:32.404 --> 03:39:35.567]  Download.com is part of a big happy CNET family.
[03:39:35.567 --> 03:39:45.294]  Among the available software and peer-to-peer share filing tools, the bill specifically states that websites such as Download.com can be blocked if they're providing tools that infringe copyrights.
[03:39:46.175 --> 03:39:57.469]  Even legal sites run by CBS that have nothing but legal stuff on there, and they give you tools to download, that isn't allowed in England.
[03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:58.310]  Use Wikileaks!
[03:39:59.491 --> 03:40:06.433]  Most worrying is that the same clause also specifically allows for blocking sites deemed likely to infringe on copyright.
[03:40:06.433 --> 03:40:14.975]  So, you expose a government document, doesn't matter if the government hasn't challenged it, they say that's government copyright, you won't be able to see WikiLeaks.
[03:40:14.975 --> 03:40:17.496]  And this is all stated, and it goes on and on.
[03:40:17.496 --> 03:40:20.277]  So people need to stop living in denial.
[03:40:20.277 --> 03:40:22.918]  Meanwhile, here's Fox News, Glenn Beck, last week.
[03:40:22.918 --> 03:40:24.178]  This is from FoxNews.com.
[03:40:26.388 --> 03:40:29.810]  And it says net neutrality pits free speech against free press.
[03:40:29.810 --> 03:40:40.335]  And he used, in a strawman argument in this article, hundreds of people that have filed with the FCC in briefs for and against ending net neutrality.
[03:40:40.335 --> 03:40:41.376]  Ending the internet as we know it.
[03:40:41.376 --> 03:40:52.261]  And he used one group out of hundreds that's a Marxist and says Marxists are running this and that we need to get rid of net neutrality.
[03:40:52.261 --> 03:40:53.342]  Meanwhile, Fox News
[03:40:54.454 --> 03:41:01.780]  Writes articles and calls Homeland Security on me a week and a half ago because somebody made violent comments on one of my message boards.
[03:41:01.780 --> 03:41:10.147]  We went to Fox News and found their own pundits calling for violence against Obama and more violent talk all over Fox Nation.
[03:41:10.147 --> 03:41:11.929]  Needless to say, we did not call the feds on them.
[03:41:12.829 --> 03:41:15.191]  But, look, they want to shut me down.
[03:41:15.191 --> 03:41:16.472]  They want to shut you down.
[03:41:16.472 --> 03:41:18.633]  They want to shut the alternative media down.
[03:41:18.633 --> 03:41:22.556]  Mainstream media is getting their butt kicked by the alternative media.
[03:41:22.556 --> 03:41:24.137]  And Rupert Murdoch has said this.
[03:41:24.137 --> 03:41:26.879]  And they all want to shut down free speech.
[03:41:26.879 --> 03:41:30.682]  They can't deal with it.
[03:41:30.682 --> 03:41:31.303]  Here's another one.
[03:41:31.303 --> 03:41:35.906]  Court rules against FCC net neutrality arrangements and arguments.
[03:41:39.929 --> 03:41:48.373]  Now, meanwhile, while we have all of this going on, here's the Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:48.373 --> 03:41:50.714]  Now remember, I call it propaganda placement.
[03:41:50.714 --> 03:41:53.955]  It's not just Coca-Cola and Pepsi and
[03:41:56.789 --> 03:42:03.853]  Warville, Redenbacher, popcorn ads that are woven into TV shows themselves and into movies.
[03:42:03.853 --> 03:42:12.198]  When you're watching a movie and you see National Guard billboards everywhere and Spider-Man or whatever, millions were paid for that.
[03:42:12.198 --> 03:42:18.081]  Or on The Apprentice, millions were paid per episode to show Virgin Atlantic signs.
[03:42:19.821 --> 03:42:22.849]  It's not just ads during the ads, it's ads during the show.
[03:42:22.849 --> 03:42:26.076]  That's how all media is now, is people glaze over a lot of the breaks.
[03:42:29.591 --> 03:42:39.621]  Now, tens of billions a year are spent on this, and I've been telling people about it, and Congress has ruled it's illegal, and then the General Accounting Office has said it's illegal, but they don't care.
[03:42:39.621 --> 03:42:44.846]  But now they admit the government is going to be the main advertiser with U.S.
[03:42:44.846 --> 03:42:45.627]  tax money.
[03:42:45.627 --> 03:42:50.912]  They're moving away from product placement, NBC says, to pure behavior placement.
[03:42:51.593 --> 03:42:53.275]  Now, I'd never seen this term referenced.
[03:42:53.275 --> 03:42:55.056]  I called it propaganda placement.
[03:42:55.056 --> 03:42:58.980]  They call it behavior, or I would call it brainwashing placement.
[03:42:58.980 --> 03:43:01.342]  And it says, what your TV is telling you to do.
[03:43:01.342 --> 03:43:05.946]  And of course, they introduce the fact that you're being propagandized with something that sounds reasonable.
[03:43:05.946 --> 03:43:08.949]  Recycle, exercise, eat right.
[03:43:08.949 --> 03:43:16.656]  But really, it's anti-family, pro-CPS, anti-Second Amendment, pro-torture, pro-surveillance, pro-corruption.
[03:43:17.662 --> 03:43:18.983]  You watch any show, you'll see it.
[03:43:18.983 --> 03:43:21.606]  They're being paid your tax money.
[03:43:21.606 --> 03:43:23.789]  Those shows are financed to brainwash you.
[03:43:25.652 --> 03:43:31.316]  In just one... And that's mainly because people for the last decade or so don't trust mainstream TV.
[03:43:31.316 --> 03:43:35.199]  And all the polls and studies show people trust alternative media even more.
[03:43:35.199 --> 03:43:36.280]  Sometimes I don't know why.
[03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:38.582]  I mean, there's a lot of garbage in alternative media.
[03:43:38.582 --> 03:43:40.123]  The government's infiltrated that.
[03:43:40.123 --> 03:43:42.124]  They have provocateurs out there.
[03:43:42.124 --> 03:43:45.887]  But the point is, you should be suspect of everything, folks, and do research.
[03:43:45.887 --> 03:43:48.649]  That doesn't mean just be suspect if someone makes a claim.
[03:43:48.649 --> 03:43:49.470]  Go look into it.
[03:43:51.138 --> 03:44:03.409]  But because they know you're not really suspect of TV shows and movies, that's where the real messages are.
[03:44:03.409 --> 03:44:04.249]  And it goes on.
[03:44:04.249 --> 03:44:12.236]  In just one week on NBC, the directives, the detectives on Law & Order investigated a cash for clunkers scam.
[03:44:12.236 --> 03:44:12.737]  A nurse on
[03:44:14.204 --> 03:44:26.352]  Mercy organized a group bike ride, Al Gore made a guest appearance on 30 Rock, and the office turned Dwight into a cape-wearing superhero obsessed with recycling.
[03:44:26.352 --> 03:44:31.276]  See, it's just all brainwashing for peer-pressure-run airheads that watch.
[03:44:31.276 --> 03:44:32.157]  Coincidence?
[03:44:32.157 --> 03:44:32.557]  Hardly.
[03:44:32.557 --> 03:44:39.862]  Now, see, we aired the Al Gore stuff at the time a few months ago, and I said on air, I said, that is staged.
[03:44:39.862 --> 03:44:41.283]  That is paid for.
[03:44:41.283 --> 03:44:42.764]  Turns out it is paid for by the government.
[03:44:44.565 --> 03:44:46.266]  It's all paid for.
[03:44:46.266 --> 03:44:53.330]  But now they're saying, oh, we're going to pretty much, except for pharmacy ads and drug ads, we're just even abandoning corporations.
[03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:54.750]  The government is going to fund this.
[03:44:54.750 --> 03:45:02.635]  And remember the FCC head a few weeks ago said, we're going to have government messages and government broadcast systems and government messages and TV.
[03:45:02.635 --> 03:45:03.575]  They've always had it.
[03:45:03.575 --> 03:45:04.876]  Now they're just going full scale.
[03:45:06.328 --> 03:45:07.709]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[03:45:07.709 --> 03:45:09.269]  The tactic, General Electric Co.'
[03:45:09.249 --> 03:45:12.211]  's NBCUniversal calls it, behavior placement.
[03:45:12.211 --> 03:45:19.974]  You wonder why every time in football or basketball they make a goal, at that moment of heightened enjoyment, they cut the troops?
[03:45:19.974 --> 03:45:21.155]  Clapping?
[03:45:21.155 --> 03:45:23.656]  That's meant to say, you like touchdowns?
[03:45:23.656 --> 03:45:24.636]  You like a basket?
[03:45:24.636 --> 03:45:26.197]  You like a hole-in-one?
[03:45:26.197 --> 03:45:29.938]  Troops did it!
[03:45:29.938 --> 03:45:32.760]  Miss America says, I just want to thank the troops?
[03:45:32.760 --> 03:45:33.320]  That's paid!
[03:45:35.558 --> 03:45:37.780]  You wonder why Miss America always praises the UN?
[03:45:37.780 --> 03:45:40.223]  That's been paid for for 50 years.
[03:45:40.223 --> 03:45:42.206]  It's all brainwashing.
[03:45:42.206 --> 03:45:44.969]  And they hand them their talking points.
[03:45:44.969 --> 03:45:46.951]  I heard radio ads for Austin Air Force.
[03:45:46.951 --> 03:45:47.932]  Something to do with the military.
[03:45:49.708 --> 03:45:50.889]  This is like 11 years ago.
[03:45:50.889 --> 03:45:52.029]  We have an AXS TV show.
[03:45:52.029 --> 03:45:52.729]  We did Mike Hanson.
[03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:54.050]  I'll dig that out and put it on YouTube.
[03:45:54.050 --> 03:45:58.872]  And they were saying, free emissions testing for your cars in all these locations!
[03:45:58.872 --> 03:46:03.554]  And if you come to get the emissions testing, you know, $10 or whatever it was off your oil change.
[03:46:03.554 --> 03:46:04.315]  So I show up.
[03:46:04.315 --> 03:46:06.336]  I walk over to the head of the Austin Air Force.
[03:46:06.336 --> 03:46:07.136]  And I said, let me guess.
[03:46:07.136 --> 03:46:14.039]  You have a federal government grant, and this is conditioning to prepare the public for new taxes and new emissions testing.
[03:46:14.039 --> 03:46:15.300]  And he said, absolutely, Alex.
[03:46:15.300 --> 03:46:15.880]  That's the plan.
[03:46:17.199 --> 03:46:17.959]  He just laughed.
[03:46:17.959 --> 03:46:32.686]  See, it's this culture of enjoyment that the publishers blind and mindless and mercury's good for me, fluoride's good for me, government my friend, fellow reserve my friend, TV show says so.
[03:46:32.686 --> 03:46:41.630]  I see these cartoons, countless ones, where the kids have microchips, where world government's good, where the UN's the savior, all paid for!
[03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:43.710]  Going back to Captain Planet.
[03:46:43.710 --> 03:46:44.671]  Ted Turner admits that.
[03:46:46.567 --> 03:46:49.550]  And of course, anybody who has a factory is the bad guy.
[03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:53.072]  That's because the government's going to shut down anybody's factories that they don't control.
[03:46:53.072 --> 03:46:53.953]  This is mafia.
[03:46:53.953 --> 03:46:54.714]  This is a takeover.
[03:46:56.141 --> 03:46:57.703]  The tactic General Electric Co.'
[03:46:57.682 --> 03:47:11.996]  's NBCUniversal calls it behavior placement, is designed to sway viewers to adopt actions they see modeled in their favorite shows, and it helps sell ads to marketers who want to associate their brands with feel-good, societally aware show.
[03:47:11.996 --> 03:47:14.698]  No, see this article itself is deceptive.
[03:47:14.698 --> 03:47:17.021]  This is all paid for and that's been admitted in congressional reports.
[03:47:17.021 --> 03:47:18.062]  In fact, Google
[03:47:24.428 --> 03:47:26.905]  Government-paid-for news ruled illegal.
[03:47:28.940 --> 03:47:38.665]  I mean, when you see a newscast locally, but it airs in every local affiliate in the country, that mercury is now good for children's brains and has been found to be nutritious.
[03:47:38.665 --> 03:47:43.207]  I mean, that's a real thing that went out from the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.
[03:47:43.207 --> 03:47:45.589]  I went and looked it up and it turned out that was a government grant.
[03:47:45.589 --> 03:47:55.414]  CBS was paid money, and this is the big secret with radio and TV stations, the big local marquee station that can put everybody out of business and can't be stopped and has all the power.
[03:47:57.392 --> 03:48:02.641]  When you listen to their news, and even their news readers don't know this, it's all given to them.
[03:48:02.641 --> 03:48:05.086]  It's all product placement.
[03:48:05.086 --> 03:48:08.532]  But when it's government, it's propaganda placement or behavior placement.
[03:48:13.530 --> 03:48:16.632]  And on all the shows, the cool woman's on Prozac.
[03:48:16.632 --> 03:48:22.196]  And on all the shows, the cool woman reports the homeschoolers next door.
[03:48:22.196 --> 03:48:23.357]  Why aren't they in school?
[03:48:23.357 --> 03:48:25.198]  The message is homeschooling's illegal.
[03:48:25.198 --> 03:48:27.780]  And then always the homeschoolers are bad.
[03:48:27.780 --> 03:48:29.321]  That's another thing.
[03:48:29.321 --> 03:48:31.163]  Another form of propaganda is on cops.
[03:48:31.163 --> 03:48:32.484]  They only show you the guilty.
[03:48:32.484 --> 03:48:34.445]  They only show you white trash scum.
[03:48:34.445 --> 03:48:37.107]  And the message is cops good and clean, public all evil.
[03:48:37.107 --> 03:48:40.109]  All right, I said I'd get to all this other news.
[03:48:40.109 --> 03:48:41.070]  We're running out of time here.
[03:48:42.635 --> 03:48:58.073]  We live in a total and complete propaganda state and we're one of the few outfits that's gained any prominence that is effective and so the federal government is coming in demonizing
[03:49:00.441 --> 03:49:05.909]  The internet, myself and many others to prepare to curtail it and to shut it down.
[03:49:05.909 --> 03:49:11.717]  And my message to all of you out there is the time to wake up and to realize what's happening.
[03:49:12.717 --> 03:49:13.718]  It's here.
[03:49:13.718 --> 03:49:15.138]  Okay?
[03:49:15.138 --> 03:49:21.062]  You're never safe when the government's got police in black uniforms and black masks and there's cameras on street corners.
[03:49:21.062 --> 03:49:23.943]  You're never safe when they're secretly arresting people and torturing them.
[03:49:23.943 --> 03:49:27.865]  You're never safe when foreign banks are looting trillions of dollars a month.
[03:49:27.865 --> 03:49:33.388]  You're never safe when most of the news and TV is paid for government propaganda and they don't even tell you that.
[03:49:33.388 --> 03:49:35.109]  That's not a free society.
[03:49:35.109 --> 03:49:37.070]  It's not cute and funny.
[03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:39.311]  It's danger, Will Robinson.
[03:49:39.311 --> 03:49:39.752]  Danger!
[03:49:40.957 --> 03:49:42.299]  What's Robbie the Robot say?
[03:49:42.299 --> 03:49:43.581]  Danger, Will Robertson!
[03:49:43.581 --> 03:49:44.162]  Danger!
[03:49:44.162 --> 03:49:44.663]  Danger!
[03:49:44.663 --> 03:49:48.529]  This is danger that we're in.
[03:49:48.529 --> 03:49:49.951]  This isn't funny.
[03:49:49.951 --> 03:49:51.112]  This isn't cute.
[03:49:52.196 --> 03:50:02.306]  They're not running drills all over the country with military running real checkpoints in every state in the union because they want to play patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
[03:50:02.306 --> 03:50:04.868]  Roll him up, roll him up, put him in the pan.
[03:50:04.868 --> 03:50:09.252]  Mark him, prick him, mark him with a B, put it in the oven for baby and me.
[03:50:09.252 --> 03:50:12.095]  Or however that nursery rhyme goes, you know.
[03:50:12.095 --> 03:50:14.177]  This is a fallen republic.
[03:50:16.226 --> 03:50:19.687]  This is a society imploding into evil.
[03:50:19.687 --> 03:50:21.107]  They're getting rid of our borders.
[03:50:21.107 --> 03:50:22.608]  They're staging terror attacks.
[03:50:22.608 --> 03:50:26.369]  I mean, I didn't even get into this.
[03:50:26.369 --> 03:50:26.909]  Here it is.
[03:50:26.909 --> 03:50:32.110]  FCC advisor advocates state-run propaganda megaphone to counter alternative media.
[03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:35.411]  See, we're the enemy of the alternative media.
[03:50:35.411 --> 03:50:37.652]  I want to come back and get into this Half-Life review.
[03:50:40.114 --> 03:50:42.076]  You can see it two ways.
[03:50:42.076 --> 03:50:44.299]  We're going to play this video for viewers.
[03:50:44.299 --> 03:50:49.646]  It is posted up at InfoWars.com, the video and the text written by Matt Ryan.

[03:50:57.535 --> 03:50:58.276]  So jam-packed.
[03:50:59.631 --> 03:51:01.793]  Also, interviewing Tucker is always fun.
[03:51:01.793 --> 03:51:04.995]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!

[03:52:13.528 --> 03:52:19.394]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.394 --> 03:52:25.599]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:26.059 --> 03:52:32.020]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[03:53:36.176 --> 03:53:39.220]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:53:39.380 --> 03:53:40.800]  What have you got to lose?
[03:53:40.800 --> 03:53:42.081]  Stop the calls now!
[03:53:42.081 --> 03:53:44.101]  Get out of debt and have more money!
[03:53:44.101 --> 03:53:47.322]  Get Herb K's number one death secret absolutely free now!
[03:53:47.322 --> 03:53:47.982]  Call 800-822-1291.
[03:53:47.982 --> 03:53:48.542]  That's 800-822-1291.
[03:53:48.542 --> 03:53:48.582]  800-822-1291.
[03:54:10.427 --> 03:54:15.109]  The Naked Body Scanner Contest has been an incredible success.
[03:54:15.109 --> 03:54:23.152]  We're going to be posting hordes of videos starting today and throughout the week at InfoWars.com of the different entries.
[03:54:23.152 --> 03:54:24.692]  It's just incredible.
[03:54:24.692 --> 03:54:28.774]  We'll be playing some of those throughout the week as well.
[03:54:32.265 --> 03:54:39.810]  More and more, we like to analyze propaganda here on this radio slash TV show multimedia transmission.
[03:54:39.810 --> 03:54:47.736]  And we know there's product placement and propaganda placement, behavior placement as the insiders call it, going on in video games.
[03:54:47.736 --> 03:54:52.199]  Video games are now bigger than movies, bigger than TV, profit-wise.
[03:54:52.199 --> 03:54:57.163]  And you have some games, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people playing simultaneously.
[03:54:57.163 --> 03:55:01.226]  The government's tracking what you do, tracking your psychology, the choices you make.
[03:55:01.846 --> 03:55:06.821]  This is a psychological warfare dictatorship that we live in.
[03:55:08.871 --> 03:55:32.672]  But Half-Life 2 came out a few years ago, and I don't play video games, but people kept sending me emails saying, your show's like Half-Life 2, or it's like Metal Gear Solid, or it's like, and I've gone and looked at all these video games now, and it's all, the government's gonna microchip you, they're putting stuff in the water, they're brainwashing you, they're drugging you, a world government's coming, and people say, oh good, they're fighting the New World Order!
[03:55:34.761 --> 03:55:38.665]  I've talked to some of the game developers now and at the grassroots they're fans of the show.
[03:55:38.665 --> 03:55:41.968]  In fact, I've been woven into quite a few major video games.
[03:55:41.968 --> 03:55:48.053]  I've even licensed it where they can use clips of my voice in some popular games.
[03:55:48.053 --> 03:55:50.256]  But the issue is that
[03:55:52.059 --> 03:55:52.279]  This is
[03:56:09.226 --> 03:56:12.287]  By Matt Ryan up on Infowars.com.
[03:56:12.287 --> 03:56:23.211]  But here's a two-minute video he put together, kind of boiling down Half-Life 2, and everything you see in this video is what the UN and the globalist social engineers say they're planning to set up.
[03:56:23.211 --> 03:56:29.193]  This is how you will live, if they even allow you to live, once their world government is in place.
[03:56:29.193 --> 03:56:34.755]  This isn't fiction, this is reality, covered in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:56:34.755 --> 03:56:35.135]  Here it is.
[03:56:36.510 --> 03:56:37.590]  Sometimes I've been relocated.
[03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:40.851]  I never get used to it.
[03:56:40.851 --> 03:56:42.252]  Welcome.
[03:56:42.252 --> 03:56:45.233]  Welcome to City 17.
[03:56:45.233 --> 03:56:52.355]  You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.
[03:56:52.355 --> 03:57:03.298]  I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors.
[03:57:04.133 --> 03:57:08.174]  I've been proud to call City 17 my home.
[03:57:08.174 --> 03:57:18.076]  And so, whether you are here to stay or passing through on your way to parts unknown, welcome to City 17.
[03:57:18.076 --> 03:57:21.857]  It's safer here.
[03:57:21.857 --> 03:57:25.738]  But this stuff, it's all I have left.
[03:57:25.738 --> 03:57:26.538]  All right, I'm moving.
[03:57:26.538 --> 03:57:28.159]  Geez.
[03:57:28.159 --> 03:57:28.679]  Police brutality!
[03:57:28.679 --> 03:57:29.939]  You're the only ones on that train?
[03:57:36.269 --> 03:57:40.012]  Overwatch stopped our train of thoughts and took my husband for questioning.
[03:57:40.012 --> 03:57:42.153]  They said he'd be on the next train.
[03:57:42.153 --> 03:57:44.695]  I'm not sure when that was.
[03:57:44.695 --> 03:57:49.118]  Did there be nice though, letting me wait for him?
[03:57:49.118 --> 03:57:52.320]  Don't drink the water.
[03:57:52.320 --> 03:57:54.001]  They put something in it to make you forget.
[03:57:54.001 --> 03:57:59.385]  I don't even remember how I got here.
[03:57:59.385 --> 03:58:01.066]  I see they took your suitcase too.
[03:58:01.066 --> 03:58:02.407]  They can't get away with this much longer.
[03:58:03.445 --> 03:58:05.006]  I'm working up the nerve to go on.
[03:58:05.006 --> 03:58:06.807]  They're bringing again?
[03:58:06.807 --> 03:58:10.469]  I was hoping I'd seen the last of him in City 14.
[03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:12.049]  I wouldn't say that too loud.
[03:58:12.049 --> 03:58:14.451]  This is his base of operations.
[03:58:14.451 --> 03:58:15.851]  Welcome.
[03:58:15.851 --> 03:58:17.132]  Welcome to City 17.
[03:58:35.854 --> 03:58:37.178]  That's what the airports are.
[03:58:37.178 --> 03:58:39.745]  They're training you to live as a slave and training your children.
[03:58:39.745 --> 03:58:40.788]  God bless you all.
[03:58:40.788 --> 03:58:41.249]  Fight back!
