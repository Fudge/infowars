[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:34.880]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome we
[00:34.880 --> 00:43.640]  are streaming into the middle of April 2010 it is Monday the 12th day of April 2010
[00:43.640 --> 00:51.360]  we're going to be live here for the next four hours today Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer is
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.840]  going to be joining us from Ireland via video Skype coming up in the middle of the next hour
[00:56.840 --> 01:03.920]  for 30 minutes to talk about a host of issues including last week's massacre videos that were
[01:03.920 --> 01:08.880]  released several have now been released Jim Tucker they believe they've discovered and he's always
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.000]  been right in the past the location some had thought it was going to be in England but now
[01:14.000 --> 01:23.160]  it has been identified to be on the continent of Europe in Spain and he's also got his inside
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.680]  Builderburg group sources we'll talk to him about what is on the agenda for Builderburg
[01:27.680 --> 01:38.120]  2010 in Spain so that is coming up in the last hour with Jim Tucker of American Free Press okay
[01:38.120 --> 01:47.520]  I have an unusual amount of news to cover today and I'm going to attempt to cover it all yesterday
[01:47.520 --> 01:55.520]  I said I would get into the president of Poland Kaczynski dying over the weekend with a large
[01:55.520 --> 02:02.320]  portion of the Polish leadership flying into Russia but I have to be honest with you he was
[02:02.320 --> 02:10.720]  enemies with the Russians he was enemies now with NATO and with the EU and if I had the
[02:10.720 --> 02:18.480]  dead reckoning and past evidence and a lot of other factors going in probably foul play probably
[02:18.480 --> 02:31.320]  foul play so we'll break down what happened with that coming up in the next segment but the lesson
[02:31.320 --> 02:38.040]  to government is don't put the majority of your executive branch and the head of your central
[02:38.040 --> 02:45.120]  bank and others who've just said no to the European Union take over of your country don't put them
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.720]  all on one aircraft and the aircraft was having technical difficulties coming in it missed the
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.680]  runway four times it was out of fuel and an emergency landing and that could have just
[02:56.680 --> 03:06.280]  been the case or they could have set up a mechanical malfunction but because governments
[03:06.280 --> 03:11.240]  are so good at covering things up we don't know what the truth is they'd also been staging or
[03:11.240 --> 03:17.440]  trying to stage missile systems in Poland for NATO Russia had reasons to want to get rid of
[03:17.440 --> 03:24.320]  the aircraft and one of the twins that ran the country his brother was the prime minister
[03:24.320 --> 03:39.080]  that's Kaczynski twins big TV movie actors in Poland so that is some of what is coming up today
[03:39.080 --> 03:48.640]  also provocateurs openly announced plans to stage tea party violence and disruptions this
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.200]  being different anarchist groups who always wear big communist red stars around their necks or red
[03:54.200 --> 04:00.320]  armbands they're communists who call themselves anarchist and who call for leftist policies
[04:00.320 --> 04:10.480]  and big government with anarchists like these who needs the sex pistols this is about as pro
[04:10.480 --> 04:20.200]  anarchy as Mao Zedong and we've got the media and the whole system really gearing up to stage
[04:20.200 --> 04:25.600]  events against the tea parties and now they're saying we're Confederate soldiers terrorist
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.760]  I'm going to get into this today also seen an article equates Confederate soldiers to
[04:29.760 --> 04:37.320]  terrorist corporate media connects Atari members the US military so that demonization
[04:37.320 --> 04:41.480]  is in full swing that's coming up I want to get into the attack on the internet it's now

[08:06.680 --> 08:14.960]  there's a war on for your mind let me watch straight into the news is a lot of it obviously
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.400]  it's extremely important many different factors are converging right now the establishment
[08:20.400 --> 08:26.520]  of world government and the growing resistance to it also want to get into unbelievable developments
[08:26.520 --> 08:30.960]  across the board with the states going into bankruptcy the county's the city's going into
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.640]  bankruptcy as the taxes only go up and up and as the services are cut we are definitely
[08:36.640 --> 08:42.880]  being transformed into mexico we are definitely being transformed into greece we are definitely
[08:42.880 --> 08:48.640]  on the road to being totally taken over like we've seen in with hundreds of other countries in
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.800]  the last several centuries this is economic warfare toe-to-toe with the new world order and
[08:54.800 --> 09:02.000]  if we can't identify who is doing this we have no hope of reversing this trend but the people
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.360]  are beginning to wake up i'm seeing mainstream news reports on cnn msnbc fox talking about
[09:10.360 --> 09:15.560]  criminal activity by the central banks discussing how they create money out of nothing how they
[09:15.560 --> 09:21.000]  engineered the crisis the media is now starting to admit okay you're not going to get free
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.920]  health care this just cuts your care and basically raises your taxes so as the public begins
[09:27.920 --> 09:36.200]  to learn just how serious this is the mainstream media is being forced not all the time but
[09:36.200 --> 09:42.240]  at least a little bit to admit what's going on or they'll lose all credibility and i want
[09:42.240 --> 09:48.360]  to go into a story that i mentioned yesterday but into more detail what your tv is telling
[09:48.360 --> 09:54.880]  you to do and i coined the term over a decade ago propaganda placement they have now coined
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.920]  a term for what they've been doing for a long time behavior placement this is out of the
[09:59.920 --> 10:06.840]  wall street journal and it dovetails with com cash win over fcc reignites net neutrality
[10:06.840 --> 10:15.400]  debate and also in england last week digital economy bill nine things you can't do anymore
[10:15.400 --> 10:23.480]  from cnet news cnet uk and then the cnet of course is a part of cbs so this is mainstream
[10:23.480 --> 10:29.840]  media admitting what's going on it's basically says the end of free speech the end of the
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.920]  internet as we know it and they're now moving to do the exact same thing here in the united
[10:35.920 --> 10:42.040]  states so when i read these articles this is from executive management briefing this
[10:42.040 --> 10:49.520]  is from cbs news this is from wall street journal this is not alex jones saying all of this
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.640]  this is the mainstream media admitting what's going on but reporting it dryly like it's
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.360]  no big deal and i mentioned this yesterday but i want to read the quotes today a transcript
[10:59.360 --> 11:08.160]  from glenn back last week glenn back net neutrality pits free speech against free press and he
[11:08.160 --> 11:14.960]  runs a straw man operation here hundreds and hundreds of people have filed in the last
[11:14.960 --> 11:23.320]  month and the public comment period where individuals can file think tanks law firms
[11:23.320 --> 11:31.680]  universities organizations governments corporations hundreds and hundreds have filed and it doesn't
[11:31.680 --> 11:38.880]  close until later in the month what the twenty sixth is the last day bill to file glenn
[11:38.880 --> 11:45.240]  back went in and found one marxist group that put a filing in and said it's a marxist plan
[11:45.240 --> 11:54.400]  net neutrality is a marxist plan it's marxist that's abusing your listeners that's treating
[11:54.400 --> 12:00.800]  your listeners and your viewers like morons and that's why i can't stand back i i try
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.240]  to not watch him i try to not listen i try to not attack him i just try to ignore it
[12:05.240 --> 12:12.000]  but he is the leader he's the biggest fish in the pond posing as a patriot and on every
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.680]  issue he's for the value added tax and i got a call last night i went and checked it sure
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.120]  enough last week he was saying he's against the value added tax now obama's value added
[12:23.120 --> 12:30.240]  tax he has his own value added tax he wants look shutting down the internet is not conservative
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.920]  or libertarian pushing value added taxes is not conservative or libertarian calling for
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.080]  the expansion of the patriot act and the police state of new wars is not constitutional alright
[12:44.080 --> 12:50.160]  i'm not even going to go there yet when i cover this i will a little bit but i basically
[12:50.160 --> 12:59.480]  already covered that facet here's the new york times headline kazinski often a source
[12:59.480 --> 13:12.920]  of tension with e u this was april 10th one day before his airplane crashed or actually
[13:12.920 --> 13:20.640]  the day it crashed and it said president kazinski who died saturday in a plane crash in western
[13:20.640 --> 13:28.320]  russia rose from childhood famous an actor to become president of poland he was 60 half
[13:28.320 --> 13:33.920]  of an unusual tandem of power mr kazinski was elected president no five from the nationalist
[13:33.920 --> 13:39.560]  conservative law and justice party led by his identical twin whom he later appointed prime
[13:39.560 --> 13:55.480]  minister now kazinski had called for putting missile systems in radar nato systems in poland
[13:55.480 --> 14:03.840]  that had angered russia but separately in the last three weeks his entire government began
[14:03.840 --> 14:12.280]  to figure out that almost all the supermarkets that were small or polish owned have shut
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.880]  down most of the polish factories have shut down in just a few years they've been part
[14:16.880 --> 14:23.000]  of the european union and that basically this was a system for the private central banks
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.240]  to prey on poland like greece and poland was next to be fully bankrupted and basically
[14:29.240 --> 14:42.240]  have all their tax money go to debt to the private banks like nigeria or greece or argentina
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.360]  and so they came out and began criticizing and said we're going to devalue our currency
[14:47.360 --> 14:55.400]  now generally that's not a good thing but that would have been good for their own domestic
[14:55.400 --> 15:03.480]  farming and and industry and construction because they really are an old world country
[15:03.480 --> 15:11.000]  next to a fully developed high tech first world western europe and they could not compete
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.920]  in this system and having to have their currency tied to the euro as part of e u integration
[15:17.920 --> 15:26.320]  was clearly destroying their economy and very unpopular and so it didn't matter that kazinski
[15:26.320 --> 15:33.160]  was a lapdog of nato in the new world order as soon as he began to become a true nationalist
[15:33.160 --> 15:41.760]  and do some things that were good for his people he's dead and there was a major split forming
[15:41.760 --> 15:47.560]  between the kazinski twins and his government and nato and the west and then here's the
[15:47.560 --> 15:53.160]  headline kazinski often a source of tension within the e u and one big e u nation like
[15:53.160 --> 15:58.400]  poland breaking off and and and doing what iceland has done the last month and saying
[15:58.400 --> 16:07.800]  no would bring down the euro and that's actually what george soros is saying in reuters today
[16:07.800 --> 16:13.600]  well that problem is solved because kazinski is dead and it could have been a malfunction
[16:13.600 --> 16:20.440]  in the aircraft it could have been an accident i don't know i want to get tarpley on the
[16:20.440 --> 16:26.400]  next few days to get his take it could have been nato and the e u killing him they did
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.960]  announce that they were going to kick the bankers out last week and he's dead five days later
[16:29.960 --> 16:38.760]  he announced it last monday five and a half days later he's dead or it could have been
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.600]  the russians but why would they blow his plane up now when for the last five years he's
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.480]  been a thorn in their side and now he was beginning to get closer to russia again he
[16:48.480 --> 16:54.720]  was swinging back towards russia but russia could have said look you've got almost the
[16:54.720 --> 17:00.840]  entire opposition to us from the polis government on one airplane over a hundred government officials
[17:00.840 --> 17:05.680]  or right at a hundred it's a hundred counting the crew they're saying eighty plus officials
[17:05.680 --> 17:13.080]  and we cannot miss this opportunity and they plant a small bomb somewhere inside the aircraft
[17:13.080 --> 17:18.520]  to depressurize it or in fuel tanks we don't know but we do know the plane came in at an
[17:18.520 --> 17:25.920]  erratic over driven speed it missed the runway three times the pilot it's confirmed was dumping
[17:25.920 --> 17:33.600]  fuel and the fact that nato the e u and the russians aren't releasing a lot of this information
[17:33.600 --> 17:38.000]  we showed there was an amaze some type of malfunction there was fog on the airfield
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.640]  reportedly though i saw a video of thirty minutes after and saw no fog but fog can dissipate
[17:42.640 --> 17:50.040]  quickly just like they said that with the senator from minnesota that there was supposedly
[17:50.040 --> 17:56.560]  fog and snow but there wasn't we know that guy was a big thorn in the side right when
[17:56.560 --> 18:05.760]  the war was kicking off so all of this is going on and in comes the aircraft and crashes
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.640]  now i want to know why there isn't just a smoldering black hole in the ground because
[18:11.640 --> 18:17.240]  with flight ninety three in pennsylvania it's a hole in the ground an engine five miles
[18:17.240 --> 18:24.040]  away i want to know why it didn't disappear like wiley coyote when he's swinging from
[18:24.040 --> 18:28.520]  cliff to cliff and he just disappears into a rock face with a silhouette etched into
[18:28.520 --> 18:42.200]  the side i want to know why when they blew up the old cowboys Irving stadium why they
[18:42.200 --> 18:48.900]  didn't just light it on fire with a big lighter and why it didn't just collapse clock runs
[18:48.900 --> 18:56.520]  out for the cowboys legend thousands cheer reflect as Irving icon crumbles into lure texas
[18:56.520 --> 19:05.680]  stadiums cowboys fabled home field now rubble within a minute we're gonna pull some video
[19:05.680 --> 19:16.400]  that up when we go live on tv and ask the question why did it collapse into its own
[19:16.400 --> 19:27.080]  footprint why why didn't they just use a big lighter building seven was hit by a plane
[19:27.080 --> 19:32.280]  and fell into its own footprint how did this stadium fall into its own footprint i mean
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.120]  why do they need to use explosives if you can just light something on fire you just
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.440]  light a paper cup put it up against a pillar the whole stadium would fall down of course
[19:42.440 --> 19:52.400]  it's asinine but my gut tells me that nato killed president kuzhinski all right we come
[19:52.400 --> 20:01.400]  back i will get into the incredible economic news as the states implode by design times

[24:59.000 --> 25:09.560]  of uh... Stalinist purges and i wanted to go back in time was ron brown assassinated
[25:09.560 --> 25:16.760]  remember they were flying into syria back in nineteen ninety seven ron brown had told
[25:16.760 --> 25:27.520]  reporters if i go down he said if i go down he said i'm going to take the administration
[25:27.520 --> 25:34.520]  with me and he had been involved as the head of the commerce department commerce secretary
[25:34.520 --> 25:41.080]  in the communist generals from china corporations uh... the huge payoffs uh... communist generals
[25:41.080 --> 25:48.200]  being given government offices have been getting given government codes just absolute
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.680]  uh... sellout to the communist chinese by bill clinton missile secrets merve technology
[25:54.680 --> 26:02.120]  so that when a icbm launches from uh... northern china and comes over the ice caps to hit the
[26:02.120 --> 26:06.800]  united states that's the shortest route when it comes back into the atmosphere of the nose
[26:06.800 --> 26:13.720]  cone pops open instead of firing one nuclear weapon at a city it can fire as many as twenty
[26:13.720 --> 26:21.960]  or it can have ten warheads and ten dummies so that even if you have uh... anti missile
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.680]  laser batteries particle beam batteries uh... anti missile missile batteries missile the
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.680]  missile batteries uh... ground to air anti missile systems it doesn't matter that's the
[26:31.680 --> 26:37.600]  type of stuff they sold out the chinese the computer secrets just everything and ron brown
[26:37.600 --> 26:43.880]  was in a lot of trouble and uh... his aircraft blew up and crashed into mountains and then
[26:43.880 --> 26:48.320]  it was reported that many of the bodies had bullet holes in them that was actually in
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.520]  the new york times in wall street journal air force lieutenant colonel steve cogswell
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.400]  a medical doctor forensic pathologist and deputy medical examiner with the air force
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.760]  institute of pathology uh... has released photos and x-rays which show forty five caliber
[27:02.760 --> 27:09.760]  wounds in the head of uh... the uh... bodies uh... of uh... mister brown and others
[27:20.760 --> 27:26.280]  so we have all of this unfolding and the media then came out and said that the air force
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.760]  were conspiracy theorists now how would you shoot people in the head on board an aircraft
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.760]  well uh... they have the high low and the he lowing different uh... systems where special
[27:37.760 --> 27:44.360]  forces are trained to kill everybody on board an aircraft depressurized blow the door remote
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.480]  control the aircraft into a designated target and jump out and uh... fly down to the ground
[27:49.480 --> 27:57.040]  basically with their parachutes this is the type of uh... hit that went on people are
[27:57.040 --> 28:01.880]  like a lot of they have bullet wounds and why are they been shot up and so uh... something
[28:01.880 --> 28:06.440]  similar could have been done on board this aircraft that's just one of the ways that
[28:06.440 --> 28:11.000]  they could have killed the polish senior leadership and it could have been inside job from their
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.840]  own government or it could have been pilot air and a malfunction and so he missed the
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.200]  airfield four times in the fog and on the fourth time came in and crashed and everybody
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.000]  was killed but i'm basically done talking about that now at least for now we'll get
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.480]  tarply on to pop in for thirty minutes or so on the next few days uh... to to discuss
[28:29.480 --> 28:31.480]  that
[28:31.480 --> 28:37.080]  if you hear any construction noise during the show uh... i've told them not to be held
[28:37.080 --> 28:44.760]  up by the fact that we're about sixty seventy yards away from where they're building uh...
[28:44.760 --> 28:50.240]  but it is part of the same complex and you can actually hear them uh... with huge drills
[28:50.240 --> 28:57.000]  putting metal pylons in for part of the construction so i sound distracted uh... i don't know if
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  you can hear it but uh... we've been having this problem the last few weeks the city and
[29:01.000 --> 29:08.240]  zoning and other issues and permits held us up for almost six months but studio is now
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.240]  rapidly being built uh... and should be done in the next month and a half or so so we're
[29:13.240 --> 29:21.000]  very very excited about that when we come back of the strange case of the naked body

[34:38.600 --> 34:46.960]  these tyranny filled individuals and where they're going okay so about a month ago we
[34:46.960 --> 34:53.400]  launched the naked body scanner protest officially and ten thousand dollars for the best public
[34:53.400 --> 34:59.600]  protest and you gotta shoot video of that against the naked body scanners or you could
[34:59.600 --> 35:10.000]  produce your own theatrical piece illustrating it or your own cartoon your own animated i
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.760]  mean the sky was the limit you could do whatever you wanted and there was a second prize for
[35:14.760 --> 35:20.680]  three thousand for the best poster contest against naked body scanners and then of course
[35:20.680 --> 35:25.960]  you had to post those in public areas that were legal and lawful and videotape that and
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.720]  then post it to the web that way the people see the posters you put up locally local news
[35:30.720 --> 35:35.360]  covers it we're now getting new stations calling us from shreveport louisiana and other cities
[35:35.360 --> 35:39.880]  where these are popping up all over the place then the video you post to the web people
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.640]  get the message than other people get the idea and see how powerful it is to leaflet
[35:44.640 --> 35:49.720]  and pamphlet their area on whatever political issue we're educating the public how to take
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.880]  effective action at a gorilla information warfare level and then the third prize is two thousand
[35:55.880 --> 36:04.880]  dollars for the best video taking my past predictions and showing how it has come true
[36:04.880 --> 36:08.560]  because I don't have the staff the money the time to mark down all the predictions we've
[36:08.560 --> 36:15.320]  made how accurate they've been that's an important to then show the uninitiated those that weren't
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.480]  listening to the show a year ago or five years ago who weren't listening and don't know that
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.680]  I predicted much of what's now happening this is a way to show them that we know what we're
[36:25.680 --> 36:30.400]  talking about and it is a great way to inform people I can't tell you how many folks told
[36:30.400 --> 36:37.360]  me they woke up because they were listening to my radio show in July and August leading
[36:37.360 --> 36:45.000]  up to nine eleven eight years ago and I can't tell you how many people were watching my
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.200]  access TV show that it reared several times where I predicted they would blow up the World
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.320]  Trade Center and blame it on their CIA asset was some have been laden that woke a lot of
[36:54.320 --> 37:01.000]  people up seeing me make that prediction and then seeing it actually happen now we've had
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.400]  I don't know three other contests in the past they have all been incredibly wildly unbelievably
[37:08.400 --> 37:15.000]  successful the most successful was the Obama poster contest we put out the posters told
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.520]  people they should post them just as a political idea to point out that Obama is a tyrant not
[37:21.520 --> 37:29.640]  a saint a jokerized image of Obama same thing was done with Bush and we supported that and
[37:29.640 --> 37:34.600]  the media started saying this is racist this is evil this is bad trying to demonize free
[37:34.600 --> 37:38.440]  speech you can't be against government run health care you can't be against banker bailouts
[37:38.440 --> 37:42.800]  you can't be against open borders you can't be against anti-second amendment legislation
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.960]  your racist trying to play the race card to create racial divisions and to divide the
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.800]  country against ourselves while the elite rule over us divide and conquer balkanization
[37:52.800 --> 38:06.000]  the great game and so we had the contest was it $5,000 for the best video of people posting
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.520]  signs it was on hundreds of TV stations hundreds of newspapers in the US in Japan in England
[38:12.520 --> 38:20.680]  in Mexico in Brazil I mean it was just all over a huge gigantic devastating success in
[38:20.680 --> 38:26.360]  full wars dot com got posted everywhere images of Obama as the joker and the media went from
[38:26.360 --> 38:31.360]  saying we're gonna arrest you if you do this and is this terrorism to just shutting up
[38:31.360 --> 38:34.920]  about it and saying okay it's your right to free speech because when they tried to oppress
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.200]  people and actually arrested a few people who were posting these in Florida and other
[38:39.200 --> 38:46.000]  areas it blew up in their face and everybody started going out and posting more of the
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.440]  signs and they got smart and backed off the establishment got smart and backed off because
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.400]  they knew this was turning into something mega huge not just huge so we've had our I
[38:57.400 --> 39:06.600]  guess fourth contest the last few years $15,000 in prizes you never had any type of contest
[39:06.600 --> 39:17.040]  with this much money on the line and we literally probably got 15 entries and then I was talking
[39:17.040 --> 39:22.160]  to Watson last week and he said Alex I've got people sending me contest videos because
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.920]  as the videos come in we post them as the flyers come in we post them to create a snowball
[39:27.920 --> 39:31.800]  domino effect where other people see it and decide to join the contest and we had nothing
[39:31.800 --> 39:37.760]  to promote well an example of how computers are great but computers can also give you
[39:37.760 --> 39:46.200]  a blind spot we have spam software on our email system so if it sees the same term over
[39:46.200 --> 39:50.400]  and over and over and over and over again it begins to block it or if it has a term
[39:50.400 --> 39:58.340]  like naked in it it's software we bought and it's similar software that blocks info wars
[39:58.340 --> 40:02.520]  dot com and prison planet dot com there's all these software packages they sell governments
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.040]  they sell corporations they now want to install internet wide in the US England's now moving
[40:07.040 --> 40:13.440]  to do it Italy's doing it Australia's moving to do it this shows you how easy they can
[40:13.440 --> 40:18.680]  curtail the web I mean on the average software they've got thousands of terms now they're
[40:18.680 --> 40:24.320]  trying to add hundreds of thousands of terms because people put naked body scanner protest
[40:24.320 --> 40:31.560]  video contest entry in their hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of the contest videos
[40:31.560 --> 40:37.520]  went into the junk folder went into the trash folder and last night I was sitting here it
[40:37.520 --> 40:43.680]  was the day after the contest closed April 10th was April 11th and I'm saying something
[40:43.680 --> 40:50.560]  is wrong there's no way every one of our other contest has been a giant success and we're
[40:50.560 --> 40:55.240]  not getting any entries normally most the entries come in the last three or four days
[40:55.240 --> 40:59.120]  we went and looked in the junk folder that we didn't have access to it was deeper in
[40:59.120 --> 41:07.800]  the system and there were hundreds and hundreds of videos incredible videos amazing videos
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.320]  off the chart powerful protest demonstrations groups of actors getting together building
[41:14.320 --> 41:24.040]  whole airport sets I salute you I commend you I thank you now here's the problem if
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.720]  I post and we've been going through these since last night we already have over a hundred
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.080]  and there's hundreds more to go through I've got a limited staff if we post say 3040 videos
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.320]  at a time no one's going to watch them they'll watch the first few and they'll get a few
[41:38.320 --> 41:43.880]  10,000 hits if I had time every day to just post one of these each one would get hundreds
[41:43.880 --> 41:49.200]  of thousands of views that's the whole point of the contest is to is to create a viral
[41:49.200 --> 42:00.480]  swell of viral but a good viral stream of anti-naked body scanner videos to overturn this system
[42:00.480 --> 42:07.040]  and to teach people how to be political activists so now I've got to all this week maybe into
[42:07.040 --> 42:13.560]  next week dole out the videos dole them out maybe 1015 a day and then it's up to you to
[42:13.560 --> 42:21.840]  go up to mfo wars.com prisonplanet.com grab the videos post them on your site get them
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.760]  out to everybody because people put a lot of work into this so that it has the main
[42:26.760 --> 42:32.280]  effect but thank God we discovered the problem so I apologize that that happened but that's
[42:32.280 --> 42:36.200]  just what you know goes on it happens when you're getting flooded with thousands of emails
[42:36.200 --> 42:46.440]  a day but you live you learn and so number one I had said that we had to have your entry
[42:46.440 --> 42:56.040]  by the end of April 10th or Saturday night had to be in and I had also said that I would
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.760]  then judge them in the next five days and announce the winner on Thursday I will not
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.920]  announce the winner this Thursday I will announce it next Thursday a because I need
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.520]  to dole these videos out so they all get seen by people again if I post 100 something
[43:11.520 --> 43:18.040]  at one time no one's going to watch but the top few it's like giving people 20 books
[43:18.040 --> 43:22.880]  to read in one day you can't do it and I mean and it's a chore just to watch them and they're
[43:22.880 --> 43:28.240]  so good there's so many of them so we're going to dole these out this week and through the
[43:28.240 --> 43:35.840]  first few days of next week every day you'll see videos and posters and the incredible
[43:35.840 --> 43:41.840]  work of our listeners posted in this contest and that'll also give me more time to try
[43:41.840 --> 43:45.960]  to watch them all I spent hours last night when I got home trying to watch them I mean
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.560]  there are just so many and they're so good and so we will announce the winner not this
[43:50.560 --> 43:55.440]  Thursday but next Thursday of the three contests because we have to go through hundreds of
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.440]  videos we would have had the last few weeks as they came in to watch them but they were
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.360]  going into a computer black hole now we found them in the black hole we found the pot of
[44:04.360 --> 44:11.480]  gold in the info war but now we need to not just go to the first bar we see with the pot
[44:11.480 --> 44:18.760]  of gold and just you know pour this down the gullets of the first first you know people
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.320]  we see we've got to make sure we don't squander this political gold we've got to make sure
[44:23.320 --> 44:29.040]  it's deployed properly out there to the people so I had been complaining the last few weeks
[44:29.040 --> 44:35.400]  about I don't know why we're not getting any entries I don't know why this is such a disaster
[44:35.400 --> 44:42.120]  I don't know why the few entries we've gotten are not as good as what we've seen in the
[44:42.120 --> 44:46.960]  past some are pretty good well now let me tell you this is a bigger success anything
[44:46.960 --> 44:54.880]  we've ever done as far as the content goes as far as the material goes but it is the
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.560]  biggest failure we've ever had via deployment but we're going to fix that now and you're
[45:00.560 --> 45:05.760]  going to help us fix that because Kurt Nemo in the next hour is going to post 10 or 15
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.000]  entries this doesn't mean these are the best entries or the worst entries it just is the
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.280]  first 15 out of the 100 pluses that we've already plowed through since last night we've
[45:15.280 --> 45:22.560]  got hundreds more to plow through and so every day on infowars.com and prismplanet.com right
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.880]  through the weekend right through Tuesday I've got to cut it off then and then I'll
[45:27.880 --> 45:32.440]  pick the 10 I think are the best and repost those for extra attention and I will announce
[45:32.440 --> 45:41.240]  the winners not this Thursday but next Thursday for all three of the amazing contest entries
[45:41.240 --> 45:51.320]  okay I just spent about eight minutes on that but it's very very very important so I never
[45:51.320 --> 45:55.200]  doubted you I mean it was a real mystery I'm like why have the other contest been such
[45:55.200 --> 46:05.640]  raging successes why is this such a dud it's not a dud not a dud and I apologize but it's
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.240]  really nobody's fault it's just you live you learn and I commend everyone and I just want
[46:10.240 --> 46:16.040]  to say incredible incredible incredible job there's a whole bunch of them that are people
[46:16.040 --> 46:22.800]  with hidden cameras in the airports showing police abuse and harassment of citizens there's
[46:22.800 --> 46:28.920]  videos where they set up naked body scanners on the side of the road mock naked body scanners
[46:28.920 --> 46:34.360]  and illustrate this to the public that they're coming to the streets near you it's just unbelievable
[46:34.360 --> 46:40.600]  I mean I can't believe the quality of these it just so many good ones so many great ones

[49:22.120 --> 49:30.240]  low low credit and now they're jacking the credit cards up in many cases above 30% they're
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.040]  jacking up all the other interest rates but the bankers still get 0% money and then when
[49:36.040 --> 49:41.880]  the government borrows it from the private banks out of nothing the government then
[49:41.880 --> 49:47.240]  raises taxes on you which further destroys the economy and makes more people go bankrupt
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.600]  and go on welfare which further bankrupts the government and as the states go bankrupt

[55:16.640 --> 55:24.400]  countries over and over again this is a tried and trusted system of economic slash military
[55:24.400 --> 55:39.840]  domination but it is now time for individuals out there to choose sides you're a cop you're
[55:39.840 --> 55:44.920]  in the military you're a bureaucrat you're a business owner you're a school teacher it's
[55:44.920 --> 55:50.400]  time to get smart it's time to face the facts get out of denial world governments out in
[55:50.400 --> 55:59.560]  the open it's all admitted tyranny's being set up it's scientific it's incremental and
[55:59.560 --> 56:05.560]  whether and I say this a lot but I want to really sink in whether you see yourself with
[56:05.560 --> 56:15.880]  the new world order or not in 99.99% of the time you are targeted by the globalist as
[56:15.880 --> 56:21.360]  well you are compartmentalized you are brainwashed you're downloaded through the media and the
[56:21.360 --> 56:33.200]  culture a false paradigm and then you play out your role in that niche the new world
[56:33.200 --> 56:40.280]  order is not good for you and this is an incredible adventure we're living in right
[56:40.280 --> 56:47.080]  now when the destiny of humanity is truly being charted and the choice is being made
[56:47.080 --> 56:53.360]  by all of us that's a lot more important than basketball or Las Vegas or partying or acting
[56:53.360 --> 57:01.720]  cool and you know people ask me constantly they say what's the biggest solution what's
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.680]  the biggest solution we talk about states rights and we talk about sovereignty and we
[57:05.680 --> 57:12.400]  talk about suing corrupt government officials but the biggest issue is education people
[57:12.400 --> 57:17.040]  are now ready to be awakened people now know something's wrong they're ready to hear the

[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.920]  about an article saying that bilgerberg group didn't exist and then i was out in chantilly
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:30.400]  in 2008 in virginia having a full schizophrenic breakdown that there were no men with sunglasses
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:37.600]  no black sedans no hotel i was just completely insane kind of like the news announces world
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.760]  government on one program and the next program comes on and says kooks believe in it doesn't
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.520]  exist they say we're cut taking over with world government but if you don't like it
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:54.480]  it doesn't exist and you're evil let's go ahead and go to william in new york william
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:02.880]  here on the air wilson go ahead yeah good afternoon alex is wilson i'd only get the
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.640]  chance to call but i'm glad i'm the first call i'm very special i feel special i just
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.720]  want to start off by saying i'm so glad by it throughout time you know at first i always
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.920]  trusted in what you said and i always believe what you say you know i remember on 9 11 i
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.320]  seen what you had to say about it and some people say no it's wrong and i had a feeling
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.320]  in my heart it was right and then with global warming you're saying this wrong and people
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.520]  will say how could you see global warming is fake are you crazy and then like throughout
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:36.000]  time just acknowledging the facts everything just brought me to know that everything was
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.840]  true and my wife i always try to make her study you know the more important things but
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:49.000]  then she gets sidetracked by this 2012 2012 what do you personally think about the end
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  of the world in 2012 my next film after i put out the next fall the republic that's
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.120]  in production right now the next film i'm going to make is going to be on the 2012
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:14.040]  hoax and so it is a hoax but within the hoax the system is planning to stage all sorts
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:20.560]  of calamities and crises and the globalist have said for more than 50 years that 2012
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.960]  is a very important number to them because they're obsessed with numerology and with
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.400]  astrology and so it's a very important date for a cultist globally but if you look at
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.600]  the Mayan calendar they just believe that's the end of an age and a new hearth is lit
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.840]  and you know the sun is the hearth and so that a new age is beginning it doesn't mean
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.960]  the end of the world so that's a lie as well even if you believe that what the Mayans are
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.680]  saying is true and then it has some validity when you actually look at what they said it
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.600]  isn't what the media is saying and i've read the translations i've been down to southern
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.560]  mexico and the yucatan peninsula and other areas many times i've talked to the Mayan
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:10.240]  tour guides who are Mayan and who have archaeology degrees and anthropology degrees and they
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:19.560]  say it's poppycock so it's all a globalist hollywood manufactured tribe okay okay and
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.120]  i was going to say i know you're going to have an upcoming interview with ron paul for
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.840]  an hour i was going to say if you could ask him this question for me if he would have
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.240]  won the presidential election in 2008 who would he have chose that his secretary of
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:39.040]  chaser and and and so forth like that's a great question so when ron paul's back on

[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:28.920]  I wanted to burn in I wanted to sink in for everybody then we've got front row seats to
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:35.760]  the open takeover by a criminal superclass of the planet I mean I think about all their
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.160]  environmental laws and how this week Obama has announced they're going to implement
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:48.880]  unilateral taxes and reductions on greenhouse emissions in all sorts of industries and factories
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.680]  and coal fired power plants no law they're just doing it and how this is going to run
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.600]  more industry more jobs out of the country raise the prices of energy raise the prices
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.720]  of products and how Mexico and India and China and scores of other nations have to make zero
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:13.840]  cuts but we do and pay taxes to these dirty bankers and they're only getting started they
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.040]  decide what type of house you can have they decide what type of home inspection you get
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.440]  you know they admit all over the country billions of dollars in federal funds to the cities
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:31.880]  and counties to where oh we'll give you a $3,000 rebate if you get a new washer and dryer
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:38.640]  but we've got to do a home inspection first and then you read and they admit that this
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.160]  is to condition you for the mandatory home inspections it's just setting the precedent
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.920]  many cities and states already have it it's all dog training it's all incremental bringing
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.680]  you into bondage bankrupting everything by design to drive you into poverty and that
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:02.400]  makes me so angry at these people I want to get more into the economy I want to get more
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:10.520]  into another name on President Obama's Supreme Court shortlist oh yes Homeland Security Secretary
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:18.240]  Janet Napolitano total thug she's for warrantless wiretapping secret arrest torture naked body

[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:47.680]  announce plans to stage tea party violence we're also going to get into teen suicide
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:53.640]  put spotlight on high-tech bullying another way they want to censor the internet and how
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:11:02.040]  that ties into Comcast went over FCC reignite net neutrality debate and England openly passes
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:09.320]  a law with some of the most your county internet rules on the planet that is coming up but right

[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.440]  now are you going to have someone on later about the wiki week the recent wiki week
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:04.120]  video yes okay well I gotta tell you you know I I had to watch I didn't have to the only
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:14.320]  way I could actually see one of the few places I could see it on a network if you will program
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.120]  was democracy now CNN had it on but they blocked out with the black box they didn't want you
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:27.200]  know people to see the actual footage of it I I I got admit I'm a little bit nervous
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.880]  I apologize there's so many things there have you heard of a video called Operation Hollywood
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:42.760]  by David L. Robb yes I believe I've watched it years ago years ago you know I guess that's
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  an old news log I don't know I kind of blew this call sorry no you didn't you brought
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.720]  up some important issues and for those that don't know I was bringing up the death of
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.720]  president Kaczynski the Polish president flying into Russia with a large percentage of the
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.440]  leadership of the government he had announced that he wasn't going to go along with the
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.440]  EU takeover of his country and his plane crashes and here's the New York Times Kaczynski often
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:14.200]  a source of tension within EU but the Russians didn't like him either very very suspicious
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.720]  but I was going over Ron Brown the fact that the Air Force head pathologist said that many
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:28.480]  of the bodies had bullet holes including Ron Brown who was the secretary of commerce involved
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.880]  in all this corruption he said if I go down everybody is going down and they shot everybody
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.400]  up in the plane and then crashed it and that's admitted but there was no further investigation
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.480]  and when they demonized the colonel he released the autopsy material so they shot everybody
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:52.400]  up special forces blew the door and then parachute it out and they trained to do that high altitude
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.880]  jumps but I know very important point you brought up John good to hear from you Ryan
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:05.560]  in Arizona Ryan you're on the air yes hello yes welcome how are you doing out I'm all
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.640]  right all right I'm glad you took my call today I'm a huge fan I've ordered almost all
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:17.440]  your videos and thank you for the support God bless you what's on your mind well you
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.680]  know I was reading the news about this the Polish plane crash and I think there's just
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.680]  too many people of high-level importance on one plane that seemed to crash and you know
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:33.520]  I know that things do happen by accident but you know I'd like to look into this a little
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:40.880]  more well if you look at many of these big airliner crashes in every case in the big
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.080]  prominent cases the entire leadership of the Egyptian military was on board you know the
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.800]  entire leadership of this government that government and it's just constantly happening
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:57.280]  constantly it was the same thing with TWA flight 800 it was full of a bunch of spies
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.600]  and then oh a navy cruiser accidentally shot a missile into it they tried to cover that
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:08.480]  up give me a break they love to blow people out of the sky because it's so easy to then
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.120]  cover it up through the TSA investigation yes and you know I feel sorry for the people
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.320]  of Poland you know I understand their leader that you know Prime Minister that passed away
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.800]  was doing things that were in their country's best interest and that's I guess the people
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.560]  that New World Order likes to target is people who stand up for their you know nation and
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.480]  their people well yeah people that actually have power I mean if you've Poland pulled
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:41.520]  out of the Euro it would be over for the Euro and the bankers are like no no we run you
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.560]  we own you and their economy is just shutting down and the bankers love it because now they
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.920]  get to social engineer see having the banking monopoly over the issue and some currency
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.280]  and credit is only the beginning of the power then you get into the ideology the fervent
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.720]  religious belief in extermination and mass murder and death and calling the population
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.280]  then it becomes crystal clear being slaves to the bankers is only the beginning thank
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.480]  you Ryan you can get back now to the soccer game sound like kids happily playing in the
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.200]  background let's talk to Tony and Niagara Falls Tony you're on the year hi Alex Tony
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:21.120]  how are you good just a couple things first thing is I took your advice and started my
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.600]  own site called Western New York Truthers dot org and it's that we already got a thousand
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.880]  users and we're going to be marching on tax free day downtown in Buffalo New York also
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.480]  another thing I like to tell you about is I know it's old news but the vandalism for
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:44.960]  the representative representative flotters office in Niagara Falls here is on main street
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:52.040]  the busiest street in Niagara Falls and there's a donut shop across the street that literally
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:57.920]  there's police at all the time so as well as me as other residents in town are very
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:04.040]  skeptical about the vandalism because there would not be any type of vandalism without
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:10.120]  someone seeing it but yet no one has seen anything well it could have been done at night
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.960]  I don't know the specifics of that case though I read about it look the Democrats have been
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:21.880]  caught over and over again attacking their own offices and NAACP affiliated groups have
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.920]  been caught doing it over and over again and most of this is staged I mean we have the
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.400]  video of the supposed inwards spitting incident and none of it's real it was all fake and
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.340]  so I appreciate your call Tony there's no doubt most of this is fake and that's coming
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:42.440]  up in the next hour now we have the big anarchist groups out in the open saying they're going
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:49.720]  to come out and do bad things posing as tea party people see false flagging is elementary
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:55.640]  it's been done for thousands and thousands of years I mean you all know about employees
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.240]  that have done something bad and blamed it on somebody else or you know about bosses
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.080]  that have done it you know about people burning down their own house to get the insurance

[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.280]  something I found online you was talking yesterday about the problem with the vaccines and you
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.040]  woke me up a lot about a little over a year ago so I started researching all this and
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.200]  I run across a material safety data sheet and I'm a truck driver hazardous material
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:42.800]  has to have a material safety data sheet on thimerosol it says use of substance pharmaceutical
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:50.720]  production and analysis hazardous identification very toxic by inhalation contact and skin
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:58.320]  is swallowed and it tells it's not supposed to be mixed with a strong oxidizing agents
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:04.680]  strong acid strong bases aluminum reducing agents and it says danger of accumulative
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.880]  effects it's other notes or mercury tell you what stay there stay there because we should

[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:13.760]  federal agents we are armed thank god the human body is so strong that despite the fact
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.560]  a pump is full of the cancer viruses and the mercury it's only affecting one in 68 children
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:27.160]  it was one in 20 plus thousand a few decades ago that got autism and it is the cumulative
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:34.560]  effect of the toxins of the chemicals and then it turns out in 2009 early 2010 record
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.560]  low numbers of seasonal flu and of course h1n1 less than 10% of the public supposedly
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.080]  contracted it and most of them didn't even get sick but in five different major government
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:52.480]  studies they have found conclusively a 60 plus percent increase in people getting h1n1
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.360]  and getting sick from it if they had already taken the seasonal flu shot and in many of
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.640]  the seasonal flu shots I noticed that h1n1 was one of the viruses they put a bunch of
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:08.720]  different viruses flu viruses RNA in there but look I remember five six years ago the
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.360]  media would say there is no mercury in shots and it was a bait and switch federal regulators
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:19.680]  said okay every vaccine company needs to make small lots available that do not have the
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.640]  marisol the mercury additive and so then the media would say there is no mercury it's
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:30.360]  a conspiracy theory then people would read the inserts and so that hoax got exploded
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.760]  they'd say of course it's in there and then people would actually read the real insert
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.320]  from the seasonal flu and h1n1 and it said it can cause Guillain-Barre other neurological
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.800]  disorders does have the marisol can sterilize you can reduce fertility can cause other auto
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:52.000]  immune disorders can cause death and people are like what and so now they had an article
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.320]  over the weekend in the AP CDC says people are getting apathetic about viruses and won't
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.120]  take their shots and there's all these crazy people that don't cause the government won't
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]  take it.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.160]  I've had three children and I put my money where my mouth is none of them have had one
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:18.600]  single injection not one single injection despite all the fear mongering your child
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.800]  can get hepatitis your child can get whooping cough your child can and then Dr. Dina Dell
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.400]  and others get up on TV and radio and say well let me tell you we need to arrest the
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.200]  people that don't vaccinate their kids because then they endanger everybody else wait a minute
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:39.000]  if you've already had the vaccine if you've already had the vaccine and you're supposedly
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.880]  protected why can't I be stupid if I want not take it this is part of the medical tyranny
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.720]  but yes if you read the hazardous material sheet on the marisol it's in the vaccines
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:56.480]  and if the marisol is nothing compared to nothing compared to the cancer viruses which
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.120]  they found in the new vaccines this year let's go ahead and go back to Brian Brian finisher
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.680]  point though about the hazardous material sheet well I missed one thing on the substances
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.680]  to be avoided it talks about not mixing it with certain things and one of the things
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:18.640]  that names is aluminum when you go to the CDC and get the ingredients six out of ten
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:26.440]  of the products that came that contain thimerosol contain some form of aluminum so they say
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:32.800]  not to mix it but yet they do it anyway so you know they're doing things on purpose
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.520]  and Brian we're supposed to just shut up and not warn anybody we're weirdos Brian because
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.800]  we get upset about kids being brain damaged by design we should only get upset about our
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.840]  football team losing Brian well that's good thing I don't watch most sports no more and
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:59.360]  I'll tell you one more thing if you want to know about the industrialization of America
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:05.840]  ask a truck driver after deregulation in the eighties and as of today we've had hundreds
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.600]  of trucking counties thousands of trucking counties go out of business in the last two
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.840]  years I mean the freight is going away and only them because the commerce is going away
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.640]  and only the megacorporations can pay all the fines and fees and regulations that is
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:26.080]  correct but listen I interrupted you go back to the hazardous materials sheet on thimerosol
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.440]  mercury because you were getting into that part about the cumulative effect and that's
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:39.040]  what's key okay it says other notes now it says above other notes it says danger of cumulative
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:47.400]  effects and then the other note says mercury compounds have a cytotoxic and protoplasmotoxic
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:57.680]  effects intoxication symptoms it says acute contact with eyes accused causes several lesions
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:07.720]  swallowing an inhalation of dust damages mucus membranes and it just goes through a long
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:14.480]  paragraph of all the problems it has long-term exposure leads to disorders damage of the
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:22.040]  nervous system which is autism since it is cumulative and magically our kids have mercury
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.600]  poisoning symptoms they're being injected with it and the media just says shut up conspiracy
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.200]  cooks and the cops say shut up cooks I'm going to give my child extra shots sure Jimmy's
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:40.640]  12 and can't talk but I love the government the government wouldn't hurt me Billy's 14
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:47.640]  he's got cancer but that's all right I love the government how dare you Brian know how
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:56.120]  to read you need more mercury shots we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:04.840]  and the GCN radio network they help to create a new world order we are part of a new world

[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.680]  tool for addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their control
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:26.240]  the united nations would take over America the trilateral commission would control the

[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:26.360]  the economy by design how this unfolding situation will show itself unless we stand
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:34.000]  up and say no the planned setup of the tea parties the stage terror events that we know
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.120]  are in the works to be blamed on the American people it is all coming up plus every few
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:47.560]  days I see mainstream news articles like this this is from popular science Intel wants brain
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:54.320]  plants in its customers heads by 2020 now I remember back in 2000 reading Pentagon reports
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:00.320]  that were declassified how they said they would incrementally roll out digital devices
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:09.080]  until the point by 2020 now only 10 years away that you won't be able to get a job unless
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:16.040]  you have implantable microchips in you and they say look we'll pitch it as if it's societally
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:23.840]  cool and for security and to have government jobs and we'll just say well if you don't
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.040]  want the microchip in your brain it's a very quick easy surgery you don't have to have
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:33.680]  a job here and we'll pitch it as if it gives sight to the blind because it has all these
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:40.320]  good dual uses but all of it is being engineered to control society this is popular science
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:56.280]  by the way oh boy truth is so much stranger than fiction before I go to John John Tom
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:07.800]  Jim and others let me give you the toll free number 1-800-259-9231 I get very angry by
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:14.640]  what I see from the government it's arrogance it's hatred of the public it's abuse of the
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.080]  public the way the culture has changed in government that the public's a bunch of scum
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:27.280]  to be fed on you know we don't even attempt to demonize police on this radio show if
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:33.680]  we wanted to there's just endless fodder but this morning I happened to get into some
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.360]  YouTube channels with literally hundreds of videos from local news of police beating
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.800]  people up in wheelchairs for no reason they'll say get up the guy says I have no legs the
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:54.320]  cops go tasering didn't follow the order I'd only seen a few of those but I decided to
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.760]  search engine the term police attack man and wheelchair or police taser man and wheelchair
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:08.200]  and there were dozens and dozens of them I couldn't even watch him I couldn't watch these people
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.040]  crying and saying it broke my bones when they threw me on the concrete and the cops on
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:22.040]  video going get up I told you get up and goes I don't have no legs don't you see and to
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:28.040]  watch him attacking and then to see the police departments defending it and then remember
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.280]  that guy that mentally deficient Polish immigrant was flying here where his mother lives in
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:39.000]  Canada and they kept him for more than 18 hours in a confinement area and he couldn't
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.560]  speak English or French and he didn't know why they were sort of waving his arms and
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.520]  just argued and so they tasered him jumped on him broke his neck killed him and the royal
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:56.320]  amount of police said that's okay good job then a few days later the same cop that jumped
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:03.000]  on his neck then the police thought the public was so dumb they said well we didn't break
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.040]  his neck we didn't kill him his neck just got broken somehow that cop was drunk driving
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.400]  and killed somebody on a motorcycle and has now been finally charged but I mean I just
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.880]  happened to see that video and then right next to the other video and it showed the
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:19.800]  video of the cops jumping on this guy's head and they were just enjoying it I was watching
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:25.680]  other videos of them beating up some military guy just because he asked questions and they
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.160]  pull out a baton and start beating him in the legs and laughing and other cops are joking
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:36.680]  while they're doing it and then they charged the military guy and I'm telling you they've
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:44.480]  hired a bunch of sadistic psychopathic bullies who think it's manly to just beat people up
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.600]  and we've turned into Soviet Russia does that mean all the police are like this absolutely
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:57.480]  not good cops are aware of what's going on but you know there's some good places to eat
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:05.800]  and around 6th street but I won't go down there I've told the story a few years ago
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:11.280]  they were having some movie events here in town and I got invited by some Hollywood producers
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.240]  oh just go have a few drinks with us over here on 6th street at some bars so we go in
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:22.080]  this mainline bar and it's not even a rough bar it's it's it's there's this big giant
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:31.440]  steroid head bouncer and he's saying ID ID ID and so I show him my ID and I didn't get
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.200]  my dirty look or anything and he says you think you're tough boy you think you're ready
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.000]  for something you want something right now he may know who I was and I just looked at
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.560]  the guy I didn't say anything and then him and this other steroid had laughed at me after
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:49.960]  I went in and the whole thing is as a man I don't have those type of homicidal intentions
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.680]  towards somebody unless they're threatening my life I mean I'm not out here just running
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:59.760]  around looking for somebody to fight but I'm telling you then we walked out of the bar
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:05.720]  an hour later and I saw cops with shaved heads and black gloves and huge arms and tattoos
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:12.000]  my sand tattoos are bad I'm saying that you know they were thuggish looking strutting around
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  going up to good looking girls demanding their IDs on the street flirting with them giving
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.680]  crazy dirty looks at people I mean you know what craze thugs look like and I was like
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.800]  I'm never coming down here again and I've been down there a few times when radio stations
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.760]  want to interview me downtown or they're having some event or I'm I have a film screening
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:34.400]  but I don't go down there to eat anymore because I guess they have special units of
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:42.800]  like steroid cops down there and
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.920]  and I've been to quite a few third world countries and I've seen the cops act a little
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:53.840]  bit like that you know thuggish and on power trips and a craze look in their eyes I mean
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.760]  I've been in Honduras and it's the only place I've seen cops act like American cops I mean
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:05.160]  Honduras is a cesspit of evil and third world wickedness and we are for all intents and
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:11.800]  purposes the greatest nation in history the most wealthy nation history because we had
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:18.440]  a monocle of liberty more than anybody else sinking into a cesspit and then I think about
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:24.200]  these cops I probably watched more than 20 videos this morning and didn't even really
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.800]  get ready for the show because of it because I usually spend two or three hours getting
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:30.280]  ready and I spent like an hour or the three hours just watching videos I was mesmerized
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:36.560]  by it and I saw a video of
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.960]  cops in a car chase and they make the guy flip his car and he flies out the window and
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.000]  he clearly has broken all his bones as a rag doll and the cops run up and start piling
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.720]  on him beating him hitting him in the head and
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.560]  it's what they want to do I mean this is what they enjoy well let me tell you something
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:05.040]  that same killer instinct you've got the real power are little hundred and twenty five hundred
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:11.120]  and thirty pound egghead nerds who have hundred and fifty hundred and sixty hundred and seventy
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:18.560]  hundred and eighty IQs and they work in eugenics societies and they run the world government
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:25.040]  and they hate everyone and they're elitist and they are putting cancer viruses in your
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:31.840]  shots poison in your water mercury in your vaccines they designed gmo food to attack
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:40.680]  your organs and to attack your sexual organs and so you drive around having a crazed hatred
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:47.000]  of the public and you're on a seething power trip your bosses you're like a little dragon
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.040]  a little seven foot tall dragon who thinks he's tough and he's sitting there snarling
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.600]  and biting and snapping and you know hurting basically sheep and then that little dragon
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.120]  who thinks he's the biggest thing in the world looks over his shoulder and there's a thousand
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:09.120]  foot dragon standing behind him and you know what that dragon likes to eat likes to eat
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:15.240]  little dragons and it reaches down and it grabs you and drops you right into its mouth
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:24.000]  and so you think you're getting away with it the swaggering little gang culture and
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:31.480]  the squeezing the public the setting the public up doing all the things you think it's cute
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:47.400]  I don't know why they like to attack people in wheelchairs I don't know why I know somebody
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:54.520]  in Austin they attacked in a wheelchair they told him get up and walk and the guy said
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:02.760]  I'm paralyzed from the chest down and so they beat him up I don't have to watch YouTube
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.640]  videos I know somebody they beat up and you know what that the cop that beat that guy
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.520]  up has been made a commander they're like my god you beat up people in wheelchairs you're
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:18.840]  more vicious than anyone we've ever seen you're gonna be police chief probably because that's
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:24.680]  the spirit they want now there are some good departments there are some good sheriffs out
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:35.320]  there but the police have been told you can do whatever you want we're gonna back you
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:43.480]  up go hog wild in the public and how can police at 800 plus cities engage in discrimination
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:52.320]  every day how can they knowingly let illegal aliens go for drunk driving for not having
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:57.160]  driver's license for not paying their tickets for all sorts of other crimes and admit this
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:06.800]  on the news and then just squeeze their fellow citizens just squeeze and squeeze and squeeze
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:11.240]  you've been dressed up in Darth Vader outfits and given high-tech weapons and trained on
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:18.600]  how to take on the American people and for riot control because your bosses are scientific
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:32.040]  criminals deploying a scientific tyranny upon humanity and separately the federal guard
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:36.360]  is being trained to go after you when you're done with us and I just you need to understand
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:41.520]  that you let that sink in real good that what you're hearing here is the truth and the fact
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:48.560]  that these departments almost always defend cops and I watched a video where they pull
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:54.720]  over this soccer mom she gets out she's polite she says officer look at my bag look at my
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.320]  car I don't have a cell phone I wasn't talking on a cell phone he says fine I'm gonna get
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:07.160]  you for speeding and she said I had it on cruise control and she says I want to see
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:20.960]  your squad car video not aggressively he just pulls a taser out and tasers are
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:31.720]  they enjoy it they enjoy getting some foreigner can't speak English at a airport white cops
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:40.160]  killing a white guy for some reason foreigners of any other color off limits but and in most
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:46.480]  these videos I see and they you know they kill him and then they laugh about he's dead
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:51.080]  I'm tough you know maybe the other cops will start sticking on the side of their squad
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.240]  cars how many citizens they've killed and like in World War two how many Japanese zeros
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:01.480]  are shot down and you have the sticker of how many kills you've had in fact we showed
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:11.920]  this when they had a raid what three years ago on those Mormons with the CPS on the
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:21.440]  news it showed the armored vehicle and it had how many kills it had on the side see
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.800]  you have a military culture for the Marines or the army and kill kill kill kill the enemy
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.640]  what makes the grass grow blood blood blood and then you bring those guys back and you
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:39.720]  make them cops and you militarize them and I've had judge advocate generals on I've had
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:46.120]  top former lawyers for the Pentagon on they agree they have forged the police into a paramilitary
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:52.360]  army against the people for the robbery of the people our land our treasure everything
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:58.200]  we are everything will ever be we know what oppression and despotism and tyranny and serfdom
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.720]  and feudalism is and this is it I mean I'm looking at info wars dot com right now all
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.760]  over the country they're having warrantless checkpoints now where they don't even have
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.680]  any pretense of probable cause just searching people's vehicles but they won't do it on
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:24.280]  the border it's sick all right I'm gonna get to the news after your calls but let's go
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.800]  ahead and go back to your calls here let's talk to John and Rhode Island John you're
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:33.480]  on the air thanks for holding how you doing Alex good buddy I'm not sure if you're familiar
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:39.000]  with a free leftist newspaper called the phoenix I know they do it in Providence and a few other
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.440]  major cities I'm not familiar with it but they had a cover piece this this week was
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.360]  tea for terrorism nice little demonization piece of the tea parties they put they have
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.200]  a nice big picture of the Atari people in Oklahoma City and a tea party rally and at
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.720]  the same time they couldn't help but take a shot at you and they said quote there's
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:06.520]  little difference between your site which is permanently linked from the drug report
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:10.880]  among others to and hardcore hate site I just want to let you know I mean I'm gonna talk
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.040]  about that in the next hour but but it is a Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL talking
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.920]  point issued last year that I am the number one enemy and that I am calling for killing
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:26.600]  police and IRS workers ahead of them staging a stack event in the Pentagon event they're
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.640]  gonna stage more those are clearly stage we've gone over all the evidence of that if people
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:37.760]  just tuned in in previous broadcasts and articles we've written and the national main communist
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.800]  newspaper did the same thing two weeks ago on me and the anarchist which aren't anarchist
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.600]  at all the I don't mean the general anarchist on the street I mean the mainline national
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:54.960]  anarchist groups are saying the same thing and CNN MSNBC Fox last week wrote two articles
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.480]  on me saying I'm calling for violence no evidence just I'm the enemy and they're singling
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.640]  me out to have a bunch of cops come kill me and they'll like a bunch of morons high-five
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:12.320]  each other and go give their kids some more shots and drink some more fluoride water and
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.360]  then them that's what they're doing they're just setting me up so and because they can't
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.400]  stand it that I know they're a bunch of terrorists but go ahead well what scares me too is you're
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:27.800]  talking about the police getting more and more brutal but the ADL does workshops with
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:34.080]  the police and the ADL the ADL runs most police departments for 30 years and they've been convicted
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:41.080]  in court for stealing the police intel files oh yeah that was in what 92 yeah San Francisco
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:51.240]  so I mean is this online too can I read it what's the T for terrorism go to the phoenix.com
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:59.480]  felt like the city slash talking politics the guy's name is David S. Bernstein well I mean
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:05.140]  probably works for the ADL so yeah so so it says there's little difference between me
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:12.440]  and the hate on the hate anyone they try to they try to tie you with Fox actually yeah
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:18.720]  well that's a yeah that's the direct talking point of George Soros and media matters oh

[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:38.760]  that for the media and the media knows who to meet and they show up set their camera
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:44.600]  up with their operative and stage it but that's why CNN and MSNBC and other channels have

[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.360]  up for the book is probably the best way of describing what i'm doing so well you're nice
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:44.400]  to spend time with us on your vacation there on the emerald aisle uh let's let's start off here
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:50.320]  there's a lot of subjects to cover with the wiki leaks video coming out last week uh with the video
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:57.920]  of the apaches and the and the kids in the van and the Reuters reporter right well what do you want
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.680]  you want me to talk about my assessment of it or do you want to talk about your assessment of it
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:09.200]  your assessment of it well first off um i i i think that uh the fact that there was a foyer in
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:14.160]  on that video by Reuters and they and the army had resisted releasing it that that was indicative
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.320]  i think of what was on the video i don't think people really want to see have it out there
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.560]  as i understand it now the video has been confirmed as authentic and that's the second problem with it
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.520]  i think that um it's not so much a problem that the the wiki leaks folks got it i think it's a fact
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:32.080]  that uh the army didn't stand up at the time this happened and said hey some mistakes were made here
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.560]  and let me be clear on why i'm saying that and i'm going to say this clearly as a as an academic
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:42.000]  not as an army reserve officer i'm saying this clearly as an academic uh there are from my background
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:48.080]  and experience from having been in combat my understanding of the rules of of warfare especially
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:54.080]  in this case the ROE the specific rules of engagement for this specific period uh which i
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:58.480]  understand are uh the essentially the one you can find on the internet the 2006 uh rules of
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:04.240]  engagement are still valid for for the most part and it's an instant to occur in 2007 based on
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:11.120]  those two factors plus uh the video what is seen on the video there are two clear rules of engagement
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:20.400]  violations that i can see uh first the first clear violation comes right after the attack begins
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.720]  and i'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the apache drivers here i mean alex there's
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.920]  there's a lot of things going on and i've been told by both former bush white house executives
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.680]  and full folks who were in iraq there are things happening before and after that video regarding
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.720]  combat operations essentially the fog of warfare the heat of battle whatever you want to call it
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.520]  the apache yeah later in the full video they do find some guys with guns going in a building
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.880]  and they fire a hellfire missile into it well and i i got to say i've not seen that part of the video
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.400]  but i'm just i'm just trying to make sure the people understand that there were things going
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.360]  on the floor and after this video so that there there was essentially an adrenaline rush going
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:03.840]  on and i think everybody who was there on the scene so you can't discount that i've been there i
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:09.120]  understand the fact that you get so focused on what's going on it's hard to to take a step back
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:14.320]  and and look hard at what's going on so giving the benefit of the doubt alex to the apache drivers
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:21.280]  they they misidentified the roiders journalists with their their cameras so that's the first
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.000]  mistake and i think that's forgivable by the fact that it was the heat of battle all right
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.680]  colonel shafer we got a break we're back in one minute with the next hour we'll be with us for

[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:59.200]  1-800-409-5633 waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:12.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:21.840]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:31.760]  well a lot of the footage is comparable to video games but this isn't a video game this is life
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:36.560]  and death and some said well hey these people were in a war zone these Reuters reporters this
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:44.160]  van full of kids you know that's their problem but the war zone is a urban built-up area
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:50.400]  in a major city in iraq and the pentagon block this being released and this is the type of
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:56.240]  stuff that happens in war in modern war so then you have to ask is this then a just war and before
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:59.680]  you go invade a country and knowing there's going to be this type of collateral damage
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:05.120]  you better make sure your nation is under threat we know they lied about wmds and everything else
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.160]  but lieutenant colonel anthony schaefer it was by tony schaefer is our guest very nice to be
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.600]  joining us you got cut off by the break this is a short segment as well continue with the points
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.000]  you were making all right well and i agree with your point on the whole justification the war
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.320]  thing alex you and i talked about a little bit i think uh frankly you and i've talked about this
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.400]  i'll say it for the for your benefit of your your listeners i think there's other ways we could have
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.080]  taken care of iraq without a full blown invasion without what that said though i think that's a
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:37.840]  topic from the day but back to the specific video um giving the benefit of the doubt to the apache
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:42.720]  drivers and the heat of the moment uh i think there could have been a justification regarding
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:49.680]  the misidentification of the the bags as either weapons or rpg's maybe i i'm i'm pretty dubious
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.680]  but let's give them the benefit of the doubt the mistakes i saw which were the clear violations
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.680]  alex were first off right after they got clearance to fire once they fired uh they should have
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.240]  essentially stopped them and paused and try to figure out what was going on and and one of the
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.880]  things one of the clear rules that were broken as it says once you once someone is down you quit
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:13.280]  shooting they didn't quit shooting they made sure these guys were dead now as an intelligence officer
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:17.680]  i said this on the air at stupid as an intelligence officer you want to capture people to find out
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.680]  what their affiliation is why they were doing what they were doing clearly this was not good
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.160]  common sense this is not something and frankly if i were the commander and i saw this in the battlefield
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.080]  i would have stopped the soldiers right there and either and done something because that's not the
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.240]  way you should conduct yourself now let's fast forward to the band and this is something i think
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:39.840]  has become a very big point of contention which i frankly uh think is a huge mistake both for the
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:46.400]  pr war and another clear violation of the rules of engagement when the reuters reporter was on the
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:50.640]  ground crawling away they were waiting they were trying to a game on hoping you'd pick up a weapon
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:55.760]  as i said before once persons down you you're you're obligated to go in there and render aid
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:01.680]  and try to capture them find out what's going on when the van shows up to give him aid and alex i've
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:06.480]  watched the video at least three times to make sure i understood it correctly first off if you
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:12.320]  study if you look at the video carefully you see people are in the van and there is no indication
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.760]  from the van at any point in time that it was a threat and this is this is where it clearly
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.080]  states that you have to have a clearly defined threat before you fire and use deadly force
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:27.600]  in this case it was very clear there was no threat from that van that van was there to
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:32.400]  render aid for that individual now there's reports out on this i'm not sure if you found copies
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.880]  that are not i've been able to read the reports i don't have a copy of them somebody called ar 156
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:43.440]  army regulation 156 uh investigative reports which are essentially uh a a a fact-finding
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  investigation directed by the commander to go through and assess what happened within the
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:52.320]  reports relating to this incident it talks about the fact that there were were vehicles out that
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:58.000]  day four-door sedans running weapons to insurgents well it's very clear from the video that that was
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.120]  on a four-door sedan it was fired on so apparently in the investigation they tried to say well we
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.920]  misidentified the van the van i don't think that's that's possible i think the van is very clearly
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:13.680]  identified as a van not as a four-door sedan so in my judgment my professional judgment both on
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:18.640]  on my experience in afghanistan having been in an urban warfare having to make shoot no shoot
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:24.160]  no shoot decisions and on the rules of engagement that the two clear violations were continuing
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.800]  to fire once the individuals were down and of course firing on the van when there was no hostile
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:33.680]  threat indicated as a matter of fact it was the it was the contrary it indicated for the most part
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:37.520]  that those people were trying to render aid to that individual which again as an intelligence
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:42.560]  officer they could have monitored that van they could have followed it and as as you see in the
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:48.400]  video u.s forces show up within minutes of the incident to secure the area the idea is to stay
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.880]  there long segment coming up let's get your conclusion on this and then talk about the
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:05:03.280]  nature of modern warfare period straight ahead hi this is alex jones did you know that the global
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:08.240]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:13.200]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:17.280]  seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even

[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:36.400]  be in in spain he'll be joining us coming up in the next hour for the next 25 minutes lieutenant
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:45.280]  colonel anthony schaefer is our guest and you can check out the website c4ads.org he's got a new
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:50.000]  book coming out very soon now that's going to have a lot of new revealing information about how
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.640]  the army was stopped from killing ben laden another senior leadership of al-qaeda in the
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:09:00.720]  months and weeks before 9 11 and of course when he tried to testify in closed session the congress
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:06.640]  about this he later got persecuted for but that was proven to be a fraud and so he's with us today look
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:14.160]  colonel they can say yeah that this is the rules of war people get killed it's a war zone but you
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:19.520]  talk about adrenaline it's something more than that because you know i've seen old gun pod footage
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.720]  of fighter pilots in vietnam they weren't giggling and snickering and and and and you know this blood
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:29.680]  lust and we see footage of some of the troops it's it's a minority uh you know getting off on
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:34.800]  shooting dogs or throwing dogs off cliffs they've two three four tours something a military has
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.200]  never been forced to do you know some of these guys are coming back and are completely bonkers but
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:46.240]  i think for the average citizen to see the these gun pod footage shows them what is an every day
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:51.600]  you know thing going on out there and and the way people are now disconnected from what soldiers
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.400]  for thousands of years have faced killing their enemy right up looking them in the eyes and we
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.520]  see the ground troops show up and they show empathy for the children that are in the minivan that's
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.640]  been shot to hell and and and then you hear uh the helicopter pilot and the gunner say ah shouldn't
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:12.800]  be in a war zone and so that so we see not just the people on the ground being dehumanized but
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.680]  we see the people in the helicopters being dehumanized well i agree with you now and this is one of
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:22.160]  those things where um again if i were the commander i witnessed that those those soldiers would have
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:27.760]  been relieved on the spot because i like that that is exactly the point that all combat especially
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:32.480]  the the the people i've been in combat with do not conduct themselves in that manner you any time
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:39.520]  you have to take a life you need to be reverend in the fact that you are doing it and um as you
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:43.760]  mentioned my book the dark side of the forest is coming out uh later this year in last last day of
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:49.360]  august and you know one of the one of the first incidents in that book i talk about my my first
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:55.120]  combat convoy i have to make a choice about shooting or not shooting an eight-year-old kid who throws
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:01.680]  a sun uh some juice uh empty box in front of the vehicle in front of me and i and i would have been
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.000]  right to shoot the kid by the rules of engagement i didn't and this is one of those things it was a
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.960]  win-win for for the tally bond if i shot the kid that's good because you know we shot a kid and
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:16.000]  that's that's a score for them and if i didn't shoot him that makes me less less likely to shoot
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.560]  a kid next time if he does have a bomb in his hand so this is the nature of modern warfare it's one
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.120]  of those things where there's no right answers but if you pick the right but if you pick the wrong
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:31.120]  answer it's going to be hurtful no matter what and let's not kid ourselves this is a war of images
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:37.120]  a war of information and you know you have info wars dot com that is a brilliant way of displaying
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:41.520]  information relating to what is really going on this is one of those things alex we have to be
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:47.360]  better than the adversary if you recall they the tally bond came out with a 29 point uh
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:53.040]  code of conduct last year uh done by uh i'll bother dar who was actually wrapped up recently
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:59.680]  because he became too pro negotiating for his own good with the pakistanis so um we will never
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.200]  see the tally bond actually execute their operations in conjunction with that 29 point uh i'm
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.480]  sorry 69 point uh code of conduct this is where we're better than they are and frankly this is one
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:15.040]  of the points i'd like to say i'm not speaking for the army but the army and the do d is actually
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:19.120]  going to read a look this now because it's the right thing to do we need to look at the circumstance
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:24.560]  of why why wasn't the soldiers were so apt to shoot that day clearly it's it's not only a training
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:30.640]  issue it's a psychological issue and let's not forget alex that we have record number of suicides
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:36.080]  from post traumatic stress i think this is why you're seeing such a great number of post traumatic
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:41.760]  stress issues because people are not doing the right thing necessarily commanders are obligated
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.520]  to train equip their their soldiers to win but then also the response for holding them back
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:52.640]  because as you point out through our history we have been better than this we we were obligated
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:58.400]  to try to pull people back and we also have vietnam we had the my line the melee massacre
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.720]  so we have had a record of people going off the reservation i'd like to believe that's
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.640]  exception but we've got to be better about the way we conduct modern warfare because things like
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:13.040]  this do matter and shapes the al-qaeda battle space is this this video will help al-qaeda recruit
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.400]  and we both know that okay let's expand on this though take a movie like apocalypse now with
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:24.720]  colonel curts who's gone completely insane and so the military sends out a special operator
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:32.800]  uh you know to kill him that's right and but now i read john you memos i read alberto
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.880]  gonzalez memos guys have never been in the military never been in combat and they're saying
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:43.280]  we can crush children's genitals we can torture children the military's given this the pentagon
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:49.920]  hires uh jail guards and people who've been fired from federal jails for abuse uh general to goomba's
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.440]  own report says raping children raping people with acid i mean this is in the army report
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:02.880]  far worse than those images why on earth would would the pentagon accept directives from the
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:09.200]  bush winehouse knowing that once this was implemented this would absolutely destroy morale
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:15.920]  and turn us into the nazis in the eyes of the world well i think that's the answer the the
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:20.400]  answer to your questions within your question i think a lot of those policies were established
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:24.560]  for retribution more than actual intelligence collection the army put out a policy a few years
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:31.680]  ago saying we will follow a very strict regimen regimen of of of of basically techniques non
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:37.200]  non-intrusive nonviolent techniques to break people again i cited for you my book there's a
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:43.680]  there's two chapters about an fbi special agent and i working to to interrogate and break i mean
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:48.400]  we didn't touch him once but within three days we're able to break him by use of really good
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:54.800]  investigative and interrogation techniques not and i think based on my experience you can get
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.440]  people to talk you don't have to teach them to touch them you don't have to torture them but
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:05.280]  in a lot of times as you know you know their mind becomes their own worst enemy because of the
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:10.400]  imagery of their own fears you can touch on people's fears without touching them and that's the idea
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:15.440]  here we need to be better and more instructive and and how we have people do let's take khaled
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.720]  sheik muhammad he confessed after a hundred plus water boardings they finally threatened his family
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:23.680]  you know they finally said well you something bad's gonna happen to your kids and wife of you
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:29.200]  don't he confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till four years after he was arrested
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:34.960]  he almost confessed to sinking the titanic or or killing kennedy i mean this is ridiculous
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:39.200]  well and i think this is this brings up an excellent problem for the prosecutions we're
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:44.720]  going to face for the 9 11 terrorists or i mean i'm sorry the the detainees at the guantanamo bay
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:49.760]  which is similar to anybody who has something to do with 9 11 regarding the techniques you just
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.200]  mentioned uh anytime you torture someone alex the fact is this they're going to tell you
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.240]  whatever you want to know to make the pain stop and that's been proven over and over again so
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.000]  again it's one of those things where i think there are some other very advanced techniques one of the
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:11.840]  9 11 uh conspirators were broken by very complex techniques relating to the fact that he was a
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:19.520]  pedophile so they in this one instance they used the idea that his personal conduct was directly
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:25.200]  in contrast and contradiction to his personal beliefs relating to a law and his his faith
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:31.280]  so enough of hitting him on that not hitting him literally but hitting him with the idea of the
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:36.000]  disconnect between his personal conduct and his personal beliefs is what broke him eventually
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.080]  and this is the idea you need to get inside his people's head these individuals head
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:46.400]  and break them without touching them so when you look at the the interrogation program uh i personally
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.120]  turned down a seat at that in that program i talk about that a little bit in my book about the
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:55.680]  being given a tour of one of the secret prisons and then saying you know been asked what do you
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:00.080]  think is like look i i basically said just to read ahead in the book here i i want nothing to do with
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:08.080]  this and frankly that's the problem i think when you have a policy set up by an administration
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.000]  alex the army or the military is obligated to follow it and that's one of those things where
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.720]  you have lawyers hopefully lawyers who are smart enough to understand that you can't arbitrarily
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:22.560]  decide to start breaking us laws and i frankly read the the uh the memos done by the bush
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:28.720]  white house lawyers as being illegal approving illegal activities which frankly you know we
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:34.240]  we as soldiers are obligated to to try to to resist illegal orders and you're told that in
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.280]  your training you you're you're your obligation to not follow illegal orders it becomes a very
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:44.320]  fine line but below between following orders which are given by lawful authority which we're
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:50.000]  trying to do or you know trying to find a way to not follow or or or disabuse yourself of
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.320]  illegal orders well i mean you just talked about it being illegal and clearly it is illegal on the
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:18:00.880]  face of it an animal but but but now we have obama continuing snatch and grab more black
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:07.120]  sides of an exposed all over europe and asia we know this is intensifying not subsiding and so
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:13.840]  i guess they got away with it so now it's secret policy in the cia speaking as an academic every
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.720]  administration who comes in tends to take on the tools which the previous administration used were
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:23.040]  successful in using so frankly you know i don't believe there's going to be any great difference
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.720]  between the the the bush white house and the obama administration on a number of these policy issues
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:33.840]  and let's cite for example alex the uh... the kilt the kill capture program i've said on fox
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:38.240]  news a couple different times recently that the obama administration's been been there their
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.760]  default position is killing people and that's something i find totally uh idiotic as an
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.240]  intelligence officer the idea is you need to capture people and find out what they know
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:53.520]  so because they don't want to deal with the issues relating to what do we do with detainees do we
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.000]  put them on trial in a civil civil civilian court do we do military tribunals because they don't
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.840]  want to deal with that now the default position is killing people what you've read about recently
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:07.520]  with the issue of alalaki apparently according to the news reports over the past two weeks
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:12.640]  there is now essentially a death warrant been been issued for him to be killed if possible by
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:19.280]  u.s. or yemen forces on site so this is this is something clearly that i think is a bit uh i think
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:23.440]  we should be defaulting our default position should be capturing these individuals and if we
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.240]  really can't then i think we need to look at it but that we should be capturing them and frankly
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:32.720]  the other problem with this is that they're in their original in the extremist belief alex
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:38.640]  being a martyr is a great thing i think we need to avoid giving them that opportunity to be a martyr
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:44.000]  this mission that includes alalaki and this includes bin laden if he's alive uh well i mean
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.040]  some have been logged and let's cut it right to the chase train in the 80s worked with the cia
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.240]  we know the muslim brigades have been used to destabilize countries the west doesn't like
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:59.360]  they were used against the soviets they're being used against the russians today it's a convenient
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:04.720]  boogie man out there uh we know the underwear bomber was allowed on the plane protected given
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:11.040]  a visa by the us an unnamed intelligence agency told the state department this this is on record
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:15.360]  and then we get the internal homeland security documents most of homeland security now and
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:20.000]  north com is set up for the american people returning veterans gun owners conservatives
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.560]  law enforcement gave us those documents last year they were confirmed to be accurate and the
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:30.000]  pentagon was hopping mad and and so was homeland security that we got them uh but when we really
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:35.840]  look at this this is a system that's been set up for the american people and you know you're in
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:39.920]  ireland right now you said northern ireland leaders condemn bombing i've got the new york
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:45.440]  times article i had agent stake knife on before they killed him a few years ago you know of a
[02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:53.360]  british special forces uh special air services assigned to this and he said that the ira was run
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:59.600]  by british intelligence as a pretext to radicalize things as an excuse to be in ireland especially
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:04.800]  northern ireland i mean come on we know the russians of stage terror we know our own government
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:10.400]  has operation north woods what can you say about government actually being behind some of the
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:17.040]  terrorism in history well i alex i i gotta stick with what i know for to be the fact i mean i had
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:20.560]  some of this these these references you've referenced i you've mentioned i have not read
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:25.360]  like i can't speak to things i don't know you know about north woods well i i don't know much
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:30.560]  about that i'm not not studied that but what i will say is that there's clearly uh as of late
[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:37.920]  a tendency to start looking at internal threats more than external now i cut my teeth uh as a
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:43.280]  lieutenant doing counterterrorism stuff in germany back in the mid 80s and it was very clear then
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.440]  and i'm not sure what's changed between then and now and in many aspects but i know back then we
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:52.640]  were very much concerned about the soviet funding radical groups within germany as a matter of fact
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:58.320]  my first terrorism counterterrorism operations are focused on the raf sports group hoffman and
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.600]  things like that whereas very clearly a third party a third organization being the soviet union
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:08.400]  was funding a lot of that activity as noted by the fact once the cold war ended a lot of these
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:13.520]  groups faded off into the distance and never came back i think that we have to be very cognizant of
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:19.280]  the fact that that there is some real you know energy been given now to our government looking
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:23.280]  internally and i think in some cases it is not warranted by the fact that you're going to yes
[02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.760]  you're going to have veterans coming back with clear psychological problems but the way to deal
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:32.400]  with that is by giving them the treatment they need not treating them as as enter as adversaries
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:37.040]  and i think that's one of the things that has been uh trending lately is to look at people who've
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:40.720]  come back and have problems as an internal enemy more than that what are your pentagon
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:46.160]  associates saying about the fact that i mean as you admit more of this is being swung around
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:50.640]  internally from my research oh i mean here's an example it came out in the baltimore sun
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:55.360]  that ron paul and myself and others and we ended up getting the secret army document which they
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:59.280]  confirmed was real so there's good guys the military senate to us that when i go out and
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:05.600]  have an in the fed rally they've got military army intelligence watching me and it says in the memo
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:10.480]  don't let them know you're with the army they may be terrorist and may kill you so they're
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:14.720]  teaching the army that i'm like some vampire that's going to try to tear their throat out
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:19.040]  there's a number of legal problems with that one of the things i came up against during able
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:23.440]  danger which was the issue of posse comitatis and and i think it's a very good law for a
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:29.520]  number of reasons first off as you just mentioned it is illegal for the army to be augmenting directly
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:34.240]  civil law enforcement operations that that is that is clearly illegal so that's one of those
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.400]  things that i know people like senator orle inspector were very much against the idea
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:44.080]  of allowing folks to to be used for purposes of law enforcement and there's good reasons for it
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:48.800]  and this is something that harkens back to the 1960s where it was equally a bad idea then
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:52.640]  to use military intelligence folks for civil law enforcement and i think it's the same thing now if
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:58.240]  this is being this is going on now i i don't know of anyone within my circle of of associates
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:02.560]  and friends who have been involved in that it's not to say i i don't know if it's happening
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:05.920]  i personally don't know i've not been involved i don't know anyone of my
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:10.320]  intelligence friends who've been involved but i know there's been contingency planning done
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:15.120]  to look at how the military could be brought into support civil unrest support the civil
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.200]  authorities and during times of civil unrest now that's something that i know it's been kicked
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:25.200]  around a lot over the past 30 years frankly uh the idea of coming in in time of a crisis to
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:32.000]  actually wreck 84 well let me ask you this and i mean i literally in the last 10 years have had
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.440]  guys get out they're obviously military and playing clothes and even threaten me in parking lots
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:41.200]  i have national news everywhere saying i'm calling for violence when i'm not
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:46.240]  does it sound to you colonel like they're trying to set me up for something well it sounds like
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:50.560]  any other whisper campaign i mean i alex is you know i was victimized by a whisper campaign by the
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.040]  pentagon as well when i first broke ranks i think there's something else that you need to look at
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:59.760]  here regarding the fact that when well you know there's a something called sifa are you familiar
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:06.240]  with sifa the county of the sport but yeah that everything that i've heard about that was and i
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:11.280]  hate to use this as a as a term but it was like darth vader's vanguard for the fact that those
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.760]  people were they have no interest in counterintelligence they were essentially uh as i understand
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:21.760]  the steve cam bones uh dirty tricks folks and and and they in one case they were surveilling
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:28.400]  a a secret service special agent whose father was it got against the bush administration
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:32.480]  i mean no i have no doubt that this sort of thing has happened so is this just harassment then
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:37.280]  because i mean it's like a no way out when he's walking along and who are these guys well they're
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:41.600]  formally associated with special forces and i'm just like a regular guy with a family who has a
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.960]  big talk show but i mean it's getting really creepy and that's one of those things that i think that
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:52.480]  this is why i spoke it out against against the use of uh blackwater contractors and and as as
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:58.960]  um some form of of mercenary and this is where there's been a real gray area alex that that we
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.680]  had to look at it by the fact that i think that there's some real uh loopholes that have been
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:08.320]  used by the military and by the intelligence organizations to hire folks who serve in these
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:14.720]  roles it's it's a very murky gray area and for example in afghanistan the cia up up until recently
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:21.360]  denied it i was there to handle two of the kis from cia where there is black water back in 2003
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:26.480]  so there's this is a loophole that a number of organizations have used to hire people off the
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.920]  street who have military background to do things which i think if they were shown to be in the
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.360]  light of day they would be shown to be illegal and this is where people have tried to get around
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:42.400]  posicomitatis of ways of trying to influence the thinking of adversaries uh you know frankly
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.160]  some people just don't appreciate people like you and others who speak out and i think that's
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:50.960]  what we're learning now we're learning the adversaries or somebody like you or me who just
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:56.240]  speak out for the constitution and bill of rights as some type of darth vader per torian guard
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:02.560]  and uh i know a lot of jag officers are retired law professors we've had on they're very very
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:07.520]  concerned you know adicott from san antonio uh and others but i mean it's just for the
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:12.960]  general public out there i don't think they realize that this whole black op or slash contractor
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.920]  they may be contractors are just out there really intimidating people surveilling people
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:21.920]  we've only got a few minutes left i can't wait till august to have you on to really really go
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:25.120]  over the book in detail and i hope people will order it because i know i'm going to read it
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:29.920]  and it's going to be extremely informative kernel shaver but in closing shifting gears out to
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:34.480]  what happened in poland do you think it's suspicious that the almost entire leadership
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:41.840]  of the polish government's aircraft uh went down well i i gotta there's two parts to it first you
[02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:47.280]  know it's like the old uh whenever someone had a cold and soviet leadership you know that was a
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:52.960]  bad sign i think you know a cold is not a cold and when it comes to soviet this may be something
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:58.240]  that people need to look at as well uh from what i understand that the the the polish president was
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:04.320]  very independent um and i think that the fact that everybody went down together in these questionable
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:09.600]  circumstance you've got to look at the you've got to look at that very hard uh the the the tupel off
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:15.760]  which crashed frankly had a horrible horrible record uh when i flew back from afghanistan i
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:21.600]  flew through tashkent and um the the airline that i was supposed to fly back on flew a lot of those
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:26.160]  fortunately for me they had pretty much grounded all the tupel off's and we're now using bowing
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:31.600]  aircraft so that that aircraft by itself has had a hugely poor safety record but it is stupid to put
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.080]  that much leadership in one aircraft well you never do it i mean i think that's for that's a
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:40.160]  mistake that that you should this should make that's an amateur mistake alex you should never
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:44.560]  make that mistake especially when you have the kind of basically the entire military general staff
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:49.040]  uh pretty much every major officer within the government and the civilian side
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:53.840]  and you got to ask yourself why would they do that especially with a with an aircraft as
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:58.080]  i mentioned with that with that kind of poor safety record kernel we've only got one minute left
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:02.320]  you wanted to make a comment on the bombing in ireland what's your take on that well you know i
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:07.600]  think it's it's frankly from what i've seen from being here just a little bit of time is there's
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:12.400]  still a great deal of dissension within northern ireland i think there's some some chaos there
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:17.040]  i think that as as things settle in you're going to see a few things like this but i think the
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:20.400]  good news isn't if there's any good news is the fact that i think things have been reduced you're
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:25.120]  not you don't have these mass bombings if nothing else there was no there was no casualties in this
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:29.920]  i think it was meant to send a message so at least here i believe that i think they're on a downhill
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:34.480]  run of terrorism being an effective tool i'm hoping that people understand that you know
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:39.280]  that things here are pretty pretty much settled i think but in other places they're not i think
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:43.600]  that uh you know anytime we look at terrorism we have to look realistically at long-term threats
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:47.520]  and another thing that i'd like to bring up briefly we talk about another time is al-qaeda
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:54.560]  president obama made a statement which i think is very accurate about the empires on the run
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:58.320]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:15.040]  letting go here just a few minutes but putting bookends on this get into your al-qaeda point but
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:21.280]  what is al-qaeda we know it's a brzeznik brzezinski computer file at the cia in 1979
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:28.960]  we know it's a term used to try to simplistically label i guess wahabi as sex out of saudi arabia
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:35.200]  we know those do exist we know there's different factions in saudi arabian you know princeton
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:38.960]  where where you've got different princes fighting with each other so we know there's a lot of
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:43.280]  different you know groups and organizations but it just came out last week in federal documents
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:49.360]  that they one of the ringleaders of the moon by attack was a quote us government agent and and and
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:56.160]  help lead the attack and so i keep going back to that over and over again i mean what is al-qaeda
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:01.520]  today well i think we have to look at this realistically because of the intelligence
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:07.520]  community is doing its job alex they're going to have people who would hopefully be will have access
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:13.440]  to the organization the problem is and this this was happened with with the cap champion uh i think
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:18.080]  a lot of the cia's activities lately have been focused on wishful thinking i think they recruit
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:24.080]  people thinking they're going to work for the us and they're true believers there's really no level
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:29.920]  of of of benefit you can give them to make them walk away from what they believe so i think that's
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:35.360]  what we're seeing here we're saying double double and triple agents absolutely absolutely i think
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:39.840]  that's what we're seeing here where i think it's almost a a policy of wishful thinking
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:43.840]  hoping these guys will really come over and support us and then they get tripled cross back
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:47.440]  essentially peter lantz to the great book on a swamp is called triple cross where it talks
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:52.160]  about ally muhammad that very thing happened there where the guy was doubled and tripled
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.080]  back against us and i think that's what we're seeing here a lot of and we're not being smart
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:02.480]  as we should to detect when they're running short on time uh a few months ago that cia base uh in
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:07.440]  central asia getting blown up was that a double cross off triple cross absolutely that guy that
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:13.760]  guy never left his true belief in al qaeda and that's why those people don't so what is al qaeda
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:21.040]  well i think al qaeda is a it's essentially a franchise of terrorism that the the radicals
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:24.640]  within the muslim community have been able to use to sustain themselves and try and tie
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:29.920]  together i think for example elaki is really the primary uh the operational leader right now he's
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:34.960]  the one who's actually able to plan things so i think that he is realistically kind of the lead
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:39.520]  guy right now in al qaeda i think that's why the focus is so heavy on him he's been able to pick up
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.720]  his franchise and do a lot with it what about obama saying he's worried about al qaeda getting
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:50.400]  nukes i mean that sounds as ridiculous as saying saddam hussein had nukes well i can tell you that
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:54.080]  there's a great deal of effort going on to look at this issue realistically right now alex i think
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:58.960]  that there's a there's a good potential that that's where they want to go for their next big attack
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:03.680]  and i don't think they've let down so i know this may be hard for your you have your listeners
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.360]  to accept i i believe that they are they are going in that direction i believe that's where
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:13.280]  they're going next is what i mean could the russians like alexander levitt say actually sell nukes
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:18.240]  i believe there's people within the infrastructure would be willing to sell the nuketa weapon
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:24.560]  based on personal gain yeah i do believe that so that's something to be cognizant of i'm not
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:27.920]  saying it would happen i think that that's something we need to be realistically looking at well you're
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.360]  going to be able to talk about a lot more of this coming up in august when the book uh the dark side
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:38.720]  of the force comes out we look forward to speaking to you then thanks for the time thank you all right
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:43.760]  there goes lieutenant colonel anthony schaefer very interesting interview very interesting
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:51.120]  individual joining us from ireland okay here's the deal we got jim tucker coming up for 30 minutes
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:57.200]  in the next hour and then i want to do a video game review because more and more of these video
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:02.240]  games have a pro new world order or anti-new world order message and video games in many cases are
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.560]  bigger than the biggest hollywood films some of these video game franchises have made over a billion
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:12.480]  bucks in the last two years uh things like uh call of duty uh you know modern warfare or things like
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:19.120]  that um there's an info wars dot com review of half life too that's been out for a few years
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:25.440]  but in this video game they have darpa control towers that mesmerize the public and people are
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:31.200]  microchipped all of this is what is actually being promoted i mean that's mainstream information
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:36.000]  you tell somebody hey the government can put up uh mind control towers well darpa has been talking
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.960]  about that in newspapers i mean they're openly talking about drugging the water supply on fox
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:46.160]  news to make us uh more passive it's already going on that's why we are so passive the most
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.960]  aggressive rebellious people ever in the history of the world maybe the some of the greeks were
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:55.440]  more aggressive but definitely some of the most aggressive people ever will suddenly put up with
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:00.080]  anything because your food your water and other things are being spiked it doesn't matter if your
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:05.280]  colonel schaefer or a cop down the street or alex jones we're all under attack by this
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:11.040]  and he wasn't even you know shocked by the fact that i talk about the pentagon following us around
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.400]  and going to end the fed rallies and then when i go to a bill berg meeting i'm at my hotel five
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:22.800]  miles away and the feds waddle in and say jones let's attack the state department tonight together
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.600]  i mean the feds know full well i'm not going to attack the state department they know full well
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:31.600]  i'm not going to attack the police they know full well i'm trying to keep people from getting
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:38.640]  violent here and that's what's making them mad and that's why multiple major publications per day
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:46.560]  are lying and saying i'm calling for violence and i'm going to get to that in a moment after we uh
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:52.560]  take some more your phone calls it's just it's just driving me crazy uh to see this happening
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:58.720]  they change my computer around where my i am's are under a different icon uh so i can see the
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:04.240]  call list how do i pull that up somehow that got minimized in here because i won't be able to pull
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:10.000]  it up in there i need to be able to pull it up here okay good you're in control of my computer
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:16.800]  that's good um okay fresh list here john wyoming tom jim jimmy ryan and others let's race through
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:24.080]  your calls uh let's talk to john and wyoming you're on the air john yeah alex welcome you hear me
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:30.720]  yes sir alex okay a couple of years ago i saw a great documentary on tv about post world war to
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:37.760]  europe and poland's leader at the time was a very patriotic man just as this man who died the other
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:44.000]  day and he was vehemently opposed to the allies turning over poland as well as all of eastern
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:50.880]  europe to joseph stalin after the end of the war and mysteriously one day he got aboard his plane
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:56.320]  which had been tampered with not by the russians but by the allies and it crashed on the island of
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:02.240]  malta killing this man it's now been declassified uh that's uh
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.720]  that our own government killed patin because he didn't want to hand stuff over to the commies
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:13.360]  and and that's what jesse ventura was talking about from fletcher prowney the head of black ops in
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:18.320]  the book the secret team that our government made a deal with the soviets to divide up the world
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:24.400]  and have third world intractable wars to build up their own power bases it's all staged now
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:29.520]  there does appear to be a real split now between russia and the anglo-american establishment you
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:34.800]  heard schaefer allude to the russians killing them and they had reasons to kill them but that
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:43.760]  but but but recently the the uh the kazinski president and his twin uh who's in the government
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:48.640]  had been prime minister they have come out for those who just joined us i covered it earlier
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:54.160]  and said we're not going along with the european union we may get out of it in fact here's the
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:59.600]  headline new york times kazinski often at a source of tension with the eu and see
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:06.800]  iceland has said no to the takeover greece is going along with it only partially but if poland
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.800]  says no to the banks taking them over and looting them uh and this program of austerity the whole
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.600]  european union could implode and that's not alex jones saying that that's george soros so
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:23.840]  this is leaning towards it being a blackout by nato but it could be the russians as well or it
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:29.600]  could be natural go ahead well i think that our people did him in much as they did the
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:35.520]  polish leader in in 1945 who wasn't going to go along with that giveaway of poland and all of
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:42.480]  eastern europe to joseph stalin i mean we spent 150 000 american lives to liberate eastern europe
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:47.440]  from adolf hitler and then we turn around and give them to joseph stalin that's like trading
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:52.640]  in syphilis for gonorrhea i mean either way you lose because they were both brutal dictators
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.440]  they were both mass murderers and this man wasn't going along with it and so they made sure his
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.600]  plane crashed into the island of malta so he wouldn't be around to oppose this takeover by
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.720]  stalin and i remember reading about that anything else john no sir that'll do it and hope you have
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:14.880]  a great day you too my friend yeah i mean people ask why is alex jones still alive well if they
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:19.840]  kill me it just makes all my information and material that much more popular kind of highlights
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:28.400]  everything i've done but somebody like a polish president who says i don't like the russians
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:33.760]  but i'm starting to not like nato in the e u and you've destroyed our economy with globalization
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:37.520]  and we're going to get out of this and they announced that they were going to do that last
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:46.320]  week and five days later he's deader than a hammer and as soon as we get ahold of tarply in the next
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:51.360]  few days uh we'll get him on to give us his takes he really is an expert in this whole area
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:56.640]  uh let's go ahead and talk to tom in texas tom you're on the air hello alex how you doing today
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:06.320]  good sir had a good vacation i hope uh april ninth uh of this year uh sheriff arvin west of
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:11.680]  hudspeth county told citizens to arm themselves because we can no longer protect them from spillover
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:16.800]  of border violence that's the third largest county in the state of texas let me stop you
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:23.440]  because we have a on an a ohio county doing it and a michigan county saying arm yourselves uh
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:27.840]  but but a sheriff and we've had a lot of south texas sheriffs on give me the name
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:31.200]  of the sheriff because i want to pull an article on this right now and also want to get the sheriff
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:43.120]  on again give me the name arvin arvin west of hudspeth county texas at borders el paso what's
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:50.080]  his name again arvin west okay i thought you said arvin west of okay arvin west and where is he
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:56.880]  hudspeth county h u d s p e t h at borders el paso county
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:03.680]  so what we should say is on friday south texas sheriff says arm yourselves to protect yourselves
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:10.080]  well it's more over west texas uh it's the county that you go through before you get to uh
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:15.920]  el paso county yeah i just see that as south because it's down there by the border but
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:22.640]  sure well yeah south south west texas is on the border but anyway what i'm saying is uh
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:28.240]  he's telling people in that county to arm themselves because he can't protect him anymore uh also in
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:34.720]  the uh statement he said that uh rick perry had uh activated the texas border violence spillover
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:41.840]  contingency contingency plan in which he requested federal aid is that all that our government
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:47.040]  and our governor and the state of texas is going to do they're just going to let this continue
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:54.640]  you well uh remember last year what was the texas state senator we had on we need to get him back
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:45:00.720]  on i forget his name he said marshal law had secretly been declared last year on the texas border
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.600]  because they believe mexico will fully collapse into anarchy because of the drug war if they
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:11.920]  decriminalize drugs it would all end like a storm blowing over but the drug war is meant just like
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:15.760]  china was brought down with the drug war it's meant to bring us down and so there's no way they're
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:22.080]  going to stop uh but i did get the article it's a sheriff arvin west of hudspeth county texas
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:27.840]  tell citizens to arm themselves as you can no longer protect them from spillover border uh
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:33.520]  violence so absolutely and that's over on the border in west texas by el paso
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:42.960]  michael burges get michael burges back on about the situation uh good points anything
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:48.640]  else you want to add color well all i wanted to say was um maybe the rest of us start
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.960]  thinking along these lines also because obvious rick perry is not going to do anything and it's
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:57.520]  obvious that uh barry satoro is not going to do anything i think he's going to let it get
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:02.880]  to a critical boiling point and then declare marshal law and take our rights away i agree with
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:08.880]  you but but again marshal law was covertly declared over a year ago and that was even in
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:14.160]  some of the el paso and other uh west and south texas papers and i remember six seven years ago
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:20.160]  talking about rocket attacks hang grenade attacks 17 000 dead this year just on the border i mean it
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:26.960]  is just i mean once beautiful towns are just boarded up high rises totaled and now it's getting
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:31.440]  like that in other cities in the state but when there's a car bombing with the mexican mafia
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:36.800]  killing somebody in dallas it's a footnote the dallas morning news meanwhile i'm here calling
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:43.360]  for non-violence in the media's elix jones is deadly he wants to kill the government get him
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:49.280]  get him because we're here exposing their whole scam i appreciate your call tom man how many articles
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:57.040]  have i seen just the last few days i'm looking for my stack here uh it's in my economy stack
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:04.000]  where the where finally the truth is coming out the police are saying all money goes to the banks
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:11.040]  now they're firing more than a half of us buy guns but i mean you could have look at new york
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.320]  look at chicago more cops than the other cities per capita highest crime rate the cops if they wanted
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:23.680]  to protect you can't protect you you can't have a cop in every house you can disarm everyone the
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:29.440]  criminals are still going to have guns it's so elementary it's so elementary and on the youtube
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:34.960]  videos of these local newscasts where the sheriffs are saying arm yourselves i see comments going
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:41.040]  if we ban all guns this would just end oh yes banal then the murderers would use pickaxes and
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:50.240]  daggers and clubs i mean it's it's asinine the answer is more guns more guns more guns more guns
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:57.040]  and the american people have known this for over a year what was it 14 million guns sold last year
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:03.200]  another three and a half million sold last time i that's almost 18 million guns the last year in
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:11.760]  three months 18 million guns sold the people know what's going on i don't think some of the general
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:16.720]  public though realizes just how bad it is and how crazy the times are and what we're going into
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:22.160]  we're in a depression folks we've had a recession going for at least three years three quarters of
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:29.840]  a recession uh with unemployment above 20 percent is a depression unemployment is not 10 percent like
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:37.200]  the news says every major private firm says 22 percent makes me dizzy it really gives me a headache
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:45.520]  gem in illinois you're on the air go ahead elix can you hear me yes sir all right i'm from the
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:53.280]  people's republic of illinois and i have um one comment and one question first i'm going to give
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:49:00.160]  you a little background i have a family member in federal law enforcement but i'll tell you a
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:08.080]  bottom line my wife got me a romanian ak-47 for valentine's day nothing says love like an assault
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:19.040]  rifle my comment is about this polish some crash you're there yes sir all right it seems a little
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:26.560]  suspicious to me this is supposed to be the anniversary of essentially a russian genocide
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:33.520]  of polish um intelligence officers and whatever they are and all of a sudden crashes that seems
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:39.280]  just a little you know it doesn't sit with me right no no i have thought that as well but is
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:45.040]  it meant to be blamed on the russians or did the russians do it i don't know i don't know either
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:51.920]  i'm just putting out the question and by the way i want to hear you on coast more and w r less
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:57.440]  here in chicago cuts it off after two hours this is pretty crappy okay here's my question
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:06.720]  it i'm a or i'm a little scared about obama's latest statement about how he is concerned
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:13.920]  about these uh he didn't say suitcase but essentially suitcase nukes in the no i brought
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:19.120]  that up with schaefer he's saying the main threat is now nukes and how many times have i said
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:24.000]  that's the way for revolutionaries to take over michael savage agrees limbaugh has said there's no
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:29.520]  way obama is going to get re-elected the democrats are going to have to stage a crisis let's just
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:35.440]  come out with it the globalist banks are looking at setting off a nuke in this country they will
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:41.440]  even go that far to get everybody scared to bow down to obama and do whatever they say to then go
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:47.200]  off and launch new wars to try to get the economy going again and i think this is a serious issue
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:51.520]  in fact it's in my stack but i may not find it reprint obama worried about nuclear terrorism

[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:24.000]  when some were speculating that it was going to be in england or spain now jim confirmed it's spain
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.160]  and he's always been right in the past and the bill berg sometimes will rent multiple hotels put
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:34.400]  out this info to find out what moles they've got uh people are commenting well why don't they just
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:39.600]  have it in japan why don't they just have it in africa no they only have it in western europe the
[03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:45.760]  caribbean or canada or the us they do three years in europe one year in the us three years in europe
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:50.640]  one year in the us that's how it's been done since the fifties and this is the group that set up the
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:58.560]  european union this is the group that set up this entire system and so we're working on getting jim
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:07.680]  on and that'll be coming up in the next segment hopefully i also want to continue with news but
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:13.520]  right now let's go back to your calls uh let's talk to jimmy and michigan jimmy you're on the air
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:21.840]  how are you doing today alex good sir hey uh um i'm i talked to michael savage and i'm finally
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.800]  made it on your show on your website it was amazing uh you're the guy that called in and
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:31.120]  talked about how they set up the hitari militia and now that they've released their best evidence
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:35.600]  the guy's like yeah the government keeps pushing we'll have to fight them someday i mean every
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:41.200]  most americans have talked like that boom you're gonna prison right i i i understand that and
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:49.360]  and i also would like to point out that mike meeks michael david meeks is the one one of the guy i
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:54.800]  can speak for him because i've known him for over 30 years i'd broken bread with his family
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:01.120]  he was welcoming my home he was going to be best man at my wedding on the 8th of may uh this is my
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:06.560]  friend i've known him forever there's no way that he would have ever been involved in any kind of
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:14.720]  conspiracy like this he is the kind of guy that wanted to change things but he was always doing
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:22.320]  it in a civil way he was he ran for republican precinct delegate and became one and uh we've
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:30.320]  been talking about and norlander for uh secretary of state uh michael bishop for attorney general
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:35.920]  we just started digging into the the guys that are well look look look the media is saying i'm
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:40.720]  calling for insurrection and violence when i'm not as a way to make us the bad guys and let the
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:46.640]  system have the moral high ground and and and the best evidence they've got is the supposed leader
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:50.960]  stone and he doesn't say anything you should go to prison for i mean talk show hosts say
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:57.520]  much more extreme things every day and so clearly this whole thing is a setup to create the illusion
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:04.320]  there's all these violent militias out there exactly and and mr uh mr potak who's certainly
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:12.080]  welcome to his opinion uh why doesn't he come and talk to one of us i'll debate him anytime
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:18.240]  anywhere no problem well obviously they don't want the truth kidding out and they want to continue
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:22.400]  with the illusion that anybody that criticizes the government is a terrorist that wants to
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:27.600]  murder people all the government uses more and more force against the citizens every day in this
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:32.560]  country and gets more and more oppressive and sells us on the idea of police dogs attacking
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:38.000]  old women at the g20 but i'd like to get your name and number and and and perhaps uh have you
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  on as a guest uh to talk more about the hitari and maybe get some of the other locals on with you
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:50.480]  that knew some of these people so we can dispel the propaganda but i saw them being set up when
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:56.880]  that pale horse guy sickles and they admit one of the members is a fad and i don't know who it is
[03:04:56.880 --> 03:05:03.920]  but i've had my suspicions stay with us hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite
[03:05:03.920 --> 03:05:08.320]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you
[03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:12.960]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:17.040]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[03:05:17.040 --> 03:05:21.520]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the
[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:27.760]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:32.560]  supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds

[03:08:56.880 --> 03:09:04.320]  berg is uh in 2010 bill berg found in spain he's also found where the uh trilateral commission

[03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:42.800]  seasons resort which is a big spot place and bill berg's meeting is a month later
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:51.520]  as a typical fashion from uh thursday june 3 until monday morning june 7
[03:09:54.320 --> 03:10:03.520]  a there meeting in a little town called uh spain sig s-i-t-g is we just got 20 miles from
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:12.320]  basalona and uh they're saying at the mar hotel which is a big spot place and uh
[03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:20.160]  of course we'll be there holding their hands for them as far as their agenda is concerned uh this
[03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:29.040]  year uh it ended up above the heading on their agenda this year which is not at all unusual
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:38.320]  unfortunately is their intentions are europeans and americans play higher income taxes
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:47.600]  significantly higher income taxes because of their plan to level the world so that the third
[03:10:47.600 --> 03:10:54.800]  world country's federal living rises the european and american standard of living drops until we're
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:11:01.200]  all uh we're all poured together in under their uh world government and so this is what you're
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:06.160]  getting from your inside sources and for those that just joined us jim talker for more than 30
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:11.760]  years has been exposing the highest level of the world government crime council the bill
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:17.120]  berg group 125 of the most powerful people in the world from western europe and north america
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:22.160]  meeting in secret and the information he's released years before things even happen
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:29.840]  from bill berg proves the fact that they are governing and controlling our planet uh to a
[03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:38.400]  very great extent now a week ago you revealed that they are going to push for raising our taxes
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:44.720]  to the level of france basically but to also suppress the third world but lower us and now
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:49.600]  that's mirrored by bernacchi saying we've all got to pay more taxes volker saying we've got to have
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:57.040]  value added and carbon taxes uh and and all the services are being cut some police departments
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:01.840]  are firing half their cops some sheriff's departments more than half but the taxes go up
[03:12:01.840 --> 03:12:08.720]  like a third world nation everything goes to the bankers uh yes they manipulated the uh
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:16.880]  worldwide depression and now they're exploiting it for their own selfish reasons they indicated going
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:25.360]  far at least until late in year 2011 late next year uh for their own purposes and now we have
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:32.240]  bernacchi telling a private group of businessmen in texas that uh these sources are difficult
[03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:36.000]  quote the quote these sources are difficult it always seems these are putting them off until
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:42.400]  the day they cannot be put off anymore uh and he's saying that we've got to raise taxes and cut
[03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:49.520]  services uh and he said that to a group of uh businessmen in dallas and their job is be a
[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:53.280]  little messenger boys and go out and tell everybody in the world that we need to accept it
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:13:00.400]  americans get so hungry so desperate they'll accept anything but yet he engineered he and the other
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:08.080]  boys uh engineered the very uh financial crisis that they're uh exploiting and everything's going
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:14.240]  towards their plan at this point jim what's it like for you to be laughed at for 20 years with
[03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:21.120]  the media saying bill berg didn't exist and now the last 10 of that 30 now they admit open news
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:26.880]  everyday world government global constitution private banks to rule the planet with a global
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:33.600]  banking constitution i mean now it's right out in the open well more so in europe than the united
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:41.360]  states because the blackout uh remains with the uh major newspapers like the washington post uh
[03:13:41.360 --> 03:13:48.640]  new york times la times and uh associated proof and the broadcast networks now there's been more
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:54.160]  exposure as you observe for you attended the meetings about independent broadcast outlets
[03:13:54.160 --> 03:14:00.560]  like yourself independent radio tv stations independent newspapers not chain newspapers
[03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:08.000]  and we had a lot of those reporters out in shantilly and also a lot in tipterio anytime during the
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:15.440]  wet uh the western hemisphere uh that is canada our door our united states uh
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:24.160]  we get a great deal of reporting from these uh independent outlets but not from the uh
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:32.160]  uh major newspapers called they've all attended uh over the years including top networks uh broadcast
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:39.360]  networks a lifetime promise to uh reveal nothing never even use the word bill berg
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:45.840]  well jim we're seeing a lot of top globalists now calling for censoring the web ending that
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:52.400]  neutrality uh and and basically restricting free speech england just passed a law uh a lot of other
[03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:58.560]  nations are passing laws australia italy uh is that on their agenda because we see globalist
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:04.000]  spokesman at davos kind of a public bill berg meeting calling for this what what other intel
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  are you getting from your sources is going to be on the agenda at bill berg 2010 well as far as
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:18.160]  the free speech is concerned they've never had a first amendment in europe and in fact it's a crime
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:27.440]  to hurt somebody's feelings in uh let's see in uh in the Netherlands and in uh
[03:15:29.200 --> 03:15:35.200]  and in england and in France and in Germany and other countries it is a crime to hurt somebody's
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:42.160]  feelings uh and of course in our own country on the first amendment uh i can say the most
[03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:48.880]  horrible thing from dot u to you but if it's not published by us if i'm not saying it to a third
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:56.400]  party i'm writing it to a third party it's not liable for it's not uh slanderous because i've
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:16:02.640]  said it only to you but they don't have that kind of uh and never have had that kind of uh free
[03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:13.920]  thought and uh yeah in europe oh but you're asking more about the agenda this year yes go ahead
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:23.440]  what else is on their agenda even as we speak uh so the uh international monetary fund is we've
[03:16:23.440 --> 03:16:33.200]  played for it uh it's still to evolve into a world treasury department uh but uh they're laid down
[03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:38.320]  propaganda already unless we do something fix our fiscal path policies that will tilt the curve
[03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:43.840]  downward you'll see these problems come forward to the sport we're putting on this michael musa
[03:16:44.880 --> 03:16:49.920]  to the peterson on april 8 to the peterson is due for international economics in calling for a
[03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:55.680]  tax hike here to europe and uh we're hearing from a lot of uh
[03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:03.840]  a lot of character comes probably with my nose here as we speak uh but while you dig around
[03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:08.240]  in your notes there and again jim's been been fighting these people forever i mean it's all
[03:17:08.240 --> 03:17:15.120]  over the bbc london guardian times of london they say a planetary government with the imf and world
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:20.480]  bank as the global treasury and the private banks will govern the planet i mean this is openly being
[03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:24.800]  announced and they say we're going to raise all your taxes and cut your services and now
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:29.600]  bloomberg reports they're going to take everybody's pension funds and give it to the bankers and if
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:36.080]  you don't like it they'll just turn north com loose on you uh yes as i said in europe there's a
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:42.480]  great deal of attention the major newspapers also for a lot of years in fact i'll think about
[03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:51.440]  thinking so many times but for it was about hell's thinking about 1980 something and we
[03:17:52.240 --> 03:17:58.080]  had in a spotlight the bandit of american free press we had the story early that year their
[03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:03.440]  exact location and we got letters from europe saying of course our circulation is hardly
[03:18:03.440 --> 03:18:11.440]  wall to wall in europe calls for much too soon to mail so one person tends to share his paper with
[03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:16.960]  10 other people helped by the subscription so we got letters from the intersection we alerted the
[03:18:16.960 --> 03:18:24.960]  local media and i said yes and uh when kiss knew the other kids got off the airplane
[03:18:25.520 --> 03:18:31.280]  at uh hell's thinking uh airport and headed for their limousines they were stunned to see all
[03:18:31.280 --> 03:18:40.400]  those cameras and reporters yelling questions and the major newspapers in london and uh paris
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:45.760]  and throughout europe has had a page one attention to photographs stories raised the same questions
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:51.760]  we always raise and they're a great deal of help we pool our information we meet uh bigger every
[03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:57.840]  evening and uh identify well you've been to those meetings though you know what we do we
[03:18:57.840 --> 03:19:02.960]  identify as many people as we can okay in case we don't get the official list but don't steal
[03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:09.280]  this and again before they would deny this but you would get in there steal their membership list
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:14.320]  expose that a global government group is meeting in secret and the decisions they make there are
[03:19:14.320 --> 03:19:19.840]  implemented you were saying on the agenda is to continue the global depression so they can consolidate
[03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:28.000]  power yes we're not going to come out of this until late night 2011 if we turn out there might be
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:34.160]  a little perk here in there as far as digging out nope not at all but they do plan to bring us out
[03:19:34.160 --> 03:19:41.200]  of it though uh with suits they're convenient now you remember it was often many years ago
[03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:46.160]  that uh they decided we should uh have a little bit more possibility when they
[03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:52.160]  ordered the uh gas prices they'd order the gas price up to nearly five dollars a gallon
[03:19:52.800 --> 03:19:58.400]  and then they decided to reduce the gas prices stay there stay there jam we're gonna break and
[03:19:58.400 --> 03:20:03.760]  come back and talk about how they control gas prices on the average americans work between 45
[03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:08.880]  to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years unfortunately
[03:20:08.880 --> 03:20:14.800]  with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to live
[03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:19.440]  below the poverty line is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:24.720]  federal reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these

[03:24:06.720 --> 03:24:12.400]  again jim tucker has been working for major newspapers since the 40s and 50s and he travels
[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:17.440]  to these events he climbs through gutters when he was younger steals their membership list
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:21.840]  prove this group exists it's the most elite on the planet now bbc and others have gotten their
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:27.040]  documents from the 50s when they plan to set up the european union by stealth and jim has sources
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:36.720]  inside bill berg and absolutely he said in 2008 when gas was uh 60 dollars a barrel that bill
[03:24:36.720 --> 03:24:40.800]  berg was going to run it up to 150 everybody laughed that happened they said they were going
[03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:45.600]  to drive it back down that happened so jim you've got your notes there from your bill berg source
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:51.200]  this year what else is on their agenda because we're looking into their crystal ball right now
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:57.200]  okay more bad news gas prices are going up possibly over the next two years the seven
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:02.080]  dollars a gallon like the like they pay in europe and they say so many times europeans pay seven
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:10.240]  dollars a gallon now observe that uh there's a potential supply of oil we've got more than enough
[03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:18.560]  oil uh coming out of uh coming out of everywhere so uh there's no rationalization with this supply
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:27.520]  of oil to raise prices other than their arbitrary decision to raise prices so sadly uh your oil
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:34.320]  prices are going to be going up uh quite high in the next year and that's from bill berg and
[03:25:34.320 --> 03:25:39.120]  queen betricks one of the owners of uh dutch roll shell and bp she's one of the chief owners
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:42.880]  with a queen of england she's the queen of the netherlands she wants more of our money
[03:25:42.880 --> 03:25:53.680]  yes uh you'll notice it they had the power to do that uh a few years ago when gas prices were
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:26:01.280]  about five dollars a gallon the bill berg instead it's time to uh bring down the price of gasoline
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:10.000]  calls joe six pack may not get off of his scooter or his small car uh if we don't bring prices down
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:16.320]  right away calls what he gets used to that small car or to his bicycle or motorbike we may not get
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:23.200]  him back and they were able to uh bring down the at that time the price of oil was oh something like
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:31.520]  140 some dollars uh a barrel and they brought it down to about 80 dollars a barrel but prices
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:38.560]  dropped them over four dollars a gallon down to uh less than two dollars a gallon so what else is on
[03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:46.240]  the agenda so they have the power uh to work it either way they won't do it they're gonna bring it
[03:26:46.240 --> 03:26:52.640]  back up now okay and that's from your source uh what other tidbits are on the agenda what are
[03:26:52.640 --> 03:27:02.800]  they concerned about what about war with iran uh again uh they're divided on that the uh americans
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:14.400]  and israelis uh i want to go to war uh to attack iran the uh uh europe most european bill bergs not
[03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:21.280]  all of them are opposed to invasion they want to talk some more so this is one of the few times

[03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:48.720]  let's see in 2001 and the uh secretary defense lumsville of course of bill berg

[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:22.720]  because i know you're a busy guy um you you mentioned on their agenda is the imf from your
[03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:29.440]  source this is also now in the news uh as the world treasury and how angry are they about their
[03:34:29.440 --> 03:34:35.200]  copenhagen treaty where the private banks would levy taxes on us and run our lives being exposed
[03:34:35.200 --> 03:34:43.040]  by climate gain of their anger if you ever see uh here one word spoken or one word let's see one
[03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:48.240]  word printed about bill berger angry they were used to the for 20 years they were used to absolute
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:55.280]  secrecy but their commitment to turning the international monetary fund into a world treasury
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:35:02.880]  department is unabated they uh a year ago increased they uh became up with that plan to
[03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:12.000]  exploit the economic stress around the world to get the world to accept a world treasury
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:18.080]  department well of which the imf was to evolve and they're still committed to that even though
[03:35:18.080 --> 03:35:24.000]  they were frustrated their efforts to impose it right away so we still have that one to fight
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:32.160]  we're winning it so far that we love us never stop fighting now jim every time i've had you on
[03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:38.400]  i've asked you to to really scan your memory uh you know from your bill berger sources we'll just
[03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:43.680]  leave it at that anything else we should know about this area of spain or what else is going
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:51.120]  to be on their agenda or anything else that we know they're concerned about uh no i think
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:55.600]  south through the if you look in their information i have of course i'll have a lot more when i get
[03:35:55.600 --> 03:36:02.080]  there because uh yeah i'm getting a lot of help not only from european newspapers but from some of
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:09.760]  the uh some high officials themselves have come forward privately to provide information
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:19.200]  so we'll have a lot more as the time goes by but uh i've just got exhausted the preliminary

[03:38:00.080 --> 03:38:04.800]  bilgerberg group uh meetings okay let me now go through a bunch of news that's important
[03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:11.680]  for those out there that don't understand what net neutrality is net neutrality is the internet
[03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:19.440]  as you know it net neutrality is being able to visit any website you want you go buy internet
[03:38:19.440 --> 03:38:24.800]  subscription and you can visit msnbc you can visit info wars dot com you can visit bbc you can
[03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:31.040]  visit the drudge report you can visit your little league football team website you can visit a parks
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:36.480]  and recreation website you can visit a dentist website or a doctor's website or the easter bunny's
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:44.400]  website if you so choose now here is an article out of executive and management briefing comcast
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:49.920]  went over fcc reignites net neutrality debate the most immediate ramification of comcast net
[03:38:49.920 --> 03:38:54.560]  neutrality victory over the federal communications commission this week is that isps might feel less
[03:38:54.560 --> 03:38:58.960]  inclined not to interfere in the traffic running over their networks however the implications range
[03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:08.080]  well beyond that coloring every aspect of broadband marketplace now this is what china does but the
[03:39:08.080 --> 03:39:13.920]  government is the big isp basically over the isps and it decides what you can visit what you can't
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:19.920]  and they just put you in a blacklist australia is doing this england's moving to do this in fact
[03:39:19.920 --> 03:39:27.760]  here is a article on that front out of cnet news dot uk this is a cbs outfit digital economy bill
[03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:33.520]  nine things you can't do anymore and it says download from us download dot com is part of a
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:39.200]  big happy cnet family among the available software and peer-to-peer chair filing tools the bill
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:44.080]  specifically states that websites such as download dot com can be blocked if they're providing tools
[03:39:44.080 --> 03:39:49.600]  that in french copyright so even legal sites run by cbs that have nothing but legal stuff on there
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:40:00.080]  and they give you tools to download that isn't allowed in england uh use wiki leaks most worrying
[03:40:00.080 --> 03:40:05.680]  is that the same clause also specifically allows for blocking sites deemed likely to infringe on
[03:40:05.680 --> 03:40:10.240]  copyright so you expose the government document doesn't matter if the government hasn't challenged
[03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:15.440]  it they say that's a government copyright you won't be able to see wiki leaks and this is all
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:21.520]  stated and it goes on and on so people need to stop living in denial meanwhile here's fox news
[03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:28.720]  glenn back last week this is from fox news dot com and it says net neutrality pits free speech
[03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:34.160]  against free press and he used in a straw man argument in this article hundreds of people
[03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:40.720]  that have filed with the fcc and briefs for and against ending net neutrality getting the internet
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:47.440]  as we know it he used one group out of hundreds that's a marxist and says marxist are running this
[03:40:47.440 --> 03:40:55.920]  and we need to get rid of net neutrality meanwhile fox news writes articles and calls homeland
[03:40:55.920 --> 03:41:00.800]  security on me a week and a half ago and because somebody made violent comments on one of my
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:07.040]  message boards we went to fox news and found their own pundits calling for violence against obama
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:11.840]  and and more violent talk all over fox nation needless to say we did not call the feds on
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:17.520]  but uh look they want to shut me down they want to shut you down they want to shut the alternative
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:22.880]  media down mainstream media is getting their butt kicked by the alternative media and rupert
[03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:28.160]  murdoch has said this and they all want to shut down free speech they can't deal with it
[03:41:30.480 --> 03:41:33.440]  here's another one court rules against fcc net neutrality
[03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:46.000]  arrangements and arguments now meanwhile while we have all of this going on here's the wall street
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:53.840]  journal now remember i call it propaganda placement it's not just coca-cola and pepsi and
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:42:02.480]  and warvel red and bocker popcorn ads that are woven into tv shows themselves and into movies
[03:42:03.120 --> 03:42:08.560]  when you when you're watching a movie and you see national guard billboards everywhere
[03:42:08.560 --> 03:42:15.120]  in spider-man or whatever millions were paid for that or on the apprentice millions were paid per
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:22.720]  episode to show virgin atlantic signs it's not just ads during the ads it's ads during the show
[03:42:22.720 --> 03:42:28.400]  that's how all media is now because people glaze over glaze over a lot of the uh you know the breaks
[03:42:29.440 --> 03:42:34.800]  now tens of billions a year are spent on this and i've been telling people about it and congress
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:38.800]  has ruled it's illegal and then the general accounting office has said it's illegal but
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:45.040]  they don't care but now they admit the government is going to be the main advertiser with us tax
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:50.800]  money they're they're moving away from product placement nbc says to pure behavior placement
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:55.520]  placement now i've never seen this term referenced i called it propaganda placement they call it
[03:42:55.520 --> 03:43:01.200]  behavior or i would call it brainwashing placement and it says what your tv is telling you to do
[03:43:01.840 --> 03:43:04.800]  and of course they introduce the fact that you're being propagandized with something that
[03:43:04.800 --> 03:43:12.320]  sounds reasonable recycle exercise eat right but really it's anti-family pro cps anti-second
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:18.880]  amendment pro torture pro surveillance pro corruption you watch any show you'll see it
[03:43:18.880 --> 03:43:23.760]  they're being paid your tax money those shows are financed to brainwash you
[03:43:25.440 --> 03:43:31.280]  in just one and that's mainly because people for the last decade or so don't trust mainstream tv and
[03:43:31.280 --> 03:43:35.680]  all the polls and studies show people trust alternative media even more sometimes i don't
[03:43:35.680 --> 03:43:39.360]  know why i mean there's a lot of garbage in alternative media the government's infiltrated
[03:43:39.360 --> 03:43:45.120]  that they have provocateurs out there but the point is you should be suspect of everything folks
[03:43:45.120 --> 03:43:51.440]  and do research that doesn't mean just be suspect of someone makes a claim go look into it but because
[03:43:51.440 --> 03:43:56.960]  they know you're not really suspect of tv shows and movies that's where the real messages are
[03:44:03.200 --> 03:44:08.560]  and it goes on in just one week on nbc the directives the detectives on law and order
[03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:18.240]  investigated a cash for clunker scam a nurse on mercy organized a group bike ride al gore made a
[03:44:18.240 --> 03:44:25.600]  guest appearance on 30 rock and the office turned right into a cape wearing superhero obsessed with
[03:44:25.600 --> 03:44:30.240]  recycling see it's just all brainwashing for peer pressure run airheads that watch
[03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:36.800]  coincidence hardly now see we we aired the al gore stuff at the time a few months ago and i
[03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:42.720]  said on air i said that is staged that is paid for turns out it is paid for by the government
[03:44:44.400 --> 03:44:50.320]  it's all paid for but now they're saying oh we're going to pretty much except for pharmacy ads and
[03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:54.960]  drug ads we're just even abandoning corporations the government is going to fund this and remember
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:45:00.240]  the FCC had a few weeks ago said we're going to have government messages and government broadcast
[03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:04.800]  systems and government messages and tv they've always had it now they're just going full scale
[03:45:04.800 --> 03:45:10.720]  land of the free home of the brave the tactic general electric codes nbc universal calls it
[03:45:10.720 --> 03:45:15.600]  behavior placement you wonder why every time in football or basketball they make a goal at
[03:45:15.600 --> 03:45:22.880]  that moment of hyten's enjoyment they cut the troops clapping that's meant to say you like
[03:45:22.880 --> 03:45:26.960]  touchdowns you like a basket you like a hole in one troops did it
[03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:36.080]  it miss america says i just want to thank the troops that's paid it's you wonder why miss
[03:45:36.080 --> 03:45:42.480]  america always praises the un has been paid for for 50 years it's all brainwashing and they hand
[03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:47.920]  them their talking points i heard radio ads for austin air force nothing to do with the military
[03:45:49.200 --> 03:45:53.440]  uh this is like 11 years ago we have an access tv show we did my cancel i dig that out and put it
[03:45:53.440 --> 03:45:58.640]  on youtube and they were saying free emissions testing for your cars and all these locations
[03:45:58.640 --> 03:46:02.640]  and if you come to get the emissions testing you know ten dollars or whatever it was off your oil
[03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:07.120]  change so i show up i'll walk over to the head of the austin air force and i said let me guess you
[03:46:07.120 --> 03:46:11.280]  have a federal government grant and this is conditioning to prepare the public for new
[03:46:11.280 --> 03:46:17.840]  taxes and new emissions testing and he said absolutely alex that's the plan he just laughed
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:25.280]  see it's this culture of enjoyment that the public is blind and mindless and mercury's good for me
[03:46:25.280 --> 03:46:32.480]  fluoride's good for me government my friend fellow reserve my friend tv show says so
[03:46:32.480 --> 03:46:37.520]  i see these cartoons countless ones where the kids have microchips where world government's good
[03:46:37.520 --> 03:46:44.640]  where the u n's the savior all paid for going back to captain planet ted turner admits that
[03:46:44.640 --> 03:46:50.160]  that and of course anybody who has a factory is the bad guy that's because the government's
[03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:54.720]  going to shut down anybody's factories that they don't control this is mafia this is a takeover
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:01.920]  the tactic general electric co's nbc universal calls it behavior placement is designed to sway
[03:47:01.920 --> 03:47:07.280]  viewers to adopt actions they see modeled in their favorite shows and it helps sell ads to marketers
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:13.760]  who want to associate their brands with feel good societally aware show no it see this article
[03:47:13.760 --> 03:47:17.280]  itself's deceptive this is all paid for and that's been admitted in congressional reports
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:32.240]  that google paid government paid for news ruled illegal i mean when you see a newscast locally
[03:47:32.240 --> 03:47:36.560]  but it's it airs then in every local affiliate in the country that mercury is now good for
[03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:40.400]  children's brains and has been found to be nutritious i mean that that's a real thing that
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:44.160]  went out from the cbs broadcast center in manhattan i went and looked it up and turned out that
[03:47:44.160 --> 03:47:50.000]  was a government grant cbs was paid money and those it's just a big secret radio and tv stations
[03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:54.880]  the big local marquee station that can put everybody out of business and can't be stopped and has all
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:48:01.040]  the power when you listen to their news and even their news readers don't know this it's all given
[03:48:01.040 --> 03:48:08.000]  to them it's all product placement but when it's government it's propaganda placement or behavior
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:20.400]  placement and on all the shows the cool woman's on prozac and on all the shows the cool woman reports
[03:48:20.400 --> 03:48:25.040]  the homeschoolers next door why aren't they in school the messages homeschooling is illegal
[03:48:25.040 --> 03:48:30.720]  and then always the homeschoolers are bad that's another thing another form of propaganda is on
[03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:35.520]  cops they only show you the guilty they only show you white trash scum and the messages cops good
[03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:40.800]  and clean public all evil all right i said i get to all this other news we're running out of time
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:48.640]  here it's it we live in a total and complete propaganda state and we're one of the few
[03:48:48.640 --> 03:48:56.560]  outfits that's gained any prominence that is effective and so the federal government is coming
[03:48:56.560 --> 03:49:05.840]  in demonizing the internet myself and many others to prepare to curtail it and to shut it down and
[03:49:05.840 --> 03:49:13.600]  my message to all of you out there is the time to wake up and to realize what's happening is here
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:18.880]  okay look it's you're you're never safe when the government's got police and black uniforms and

[03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:31.840]  dollars a month you're never safe when most of the news and tv is paid for government propaganda
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:37.920]  and they don't even tell you that that's not a free society it's not cute and funny it's danger

[03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:43.360]  multimedia transmission and we know there's product placement and propaganda placement
[03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:48.880]  behavior placement as the insiders call it going on in video games video games are now bigger than
[03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:54.720]  movies bigger than tv profit wise and you have some games tens of thousands even hundreds of
[03:54:54.720 --> 03:54:59.120]  thousands of people playing simultaneously the government's tracking what you do tracking your
[03:54:59.120 --> 03:55:06.800]  psychology the choices you make this is a psychological warfare dictatorship that we live in
[03:55:08.720 --> 03:55:13.520]  but half-life two came out a few years ago and i don't play video games but people kept sending
[03:55:13.520 --> 03:55:19.280]  me emails saying your show's like half-life two or it's like metal gear solid or it's like and
[03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:24.560]  i've gone and looked at all these video games now and it's all the government's going to microchip
[03:55:24.560 --> 03:55:29.600]  you they're putting stuff in the water they're brainwashing you they're drugging you a world
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:35.280]  government's coming and people say oh good they're fighting the new world order i've talked to some
[03:55:35.280 --> 03:55:39.440]  of the game developers now and at the grassroots they're fans of the show in fact i've been woven
[03:55:39.440 --> 03:55:44.320]  into quite a few major video games i've even licensed it where they can use clips of my voice
[03:55:44.320 --> 03:55:54.400]  in in some popular games but the issue is that this still just serves the condition everybody
[03:55:54.400 --> 03:56:00.560]  so when i then talk about what's being set up in their plan this brave new world this thx1138 type
[03:56:00.560 --> 03:56:06.160]  society people say oh that's just metal gear solid or that's just half-life two we've got a video
