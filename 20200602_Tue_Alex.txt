[00:00.000 --> 00:17.080]  I can need creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, healing
[00:17.080 --> 00:28.280]  not hatred, justice not chaos, this is our mission and we will succeed, 100 percent we
[00:28.280 --> 00:33.000]  will succeed, our country always wins.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.640]  That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security
[00:39.640 --> 00:42.000]  and safety in America.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.680]  I am mobilizing all available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting
[00:48.680 --> 00:55.520]  and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.000]  including your second amendment rights.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.600]  Therefore the following measures are going into effect immediately.
[01:06.600 --> 01:12.760]  First we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country.
[01:12.760 --> 01:14.800]  We will end it now.
[01:14.800 --> 01:22.680]  Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient
[01:22.680 --> 01:26.960]  numbers that we dominate the streets.
[01:26.960 --> 01:32.240]  Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.360]  has been quelled.
[01:34.360 --> 01:40.640]  If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.120]  of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.560]  problem for them.
[01:49.560 --> 01:57.920]  I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital Washington, D.C.
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.820]  What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace.
[02:02.820 --> 02:10.000]  As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.960]  personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults,
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.760]  and the wanton destruction of property.
[02:22.760 --> 02:29.960]  We are putting everybody on warning our seven o'clock curfew will be strictly enforced.
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.000]  Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained and prosecuted
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.080]  to the fullest extent of the law.
[02:39.080 --> 02:44.760]  I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal
[02:44.760 --> 02:51.360]  penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have now discovered who is delivering bricks to more than 20 cities.
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.000]  It's Acme Brick owned by Berkshire Hathaway and Bill Gates.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.880]  We can't make that up.
[03:03.880 --> 03:06.440]  That is the arrogance that is the Civil War we are in.
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.480]  We are in today, what, 78 of the lockdowns and then now they trigger all these riots
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.720]  and all over Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, they are blocking anybody showing rioters
[03:17.720 --> 03:23.160]  and looters racially attacking white people but also randomly attacking black people,
[03:23.160 --> 03:29.280]  Asians, Hispanics, burning down mainly black businesses because that is the neighborhoods,
[03:29.280 --> 03:31.400]  just total bedlam.
[03:31.400 --> 03:33.440]  And if you try to show it, it is deleted.
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.240]  Tucker Carlson talked about that last night that the media is acting like this is good
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.240]  and this is all peaceful.
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.920]  Remember the MSNBC idiot last Saturday saying, oh, there is nothing violent.
[03:44.920 --> 03:52.880]  This is all very peaceful with a building, a 10 story building behind him in flames.
[03:52.880 --> 04:00.040]  So this is the PSYOP and then when the military ends up killing people, shooting looters,
[04:00.040 --> 04:03.720]  they are going to act like it is another race war crime.
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.640]  It is insane and I got to tell you, I know a lot of people have been robbed in their
[04:07.640 --> 04:10.320]  homes, have been robbed in their cars, have been robbed.
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.400]  I was saying earlier, go out with COVID-19, it is basically a hoax but I will tell everybody
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.320]  now you should not be out after dark in any major urban area and you should be packing
[04:20.320 --> 04:25.840]  and you should be locking your doors and you should be watching your ass because I just
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.640]  learned before I went live that my son was going to visit my parents and there was looters
[04:31.640 --> 04:36.920]  in the store attacking people and he had to kick their ass and we have got that dramatic
[04:36.920 --> 04:37.920]  footage.
[04:37.920 --> 04:38.920]  It is unbelievable.
[04:38.920 --> 04:40.720]  It looks like a movie.
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.760]  So that is how crazy all this is and he didn't even, I guess it happened a few days ago,
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.600]  he didn't even tell me until now because he got the footage from the security camera.
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.200]  I mean that is how bad this is folks.
[04:51.200 --> 04:53.960]  They are robbing two gun shops I go to have been robbed.
[04:53.960 --> 04:55.600]  I mean it is just a total bedlam.
[04:55.600 --> 05:02.040]  We will be right back.
[05:02.040 --> 05:04.640]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back
[05:04.640 --> 05:05.640]  in stock by Krill Oil.
[05:05.640 --> 05:07.080]  We have the ultimate Krill Oil.

[05:31.960 --> 05:34.720]  Both formulas were really close to selling out, real red pill plus, it has got some
[05:34.720 --> 05:36.560]  stimulant in it, natural caffeine.
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.760]  That is close to selling out, 50% off still.
[05:38.760 --> 05:42.680]  Infowarsstore.com and we are already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying
[05:42.680 --> 05:46.960]  we may not take orders in a few months, so I may not ever be able to get products again.
[05:46.960 --> 05:49.000]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.600]  This is total depression.
[05:50.600 --> 06:05.560]  The infrastructure is going down, get the products while you still can.
[06:05.560 --> 06:11.360]  I have been playing air raid sirens for seven months before COVID, before all this because
[06:11.360 --> 06:14.200]  I am telling you they are making their move.
[06:14.200 --> 06:21.240]  We are now under martial law and if we make one wrong step, not just the country but the
[06:21.240 --> 06:26.480]  world is going to plunge into a giant new military conflict.
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.560]  We are at war with China and with collaborators inside the government and multinational corporations.
[06:32.560 --> 06:34.060]  These people are insane.
[06:34.060 --> 06:36.760]  They are not war makers, they don't have the real history behind it.
[06:36.760 --> 06:40.800]  They have gotten away with so many crimes that these corporates believe they can pull
[06:40.800 --> 06:45.080]  this off and not end up getting pulled into the war they start.
[06:45.080 --> 06:47.260]  I assure them they will be pulled into it.
[06:47.260 --> 06:50.920]  Here is the Polk County Sheriff in Florida.
[06:50.920 --> 06:54.480]  Now that the looters are announcing they are going into the suburbs, it has already begun
[06:54.480 --> 06:58.720]  responding that it is the citizens right in duty to defend themselves and he warns the
[06:58.720 --> 06:59.720]  looters.
[06:59.720 --> 07:06.960]  We have received information in social media that some of the criminals were going to take
[07:06.960 --> 07:10.440]  their criminal conduct into the neighborhoods.
[07:10.440 --> 07:16.040]  I would tell them if you value your life you probably shouldn't do that in Polk County
[07:16.040 --> 07:24.120]  because the people of Polk County like guns, they have guns, I encourage them to own guns
[07:24.120 --> 07:29.480]  and they are going to be in their homes tonight with their guns loaded and if you try to break
[07:29.480 --> 07:36.800]  into their homes to steal, to set fires, I am highly recommending they blow you back
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.160]  out of the house with their guns.
[07:40.160 --> 07:47.440]  So leave the community alone and we will do our best to support the community.
[07:47.440 --> 07:51.040]  But ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it.
[07:51.040 --> 07:56.080]  All of that ugliness has taken away from what we are united about.
[07:56.080 --> 08:03.520]  We are united about the conduct that you saw with George where his life was taken with
[08:03.520 --> 08:05.360]  the need of the net.
[08:05.360 --> 08:09.360]  It is horrific and there is not enough words to explain that.
[08:09.360 --> 08:14.960]  Let's keep the focus on that.
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.440]  And the fact that they have now come up with a medical examiner report that he had enough
[08:18.440 --> 08:24.920]  fentanyl in his system to kill four or five people and he was resisting and he was out
[08:24.920 --> 08:28.240]  of control and the police were scared and didn't pay attention and put their knee on
[08:28.240 --> 08:32.440]  his neck and he had a heart attack and died.
[08:32.440 --> 08:35.520]  It's not defending what the cop did, it's not about that.
[08:35.520 --> 08:39.600]  It's about the scyop to create a civil war in this country.
[08:39.600 --> 08:47.200]  It's June 2nd, the year is 2020, on this Tuesday transmission, 153 days out from the election.
[08:47.200 --> 08:54.640]  And all of this is about the globalist corporate system and their testing ground of communist
[08:54.640 --> 09:02.120]  China, their evil anti-human, anti-God laboratory, projecting their power out and punishing us
[09:02.120 --> 09:09.160]  for electing Trump and punishing us for electing Balasaro, Bolsonaro and punishing us for not
[09:09.160 --> 09:13.840]  wanting their new world order and not wanting drag queen pedophile story time.
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.560]  And the Democrats and the globalists and the EU are on record saying this is to punish
[09:18.560 --> 09:20.200]  you.
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.280]  This is to teach you to cut your carbon.
[09:22.280 --> 09:24.440]  This is to teach you that you're bad.
[09:24.440 --> 09:25.440]  This is an atonement.
[09:25.440 --> 09:35.760]  They have three or four purge movies where the whites go out and kill black people every
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.800]  time they have one of these purges.
[09:40.800 --> 09:42.760]  And of course, that's the inverse of what's happening.
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.000]  This is the media going on and telling black people, go out and purge white people, random
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.200]  old lady in a wheelchair, homeless lady, knock her teeth out.
[09:52.200 --> 09:54.760]  White dude walking down the street, kill them.
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.320]  There have been cops more than 10 police shot in the last 24 hours.
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.360]  I can't find one of their names because the media will not humanize them.
[10:03.360 --> 10:05.320]  And it's not about worshiping police.
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.440]  It's about worshiping reality, truth.
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.360]  There's a cop in a coma dying in Vegas right now, randomly shot in the head.
[10:14.360 --> 10:15.960]  They won't show him.
[10:15.960 --> 10:19.680]  They won't say his name because they will not humanize people.
[10:19.680 --> 10:26.440]  But we all know George Floyd's name, clearly a drug dealer, clearly involved in the rackets,
[10:26.440 --> 10:33.440]  clearly involved with those cops that knew him in some weird behavior.
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.240]  Dropping a white baggie out of his pocket when they've got him in handcuffs, he's fishing
[10:38.240 --> 10:39.240]  it out.
[10:39.240 --> 10:42.160]  And we exclusively broke that footage yesterday.
[10:42.160 --> 10:43.440]  Everybody knows it's there.
[10:43.440 --> 10:46.760]  Not one outlet covered it because that's not politically correct.
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.480]  And it's not defending it, it's showing the craziness we're all involved in.
[10:52.480 --> 10:57.000]  And now the medical examiner comes out and he had overdose levels of fentanyl, the chai
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  com weapon.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.960]  Oh, but nobody cares about the chai com weapon killing hundreds of thousands of people a
[11:02.960 --> 11:03.960]  year.
[11:03.960 --> 11:06.160]  Black, white, old, young.
[11:06.160 --> 11:10.120]  It's all just about, oh, the cop kills him, he begs for his life.
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.880]  It's very poignant.
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.520]  But Facebook, Twitter, Google are removing videos of white people being beaten and being
[11:18.520 --> 11:24.600]  killed and being shot and racist black people programmed by the media to do this.
[11:24.600 --> 11:28.760]  Do I then blame all black people that, oh, there's some racist black people out there
[11:28.760 --> 11:30.240]  that are idiots?
[11:30.240 --> 11:33.200]  No, because I'm not a moron myself.
[11:33.200 --> 11:35.440]  It goes back to Martin Luther King.
[11:35.440 --> 11:38.320]  You judge somebody on who they are.
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.960]  Now, there are so many of these videos, but I just want to get to these now.
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.320]  Two of the seven or eight I've already seen this morning of black people all over the
[11:47.320 --> 11:54.680]  United States coming up to looters in Texas and Minnesota and Illinois and going, oh,
[11:54.680 --> 12:01.480]  it's a bunch of fancy pants, anti for girls, college girls, probably college professors
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.920]  wearing their Rolexes.
[12:02.920 --> 12:03.920]  You name it.
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.320]  They literally are very wealthy on average, and this is them going out and getting their
[12:08.320 --> 12:14.240]  military experience, this is them going out to piss on America and the black people are
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.360]  walking up saying, hey, why are you putting black lives matter on these businesses and
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.360]  knocking the windows out?
[12:19.360 --> 12:22.600]  You're just, you're doing that to try to stir people up and we've got the videos all over
[12:22.600 --> 12:23.600]  the country.
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.400]  Antifa goes up and knocks the first windows out at the Louis Vuitton or the other luxury
[12:27.400 --> 12:33.440]  shop and then gets the black teenagers that are out on the street to go in and do it.
[12:33.440 --> 12:41.040]  And that's what's in these Homeland Security documents and these reports right here.
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.280]  Remember two years ago?
[12:44.280 --> 12:49.920]  Remember Brian Stelter and CNN and ABC News saying Alex Jones is insane?
[12:49.920 --> 12:55.480]  Alex Jones says that there's a planned uprising by Antifa and trying to cause a race war.
[12:55.480 --> 12:56.480]  Remember all those clips?
[12:56.480 --> 12:58.480]  Maybe our archives can find them.
[12:58.480 --> 13:07.360]  I probably said it 500 times and I was going off their own action plans, their own documents
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.880]  where Alexander Soros funds hundreds of millions of dollars a year to try to cause race wars
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.240]  and how they train the Antifa to go smash buildings and then encourage blacks to join
[13:17.240 --> 13:18.400]  them.
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.200]  Literally preying on black people like they're stupid trying to trick them.
[13:22.200 --> 13:25.680]  This isn't about defending black people because they're doing it, it's wrong and it's terrible.
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.200]  The point is, is that here you want to indict somebody, Attorney General Barr?
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.440]  You want to have the proof of the criminal conspiracy?
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.160]  Here it is, open and shut, run as a military action plan.
[13:39.160 --> 13:46.720]  With an HQ and commanders and radios and codes, these are professional criminals.
[13:46.720 --> 13:49.480]  No need to charge them with terrorism even though that's what they're doing politically
[13:49.480 --> 13:55.440]  trying to shut down our speech, threatening us, they're engaged in organized crime racketeering.
[13:55.440 --> 13:58.600]  They should all spend 50 years in prison.
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.360]  This is, people are dying because of this and these swarmy academics believe they rule
[14:03.360 --> 14:08.240]  America with their arrogance so they can dress up in black uniforms and go out and target
[14:08.240 --> 14:12.800]  black people to get them to go commit crimes to create a race war.
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.080]  Let me tell you, there are a lot of mentally ill people folks.
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.800]  Mentally ill black people, I've been downtown this morning, driving around, looking at what's
[14:20.800 --> 14:21.800]  happening.
[14:21.800 --> 14:28.320]  There's a lot of mentally ill, homeless, white, Hispanic and black zombies going around crazy
[14:28.320 --> 14:34.480]  and they are attacking people and it's just bedlam.
[14:34.480 --> 14:40.680]  So full page New York Times articles, advertisements, calling for overthrow in the government, triggering
[14:40.680 --> 14:42.560]  a race war.
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.640]  And they literally came out in the national news when I said this and said, Jones is
[14:45.640 --> 14:52.680]  insane, it doesn't exist, it's not happening.
[14:52.680 --> 14:55.640]  So here's the document you need to send to the White House and send to the Attorney General
[14:55.640 --> 14:56.640]  and send to the FBI.
[14:56.640 --> 15:00.480]  They say they know all this, you got FBI agents, it turns out they're in, they're running
[15:00.480 --> 15:01.480]  it.
[15:01.480 --> 15:06.240]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore and this is the blueprint
[15:06.240 --> 15:07.480]  for the whole damn thing.
[15:07.480 --> 15:13.040]  With the documents and they have fought like the devil and Soros has funded all these lawsuits
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.640]  and all these dirty tricks to get us off the air, that's why I show you this every week.
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.440]  Where they go, what cops are in on it with them, how the police captains have already
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.200]  organized where they're allowed to stage stuff to try to trick the black people, it actually
[15:26.200 --> 15:27.480]  says it into doing it.
[15:27.480 --> 15:30.880]  This is sick man, this is sick.
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.120]  This is the blueprint for the crime and they're doing it.
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.680]  So when we come back, we've got folks catching them including one of the top UFC fighters
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.280]  in the world, John Jones, going up and catching a bunch of chicken-necked white people trying
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.880]  to trick black folks into rioting and looting and he just takes this rake and paint cans
[15:48.880 --> 15:50.360]  away from him.
[15:50.360 --> 15:58.840]  Unbelievable, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[15:58.840 --> 16:03.720]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago,
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.360]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus, I'm worried
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.600]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.120]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches
[16:16.120 --> 16:18.960]  across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[16:18.960 --> 16:22.720]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it but with the election
[16:22.720 --> 16:27.280]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[16:27.280 --> 16:32.600]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[16:32.600 --> 16:37.160]  They're easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked
[16:37.160 --> 16:39.160]  off to be ready and it funds the InfoWars.

[17:59.600 --> 18:15.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:15.760 --> 18:21.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[18:21.760 --> 18:30.880]  Let me just get this out of the way as a declaration, and again, everything we talk
[18:30.880 --> 18:35.960]  about here is very important, but if we could highlight this and have red neon on it, that
[18:35.960 --> 18:36.960]  would be good.
[18:36.960 --> 18:39.400]  Maybe some fireworks going off behind it.
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.440]  I think everybody understands now we can't live in peace with Democrats and leftists
[18:44.440 --> 18:46.840]  and the pedophiles and the devil worshipers.
[18:46.840 --> 18:53.600]  They have a hunger to conquer us because they don't have anything inside, and they're always
[18:53.600 --> 18:59.360]  trying to create a cataclysm or a crisis out of which they get power, and they've done
[18:59.360 --> 19:02.880]  it in Russia, and they did it in Nazi Germany, and they've done it in China, and it's the
[19:02.880 --> 19:08.400]  very same group of megabanks that financed the great wars of Napoleon and the British
[19:08.400 --> 19:09.400]  that are behind it.
[19:09.400 --> 19:15.160]  It's the Rothschilds 100 percent, and the Rothschilds are just the scum of the planet.
[19:15.160 --> 19:20.120]  It's the worst people you could ever imagine, and they're absolutely bloodthirsty.
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.960]  That doesn't mean all Rothschilds are, but the head Rothschild group, and the Rockefellers,
[19:24.960 --> 19:27.720]  and just all the names you know, it's them, man.
[19:27.720 --> 19:34.920]  They are just cold, blooded killers, and they're funding a giant anti-human agenda.
[19:34.920 --> 19:36.000]  It's beyond racism.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.760]  It's just death.
[19:37.760 --> 19:38.920]  It's a satanic agenda.
[19:38.920 --> 19:41.360]  Kill, still, and destroy.
[19:41.360 --> 19:44.960]  And the names mean nothing, and they run the Catholic Church now.
[19:44.960 --> 19:49.520]  The globalists have got all the major players in place, and so they're making their world
[19:49.520 --> 19:55.520]  government move, and we're in a lot of trouble.
[19:55.520 --> 19:58.960]  And so denying this is only going to make things worse.
[19:58.960 --> 20:01.520]  We're going into planetary shutdown.
[20:01.520 --> 20:05.960]  The depression is already going to be really, really bad in the third world, very bad here.
[20:05.960 --> 20:09.560]  I don't know if they can turn things back on, and they don't want it turned back on.
[20:09.560 --> 20:12.440]  You started realizing that COVID-19 was a giant fraud.
[20:12.440 --> 20:16.680]  The German government's internal reports, the Interior Ministry said it's all regular
[20:16.680 --> 20:17.880]  deaths were being attributed.
[20:17.880 --> 20:18.880]  We have the same amount of deaths.
[20:18.880 --> 20:25.600]  This is a bad pneumonia, but it's man-made, so the gates in them can own it.
[20:25.600 --> 20:26.600]  It's sick.
[20:26.600 --> 20:27.680]  They don't care.
[20:27.680 --> 20:29.520]  They're making their move.
[20:29.520 --> 20:31.640]  They're all in because they're slaves.
[20:31.640 --> 20:34.880]  Gates is a slave to this evil force.
[20:34.880 --> 20:39.520]  And so let me just say this.
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.480]  Everyone else wants to be a follower.
[20:41.480 --> 20:47.080]  All these big police departments and governors are bowing to the looters.
[20:47.080 --> 20:51.520]  All these corporate systems are doing it because they were all put in place because they followed
[20:51.520 --> 20:52.920]  the corporates' directives.
[20:52.920 --> 20:54.080]  They're always sounded good.
[20:54.080 --> 20:58.320]  It sounded reasonable to get them over and over again to agree to what came into their
[20:58.320 --> 21:02.960]  inbox from the organizations and political groups that control them.
[21:02.960 --> 21:11.440]  And so now they followed their orders so many times to do bad things that they are ready
[21:11.440 --> 21:15.000]  to bow, just like in the old Superman movie, to Zod.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.920]  In fact, can you guys cue that promo up for next segment?
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.280]  It's about submission to Islam, to all of it.
[21:22.280 --> 21:24.720]  And the cops are like, sure, I'm a confident good guy.
[21:24.720 --> 21:27.160]  My chief tells me to bow to some black people.
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.920]  But when you're bowing, you're not bowing to say I'm in solidarity.
[21:29.920 --> 21:30.920]  How about you shake somebody's hand?
[21:30.920 --> 21:32.400]  How about you get a cup of coffee with somebody?
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.760]  Or a bottle of barbecue?
[21:33.760 --> 21:34.760]  No.
[21:34.760 --> 21:41.320]  Instead, what you're doing is bowing to say you're bad, you're guilty of something because
[21:41.320 --> 21:45.520]  of the color of your skin, the inverse of what Martin Luther King said.
[21:45.520 --> 21:51.560]  This is so racist, so evil, so backward, so bad, and it's a war on Christianity and a
[21:51.560 --> 21:56.360]  war on the abolition movement, and it's a war to make us all tribal and kill each other.
[21:56.360 --> 22:01.880]  Because let me tell you, while controlled groups are bowing and saying I'm bad, I'm
[22:01.880 --> 22:10.040]  sorry I'm lying, because of what another white person did, or didn't do, you are greenlighting
[22:10.040 --> 22:13.240]  this idea where everything is based on what color somebody is.
[22:13.240 --> 22:19.640]  It is unspeakably dangerous, unspeakably evil.
[22:19.640 --> 22:24.640]  So when you submit to a leftist in any way, at a job or at college or anywhere, when you
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.480]  give them your money, when you support Nike, when you support the chai comms, you might
[22:29.480 --> 22:34.760]  as well just cut your fingers off or stab yourself in the eye, or cut your balls off
[22:34.760 --> 22:38.040]  because that's what they're coming for is everything.
[22:38.040 --> 22:41.640]  The globalists do care about black people, they want to kill them, that's their favorite
[22:41.640 --> 22:48.920]  group, that's their testing group, and the very globalists that have been hammering Africans
[22:48.920 --> 22:55.040]  all over the world and doing a number on them psychologically as the beta tests are now
[22:55.040 --> 23:01.280]  saying they represent them while they lead them like a pied piper into the river to drown.
[23:01.280 --> 23:05.360]  I for one am not going to be part of this evil, and I declare total war on the new world
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.600]  order and all their systems and any leftist I see, any trendy, I love it when they open
[23:10.600 --> 23:13.560]  their mouth in a restaurant, I love it when they try to intimidate me, in fact when I
[23:13.560 --> 23:15.880]  just see them now I get in their face, just everywhere.
[23:15.880 --> 23:26.160]  I'm done, I'm not playing any games with any of these people because they are the enemy.
[23:26.160 --> 23:30.760]  You want to see incendiary footage folks, I've got 50 videos of white people being shot,
[23:30.760 --> 23:34.120]  killed, beaten, tortured, I'm not even really getting into all those, because I'm not even
[23:34.120 --> 23:38.400]  trying to inflame people, I'm trying to get folks to understand that above all this is
[23:38.400 --> 23:42.560]  an orchestrated group, there's an article in M4 saying there's some group orchestrating
[23:42.560 --> 23:49.080]  this, yeah we know, Soros and the Rothschilds are on record doing it.
[23:49.080 --> 23:57.280]  I've got all their battle documents, just like I've got the man that died in Minnesota,
[23:57.280 --> 24:02.600]  George Floyd on video, dropping what looks like fentanyl out of his pocket, and we got
[24:02.600 --> 24:07.480]  it all at band.video, but the only way this truth gets out is when you tell the truth,
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.880]  well here's video you're not going to see on CNN or MSNBC, in fact they're taking this
[24:10.880 --> 24:16.520]  off everywhere, there's a whole bunch of these videos, black protesters catch white
[24:16.520 --> 24:46.480]  anti-famembers red handed, here it is.
[24:46.480 --> 25:07.680]  All
[25:07.680 --> 25:14.240]  brainwashed their local college with their little pink purses, alright let's go ahead
[25:14.240 --> 25:19.800]  and go to this video, this is the heavyweight champion of the world, UFC, John Jones, and
[25:19.800 --> 25:22.440]  he didn't put this out himself, he didn't want the attention, he saw people looting
[25:22.440 --> 25:28.800]  his town and burning up and attacking black white storage units, spray painting, he said
[25:28.800 --> 25:56.240]  you're not doing that, here it is, Albuquerque, this is Albuquerque, New Mexico, so he's
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.080]  out there covering the protests, looking at it, he's interested, he sees white meth
[26:00.080 --> 26:05.160]  ads, and I just, it's the truth mania, when I was down there this weekend and they were
[26:05.160 --> 26:08.680]  attacking our armored vehicle with an O and attacking me and throwing bottles at me and
[26:08.680 --> 26:14.800]  steel rods that went right about my head, they were trying to kill me, it was all glow
[26:14.800 --> 26:17.640]  in the darks what my dad calls them, white people that never go out can almost have
[26:17.640 --> 26:21.200]  a green skin, and they all looked all messed out and they'd like get out of their cars
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.440]  and go I'll beat your ass, I mean I could literally take on a hundred of them, and I'm
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.480]  not, I mean I'm seriously just, literally as much as I could punch them or just kick
[26:29.480 --> 26:33.240]  them, knock them over, I mean if I'd have got out, I'm not bragging, I probably could
[26:33.240 --> 26:39.040]  have killed twenty of them, but there he is, and that's what these people are, it's truly
[26:39.040 --> 26:43.040]  disgusting ladies and gentlemen, and then you've always got the token black guy there
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.320]  with their black lives matter thing, I mean these people are idiots, they have no idea
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.680]  what's going to happen if they actually breach that vehicle and got in there, I mean there
[26:50.680 --> 26:54.480]  were a bunch of trained killers inside, we'll be right back stay with us.
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.320]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[26:59.320 --> 27:05.440]  will last five years, and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.160]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.280]  to have a list of ten people that you visit and if you go outside that list of ten you'll
[27:15.280 --> 27:21.120]  be permanently detained, yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let
[27:21.120 --> 27:25.600]  the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.440]  you are now non-essential and a prisoner, from the beginning of my research it was clear
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.800]  the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group, they have to put this electronic straight
[27:36.800 --> 27:42.280]  jacket on us before they carry out their end game which is global depopulation, so you
[27:42.280 --> 27:48.840]  see submitting to them is death, the only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate
[27:48.840 --> 27:54.840]  their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy, wake up or die.
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.600]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to Latin America was the
[27:59.600 --> 28:05.080]  most common form of government, you had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen
[28:05.080 --> 28:11.000]  sitting on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.160]  for control, in fact in most cultures they called the peasants the little people because
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.640]  they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them
[28:21.640 --> 28:27.360]  again at a starving level, they were so busy trying to survive they would never try to
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.760]  challenge the entrenched elite, well now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.120]  and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezos is the world, they are sitting back on their giant
[28:36.120 --> 28:42.640]  estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life, laughing at you shut
[28:42.640 --> 28:49.000]  down, going bankrupt in the third world starving to death, their religion is power and control
[28:49.000 --> 28:55.280]  and they are pressing that advantage against us, we must break free from these monsters.
[28:55.280 --> 29:00.280]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[29:00.280 --> 29:06.400]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression, in fact we are already into the worldwide
[29:06.400 --> 29:10.880]  depression and the death sentence for the third world, but it's critical to understand
[29:10.880 --> 29:17.000]  that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be, a month of shutdown
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.640]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy, that's why
[29:21.640 --> 29:25.560]  we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self sufficient
[29:25.560 --> 29:30.840]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control,
[29:30.840 --> 29:36.760]  they've admitted all of this, so remember how does infowars continue years and decades
[29:36.760 --> 29:41.760]  in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen because we're following
[29:41.760 --> 29:47.040]  the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary,
[29:47.040 --> 29:51.480]  but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary, it's time
[29:51.480 --> 29:58.120]  to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[29:58.120 --> 30:26.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:26.520 --> 30:33.000]  You are not the president, no one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[30:33.000 --> 30:56.440]  I'm the man they're protecting, I'm the president.
[30:56.440 --> 31:01.640]  Dealing is not a symbol of solidarity, hands shaking, but Fauci says, the UN says don't
[31:01.640 --> 31:02.640]  ever do that again.
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.920]  You can't trust each other up behind glass barriers, can't go outside, but if you want
[31:07.920 --> 31:12.040]  to go out and riot and hurt a white person, well then it's virtuous because you know America
[31:12.040 --> 31:18.880]  is evil and this is a Marxist movement with a bunch of Harvard billionaires, Nike famously
[31:18.880 --> 31:23.600]  had the worst wet shops in the world, slave camps, now Apple has topped them with suicide
[31:23.600 --> 31:30.600]  nets and forced abortions and 18-hour work days, but again Tim Cook is effeminate and
[31:30.600 --> 31:34.440]  literally just goes around going I'm gay, I'm gay, seriously, he goes gay, gay, gay,
[31:34.440 --> 31:38.360]  I'm gonna go oh god you're gay, it's okay, you're on death camps, that's all this is
[31:38.360 --> 31:44.640]  is a cover, I have death camps but that's all this is folks, that's why Gates wears
[31:44.640 --> 31:49.880]  a pink sweater, oh look pink sweater, it's like John D. Rockefeller the first would hand
[31:49.880 --> 31:54.560]  out dimes to people and oh I'm your friend, let me hand you dimes, you all get something
[31:54.560 --> 32:03.120]  free, patronizing and so we sit here and we watch this and our country's flooded with
[32:03.120 --> 32:07.920]  drugs and flooded with propaganda and flooded with evil culture and things are just breaking
[32:07.920 --> 32:13.080]  down and people are lazy and stupid, old, young, black, white, we are a fallen country
[32:13.080 --> 32:18.640]  that's drunk on the blood of 62 million dead babies we've aborted and now it's all over
[32:18.640 --> 32:25.800]  the news like oh the most human like mouse ever and you look at it and it's a little
[32:25.800 --> 32:32.080]  human and they're just going yeah we made human mice, oh and we've got, remember just
[32:32.080 --> 32:37.520]  five years ago, Jones is insane, it doesn't exist, now it's like oh yeah we're gene editing
[32:37.520 --> 32:44.560]  babies and we've got a mouse, it's 80% human, oh but it doesn't have any rights, we medically
[32:44.560 --> 32:49.720]  test on it, like I meant to cover that, you could put a little human face on the mouse
[32:49.720 --> 32:55.320]  and it's now just a kind of, just a side issue you know because you know George Floyd,
[32:55.320 --> 33:01.600]  he died and there it is, human mouse hybrid hailed by top scientists is the most human
[33:01.600 --> 33:06.360]  yet and they keep the chimeras stuff quiet but you can actually find the photos put up
[33:06.360 --> 33:10.760]  by some of the research labs and man is it scary, in fact put that up, notice it's called
[33:10.760 --> 33:19.840]  chimeras, there they are, integrate developing mouse embryos and generate functional cells
[33:19.840 --> 33:33.040]  in mice, the postnatal mice, oh but George Floyd bombed out of his brain on fentanyl,
[33:33.040 --> 33:44.680]  died and so, oh four cop shot in St. Louis, Vegas cop on live support, brain dead, other
[33:44.680 --> 33:48.560]  cop shot but it's like oh that's a cop, we're not gonna show them bleeding to death, we're
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.760]  not gonna show them dead, we're just gonna show you George Floyd and then if you try
[33:53.760 --> 34:01.520]  to show the cops getting shot, Twitter and Facebook and Google, they all take it down
[34:01.520 --> 34:05.720]  and then as society breaks down and the dogs come out and the military comes out, oh the
[34:05.720 --> 34:13.520]  media is like oh the military is attacking its white people, to bring the country down,
[34:13.520 --> 34:17.400]  to destroy your prosperity, to destroy your future, America is fighting for its life,
[34:17.400 --> 34:25.240]  this is a chai-com globalist directed attack, here let's play this lady, bowling to black
[34:25.240 --> 34:31.080]  lives matter funded by Soros, funded by Nike, funded by Jeff Bezos on record, the guys that
[34:31.080 --> 34:36.360]  actually own slave factories where people are like locked up in containers at night,
[34:36.360 --> 34:39.800]  where if a woman gets pregnant they force abort, I mean you're talking about prisoners
[34:39.800 --> 34:45.920]  but it's like oh but Jeff Bezos is at an eye that points to the wrong direction so it's
[34:45.920 --> 34:55.640]  okay and you've got people living off the fumes of America, one of the most open free
[34:55.640 --> 35:01.040]  countries the world's ever seen and boy everybody's about to get a taste, if America goes down
[35:01.040 --> 35:07.400]  they're going to beg and plead for it to come back but it won't because you're a real slave
[35:07.400 --> 35:16.280]  now and all the commies and all the people that one got two or three degrees that can't
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.440]  get a job but are told once we overthrow America you'll have a job in the new economy they
[35:20.440 --> 35:27.080]  won't have a job or it won't be paid but at least they'll be able to kick us around and
[35:27.080 --> 35:31.200]  believe me when I go out these events you see them they go we're going to take over
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.560]  we're going to arrest you we're going to kill your ass no that won't be you my friend you'll
[35:36.560 --> 35:45.560]  be the first people that are gotten rid of I'll be put on a private jet and flown in

[35:51.320 --> 35:57.480]  while you're in a death camp dumbass but then I'll say no and I'll get killed on the spot
[35:57.480 --> 36:02.360]  that's how it really works dumbasses the globalists don't collect you like baseball
[36:02.360 --> 36:07.920]  cards they collect people like me like baseball cards they want me to join the new world order
[36:07.920 --> 36:14.120]  because I have value you don't have value in their eyes you're what they call a useless

[41:21.840 --> 41:26.280]  real state of the world not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the
[41:26.280 --> 41:31.040]  council on bond relations the builder burden group the Davos group and other globalists
[41:31.040 --> 41:37.240]  we're pushing for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans
[41:37.240 --> 41:43.040]  for humans by humans not a world where the establishment hate themselves project their
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.640]  hate onto us and decide we're gonna have a post human world really excited to know that

[42:07.040 --> 42:14.880]  future of humanity and now open world government is being established with an in game to depopulate
[42:14.880 --> 42:21.880]  the planet now the internal operations of the globalist are being externalized you must
[42:21.880 --> 42:27.840]  decide which side you're on living in denial having mass doc syndrome learned up with us
[42:27.840 --> 42:34.040]  will only deliver you into misery destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual
[42:34.040 --> 42:40.760]  death we're talking about not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars
[42:40.760 --> 42:46.160]  was correct about it all we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are
[42:46.160 --> 42:52.040]  aware of the new order decide to join it out of fear they are truly we must fight this
[42:52.040 --> 42:59.080]  or lose our souls the united states is not communist china we don't have three million
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.720]  people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents
[43:04.720 --> 43:11.400]  and sell their organs but all of the news we see you in billable indigates WHO mainstream
[43:11.400 --> 43:16.880]  corporate media raising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.440]  women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people
[43:21.440 --> 43:25.640]  well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws
[43:25.640 --> 43:30.440]  saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's calling
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.800]  it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are going
[43:35.800 --> 43:40.120]  to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are
[43:40.120 --> 43:46.280]  exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at band on video and info wars dot com
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.880]  spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their
[43:50.880 --> 43:59.920]  operation that much quicker you're listening to the alex jones show
[43:59.920 --> 44:28.680]  welcome back we have massive news breaking and info wars dot com that is so critical
[44:28.680 --> 44:33.520]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones the globalist are always about titrating the
[44:33.520 --> 44:39.000]  dose of the poison you can take cobra poison or other snake poison and slowly build up
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.040]  the amount of your system till you become quasi immune to it you can take a much bigger
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.200]  dose that would kill a normal person but see the weather psychology works the globalist
[44:47.200 --> 44:51.680]  personally have told me in one conversation i've talked about quite a bit that you don't
[44:51.680 --> 44:59.280]  get it jones the public adapts to enslavement and so instead of the titrated dose going
[44:59.280 --> 45:06.000]  up making them resist it makes them submit and so all the censorship all the control
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.080]  now in the browsers in the private text messages which means they're surveilling you but that's
[45:12.080 --> 45:20.920]  totally illegal separate from the censorship now apple that has three million weavers in
[45:20.920 --> 45:26.360]  china many of them in death camps mainstream news admits that they're making components
[45:26.360 --> 45:32.440]  for iphones and then in mainland china or in the heart of china old china as they call
[45:32.440 --> 45:38.440]  it you have slavery going on and suicide nets and forced drugging and just stuff beyond
[45:38.440 --> 45:46.080]  any nightmare you've ever imagined and now in solidarity to push this it's not just
[45:46.080 --> 45:52.960]  nike and amazon virtue signaling as they get looted apple freezes browser feature of music
[45:52.960 --> 46:03.240]  app and replaces it with f the police playlist from nwa so yeah that was fun to listen to
[46:03.240 --> 46:09.080]  when i was 12 years old too the point is is that this is a mega corporation super cold
[46:09.080 --> 46:16.080]  blooded scientifically taking over the planet and they want you to believe that they're the
[46:16.080 --> 46:22.000]  super cool trendies that you know f the police and and what does the f the police mean it
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.520]  means local elected government this is a global technotronic technocracy coming in like a
[46:28.520 --> 46:34.400]  giant alien mothership blocking out the sun over our cities and it's like i will teach
[46:34.400 --> 46:42.160]  you to be free kill your police overthrow and burn your infrastructure because america was
[46:42.160 --> 46:49.160]  deep into the new world order the chinese century was here and we said no actually we
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.960]  don't want to jump in the oven we don't want to jump in the wood chipper we don't want
[46:53.960 --> 47:00.200]  to go bye bye and so they went oh you're russian agents because they're the globalists that
[47:00.200 --> 47:04.120]  want to say no borders no wall no usa at all they're the ones that say get rid of the country
[47:04.120 --> 47:08.360]  they're the ones that say america is permanently broken and it's over all over the news we're
[47:08.360 --> 47:14.280]  depressed we're done it's all over and anybody that signs on to this is going into real slavery
[47:14.280 --> 47:21.920]  i don't care what color you are so now obama's national security advisor has climbed out from
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.720]  under a rock after 78 days of having his lockdown under marshal law in a bizarre claim a rock
[47:28.720 --> 47:33.840]  obama's former national security advisor susan rice said that the rioting and violence being
[47:33.840 --> 47:40.560]  witnessed in major cities is right out of the russian playbook she then goes on to say
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.480]  that the russians are doing this with no proof after locking our government up for three
[47:44.480 --> 47:49.000]  years with russia gatecraft they're back it's not the democrat governors it's not the democrat
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.160]  police chiefs like art ace of eight is saying how dare you be mean to brown people it's our
[47:53.160 --> 48:03.040]  country the whites are the enemy i mean whoa in houston oh it's not the virtues signaling
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.080]  it's not the media with all the race war movies none of that no no no it's not anti-fuck burning
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.320]  down the homeless camp it's alex jones why you see it all to the news no proof they just
[48:12.320 --> 48:18.160]  say i did it because they're going for a broke because we're loyal americans that care about
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.800]  everybody and just want justice and freedom and we're christian and so susan rice climbs
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.800]  out from under her rock obviously always drugged out of her damn mind just a front person for
[48:27.800 --> 48:36.880]  these people and she's saying the russians the russians the chinese government is praising
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.880]  the rioters the chinese government is all over twitter not being fact checked the iranian
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.160]  government but the president's being banned and we just sit here while the president can't
[48:47.160 --> 48:51.120]  communicate in modern communication systems and we're totally shut down except for your
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.760]  word of mouth ball moves down the field when you share the link at bandot video the power
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.520]  you've got the power to destroy them now and when are you going to wake up that it's not
[49:01.520 --> 49:09.760]  kansas anymore that it's not a game this is real info wars is real you're real i'm real
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.200]  and now that they've destabilized and trumps got to launch the troops he knows they're
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.960]  setting him up the troops are going to kill some people that's what they do and now it's
[49:17.960 --> 49:27.800]  going to be oh trump marshal law when he didn't want the marshal law and they made him instituted
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.800]  you're going to look back folks if we lose this and you're going to wish to hell you
[49:32.800 --> 49:37.880]  spread the word you got involved now all the candy ass churches everybody on the fence
[49:37.880 --> 49:46.160]  god said you were hot nor cold i spit you out of my mouth get off the fence get off the
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.280]  pot man take a dump or get off of it but i'm here to tell you ladies and gentlemen you're
[49:51.280 --> 49:57.280]  getting bolshevik revolution right now and they're going to put you in a camp and they're
[49:57.280 --> 50:01.480]  going to torture the living hell out of you because that's all these people want to do
[50:01.480 --> 50:08.920]  is gouge your eyeballs out and as soon as you figure that out you're going to grow up
[50:08.920 --> 50:13.560]  but boy everybody knows why we got guns and that's the good part about it is we're not
[50:13.560 --> 50:17.280]  like the poor russians or the poor chinese that were surfed before who didn't really
[50:17.280 --> 50:21.520]  have a long history of being free and who were always being attacked by outside forces
[50:21.520 --> 50:28.040]  so they never got their own solidarity this place still has an armed camp and we still
[50:28.040 --> 50:32.360]  know what's going on and so i got news for the new world order you better run your asses
[50:32.360 --> 50:39.120]  to switzerland and new zealand and kawaii hawaii because you're going to fail and you can
[50:39.120 --> 50:44.680]  launch and try to get everybody else zuckerberg and and tim cook to go kill people and kill
[50:44.680 --> 50:48.560]  the cops and all that happens to the government break down and bow to you and kneel to you
[50:48.560 --> 50:55.400]  it's not going to happen and i assure you that you're going to pay severely for what
[50:55.400 --> 51:00.640]  you've done and bill gates is going to pay severely for what he's done and warth roth
[51:00.640 --> 51:07.760]  child is going to pay severely for what you've done you're politically defeated and i think
[51:07.760 --> 51:11.400]  you know that that's why you're trying to overturn everything and overturn the chess
[51:11.400 --> 51:16.200]  board but there could be one percent of thinking people you're still going to lose it's more
[51:16.200 --> 51:20.760]  like thirty percent now and the word spreading really fast your whole covid blew up in your
[51:20.760 --> 51:26.560]  face so the big question i got asked listeners is what is their next fiasco mass shootings
[51:26.560 --> 51:34.240]  race war maybe a stronger bio weapon economic collapse physical war with china over taiwan
[51:34.240 --> 51:40.560]  hong kong assassination of the president i mean anything could happen right now get
[51:40.560 --> 51:46.040]  ready folks you're not in a normal period anymore the games are over you're as helpless
[51:46.040 --> 51:50.120]  as a baby in their mother's womb when that planned parenthood death operator is coming
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.200]  to kill unless you start speaking out that you sit there like a baby in the womb that
[51:55.200 --> 51:59.160]  baby didn't have a chance to fight you've got a chance to fight are you going to fight
[51:59.160 --> 52:04.480]  or are you going to sit there and kiss ass all day so here's susan rice looking like
[52:04.480 --> 52:12.320]  she's loaded like a freight train flying like an aeroplane telling us that the russians
[52:12.320 --> 52:18.200]  are the ones doing it when the own damn channel she's on pushing the thing here it is we've
[52:18.200 --> 52:24.600]  come to try to hijack those protests and turn them into something very different and they
[52:24.600 --> 52:29.960]  are probably also i would bet based on my experience i'm not reading the intelligence
[52:29.960 --> 52:35.280]  today or these days but based on my experience this is right out of the russian playbook
[52:35.280 --> 52:41.320]  as well but we can't allow the extremists the foreign actors to distract from the real
[52:41.320 --> 52:46.920]  problems we have in this country that are longstanding centuries old and need to be
[52:46.920 --> 52:51.680]  addressed responsibly by new so these are all cia leftist foundation folks that they're
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.760]  sociologists they just anthropologists and they look at the culture they play it off
[52:55.760 --> 53:01.000]  against each other what what a sickening evil woman who supports radical islam all the rest
[53:01.000 --> 53:06.800]  of it she's a dirt bag she's an elitist she loves playing people off she loves the public
[53:06.800 --> 53:13.280]  not being informed and then she just goes on into how the russians are running everything
[53:13.280 --> 53:17.120]  that's all she's got because she's the globalist she's the anti-american she's the person
[53:17.120 --> 53:22.840]  who wants to get rid of the country she's the enemy so she's all the russians are doing
[53:22.840 --> 53:30.560]  all this you're doing it rice and we all know it you dirty piece of crap you got to deal
[53:30.560 --> 53:41.560]  with god though you ugly witch okay this apple thing though is unbelievable folks info wars.com
[53:41.560 --> 53:45.520]  and i went and checked it they've literally hijacked the browsers of the of the apple
[53:45.520 --> 53:51.160]  app that over a hundred million people last time i checked out and are playing kill the

[53:57.080 --> 54:02.400]  cops why while the biggest corporation in the world told me to the don't slave camps
[54:02.400 --> 54:07.080]  yes sir tim cook and trumps up there with cushioner telling him tim cooks his friend
[54:07.080 --> 54:13.640]  you know apple is a technocracy stuff doesn't happen unless tim cooks says it tim cooks said
[54:13.640 --> 54:18.480]  two years ago in beijing he said i want to help you censor and i want to censor americans
[54:18.480 --> 54:27.400]  he's a bdi drug addict who's going to burn in hell and not because he sticks his tally
[54:27.400 --> 54:34.080]  wacker and other men but because he hates humanity and runs death camps burn in hell
[54:34.080 --> 54:46.880]  tim cook burn in hell you maggot burn in hell you little turd this is the end my friends
[54:46.880 --> 54:53.280]  my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end
[54:53.280 --> 55:01.360]  the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen because there was only the mirage
[55:01.360 --> 55:07.720]  of safety movies and partying and living like children never growing up never caring about
[55:07.720 --> 55:13.840]  other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history book show
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.480]  us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from
[55:18.480 --> 55:25.080]  god they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest
[55:25.080 --> 55:30.400]  and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again
[55:30.400 --> 55:37.360]  today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars

[57:01.240 --> 57:10.400]  the left soros the globalist the chycoms trying to fund marshal law in america president
[57:10.400 --> 57:20.120]  trump is a con man and the ultimate narcissist who wants the world to revolve around him
[57:20.120 --> 57:27.000]  it's fascinating to me that jordan soros has a foundation dedicated to political activism
[57:27.000 --> 57:35.280]  left wing activism anti-american activism i believe in in many examples and he gets
[57:35.280 --> 57:41.960]  to do it through a tax exempt foundation what are you are you kidding me yeah isn't it amazing
[57:41.960 --> 57:48.520]  that you have these smallish tea party groups that get persecuted prosecuted by the irs but
[57:48.520 --> 57:54.280]  i've never heard george soros even have a nasty letter from the irs for all this political
[57:54.280 --> 58:00.720]  activity he's running through a c3 foundation so that when buildings are being burnt down
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.400]  people are being killed security guards at federal buildings are being shot dead the
[58:04.400 --> 58:12.280]  media gives it almost no coverage so that when local and federal government responds
[58:12.280 --> 58:17.920]  they can tell the public this is tyranny attack them president trump and attorney general
[58:17.920 --> 58:24.480]  william bar blame left wing anarchist groups for the national violence and bar delivered
[58:24.480 --> 58:29.680]  a warning after both minnesota's democratic governor tim walls and president trump suggested
[58:29.680 --> 58:35.240]  some demonstrators in minnesota were out of state antagonists claims they did not back
[58:35.240 --> 58:41.840]  up with evidence and people it's a lot of radical left bad people and they've got to
[58:41.840 --> 58:47.080]  be taught that you can't do this this is an attempt to trigger a civil war the globalist
[58:47.080 --> 58:53.720]  can't defeat america but they can trick us to fight each other over made up or exaggerated
[58:53.720 --> 58:58.120]  issues they win what should the president of united states be doing right now president
[58:58.120 --> 59:04.360]  of united states should be donated to the office that he serves he should be a unifying force
[59:04.360 --> 59:11.840]  in our country we have seen that with democratic and republican presidents all along they have
[59:11.840 --> 59:18.880]  seen their responsibility to be the president of the united states to unify our country
[59:18.880 --> 59:25.400]  and not to fuel the flame not to fuel the flame and i think to take his bait time and
[59:25.400 --> 59:31.120]  time again is just a gift to him because he always wants to divert attention from what
[59:31.120 --> 59:58.360]  the cause of the response was rather than to describe it in his own terms and this is
[59:58.360 --> 1:00:02.440]  being boosted to the top of twitter and i don't like it looks like a police state but
[1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:07.440]  they've been ordered there and lawlessness created this and so all the trendies that
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:13.600]  want civil war and won all this they're getting what they asked for now notice the imperial
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:19.800]  stormtroopers are precise they actually shoot the woman in the chest from 60 yards away
[1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:24.480]  because that's what they're trained to do this is what soros and the globalist are conjuring
[1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:29.560]  is the actual military the actual police and they use a bunch of methhead idiots out there
[1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:32.680]  to poke the bear to do it and these people are ordered to go out and clear the streets
[1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:39.480]  what's gonna happen a disaster the cops arrested he's indicted so what's all this in so-called
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:44.160]  rioting about it's not about injustice it's not about standing up for what's right it's
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:50.240]  about control and power and it's all led if you go out on the la streets or the austin
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:54.760]  streets or the minnesota streets i've been on the texas streets the last two days but
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:58.960]  i see the videos from all over the country man it's a bunch of white people and i'm not
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.320]  trying to bash white people but you know what we don't have a mexican problem we don't have
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:30.640]  a black person problem we got a white crackhead problem
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:38.120]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones folks alan keys
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:42.880]  just got a lot to say coming up and i don't want to make this show the center of attention
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:47.440]  either but we have really been set up bad by mainstream media against we've got to take
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:52.480]  care of that when we come back in 60 seconds and set the records right about what's happening
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:57.320]  now it's official the united nations came out yesterday and said the cove of the emergency
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:03.440]  will last five years and the uk government said you must all carry cell phones outside
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:08.160]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:13.320]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:19.120]  be permanently detained yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:24.560]  the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you are
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:29.520]  now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it was clear the
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:35.200]  globalist art authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic straightjacket
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:41.760]  on us before they carry out their end game which is global depopulation so you see submitting
[1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:48.280]  to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:03:03.120]  they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die crashing through the lies and disinformation
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:17.200]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:21.560]  you know when the enemies launch in an attack because you see the propaganda increase you
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:26.720]  see movement on the street the major corporations that are globalist think they can conquer
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.840]  every nation state that want hegemonic planetary control ally of the communist china are making
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:36.720]  their move right now and they are lying at levels never before seen because they're
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:43.000]  behaving like it's the end of the world because it is the end of their globalist system if
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.880]  they lose and that's why trumps got act decisively to shut all this down because they're just
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:52.960]  going to keep escalating what they're doing to the point of destruction and war if the
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:04:00.080]  collaborators with communist china and the globalist are not dealt with and I mean decapitated
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:05.800]  however the constitutionally elected executive branch sees fit this is the the wheelhouse
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:12.000]  we're in right now all apple audio devices with the stream music have been taken over
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.600]  with f the police kill the police menus that's all being done by tim cook that on slave factories
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:23.000]  in china there I just had my daughter call me my oldest daughter she goes dad it's all

[1:05:57.560 --> 1:06:01.920]  with right now this is the type of stuff that's all over twitter being boosted at the top
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:06.240]  of twitter that trumps raping little girls with no proof that i'm burning down homeless
[1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:13.200]  camps this is a congressional candidate responds to mattress burning richard row and and this
[1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:17.840]  is the type of stuff that that's being boosted by time i wasn't even down there my crew was
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:22.240]  there we were covering it we would never commit a crime we don't do it doesn't matter they
[1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:28.480]  don't care they just say because we broke antifa burning the homeless camp and and twitter
[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:33.520]  had their people put out that i did it that this this is the type of guy very scary guy
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:37.440]  looks like he's had a lobotomy and i'm not being mean about it i mean a very scary individual
[1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:41.840]  this is the type of mentally unhinged people that i believe that i'm burning homeless camps
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:46.400]  here it is hello richard row candidate for congress florida's house twenty three news
[1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:55.280]  out of austin texas info wars apparently film themselves setting a homeless man's mattress
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:07:06.160]  on fire to frame antifa protesters in order to get footage for their video website toward
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:13.680]  the end of said footage the homeless man came up screaming begging asking why info wars
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:25.840]  is of course saying it was antifa no one believes you you piece of no one believes you not just
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.680]  because i was sandy hook and all the other disinformation you spread not just because
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:34.800]  you're a disinformation outlet with russian ties who just spreads russian uh trump propaganda

[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:49.920]  pike richard wrote for congress i'm out so that's a little sampling of what's going on no one says
[1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:54.560]  cut twitter only lets us put out short videos or our crew that has little accounts that are
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:59.360]  getting banned all the time and we released the raw footage and this guy by the way we sent him
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:04.880]  and tweeted him the stuff he won't stop because it doesn't matter to him whatever he says we have
[1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:10.000]  the video people running in burning it then they go oh well the people are wearing info wars gear
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:17.600]  then you look they're not wearing info wars gear it's a spurs hat so again ladies and gentlemen
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:23.600]  this is how the left spins everything we show people burning a homeless camp and i did it
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:29.120]  and this is what they're doing and now they say here it is right here exclusive troubled woman with
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:33.920]  a history of drug use who claimed that she is assaulted by trump at jeffrey epstein sex party
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:40.000]  days 13 made it all up she now admits but this is all being recycled folks
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:46.480]  and being pushed they're making their revolutionary move right now
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.960]  we're seeing more globalist propaganda and activity in an hour nice to see in five years
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:56.720]  so alan keys former u.s. ambassador united nations under ronald reagan bestselling author talk show
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:01.120]  house former host of crossfire and so many other great programs deep six in the memory holds he's
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:05.360]  so effective and truthful joins us and i really appreciate him coming on but what would you call
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:10.560]  this point in time ambassador that we're in right now i want listeners understand i've been on there
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:16.880]  26 years we've never entered anything like this in my view what would you call this period well
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:20.800]  i think it's the period in which we're going to decide whether or not our constitutional
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:28.560]  self-government survives or is overthrown by a little clique of ideologues who are seeking to
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:34.240]  subject the people of the united states and indeed the world to their ideological camp
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:40.000]  so that at the end of the day everything that we have stood for and helped other
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:45.520]  nations to arrive at will be destroyed and will see the world subjected to a totalitarian
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:53.680]  communist style tyranny their model seems to be communist china these days but but we should
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:58.640]  believe i guess from what you're saying that only the russians are involved since they have actually
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:05.040]  at least by their appearances gotten rid of communism therefore they must be to blame
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:11.680]  not the folks who are actually practicing that regime's excess is now and you just hit the total
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:17.120]  key there where we are the total key the american system not that we ever realize it but our ideal
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:21.440]  of humanity and empowerment all this they the globalists can't compete they're authoritarian
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:26.320]  that's what they want to say freedom is slavery so that we give up on it so they can just have
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:31.280]  free reign because the american system threatens their hegemonic rule well i think there's no
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:35.440]  doubt about that and we're also we have also been the most successful country in the history of the
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:42.400]  world because we tapped into the remarkable energy that comes with a people that are both
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:48.400]  free to make choices and decisions and take responsibility but also disciplined by a sense
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:55.440]  of right and that's what our commitment to god endowed rights is really about it's about accepting
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:00.080]  the discipline that there's a standard of right and wrong and together we stand on the common
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:05.600]  ground of agreeing that when you do what's right it is the job of the community and the
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:12.400]  government it establishes to make sure that you are secure in your exercise of right and i think
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:18.640]  that that combination of the moral standard ultimately appealing to god and the commitment
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:25.600]  to respect individual rights and responsibilities it has unleashed a great success in this country
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:29.760]  you're right that's the secret formula and the satanist can't handle it so when we come back
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:33.200]  with former ambassador of the united nations allen keys one of the smartest guys on the planet who
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:38.800]  didn't serve evil what comes next how do we stop this martial law how do we stop the race riots
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:44.000]  how do we go after the democrats that are openly triggering it and then claiming russians are behind
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.960]  it they're all over the place pushing it all the big corporations want it and then the russians are
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:55.200]  doing it it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:01.760]  to where it is every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:07.200]  months it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:12.560]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:20.080]  they're not going to have medical ID cards forced inoculations we are now in a giant dystopia but
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:26.240]  a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:31.440]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:36.560]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business
[1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:42.160]  down shut your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions already starved to death tens of
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:46.880]  millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have destroyed
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:53.200]  your life and our lives congratulations the panic that has been orchestrated by the global
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:14:00.080]  corporates media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:05.280]  already into the worldwide depression in the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:12.320]  understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown
[1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:17.600]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we always said
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:22.240]  it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:28.960]  make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:34.560]  how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:40.240]  they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:45.440]  dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:49.440]  more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:15:02.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:13.920]  all right l&t former ambassador to the nation is our guest i'm your host alex jones and i was just
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:23.360]  in the break room right there getting a cup of coffee and i was watching senator ted cruise
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.360]  talk about how antifa is terrorist funded working with foreign governments to overthrow the u.s
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.160]  and how they don't have u.s citizens rights and how we're in a fight for our lives and it wasn't
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:37.920]  rhetoric because we've been saying that i mean it's the truth but i'm just sitting there watching
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:44.960]  this we've had so much normalcy and so much freedom and for so long that that people don't get how much
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:50.560]  danger we're all in and that these big mega corporations are very arrogant and they've
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:55.600]  not had due process as bad as our government's been it's had corrupt problems these are bigger than
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:16:01.120]  governments now and and they're and they're they're they're very autocratic and they're very evil
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:06.480]  and so folks need to understand i'm a libertarian in that i want a very small government but i want
[1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.440]  a government that protects my liberty because there's always another government trying to come
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:13.840]  in and take over and and so this is the greatest threat we face in our whole history and it's not
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:17.040]  just about america i know alan keys and everybody i get on they're great patriots they're always like
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:21.920]  america america and i get that but everybody's been around the world this is about true evil on a
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:27.200]  planetary scale corporations that have gotten away with whatever they want who now think they're god
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.760]  and to have apple that owns these slave factories with the worst abuses on record they make nikey
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:36.880]  look like humanitarians lecturing everybody and saying kill the police now and hijacking everyone's
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:42.240]  browser they're getting you used to being raped that just oh my private message has been intercepted
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:49.360]  oh my my my app now has a message for me this is a takeover so alan keys you i mean you're dead
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:54.880]  right that they're trying to destroy the american system i just have been so alarmist so long knowing
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:17:01.280]  this was coming how now at the actual point of war do we telegraph to people that you better hit the
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:06.800]  knee and ask jesus to open that channel up like you were saying and then take action because you know
[1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:13.360]  god's there but god helps those that help themselves how do we quantify for people that this is game
[1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:18.000]  time right now this isn't this isn't little league bush league this isn't the playoffs it's the super
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:23.520]  bowl for the whole future of humanity i think the first thing we have to do is make sure that the
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:29.600]  people who are representing us are doing their jobs um and i have been watching a lot of these
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:35.360]  people talk about the violence that's occurring and they act as if this is some protect protests
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:40.720]  that's protected by the constitution i it amazes me that people never go back to the constitution
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:46.560]  and read it because the right is not beating people up and burn things the rights that that's
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:54.240]  protected in the constitution is a right that says congress shall make no law abridging the right of
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:18:02.880]  the people peaceably to assemble peaceably so if people are out there and they're burning down police
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:08.640]  precincts and destroying malls and and assaulting people and so forth and so on they are not protected
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:15.920]  by the constitution of the united states what they are actually doing qualifies as insurrection
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:23.280]  and when insurrection becomes widespread which it has been lately i think we need to remember
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:29.520]  that the president is the commander-in-chief what's he the commander-in-chief of alan he's
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:36.000]  the commander-in-chief of the army and navy people know that but he's also the commander-in-chief
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:43.600]  of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:47.360]  and people have been talking as if the only people who can mobilize the militia are the
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.600]  governors and the president must ask their permission to mobilize them and so forth and so on
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:59.920]  not true okay because at the end of the day it is also stated in the u.s. code that the president
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:08.240]  can under certain circumstances when the states have failed to act in order to secure that protection
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:13.280]  required by the 14th amendment incumbent upon them and stated in the constitution
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:18.880]  that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process so he's following
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:23.760]  the constitution 100 percent in his statement yesterday well when he says if the governors
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:28.960]  won't act i will well when you go out and burn down malls and so forth and so on and the police
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:33.120]  are standing around acting like they're doing nothing because the governor says so or you
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:37.920]  mobilize the national garden and act as if you want to have a big prayer meeting rather than stop
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:44.240]  the violence and it continues night after night and so forth and so on and it gets worse the
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:49.840]  president is supposed to look at that and make a determination they have failed to deal with the
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:57.920]  insurrection the law then says that he shall then turn to the and it's not just the military
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:02.720]  and this is what's been bothering me a little bit about the response the first thing the president
[1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:11.040]  has to do he has to assert his role as commander in chief of the military yes but of the militia
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:17.840]  when called into the service so he has to call them into his service he has to has to basically
[1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:23.040]  say you guys aren't doing this job i'm taking over the national guard by the way the alamo was
[1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:28.480]  getting torn up and citizens had to go protect that's what you're saying is is it we as citizens
[1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:33.520]  constitute government to carry out our operations but we inherently still have that right in fact
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:38.720]  no no no i'm sorry that's not what i'm saying let's be clear about this you're saying the president
[1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:45.200]  has to be in command let me finish the president is the commander in chief his word now should be
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:50.640]  governing every response throughout the 20 or so states and more than a hundred cities that have
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:56.880]  been under attack he then needs to be the head of the chain of command deciding what's to be done
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:03.280]  by the national guard by the militia by the way the word militia is not used in some sense of
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:10.080]  of of that is not constitutional it's a it's supposed to be those between 17 and 45
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:17.840]  who can then be called into action under regulations that the president is going to determine
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:24.880]  to help restore order to help take up tasks that might be needed to support the forces in the
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:30.160]  national guard maybe eventually in the military who do so but the first task of the president is
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:35.120]  to make sure that everybody understands there's a single chain of command because if he brings the
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:39.920]  military in and people are pretending that the national guard answers to the governors that's
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:45.600]  going to lead to confusion so he has to do it in the right ordering and so let's talk about that i
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:50.160]  mean i get what you're saying i'm bringing up the citizens are filling the gap that trump hasn't yet
[1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:54.800]  gone into going out and defending you know the the the country but i get what you're saying is
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:58.880]  the president has to declare himself as the commander in chief under the constitution
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:03.040]  which he's already begun to do yesterday and sweep the governors aside that want a virtue signal
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:11.120]  well he sweeps them aside on a lawful basis because they have failed to deal with the situation
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.440]  and having failed to deal with the situation he steps forward to deal with it and he takes over
[1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:21.120]  and he says the national guard is called into service under the united states to make sure
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:27.200]  that no person will be deprived of liberty without life liberty or property without due process
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:32.160]  which has been occurring that's the specific requirement in the u.s code and he can now
[1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:38.480]  evoke it because they have failed sometimes by willful failure not acting sometimes they've tried
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:44.240]  but they haven't succeeded it doesn't matter he can take responsibility and if he then feels
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:50.400]  that they must be supplemented in one way or another by military forces uh the the actual
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:57.280]  authorization in the u.s code says that he can mobilize the army the navy the militia or any
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:04.640]  other means necessary to deal with the violation of the constitution which requires no doubt though
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:09.200]  this is the global assault americans need to know trump didn't start this we didn't start this this
[1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:13.920]  is the attempt to overthrow the country we'll come back and talk about i know you get into technical
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:17.680]  stuff and that's great but where you see this going if trump doesn't act and how he acts and
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:22.080]  how they obviously want to get some people killed with the military then create a bigger race war
[1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:28.080]  it's just so disgusting how about cutting the head off the stage going after the antifa organizers
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:33.680]  the terrorist funders the soros people and that's the most logical thing the the fbi raids
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:41.040]  five people they'll stop it's a few people obama hillary the globalists they're running this
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:46.720]  so instead of just having a huge martial law war why not just send in the fbi to arrest these people
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:55.200]  we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've told folks going back three months ago i'm not
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:23:59.040]  buying storable food because i'm worried about the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food
[1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:04.000]  shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.480]  already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:12.880]  it's even worse in the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:18.320]  but with the election fraud and the covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:23.760]  else is going on now is the time to get storable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:29.040]  an easily totable bags it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready

[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:58.080]  like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:03.360]  dies she said oh yeah when i grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in the
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:08.400]  street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:14.000]  blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around gibbering talking nonsense for
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.680]  about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well that's what's gonna happen with our economy
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:25.520]  it is in cardiac arrest this has been done by design and the un the chai comms the mainstream
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:31.920]  media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed so remember the depression

[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:26.880]  because that's what funds this place all right back to former ambassador the united nations
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:31.680]  author and talk show host alan keys about start over then your message to the president of his
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:36.800]  office and what he needs to do now in the constitution with what we're facing and then
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:42.320]  you have to focus on the positive i want you to answer this though what do you see happening if
[1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:46.800]  trump doesn't take action correctly because i get it i'm trying to talk about the general audience
[1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:50.800]  give the audience info you're mainly a message to the president and i get that so what are you
[1:30:50.800 --> 1:30:56.320]  saying well what i'm saying is that he first of all has to stop the violence and that there
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:02.560]  is no excuse for that violence no constitutional protection for it it must simply stop and if
[1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:07.520]  there are governors and mayors who are dithering around the president has the constitutional
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:13.120]  authority and the responsibility to step in and make sure that no person is deprived of life
[1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:18.880]  liberty or property absent due process which is the requirement of the constitution imposed upon
[1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:24.880]  the states which he then is authorized to intervene take over the national guard and whatever other
[1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:31.200]  means are necessary to restore order and that's what he must get about doing right away it's his
[1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:36.320]  responsibility to do that on behalf of the nation as a whole especially when things go beyond the
[1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:42.400]  scale of one state one city and you're dealing with what is now quite obviously an orchestrated
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:50.160]  attack on order throughout the society on the excuse by the way of an episode that was dealt
[1:31:50.160 --> 1:31:55.760]  with i think as expeditiously as you could have imagined faster than i've ever seen it in fact
[1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:01.440]  because the minute the autopsy had established the cause of death they had already fired the
[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:06.560]  police officer then arrested him and are moving now to see whether others who stood by and did
[1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:13.120]  nothing would also be prosecuted you can't really observe due process without waiting for the autopsy
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:18.160]  report that's all they did they waited for that report and then they moved ahead they didn't go
[1:32:18.160 --> 1:32:22.720]  through the usual procedure which is a police an internal police investigation and all of that
[1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:28.720]  and i thought that that expedition was in response to the strong public outrage that i
[1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:33.840]  am pretty much everybody else who saw the episode was sharing i did not understand and neither did
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:41.280]  a lot of other people why something was not done in response to that situation way before this man
[1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:47.840]  was even in danger of death especially since he wasn't apparently suspected of a violent crime
[1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:55.040]  but once you get the message that this is something being used by others to attack the country
[1:32:55.040 --> 1:33:00.560]  the president must thus then respond and if the governors and mayors are not acting with
[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:06.240]  expedition to deal with the violence if they're talking as some of them have as if there is some
[1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:11.120]  constitutional protection for that kind of violence then he has to intervene and set them
[1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:18.000]  straight and do so by means that establish the order of priorities he gets to take over the
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:23.920]  process of law enforcement and make sure that the constitution is respected and he needs to do that
[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:32.560]  now immediately i think that it it has been to me kind of dismaying that he hasn't moved i'm wondering
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:38.240]  whether his advisors haven't been going through the the code in order to make it clear that he not
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:46.160]  only has where you have the authority the operative word is shell when this kind of an abuse of our
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:52.480]  rights is taking place then the president shall intervene if it appears that the governors and
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:57.280]  others have failed and i think the continuing violence certainly suggests that they have no
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:00.880]  you're right and that's coming on it's it's kushner that's telling trump to do nothing which is
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:08.480]  insane well it's not only insane it's it's going to be i think deeply harmful to the country and
[1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:14.720]  that is crazy the president cannot allow that to happen second the part that i think is important
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.760]  is that he can look at the means available and and decide which ones and i think it would be
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:25.520]  appropriate by the way for him to bring in the sheriffs for him to use the sheriffs to call
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:32.640]  out the able-bodied people 17 to 45 within a certain criteria that could be useful to helping to
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:38.160]  guard buildings and restore order in that sense as a supplement to the national guard i think we
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:43.280]  also have to be careful to keep in mind that you bring in military forces at a present time like
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:48.560]  this we are also in danger of other kinds of attacks and i hope they're taking account of that
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:53.120]  because some people in this country in our media have clearly been working in concert
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.480]  with china and other let's talk about that next segment because this is all in our country i agree
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:02.080]  this is all admitted to be foreign orchestrated now and that's the real way to cut the head off
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:06.720]  the snake i want to talk about that but here's the polk county sheriff in florida talking about
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:12.880]  the power of the militia here it is we have received information and social media that some of the
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:20.320]  criminals were going to take their criminal conduct into the neighborhoods i would tell them if you
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:26.480]  value your life you probably shouldn't do that in polk county because the people of polk county
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:34.640]  like guns they have guns i encourage them to own guns and they're going to be in their homes tonight
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:42.000]  with their guns loaded and if you try to break into their homes to steal to set fires
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:47.200]  i'm highly recommending they blow you back out of the house with their guns
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:55.120]  so leave the community alone and we'll do our best to support the community
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:02.160]  but ladies and gentlemen make no mistake about it all of that ugliness has taken away
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:11.040]  from what we're united about we're united about the conduct that you saw with george where he is
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  life was taken with the need of the net it's horrific and there's not enough words to explain
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:23.120]  that let's keep the focus on that that's right i mean nobody wants to watch somebody back for
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:28.880]  their life and die because of minnesota is the only those cities the only two cities the country
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:34.160]  that allow that they banned that decades ago because it killed some people and so idiotic
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:39.920]  police training and now the whole country has to burn we have to have a domestic collapse but who's
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:48.400]  really behind it and and and how do we say no to that straight ahead i don't have to tell you
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:52.960]  that we are in the most important point in human history the globalists have taken the gloves off
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:58.240]  and they've taken the mask off and they're like yeah you're taking implantable chips yeah we're
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:04.080]  in the pedophilia yeah we're in the world government yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:10.400]  we are shutting your ass down yeah we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:15.440]  work in industry anymore you're gonna be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:20.240]  that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:26.960]  your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:31.760]  we have to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding you were
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:37.280]  right and understanding i was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while

[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.880]  when you shoot an elk and say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:06.640]  50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.920]  through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:17.920]  and they die then you go bag them and haul them back in well that's what's gonna happen to the
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:24.560]  entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:29.840]  heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:33.840]  well for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:39.280]  the UN and i believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:42.800]  the third world so that all the leftists had thought it was their revolution to get rid of
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:49.120]  trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what hitler did as i

[1:40:53.920 --> 1:41:08.560]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:14.080]  so there's a viral video out right now it's on info wars.com
[1:41:15.840 --> 1:41:18.000]  of a pigeon battling with an escalator
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:30.080]  but that's the same thing we see there's a cardinal that for years came to my window and pecked
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:34.240]  it every morning he's gone now i kind of feel all left alone i actually wanted to be died or
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:38.400]  whatever for a couple three or four years he pecked at the window and you know here you've got the
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:44.000]  pigeon um running on the treadmill and you know attacking it and trying to control it and who knows
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:50.160]  if it's 5g making it upset all the birds have been going crazy but this is this is racism this is
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.880]  fighting with each other over what color we are instead of our ideology we should be fighting
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:59.200]  with each other over what we stand for that should determine us what we believe what we build what we
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:05.120]  do i've said this a thousand times i go to a restaurant because they've got good food because
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:10.080]  i like southern cooking and the north thrill racist about southern cooking they call it soul food
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:14.560]  if it's just other cooking like oh that's black people food i just go to the black sold food places
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:18.480]  they got the best chicken fried steaks and sweet potatoes and you know food like that to me i don't
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:22.000]  walk in there going oh these are black people i'm virtually signaling going in here to eat a black
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:26.400]  restaurant i'm going there because they got the best chicken fried steak and the best sweet potatoes
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:30.080]  and the best black hot peas and the best cornbread the best whatever because that's just what i grew
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:36.240]  up eating to me that's not black food that's just texas food but but again it shows how the left
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:42.800]  politicizes every issue and instead of it being food they turn it into a new symbol
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:47.120]  and that's what the psychologist and the and the people running things have done and now
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:52.240]  we have communist china openly funding insurrection openly allowed to do whatever they
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:57.120]  want on twitter and facebook but the president censored and you talk about a day late a dollar
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:03.760]  short look trump only with 156 days left 153 now announces an executive order against big tech
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:12.000]  censorship but trump can't do it all i get that our guest is right saying trump should take action
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:18.240]  he's in the prime position do it but what do we the people do to put pressure on everybody to
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:23.840]  realize the simple decision that bankrupting america having a race war locking everything down
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:30.080]  now the german interior ministry comes out and says covid 19's a hoax uh i mean everything they
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:35.520]  do is a fraud so what i'm getting at here is we can push the president all day and that's good
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:41.440]  and that's important allen keys but what else can we the people do uh to try to turn this around
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:48.800]  and not go down this road and what happens if we don't is that a question for me yeah i'm and
[1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:53.360]  that's a lot of questions i mean there's so many points do we pressure trump what do we do
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:44:00.960]  do well i think the two things are actually never separable because at the end of the day we elect
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:07.280]  our officials to represent our responsibility to do certain things and the second amendment's
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:12.640]  a good example by the way though everybody forgets this uh the second amendment isn't just about
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:20.640]  the militia it's about a well regulated militia part of that regulation is taken care of by the
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:26.800]  congress and the national guard and all of that and everybody knows about that but when i say that
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:32.480]  the president has to move in and start dealing with the militia in that larger sense he then has
[1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:38.160]  the responsibility to say we're faced with this situation and here's what the folks starting at
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:43.360]  the grassroots can do to help restore order in this situation what you're saying is that
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:49.920]  infrastructure died it went away it became vestigial no it didn't die no i'm not saying that i'm not
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:53.360]  saying that well let me say what i said that's your just we're arguing about the point let me
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:45:00.480]  get to it the constitution actually gives the president the leeway to adapt the unorganized
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:04.320]  militia let me just stop you i'm not trying to get an argument with you here what i'm saying is
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:09.360]  they have killed the nerve endings i'm not saying the law is dead i'm saying they have
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:15.040]  extincted it you're saying when you say regulated it means there is a governmental bureaucracy
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:18.880]  of the people being civil defense that should be brought back and and you're saying was never
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:25.120]  taken away but how do you activate something that's been put in in carbon phrase well see i i i think
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:30.640]  bureaucracy at the moment doesn't enter into it what is enters into it is the president of the
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:37.360]  united states appealing to the able-bodied males seven to forty five in different parts of the
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:43.760]  country pointing for instance to the county sheriffs and saying here's a responsible official
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:49.680]  and i would can i finish i would like this responsible official to become a focal point
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:56.880]  for organizing the response of communities against the disc violence and i will will
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:46:03.440]  will give them some instructions about how they go about doing this so that in a regular fashion
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:09.360]  people can come together and organize in defense of their communities we need to restore that sense
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:14.880]  which was always part of this understanding that part of what needs to be done when there's a local
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:20.400]  insurrection or organized insurrection targeting the local i agree with that i'm saying if there's
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:26.720]  after a feed of that how does the president carry that out he must he must ask for it and he must
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:31.760]  give instructions as to how it is done and then he must allow the sheriffs who are quite familiar
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:37.840]  you saw that sheriff i think that sheriff has the right spirit has the knowledge probably of how it
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:42.800]  needs to be done or implemented at least what he needs is the direction and that direction would
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:48.080]  then come in these circumstances for these circumstances from the white house and he needs
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:54.880]  to task people around him in the military to come up with that organization so it can be implemented
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:59.680]  right now to deal with this you're saying the president must call on the power of the people
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:05.440]  that i agree with that statement that's right but he must call on it in a way that helps to
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:11.040]  designate who's going to be responsible for organizing it and take responsibility for making
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:16.480]  sure that it is done in a way that's consistent with the mission which is to make sure that
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:23.920]  order which means respect for the simple fact that no violence is to be done and no threat is to be
[1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:29.920]  posed to life liberty or property without due process that's the mission and that's the mission
[1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:35.920]  that is not yet being acquitted by the governors and the mayors partly i suspect because some of
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:42.560]  them are so committed to this leftist ideology that they actually think that violence is a proper
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:47.760]  means for expressing our oh yeah listen to this my son we haven't heard this yet he got the footage
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:52.320]  of two nights ago he went into a convenience store there's a guy attacking everyone and beating him
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:57.360]  and stealing when the cops come they let him go because the guy said i'm a protester so when you
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:02.400]  in law are explaining the media as you said and republican governors too not just democrats are
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:08.320]  saying oh robbing and burning things is an act of protest no it's not no it's not that's something
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:14.000]  that i think needs to be gotten across quite quickly and but and introducing his role in this
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:20.800]  the president could actually in his statement make that part of the introduction this understanding
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:28.560]  that somehow protest is protected when it crosses the line into violence that's a wrong understanding
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:34.880]  my responsibility he should say is to make sure that the constitution and law which requires
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:40.720]  that no person be deprived of life liberty or property and then remember all the way back to
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:46.320]  the declaration all the way back Alex to the Declaration of Independence the primary role
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:53.680]  of the institution of government is to secure these rights among them the right to life liberty
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:49:01.040]  etc that that means that that security is a goal for government overall it's a goal recognized in
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:08.160]  the constitution in specific terms life is the prime directive and yes and and it has to be
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:13.520]  respected the democrats the ideologues the leftists that's my question what are the i know you want
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:17.680]  to focus on us but they're really going for broke what do you expect them to do next this is very
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:23.760]  ominous they just seem to be going for broke well they seem very willing and anxious in fact to induce
[1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:30.800]  chaos and bring the country to civil war that's their goal the way you avoid civil war is by imposing
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:38.480]  civil order instead that is to say to take steps in line with the constitution and the laws that
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:44.800]  restore order using and relying upon what's already been demonstrated some people hate it
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.520]  but i think what the american people demonstrated in the first part of this whole quarantine period
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:54.720]  was that when they're asked to do something that makes sense to them they do it even when
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:58.960]  it doesn't make sense to them they'll do it if they think it's going to be good for the country
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:05.120]  but when they see that they're being snookered they will start to resist but that's a combination of
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:11.040]  common sense and law-abiding character that needs to be mobilized now by the president
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:16.640]  have faith in the grassroots have faith in your own powers don't listen to the question i agree
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:23.600]  alan keys i am tv dot us i am tv dot us one other site should people visit to find out what you're

[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:11.920]  just like the history book show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:17.600]  and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their people
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:23.600]  sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:30.400]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:36.560]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support

[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:07.840]  he's fearless and double tough millie weaver's gonna come in the next two segments elin keys
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:12.880]  is amazing he's so optimistic if we would just follow the constitution and bill of rights which
[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:17.840]  are the weapons systems of freedom that he just wants to keep hammering those and gets pissed
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:24.400]  when i bring up the problems about okay i get all that but but but but what have we failed
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:28.000]  well let's not talk about the failure let's talk about the victory
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  and i get that i'm not criticizing him i love having him on he's so he's amazing he knows his stuff
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:38.960]  and that's why they buried him out there where you can't hear him except on broadcast like this
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:40.320]  but man
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:50.160]  it really came home from me when i learned that my son was in a store and there was a person
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:58.240]  there assaulting everybody and my son said there was like a six foot six big dude my son's like six
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:06.560]  two now we're gonna get this footage coming up and the big guy wouldn't go help the shopkeeper
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:16.880]  being beaten up by the by the by the crazy person and so my son had to go do it and just it just
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:22.240]  it just really came home to me that that's how screwed up everything is i mean i know
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:28.640]  two gun stores i go to that one they attempted to rob and shot up the other they robbed

[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:50.480]  that we dominate the streets mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:57.120]  presence until the violence has been quelled if a city or state refuses to take the actions that
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:03.760]  are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents then i will deploy the united
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:12.960]  states military and quickly solve the problem for them i am also taking swift and decisive action
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:21.200]  to protect our great capital washington dc what happened in this city last night was a total
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:29.920]  disgrace as we speak i am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers military
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:38.960]  personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting looting vandalism assaults and the
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:46.880]  wanton destruction of property we are putting everybody on warning our seven o'clock curfew

[2:02:53.520 --> 2:03:01.280]  detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law i want the organizers of this terror
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:09.680]  to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail it was
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:15.440]  25 years ago that i was contacted by members of the military and emergency management systems
[2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:20.320]  and police chiefs so i all interviewed on record that bill clinton had a plan to use the arming
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:28.320]  to trigger civil unrest martial law and gun confiscation and i was so green back at the time
[2:03:29.200 --> 2:03:36.880]  that i was getting documents from the fbi and and from the army about the delta force being
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:42.400]  trained for this and i went on air and like it was like the delta force is planning to overthrow
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:47.120]  america and like years later they're like you we understand your it was we gave you the documents
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:51.440]  we didn't want to do this you understand we're being given the orders hey i was 26 years old
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:04:00.480]  i had a talk show who who got that i just wouldn't got it now i get it all later so i get how these
[2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:06.880]  young people get manipulated because even when i was given the information to stop it by the people
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:14.640]  in the pentagon that didn't like it i didn't even know what to do with the information it's like
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:24.240]  pearls before swine and so all these years later here we are with the globalist the chai comms
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:28.880]  openly trying to destroy the country the police are our enemy they're just average people like us
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:33.280]  some are good some are bad most are good the firefighters almost all good people so a few
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:45.440]  babbles but they're americans and the globalists are trying to tear us all apart and manipulate us
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:50.320]  to stall the economy because the covet hoax is failing and the economy is starting to come back
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:56.080]  and they're just so pissed man i double checked it it's acme brick of berkshire half the way
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:01.280]  in more than 20 cities delivered pallets of bricks everywhere just dumped them off
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:06.400]  they just with a computer they hit a button deliver it everywhere apple just took over
[2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:10.720]  and said kill the police on their main feed everybody's phone was taken over like kill the
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:18.080]  police murder everybody these are these are the big dirty corporations doing this they're making
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:22.640]  their move they think they're gonna defeat americans and defeat you they think we're that stupid and
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:30.880]  you know what i know at a spiritual gut level that they're gonna lose but then that's when i
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:35.520]  get the chill out my spine
[2:05:39.040 --> 2:05:44.080]  you understand they're gonna escalate and at a certain point we have to stop
[2:05:46.640 --> 2:05:53.600]  and ask ourselves he is not shutting them down aiding them and so i'm the anti fascist i'm the
[2:05:53.600 --> 2:06:02.480]  anti police state i tried to stop all this we're here now this is where we were brought you understand
[2:06:02.480 --> 2:06:08.560]  that if the pentagon and what's left of the justice department and the president doesn't
[2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:16.560]  start decapitating the enemy last month we're gonna lose they're already setting up their whole
[2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:23.120]  civil war they think they're gonna sit it out in new zealand and hawaii and tasmania and switzerland
[2:06:23.120 --> 2:06:33.920]  no i'll assure you you're not let's just not go there because i don't want to kill

[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:11.280]  be bought off but in the end the globalists admit they're building a post human world and now that
[2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:19.120]  we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its endgame submission to this is a
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:26.160]  form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living

[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:17.520]  and cyber security contracting company many of these contracted groups also have contracts with
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:24.720]  the military um they they're teaching them tactical military maneuvers organization strategies
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:30.560]  communications like bernard currick former uh you know in in ypd commissioner said this is
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:36.000]  military precision this is this isn't just terrorism this is organized overthrow of the
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:41.600]  government i mean so people like oh trump's gonna respond and arrest him he's a tyrant
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:46.880]  the only thing he can do they should send the green berets in to literally just deal with the and
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:52.400]  i don't mean the idiot protesters you cut the head off the snake it's done but you've got these
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:57.600]  arrogant contractors that are funded by china that literally think america is a chump and is over
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:00.480]  so so since you're gonna get to it millie i didn't know you were gonna do this today i know you were
[2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:05.520]  getting ready for it start over right now begin at the beginning and tell people what you've got
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:11.840]  okay so we have had somebody infiltrate the sunrise movement for the past two years they've
[2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:18.640]  went under as a NGO globalist overthrow america group yes it is the same group that bernie sanders
[2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:24.960]  was endorsed by a communist is it yes they these democrats are in league with these groups they
[2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:30.240]  say that they're a and all because they're candy-ass leftist they just think they're allowed to do this
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:37.840]  they're progressive communists many of these same groups black lives matter all of them if you if
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:43.440]  you follow the leaves up to the same branch it's all the same this is being run by the world bank
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:48.880]  by the club of roam and believe it or not the internal documents we have show that aoc is a
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:54.240]  member of the club of roam course i mean these people aren't who they say they are it is worse
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:16:59.200]  than we think they are terrorists like ilhan omar i mean this is going down they are no this is a
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:05.440]  literal muslim brotherhood new world or takeover absolutely alex and they have the military on
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:10.160]  their side so that is why it is so planned and coordinated we've seen that we've seen palates
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:15.440]  of bricks being delivered we've seen uh them interfering with police let's be clear they
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:21.760]  have a they have a large slice of the military command under their control yes and they use
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:27.600]  discord chats they use google docs they use all of these private encrypted chats online
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:33.680]  use five five six everything well they use it to communicate their orchestration of their plans
[2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:38.560]  does that make sense and we were able to get inside we got servers we got everything we've
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:43.680]  got their internal documents we have their plans with them uh they've got a graph that says the
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:49.200]  momentum cycle how it talks about um the different periods of the uprising you know they know they're
[2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:54.000]  in they want to hijack our revolution to restore the republic and so and you've gotten just like
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:57.760]  we got the critical documents i'm not bringing this up to go oh look we have documents just like
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:02.720]  we got documents about how they plan the uprising and how it's all admitted now we're trying to
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:09.360]  expose this to people that we have their plans so yes trump must act now please continue well one
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:13.760]  of the things that i found kind of shocking is inside when they're communicating about the new
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:20.080]  normal their new normal is a code word and it doesn't have anything to do with code 19 alex it has
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:25.200]  everything to do with this uprising and the new normal is going to be this uprising the violence
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:30.160]  that's going to continue and escalate their new normal so that's one of the weird things we saw
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:35.600]  in the documents new normal is actually a code word and them pushing for all these masks everything
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:40.640]  it was part of their plan they can use the mask to be able to go out there conceal their identity
[2:18:40.640 --> 2:18:45.280]  well that is an archetype of now they're everybody's anti-fit was to make them feel powerful look
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:50.400]  everyone's exactly everyone's wearing a mask every i think i got a call from a high level really
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:54.400]  smart guy he goes two weeks ago he goes listen the mask or the cover of the criminal takeover
[2:18:54.400 --> 2:18:59.200]  the mask is meant to make antefa believe this is their code see we're in charge everyone's
[2:18:59.200 --> 2:19:04.560]  wearing a mask you just said it meli there's a group called momentum it's an organization that
[2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:11.600]  has been training these people how to protest how to riot how to overthrow how to use these
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:17.200]  tactics they have different names like fire mage light mage where you know fire mages are the ones
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:24.160]  that throw the uh the multi cocktails they have different people alex it's all coordinated and
[2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:28.720]  organized they have the medics we hear them in the video footage medic medic it is all coordinated
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:34.480]  they have assigned roles for all these protesters they have peaceful protesters as one of the roles
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:39.280]  where they just go act like they're just peaceful people getting hurt i mean the only action is not
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:45.280]  by we the people but i mean it's decapitation i mean the government if it's legitimate needs to
[2:19:45.280 --> 2:19:50.800]  stop this foreign insurrection and it needs to decapitate the leadership exactly this was
[2:19:51.440 --> 2:19:55.920]  preplanned i've been looking at last night i was going down a rabbit hole i was up late
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:59.280]  i was just looking at all these private communications these tweets even some of
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:02.960]  these tweets are public where they're posting oh thanks for the the money for the supplies
[2:20:02.960 --> 2:20:06.400]  i'm going to be putting it up on the discord i'm going to be putting up on the google doc
[2:20:06.400 --> 2:20:13.280]  and it's all hollywood and billionaires and warren buffett just funding it oh they just don't care
[2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:18.640]  they're proud of it they're funding it and some of these same groups were previously in the months
[2:20:18.640 --> 2:20:25.120]  prior um they were putting these funds to bail out prisoners and people from jail to get them out of
[2:20:25.120 --> 2:20:30.160]  prison uh because they were saying COVID-19 was endangering them so we saw all these releases
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:35.840]  well the good news is they started the war now they're gonna get it well they're right back
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:39.120]  stay with us they think we're going to prison camps you're going into graves

[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:14.320]  let the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you are now
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:19.520]  non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it was clear the globalist are an
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:25.440]  authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:33.280]  carry out their in game which is global depopulation so you see submitting to them is death the only
[2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:40.000]  way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:48.320]  wake up or die we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've told folks going back three months
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:52.240]  ago i'm not buying storeable food because i'm worried about the covid-19 virus i'm worried
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:57.200]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:01.520]  begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:05.600]  united states and it's even worse in the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:10.960]  clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the covid-19 all the wars and the third
[2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:15.760]  world collapsing and everything else is going on now is the time to get storeable foods because
[2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:21.040]  they'll last for 25 years they're in easily totable bags it's high quality food and it's good to have
[2:23:21.040 --> 2:23:25.120]  that box checked off to be ready and it funds the info war so we have storeable food available
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:30.080]  again infowarstore.com or call toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine whatever
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:34.240]  you do get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them they do

[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:47.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:06.240]  everything everything originates from the seed of determination
[2:24:06.240 --> 2:24:12.480]  i don't normally go off with fortune cookies i have to say but i got some Chinese food today and
[2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:16.960]  i said let me open both these up and see what they have to say just now during the break i
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:23.040]  was carving down an egg roll and it says everything originates from the seed of determination
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:29.680]  exactly if info wars has one thing it's determination and it's that understanding that we just can't
[2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:35.600]  turn our wills over to others at least unconsciously consciously turned over to god that's great
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:40.960]  that god doesn't take control of your will god empowers your will that's the big secret to
[2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:46.400]  satanists don't know they think oh satan empowers the will no it's the other way around
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:53.280]  another one dreams are extremely important you can't do it unless you imagine it
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:25:01.920]  two really good points they didn't come from gg pain millie weaver i know you've been working on
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:07.280]  this for months you guys about infiltrator inside you've got all the data i told you weeks ago i said
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:14.080]  just just give it to project veritas they're really good at getting stuff out i mean hell we
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:19.360]  don't want the glory this is a really dangerous thing you guys have done um i've seen a lot of it
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:24.080]  it's it's very damning and to realize they've got the kids they're not just doing drag queen
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:27.440]  story time out and open with convicted pedophiles bouncing six-year-old girls on their
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:33.600]  knee and little boys they are in there man they are brainwashing there this is marxis this is
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:40.560]  malice this is hardcore and this is their big push that's why uh what are you expecting to do
[2:25:40.560 --> 2:25:44.320]  next and then and then and then get back into these documents and when are you guys gonna put
[2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:48.560]  these out on the internet so folks can see them because you've announced it now they're they're
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:53.440]  coming for you oh yeah they've already been coming for they know that we have them so
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:57.040]  we're trying to get them out as soon as we can alex they're gonna be out within a day or two
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:01.840]  i mean we are getting it out fast and we've already put out a little bit and it's a blueprint for the
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:06.560]  total takeover of our children while your kids at school you don't know they're literally being taken
[2:26:06.560 --> 2:26:12.480]  over oh yeah and i already put a clip out on my twitter millie weaver uh millie underscore weaver
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:18.160]  on twitter if you guys want to see that but yeah it is it's bad alex they actually have some teachers
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:24.960]  in league with this group the sunrise movement so we have actual teachers grooming and then directing
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:31.360]  underage children to these green party organizations that are communist organizations so these children
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:37.120]  are being secretly groomed behind their parents back orchestrating and coordinating with private
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:42.880]  chats encrypted chats with children private zoom conferences with children we had to blur out some
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:48.480]  of the faces in the video we just released because they are underage kids alex it's that bad um you
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:55.280]  have people using nlp high level and this is literally potbellied communist brainwashing children
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:27:01.360]  without their parents knowing with extreme pleasure oh yeah and they're all well meaning liberals
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:06.320]  that's why you see the police chiefs everyone going oh america's bad yes kill white people and it's a
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:12.480]  white guy saying it it's all a cult of guilt it's a literal cult takeover it's all right we secretly
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:17.200]  talk to your kid without them knowing because it's it's the of course they all add the lgbt
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:22.960]  sexualization but look at the cult leaders that are running it i mean this is who's secretly talking
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:29.440]  to your children god and these young kids think that this is an organic uprising an organic movement
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:34.160]  it's not it's being run by the military industrial complex it's being yeah get back to that because
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:41.280]  you guys practice back as the top generals oh yeah okay so the ia operations that we're seeing on
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:48.000]  twitter and on social media right now that has been tracked back to um military generals general
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:54.160]  hayden general jim jones these are obama um people that worked in the obama administration alex these
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:28:00.480]  people they are planning to do an armed overthrow a violent overthrow they have their hands in this
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:09.040]  it is insane so an ia operation and uh interactive internet activities operation um that is basically
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:14.640]  where you have these systems you have a system called shadow net uh patrick burgey he was one
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:19.600]  of the pioneers he developed this software for the military to be used in iraq and iran
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.480]  some of this technology because these private corporations were able to keep it after the
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:30.560]  contracts were up that same technology was used in the ukraine to help with the ukraine uprising
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:34.160]  for folks that don't know now being used today for folks that don't know if you just type into a
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:41.440]  search engine obama legalizes cia propaganda in the united states they'll get foreign affairs
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:48.480]  all these articles and so this is taxpayer money being used by stay behind networks in the government
[2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:54.640]  the bureaucracy to engage in this and then mobilize the riots the murder the death everything you see
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:03.200]  oh yeah it's pretty bad alex um so basically military weapons are being used on american
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:08.560]  citizens the social media is in on it these terrorist activities well that's why they're so
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:12.800]  arrogant because kushner knows all this i mean have you noticed that tucker carlsson's come out
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:17.920]  against kushner and it's just totally i mean risking his job everything to say that kushner
[2:29:17.920 --> 2:29:23.680]  works for the deep state is literally sabotaging trump yeah you have people within the deep state
[2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:28.400]  that are on the right wing side of things and right now they're trying to tell president trump
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:32.640]  not to have a strong response oh you don't want to be called a dictator president trump you don't
[2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:37.360]  want to be seen as too harsh they'll come you know the left will criticize them anyway today
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:44.640]  hashtag um president dictator trump dictatorship is trending so they don't care they're going to use
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:49.920]  anyway they'll gaslight they'll lie they'll smear him he needs to come down hard he needs to declare
[2:29:49.920 --> 2:29:54.720]  the insurrection insurrection act and he needs to get the national garden here exactly because
[2:29:54.720 --> 2:30:00.800]  this is a martial law we're being put into globalist martial law where we have no rights this is
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:05.760]  duly elected government needs to challenge this foreign globalist operation and stop it dead in
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:13.760]  its tracks oh yeah and we have democrats like for instance on uh the hunt hill bridge in dallas
[2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:20.480]  last night the military the national guard put up her tweet guys milley's tweet yes um they were
[2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:26.800]  able to actually corral the riders onto the bridge they had both sides of the bridge closed off
[2:30:26.800 --> 2:30:32.000]  they were trapped so the military police were able to make large arrests they arrested everyone
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:38.320]  hundreds of people about 300 people rioters terrorists okay were arrested and apprehended
[2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:43.840]  for breaking curfew that's what they were able to get them with now of course the leftists are all
[2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:49.680]  on social media saying these are peaceful protesters they're peaceful protesters no they're not they're
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:55.040]  criminals peaceful protesters don't break the law they don't commit crimes okay they wouldn't be out
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:30:59.840]  there because they wouldn't be wanting to violate a curfew that's not true look the whole point is
[2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:04.560]  is if somebody's caught on tape doing something they're a criminal this is done by foreign powers
[2:31:04.560 --> 2:31:09.360]  it's one thing that citizens do stuff is it lawful isn't it we look at each case this is a
[2:31:09.360 --> 2:31:14.640]  globalist literally saying they're overthrowing the country and like you said they don't care
[2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:19.120]  anymore they just brainwash kids they just put out fake news they say milley that we burned down
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:26.080]  the the homeless camp totally made up so as soon as myself and other law-abiding americans were
[2:31:26.080 --> 2:31:32.320]  applauding this you know capture of these rioters these terrorists sooner than we could even like
[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:36.560]  enjoy the fact that these people are being apprehended and we can sleep peacefully and
[2:31:36.560 --> 2:31:44.960]  rest peacefully we hear that the democrat da john crutes decides he's going to release them
[2:31:44.960 --> 2:31:50.240]  so the military police take all these these rioters these terrorists down at the corner you
[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:55.360]  have the blue states and blue cities encouraging insurrection to kill the economy and that's the
[2:31:55.360 --> 2:32:01.200]  bottom line the covet hoax this whole thing is about depression folks wrecking the country because
[2:32:01.200 --> 2:32:06.560]  we didn't go along with the new world order aren't milley you it's great that you let this out today

[2:33:18.480 --> 2:33:24.240]  so horrible though that i started crying watching it like weird pervert looking dudes man with your
[2:33:24.240 --> 2:33:31.120]  kids i mean we're talking like jeffrey dommer looking people like commie perverts man while your
[2:33:31.120 --> 2:33:35.920]  kids at school they are literally under comic control when this footage comes out it's way worse
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:41.440]  than the pedo gate stuff i mean this is just they're molesting their minds i don't like coming to you
[2:33:41.440 --> 2:33:45.360]  every day on the radio and tv stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:50.240]  these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:57.040]  true we were warning everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:00.800]  put a fence around it if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:05.280]  hit their head and drown people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:09.280]  ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world the collapse of the first world
[2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:15.440]  and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:20.480]  it they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:26.240]  they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy i know
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:31.520]  all this sounds insane when i was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:36.800]  their operations manual i wish this wasn't the case but they're really our evil psychopaths in
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:42.320]  control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them i'm always excited about info wars
[2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:46.160]  life products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:52.240]  war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:35:00.960]  development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:08.320]  essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just
[2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:15.120]  pour out a bunch of thick gross goo goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:20.320]  way i like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:25.680]  it around your eyes but i just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:29.600]  show this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:35.680]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:46.400]  refreshing this is a big winner the united states is not communist china we don't have three million
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:52.240]  people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:58.960]  sell their organs but all over the news we see the u n billable indicates who mainstream corporate
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:05.120]  media praising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:09.920]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:15.120]  that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:21.120]  virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:26.000]  control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:31.920]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video
[2:36:31.920 --> 2:36:37.520]  and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able
[2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:45.120]  to defeat their operation that much quicker info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just
[2:36:45.120 --> 2:36:51.600]  american freedom but worldwide maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host of info wars
[2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:57.200]  or the researchers or the journalists it's you the listeners the activists the people on the
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:37:02.880]  front lines in the arena and it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interviewed
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.680]  that make info wars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds
[2:37:07.680 --> 2:37:12.560]  we're having an open discussion about the real state of the world not the establishment and
[2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:16.640]  talking points that are put out by the council in final relations the builder burden group
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:24.000]  davos group and other club we're pushing for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:30.320]  based on humans for humans by humans not a world where the establishment hate themselves
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:35.120]  protect their hate onto us and decide we're gonna have a post human world i'm really excited to
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:40.480]  know that info wars has your support and i want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:46.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:46.640 --> 2:38:05.680]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's rex jones the answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:13.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show well we knew this was coming a long time ago we made
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:19.920]  preparation for it and now it's just exactly as nasty and ugly and disgusting as we thought it was
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:27.600]  but we're not caught flat-footed and the generations of americans continue on and my son
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:34.400]  who's been on air for 18 years here popping in and out rex jones is here you know he's a little
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:38.400]  bit of trouble with me he came in this morning he showed me this video right before i went live on
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.360]  there and he said yeah this happened sunday two days ago and about he got the footage today
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:50.320]  from the local convenience store by my parents he was over there visiting but this is bigger than
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:56.880]  rex jones or alex jones it's that two gun shops of the three or four i've ever bought guns from
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:02.640]  have been robbed in austin everybody i know is that their house is broken into their car or they've
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:10.480]  been carjacked i mean it my phone rings off the hook with crime and it's zombie black people white
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:16.160]  people you name it attacking other people because the green light like the purge is go out and attack
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:21.520]  but it's not white people give me the green light black people it's just a lawlessness over the past
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:27.040]  two or three years i have personally seen austin go dramatically downhill and these these riots in
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:31.200]  the covet thing it's an excuse for these people to just go out and be crazy and that's what i saw
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:36.320]  that's what i had to deal with it was completely insane the dude runs in to start screaming i'm
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:42.400]  protesting i'm protesting i got a picture you're gonna drive me crazy let's just fix your piece
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:49.600]  here you go like popped out of here here you go ahead there's your earpiece is fixed anyways my
[2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:56.000]  little baby's here my first born rex no but i mean because they tell people be homeless use drugs
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:00.400]  that they take the welfare check and buy drugs this is a democrat formula to bring things down
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:06.080]  so we're gonna play this video here in a second and talk about what happened when the police said
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:11.200]  no he's a protester he's allowed to loot you try to take the cash register the they cut so what
[2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:16.320]  happened was let's start over let's start over start the beginning all right it's like 11 pm i
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:22.560]  walk into the gas station i buy ramen i go to the counter to pay for my ramen about halfway as a
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:28.000]  very trashy you're eating that whatever man whatever i was hungry so i'm walking to the counter
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:34.800]  with my ramen this dude runs in don't say ramen again with my food this dude runs in
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:39.920]  just starts yelling i'm protesting i'm protesting i'm protesting and grabs everything in sight
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:45.440]  he's running around the store so one of the clerks calls the cops the other dude tries to stop him
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:48.800]  he goes for the lottery ticket starts trying to break in the plastic lottery ticket thing
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:54.720]  at that point the uh store attendant with the man bun puts his hand on him and then the crackhead
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:40:59.520]  proceeds to drag him over to the open beer thing over there and starts smashing his head into the
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:06.880]  side of it and as you can see there i was i jumped in i tried to i stopped the crackhead i hit the
[2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:11.680]  crackhead about eight times hard on the side of the head and he looked up at me with like gerbil eyes
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:15.840]  who's clearly whacked out on like pcp or something crazy and proceeded to run to the front of the
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:20.160]  store and threw a carton of fruit on me i punched him in the face again i broke his nose at that
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:26.000]  point he ran out of the store cops come cops cuff him he tells the cops that i assaulted him
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:30.880]  that the store owners are trying to steal from him and that he wanted me arrested and that he was
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:36.800]  protesting the cops holding there for like five or ten minutes they let him go he proceeds to pass
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:43.120]  out bloody in front of the store this is america this is america in 2020 this is america we're
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:48.480]  rioting and looting and pillaging is totally normal because george floyd who in my opinion was
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.120]  murdered because this because this happened because this one dude was murdered it justifies
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:57.840]  the looting and pillaging and robbing coming out now though that this this bar they ran was like a
[2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:02.560]  whorehouse drug dealing facility and the cops were involved floyd was involved it looks like some kind
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:07.120]  of like gangland stuff that i don't know the whole situation from what i saw i don't like it but my
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:12.000]  point being is even if he was a bad person which i don't think he was my point being is this whole
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:17.920]  situation this that does not justify this kind of behavior the killing of one man justifies
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:23.200]  protest justifies outrage but doesn't justify the burning of cities it doesn't justify this i mean
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:26.720]  you know your only problem is you're hitting with the back of the head you should have uppercut
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:31.600]  but you want to hit that would have been a lot better breakfast you know i was scared in that
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:35.040]  situation i didn't know what to do you can see me there go back to the video good well no no no no
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:40.640]  no i'm being honest not bad i have my what whatever and maybe i should hit you in the face um yeah
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:44.800]  look look in that situation i was scared there was like a six foot six dude standing that guy's
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:48.560]  that guy's huge the camera doesn't do him justice i kept on looking over to him thinking he would
[2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:52.800]  do something and then at one point i was just like all right i guess i had to jump in and do something
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:57.280]  and i'll be honest the host i was terrified but i mean i had to do it and now that i've been
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:02.480]  in that all i know is we love our somalis oh they're so good others we love our no we love our
[2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:10.480]  somalis we love our muslims too oh they're so good oh they're so sweet they're gonna stab
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:18.800]  your daughter at the mall gonna stab your daughter at the mall gonna stab your your wife your son
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:27.760]  say it your wife your son and then the police chief's gonna say we love our somalis we love our
[2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:35.680]  muslims oh they're so good oh they're so sweet that's good stuff right there you're in a good mood
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:40.880]  today top man well you're threatened appearing again so you're in a good mood for others this let's
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:45.840]  get back to talking about the horrible stuff going on i personally know people not friends of mine i
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:50.880]  know people and i've seen their posts on snapchat and instagram social media i know like juniors
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:55.760]  in high school that are going out and looting liquor stores this stuff it's just further i'm
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:59.200]  telling you like i want listeners to know because i know you're all in your community you're seeing
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:04.560]  what you're seeing i'm here in austin texas it's robbery land i mean because i'm out of people
[2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:08.880]  those people just don't care it's my house out the other day and i don't like get out of the car
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:14.080]  start reaching for my shotgun i mean it's getting bad you are not safe unless you are armed and i
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:18.400]  think that the gun control argument for one is dead after this you can't say there's no reason
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:23.600]  for you to need it and they are 15 after after cities are on fire i mean but as long as the police
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:28.800]  bow to the blm everything's okay and why haven't we heard anything about covet 19 why haven't we
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:32.240]  heard anything about coronavirus because the german government came out and said it is an official
[2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:39.680]  hoax this is america 2020 cities are on fire job here's the deal we're gonna get a pressure to
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:43.680]  have a critical police when they're going under globalist control and being nanny states and i've
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:46.400]  got problems with them just like government but they're the they're the bottom of the government
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:50.720]  you know the rubber meets the roads i don't make it about them like i'm against the tsa doing stuff
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:57.280]  but i'm not against the tsa agent but these leaders of the police i mean what are we paying you for
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:06.800]  for when you sit there and they're doing contact tracing and six degrees of separation
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:14.080]  enforcement in new york in texas in california have all the videos where the police are making
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:19.680]  sure social distancing is happening arresting people while two miles away buildings are burning
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:23.680]  it's completely insane i mean do you remember when um you remember when in richmond virginia
[2:45:23.680 --> 2:45:27.840]  you remember there was a gun when there was a gun protest that was seen as terrorism but this is
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:33.280]  protesting cities are on fire that's right going and exercising 50 000 gun owners not one crime
[2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:38.960]  committed only one leftist arrested and that's when the globalist launched covid 19 and this they got
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:43.520]  so pissed they went oh my god they're gonna have 50 000 gun owners together and they all acted unison
[2:45:43.520 --> 2:45:48.400]  and a third of them were probably black or a bunch of asians too that made the globalist
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:53.680]  rap bricks all these racist leftists that are obsessed with race-based narratives like we're us being
[2:45:53.680 --> 2:45:58.720]  unified by the right to self-defense this wasn't even like the store that got robbed i i've i've
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:04.080]  i love the lady in the uh in the personal scooter being beat up i mean i don't love it it's disgusting
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:09.920]  oh my god i like oh look she's a white lady let's beat her up and spray a firing stick with her
[2:46:09.920 --> 2:46:16.800]  on her like what is that like how is this woman your enemy there is no if in six months everyone
[2:46:16.800 --> 2:46:23.600]  is going to forget about this sadly like if this doesn't turn into a civil war people will forget
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:27.840]  about it but in six months when david hog and all those freaking people are tweeting about how we
[2:46:27.840 --> 2:46:32.720]  need gun control and there's no reason for you to own large capacity magazines you need to show videos
[2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:37.600]  from this from this whole incident because when cities are on fire when stores are being looted
[2:46:37.600 --> 2:46:41.120]  when people are being stabbed and murdered in the streets and killed when people are being beaten to
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:46.880]  death by hordes and angry leftists this is why the second woman exists i agree so let's go back
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:51.040]  let's go back to the sky because you only got some of the surveillance footage you're just in there
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:56.000]  and he starts attacking him in there he starts attacking people he so first off his pants are
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:01.360]  down to his ankles he starts throwing literally everything he can get chips drinks whatever in
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:07.120]  his pants and then he makes a beeline like santa claus's bag it was insane no it was completely
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:11.120]  insane and he runs over and starts trying to break into the lottery ticket thing he's going for
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:16.800]  lottery tickets the guy with the man bun there the guy with the man bun there um on the right
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:20.640]  side of the screen he tries to stop him he pulls him over by his hair and starts beating his head
[2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:23.600]  into the side of the open beer container thing i don't know what it's called but it's where they
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:30.080]  keep the uh like poor locals and stuff it's really bad it's really bad footage i mean you had to be
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:35.760]  there that guy had a dead gerbil eyes like i hit him in the back of the head eight times really
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:41.120]  hard i'm like i weigh like i weigh 205 pounds like it hurt and he like reared his head up like
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:47.200]  the terminator and his he had no iris all pupil runs over to the front of the store throws a
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:52.000]  like box of fruit at me i punched him in the face i broke his nose he runs out of the he runs out
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:57.920]  into the street and escapes like two minutes later the cops come he comes back to the store
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:02.240]  pointing and screaming at me and saying that i assaulted him and that he was actually can't
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:05.600]  be around this stuff he should what do you mean i can't be around i was at a gas station getting
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:11.680]  food no i understand but i mean i was nowhere in your downtown this is my fault this guy's a crazy
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:18.480]  fact you're too valuable do not engage the crackheads do not engage your crackheads not unless
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:23.360]  you know i had no choice man it's my here's where i'm at i'm carrying a gun and so somebody attacks
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:27.840]  me you're gonna talk to the you're gonna talk to the bullets i'm not i'm too old i'm not using
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:36.880]  fists anymore the right back this is the end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:45.520]  plans the end of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:53.440]  gentlemen because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:59.120]  never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:04.480]  just like the history books show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:10.240]  and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their people
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:16.160]  sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:23.760]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:29.120]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:36.000]  and your prayers now it's official the united nations came out yesterday and said the covet
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:42.160]  emergency will last five years and the uk government said you must all carry cell phones
[2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:47.360]  outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:53.600]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:59.440]  detained yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:06.560]  jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:11.680]  from the beginning of my research it was clear the globalist art authoritarian anti-human group
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:16.960]  they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:24.800]  which is global depopulation so you see submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:31.040]  expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:37.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:54.960]  well i can see the headline alex jones's son burns down gas station murders innocent man in
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:51:00.160]  wheelchair as they say they say we burned down the uh i'm sure i'm anti for camp
[2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:04.240]  doesn't matter we have all the ac flows we didn't i'm sure i'll be accused of committing a hate crime
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:10.560]  yeah yeah yeah yeah all right look in closing paul joseph watson's about to take over um
[2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:16.160]  this is a very dangerous time right now it's a very very sad time and all these criminals have
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:19.760]  been given a green light to go crazy what do you think's coming next you know what i have never
[2:51:19.760 --> 2:51:25.360]  felt this generally uneasy about like i have a i have this big fear of a really horrible mass
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:28.480]  shooting happening in the next couple of weeks i think elin and you are right i think they're
[2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:31.520]  gonna stage a mass shooting i think that there's gonna be at least 30 they're gonna say a white
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:35.680]  supremacist kills a bunch of black people yep to trigger them trigger the martial law it'll be
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:39.840]  a it'll be some guy that's whacked out on ssri's he's gonna kill whole mob people it's gonna be
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:44.320]  really bad i have this horrible feeling about what's coming up because this is the perfect
[2:51:44.320 --> 2:51:49.040]  storm this is what they've always wanted you've had people locked in their homes for two or three
[2:51:49.040 --> 2:51:53.520]  months you have people that are angry and outraged about the death of this man give people out in
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:59.680]  the streets burning and looting and pillaging it only takes one person to go out that they might
[2:51:59.680 --> 2:52:03.760]  set up it only takes it only this is the perfect time for a false flag that's what i'm trying to
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:10.320]  say we're in the season of it this this is exactly what they need to get the focus off of them because
[2:52:10.320 --> 2:52:15.040]  and get the focus off of them and get the focus onto the issues that they what they want to press
[2:52:15.040 --> 2:52:22.320]  so we should start fake hashtag fake mass shooting right now because it's coming i a hundred percent
[2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:26.720]  believe in the next week or two there are going to be at least 10 people dead in some major city
[2:52:26.720 --> 2:52:31.680]  in the u.s well they're already killed a bunch of cops and all day we look for the names of the police
[2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:33.680]  they weren't even put the names out of the cops they shot
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:40.720]  yeah about that because they won't and it's not about how about worse than police it's about
[2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:45.680]  humans alex they're like alex their lives don't matter now we're supposed to say daddy alex we'll
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:51.600]  say papa i'm confronting racism right now you see they're their lives don't matter do you understand
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:55.200]  that as a white person you're not allowed to speak of speak about the issues of people of color

[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:51.040]  in this together live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:57:02.320]  we are live and where to start i tweeted this earlier we live in an era where truth
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:09.840]  is not determined by objective reality but by fear of consequences from the mob if you don't accept
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:15.760]  and amplify their version of it and i got a little taste of that because we have our own
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:21.600]  black lives matter protests going on in london right now of course we had anti lockdown protests a
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:26.720]  couple of weeks ago the media publicly humiliated and shamed the people involved in those and many
[2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:33.600]  of them were arrested for not social distancing but thousands of black lives matter and t for
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:41.600]  protesters descended on the u.s embassy on sunday afternoon to protest against the death of george
[2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:49.200]  floyd and i had the great honor to be stuck right in the middle of that protest in a car on a boiling
[2:57:49.200 --> 2:57:56.320]  hot day with a massive hangover the two hours solid and this is what happened basically they
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:01.360]  blocked the end of the road where the u.s embassy is which is like nine minutes away from where i live
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:06.480]  blocked the road there was a line of police probably about 20 police officers doing absolutely
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:11.360]  nothing of course they were probably you know the rest of them were probably busy arresting people
[2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:16.480]  for mean tweets arresting fathers of grooming gang victims because apparently that's more important
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:24.000]  they were doing nothing the protesters were blocking the road and the protesters both black
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:32.080]  and white were walking in between all the cars as they were stuck you can find this on my twitter by
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:38.160]  the way there is there's a video of the protest near west minstead there's another one if you scroll
[2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:43.360]  right down on my profile there's a video where there's a us flag in the video and all these protesters
[2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:48.400]  and all these cars that's where i was stuck and the protesters again both black and white
[2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:56.560]  would go in between the cars glaring at the people in the vehicles to check the evidence of
[2:58:57.200 --> 2:59:02.480]  face crime now what is face crime well it's something that was enforced by the party
[2:59:03.040 --> 2:59:11.200]  in george orwell's 1984 and it was described as to wear an improper expression on your face
[2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:17.760]  and of course that meant if you weren't showing enough fealty enough enthusiasm for the party for
[2:59:17.760 --> 2:59:24.400]  big brother enough hatred against goldstein in terms of the two minutes hate then you were deemed to
[2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:31.120]  be suspect and that's exactly what was happening during this black lives matter protest down there
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:36.400]  at the us embassy so they were glaring at everybody in the cars the white people in the cars again
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:42.320]  both black and white demonstrators if you didn't show fealty if you didn't give a thumbs up if you
[2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:49.760]  didn't beat in support of black lives matter then you were harassed and we had to roll up the windows
[2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:54.320]  because they were trying to get in the windows they were trying to put flyers in the windows because
[2:59:54.320 --> 3:00:01.040]  i had an improper facial expression because i wasn't supporting their protest literally did
[3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:06.720]  a massive hangover and three hours sleep whoever was there with me stuck in a boiling hot car for
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:10.720]  two hours i wasn't going to be very happy about it but they were banging on the windows they were
[3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:15.040]  harassing people they were trying to put flyers through the windows and saying you're not showing
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:19.440]  the proper support you need to check your white privilege here's a flyer you need to read this
[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:25.920]  so i got a little taste of that on sunday there you see the video and i was writing the blood
[3:00:25.920 --> 3:00:34.400]  of that and now today that spilled over into blackout tuesday which the guys are talking about
[3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:40.320]  there before the break headline out of the guardian blackout tuesday black squares dominate social
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:45.840]  media and spark debate there's millions of white girls posting images of black squares on instagram
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:52.800]  is surely going to end racism right and what's even more interesting is that i know people
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:59.120]  like rex was talking about before i know people from my past i don't really speak to that much
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  anymore but you know still follow them on social media on instagram and they know all about antifa
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:11.600]  they know all about black lives matter they know all about this looting this rioting these beatings
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:17.440]  of innocent people setting fire to businesses owned by black people they know all about it
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:26.000]  but even they have been cow-towed into amplifying this mob message of supporting black lives matter
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  of supporting antifa with this blackout tuesday the protest movement sparked by the death and
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:36.160]  police custody of george floyd and minneapolis spread from the music business to social media on
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:40.560]  tuesday there's major institutions around the world posted black squares and stopped online
[3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:47.120]  activity in solidarity and again this is also being led by the celebrities some of whom have
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:54.320]  donated up to two hundred thousand dollars to get these criminals these rioters out of jail
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:01:59.920]  in fact i'm going to go on to a story in the next segment where there's literally a woman
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:07.120]  crying her eyes out because her sister was killed by a protester how many celebrities is seth rogan
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:13.760]  going to donate to that that family her sister was literally shot by another protester and is now
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:20.240]  dead as she was leaving a protest in ohio is she going to get a single dollar from these
[3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:25.280]  celebrities who are paying up to two hundred thousand dollars to bail criminals out of jail
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:30.960]  are any of those businesses owned by black people going to get a single dollar from these
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:36.960]  celebrities who are donating up to two hundred thousand dollars to bail out rioters and criminals
[3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:43.520]  from jail not so far that i've seen there was a go fund me for the guy who lost his business
[3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:48.640]  back a couple of days ago and went viral but again that was you know the donations came
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:53.600]  straight from the people i didn't see any celebrity supporting that didn't see any major
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:03:00.400]  corporation supporting that on that subject headline apple freezes browse feature of music
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:06.960]  app and replaces it with f the police playlist yes now you can't even choose your own music
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:13.920]  on the apple music app if you go to the browse feature or the radio feature they're completely
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:20.240]  inactive today and have been replaced by an f the police playlist you don't know what f the police
[3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:26.880]  is it's a song by nwa and it includes these lyrics remember this is the apple corporation
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:32.480]  endorsing this quote be a police out of shape and when i'm finished bring the yellow tape to
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:38.800]  tape off the scene of the slaughter punk police are afraid of me a young n word on the warpath
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:45.200]  and when i'm finished it's going to be a bloodbath of cops dying in la this message is endorsed by
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:51.680]  apple very mind apple the same corporation that uses chinese slave labour in factories where they
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:56.800]  literally have to put suicide nets around the factories because the workers are so abused
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:03.040]  and want to kill themselves on a regular basis but yeah they really care about injustice this is
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:11.520]  the same corporation that removed an app from their store that was enabling the hong kong protesters
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:19.440]  to organize in their protests against chinese communist government oppression removed the
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:25.600]  app that helped them organize but they really care about injustice absolutely incredible now
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:32.640]  they're controlling what music you can listen to on their app and again it goes back to you
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:38.160]  don't fall in line with the mob virtue signaling is now not enough i'm going to get onto another
[3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:44.800]  story of a fashion designer who didn't donate enough money to black lives matter so now he's
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:52.080]  been publicly shamed so silence if you just don't say anything about it the mob will come after you
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:57.440]  anyway if you do say something about it and if you support it but not vehemently enough the mob
[3:04:57.440 --> 3:05:04.080]  will come after you anyway this is mob rule writ large absolutely incredible and in fact
[3:05:04.080 --> 3:05:11.760]  we'll play it after the break but there's a clip from doctor who from about 10 15 years ago where
[3:05:11.760 --> 3:05:17.280]  everybody's receiving the same information on their phones and it's eliciting the same reactions and
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:24.880]  it's it's parallel with what apple's doing today with this feature on their app meanwhile
[3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:30.480]  nicolodian frightens children with i can't breathe virtue signal we're going to play this
[3:05:30.480 --> 3:05:36.560]  clip after the break as well and the woman who posted this clip by the way he was a trump supporter
[3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:42.480]  it's a video of a promo played on nicolodian where they play this creepy heavy breathing
[3:05:42.480 --> 3:05:47.840]  sound and then i can't breathe is a text that's flashed up to children the kids crying in the
[3:05:47.840 --> 3:05:52.800]  background saying he's scared please turn it off this woman's on the video which was uploaded to
[3:05:52.800 --> 3:05:59.440]  twitter saying no i just want to see what this message says that went viral overnight i think
[3:05:59.440 --> 3:06:05.840]  it got about three million views about an hour ago she had to delete her entire twitter account
[3:06:05.840 --> 3:06:13.200]  because again she was getting death threats violent threats intimidation from the mob if you don't
[3:06:13.200 --> 3:06:19.200]  support their message they will come after you like never before i'm going to get into that and
[3:06:19.200 --> 3:06:24.240]  more and also talk about the origins of the black lives matter movement because of course cnn still
[3:06:24.240 --> 3:06:30.000]  tells us that they're all peaceful loving tolerant people yet if you look at who their inspirational
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:35.680]  guru is suggests something very different we'll get into that and more on the other side summit
[3:06:35.680 --> 3:06:40.960]  dot news don't go away it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:48.240]  up the world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:53.280]  shut down for two months it is going to be a death sentence the third world and a horrible night
[3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:58.320]  marriage collapse for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep
[3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:04.880]  debt to the mega banks they're not going to have medical ID cards force inoculations we are now in
[3:07:04.880 --> 3:07:12.640]  a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against
[3:07:12.640 --> 3:07:17.920]  this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our
[3:07:17.920 --> 3:07:23.760]  backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business
[3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:29.280]  down shut your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already starve to death tens
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:33.520]  of millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have
[3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:39.920]  destroyed your lives and our lives congratulations hey guys rob do here with info wars store
[3:07:39.920 --> 3:07:43.840]  dot com and i want to tell you about something that i think has really helped me out and i think
[3:07:43.840 --> 3:07:48.800]  can help you out too especially if you have any problems sleeping and that's knockout let's face
[3:07:48.800 --> 3:07:54.560]  it our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown this government imposed imprisonment
[3:07:54.560 --> 3:07:58.800]  and it is definitely affected my sleep schedule but one thing that has helped is knockout i take one
[3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:03.120]  pill about an hour before i want to go to bed and boom i get a great night's sleep and just this past
[3:08:03.120 --> 3:08:09.120]  memorial day i took two of them fell asleep about one a.m woke up at eight a.m ready to go it really
[3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:13.040]  has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life too if you don't get any
[3:08:13.040 --> 3:08:16.640]  sleep you're going to be a grouch if you get great sleep you're going to be on point you're going to

[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:46.880]  it's available at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:09:03.360]  so virtue signaling has evolved from people echoing social justice dogma from brownie
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:09.200]  ponds to people echoing social justice dogma because they're so terrified of their friends
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:16.160]  their colleagues attacking them but not loudly proclaiming that they share the same opinion as
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:22.240]  everyone else this enforcement of uniformity of thinking is perhaps one of the most chilling
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:28.480]  things to come out for the past few days because below the rioting looting and rampant violence
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:33.840]  that we've seen across america we also have transnational entertainment corporations
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:41.440]  currently prostrating themselves to support protests in america they were noticeably silent
[3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:46.960]  weren't they when protesters were demonstrating against chinese communist oppression in hong kong
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:53.600]  and in fact many large corporations like the nba openly supported china during that vicious
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:10:00.400]  oppression of protesters in hong kong almost like the billions they make from china is more
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:06.080]  important than supporting justice and we see another example of that today with apple which again
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:12.080]  uses slave labor in china where at the factory they literally have to have suicide nets around
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:17.360]  the entire complex because people try to kill themselves on a regular basis but they care
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:23.840]  about justice now they've literally hijacked people's phones apple has frozen the browse feature on
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:28.160]  its music app and replaced it with a playlist that includes the song f the police which is about
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:33.520]  killing police officers in case you didn't know the stunt is part of blackout tuesday with celebrities
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:38.400]  and corporations bombarding social media with messages blacked out squares about how much they
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:43.920]  support the violent riots i mean protests taking place across america it's funny though now because
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:50.800]  within about three hours of this blackout tuesday trending they turned on each other once again and
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:55.600]  said well no putting a black square on instagram isn't really going to do much to address racial
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:01.200]  inequality so now those people are being attacked for doing that when a user tries to access the
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:05.600]  browse feature on the app they are met with a message that says instead fat support steadfast
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:10.320]  support the black voices that define music creativity and culture we use ours i've checked
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:15.280]  it on my own phone you can check it for yourself and one of the playlist tracks is f the police which
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:21.600]  is about killing cops faith goldy tweeted so apple music won't let me listen to my own music
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:26.560]  while i remain quarantined against my will it's forcing me to listen to rap music about burning
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:32.560]  down american cities then you have nicolodian which is also jumped on board with this uh
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:36.160]  massive corporate virtue signal because suddenly they really care about justice
[3:11:37.120 --> 3:11:41.520]  a video clip shows a frightened child asking his mother to turn off a nicolodian promo
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:46.480]  which features the sound of heavy breathing and the words i can't breathe as a corporate
[3:11:46.480 --> 3:11:51.520]  virtue signal to recognize the death of george floyd and we have that clip let's play it now
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:12:07.680]  okay i i will i just want to see what's happening here don't don't be scared
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:10.560]  don't be scared
[3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:19.440]  okay i will change it okay so there you have children being frightened and brainwashed
[3:12:19.440 --> 3:12:24.560]  with this message that black people are being indiscriminately targeted for death by cops which
[3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:29.440]  i'm going to get into the next segment is completely not true the very basis of these
[3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:34.880]  entire protests is completely erroneous but after the clip went viral that you just heard
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:39.520]  the mother was completely ripped apart by a hateful mob of respondents on twitter because of
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:46.160]  course she was in fact nicolodian was trending the words that she used in this tweet were trending
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:50.640]  got about two million views on the video and she deleted her entire twitter account because no
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:12:57.120]  doubt she was getting violent death threats in the messages in fact i remember i did a viral
[3:12:57.120 --> 3:13:04.480]  video about the pittsburgh riot so i think it was back in 2016 which got about 19 million
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:10.800]  views on facebook woke up the next day to about three dozen direct death threats because these
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:19.360]  people are very tolerant very loving hashtag be kind and of course apple changing your phone so you
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:26.000]  can't use the radio function or the browse function you have to listen to this pro blm playlist very
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:30.560]  reminiscent of a doctor who episode which somebody flagged up to me earlier which was
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:35.440]  broadcast about 10 years ago we also have that clip and we're going to roll it right now here it is
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:41.200]  like i said parallel world gingerbread house we need to get out of here as fast as we can
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:51.200]  what they all do
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:14:06.960]  stop
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:10.960]  is the ear pieces
[3:14:14.160 --> 3:14:16.720]  like bluetooth attachments but everyone's connected together
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:24.880]  it's on my phone it's automatic look it's downloading it's just what we're all getting
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:38.400]  news international news sports weather they get it direct downloaded right into their heads tv
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:46.080]  schedules lottery numbers everyone shares the same information the daily download published by
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:50.640]  cybers industry
[3:14:56.640 --> 3:15:02.160]  you're not you're obsessed with the latest upgrade all right not my love different mode remember
[3:15:06.320 --> 3:15:12.160]  so a dystopian alternate reality where the uniformity of people's opinions are enforced by
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:17.440]  mob intimidation as i've just talked about an automatic downloads to your phone by giant
[3:15:17.440 --> 3:15:25.200]  corporations so glad that that isn't happening to us oh it is headline despite corporate virtue
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:31.760]  signaling nike and amazon both targeted by rioters now yesterday or a few days ago i believe it was
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:36.800]  nike got on the board earlier they got on the bandwagon earlier with this corporate virtue
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:43.520]  signaling again nike of you know third world sweatshop fame they care about injustice tweeted a video
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:48.000]  in which the company urged people don't turn your back on racism don't pretend there's not a problem
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:53.760]  in america unless you're paying children slave wages in the third world then it's fine be part of the
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:16:01.840]  change then amazon also echo echoed that by tweeting this the inequitable brute treatment of black
[3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:07.040]  people in our country must stop do together we stand in solidarity with the black community
[3:16:07.040 --> 3:16:11.680]  nike stores all over america are being looted as you can see right here so that didn't really
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:19.040]  work did it and then amazon pledged their support for the rioters even as their own employees were
[3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:24.240]  being targeted by the mob and in this article you can see video footage out of santa monica
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:29.200]  california shows an amazon truck being ransacked by a group of what the media will no doubt describe
[3:16:29.200 --> 3:16:34.320]  as white nationalists because of course that's the narrative that they're running with you can
[3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:38.320]  see the mob looting the amazon delivery truck and knocking what looks like an old white lady to the
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:43.680]  ground while ripping the purse out of her hands in this video again a vicious attack by white
[3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:50.800]  nationalist so didn't work for nike didn't work for amazon their stores are getting looted their
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:56.000]  employees are getting attacked don't reckon nike really gives the damn about that though because
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:01.840]  of course they sponsored calling cappernick who started the whole take any movement and from
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:08.080]  that 2018 ad in which cappernick asserted believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:15.040]  just do it they made six billion dollars so is it really worth a few stores getting ransacked the
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:19.360]  loss of some stock that's six million dollar corporate virtue signal six billion dollar
[3:17:19.360 --> 3:17:25.280]  corporate virtue signal you bet it is absolutely incredible we're gonna come back and talk about
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:31.200]  the sister the woman whose sister was shot dead at a black lives matter protest it's getting
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:37.200]  next to zero media attention as you would expect we'll be back i was talking to my wife tonight and
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:43.040]  i was saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it
[3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:48.000]  runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies she said oh yeah when i
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:53.280]  grew up in oman, Nebraska one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another
[3:17:53.280 --> 3:17:58.800]  man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out a huge hole and he was
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:03.840]  holding it he walked around gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:10.240]  over dead well that's what's gonna happen with our economy it is in cardiac arrest this has been done
[3:18:10.240 --> 3:18:16.240]  by design and the un the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep
[3:18:16.240 --> 3:18:22.320]  the economy closed so remember the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on
[3:18:22.320 --> 3:18:29.600]  the un on billa melinda gates on obama on hillary on biden on the democrats we tried to stop it we
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:34.640]  tried to fight it but you guys said you want to wreck america and the world and now you've done it

[3:20:55.840 --> 3:21:04.800]  you are listening to her joseph watson so celebrities and ordinary people alike are being
[3:21:04.800 --> 3:21:09.600]  publicly shamed and cancelled for not virtue signaling hard enough that's the stage that we
[3:21:09.600 --> 3:21:16.160]  reach the actress emma watson is trending on twitter at the moment because she posted three
[3:21:16.160 --> 3:21:22.320]  black squares on instagram not the one that was demanded by the mob and then she also posted three
[3:21:22.320 --> 3:21:29.040]  white squares on her instagram page so it wouldn't ruin the aesthetic now emma watson is being publicly
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:37.120]  humiliated and cancelled on twitter by the mob by the way in the uk where we had the
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:44.400]  clap for the nhs every week for the past six weeks the same nhs that moved all the coronavirus
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:49.200]  victims elderly coronavirus victims out of hospitals and into care homes and killed thousands
[3:21:49.200 --> 3:21:55.280]  more people yeah that nhs who we applaud every week because they're so good now there's going to be
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:22:01.760]  and take a knee for george floyd and that's going to take place from wednesday third of june tomorrow
[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:07.760]  at six p.m i presume it'd be more silent than the applause and the fireworks and the bagpipes
[3:22:07.760 --> 3:22:14.320]  that we've seen for the nhs but i'm sure after they take a knee for george floyd they will be
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:20.320]  applauding themselves afterwards and posting it on social media because they're such good allies
[3:22:20.960 --> 3:22:26.640]  speaking of that video woman kneels on demand in the street to apologize for her white privilege
[3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:31.280]  the video clip shows a woman immediately obeying a black man's request to kneel on her feet in the
[3:22:31.280 --> 3:22:35.760]  street and apologize for her white privilege i think we've got the clip let's play it now i'll
[3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:41.280]  speak over it it's fine so basically he's pointing at her he's giving her like hand gestures like
[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:47.760]  he's training a dog to roll over runs up to her on the street i think he's probably trolling because
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:53.120]  he says i work for black lives matter and that the ceo of the company has told him to come out
[3:22:53.760 --> 3:22:59.120]  tell white people to get on their knees so whether he's trolling or not is not the issue the issue
[3:22:59.120 --> 3:23:07.040]  is her reaction she immediately gets down on her knees and uh prostrates herself genuflex to this
[3:23:07.040 --> 3:23:13.920]  powerful black lives matter activist and apologizes for her white privilege although at the beginning
[3:23:13.920 --> 3:23:18.240]  of the encounter she seemed quite afraid of the black man a little bit of racism shining right
[3:23:18.240 --> 3:23:24.960]  through there so we have that going on we have cops across america literally taking a knee as their
[3:23:24.960 --> 3:23:30.640]  cities are burned and looted to the ground we love our law enforcement officers and we have this
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:37.200]  headliner of new york post luxury designer virgil abloh slammed for donating a measly 50
[3:23:37.200 --> 3:23:43.920]  dollars to protesters bail fund so because he only gave only gave 50 dollars to bail out criminals
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:49.200]  and looters that beat people up in the streets viciously now he's being publicly humiliated

[3:23:55.280 --> 3:24:01.680]  for being cheap into pouring their cause he's the artistic director of louis vuitton menswear
[3:24:01.680 --> 3:24:06.480]  he posted on his instagram stories that he had donated 50 dollars to protesters in need of bail
[3:24:06.480 --> 3:24:12.640]  money and after that or before that he'd made some other comments on his instagram which got him
[3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:19.280]  in some hot water again he wasn't showing enough vehement praise or the prostrating himself enough
[3:24:19.280 --> 3:24:26.000]  he's black by the way two black lives matter protesters he donates cash to bail out literal
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:34.160]  criminals but it's not enough so now he's being publicly humiliated and shamed meanwhile speaking

[3:31:29.760 --> 3:31:36.400]  body again thank you all for your support we are all in this together. I've hunted a lot of big game
[3:31:36.400 --> 3:31:43.600]  at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards even if you
[3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:50.560]  hit them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline
[3:31:50.560 --> 3:31:56.080]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they
[3:31:56.080 --> 3:32:02.160]  realize what's happened they fall over and they die then you go bag them and haul them back in
[3:32:02.880 --> 3:32:08.000]  well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:14.640]  show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[3:32:14.640 --> 3:32:19.280]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over
[3:32:19.280 --> 3:32:23.840]  100 million dead according to the UN and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN
[3:32:23.840 --> 3:32:28.240]  that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that thought it
[3:32:28.240 --> 3:32:32.160]  was their revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something
[3:32:32.160 --> 3:32:39.440]  better than what Hitler did feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to
[3:32:39.440 --> 3:32:45.040]  Latin America was the most common form of government you had a ruling class the nobility
[3:32:45.040 --> 3:32:49.680]  with a king and queen sitting on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence
[3:32:50.240 --> 3:32:56.800]  starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little people
[3:32:56.800 --> 3:33:02.560]  because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them
[3:33:02.560 --> 3:33:08.400]  again at a starving level they were so busy trying to survive they would never try to
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:12.880]  challenge the entrance to lead well now all the big google owners and the rocofellers and the
[3:33:12.880 --> 3:33:17.760]  Rothschilds the jeff bezos is the world they're sitting back on their giant estates with their
[3:33:17.760 --> 3:33:25.440]  jet helicopters and private jets living the life laughing at you shut down going bankrupt in the
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:31.760]  third world starving to death their religion is power and control and they are pressing that
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:39.840]  advantage against us we must break free from these monsters we're living in insanely dangerous times
[3:33:39.840 --> 3:33:44.320]  and i've told folks the one back three months ago i'm not buying storable food because i'm
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:48.720]  worried about the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and
[3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:53.680]  now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun it's already caused food shortages and the collapse
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:58.160]  of farms and ranches across the united states and it's even worse in the third world so i hope
[3:33:58.160 --> 3:34:02.400]  trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the
[3:34:02.400 --> 3:34:06.960]  covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on

[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:27.280]  people the claim that black people are indiscriminately disproportionately targeted in killings by
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:33.440]  white police officers is of course complete bonk it was bonk during the fergusson riots it was
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:40.720]  bonk during the pittsburgh riots and it's still bonk to this day lanidus johnson and i tweeted
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:46.960]  this earlier retweeted it who is black by the way got all these stats from the fbi crime statistics
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:53.200]  we've shown them many times before but he compiled them once again he tweeted this for every 10 000
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:59.040]  black people arrested for violent crime three are killed for every 10 000 white people arrested for
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:04.400]  violent crime four are killed and then idiots in the thread were saying oh but there's many more
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:09.600]  white people in american the black people know it's equal measures 10 000 black people
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:15.440]  10 000 white people arrested for violent crime the figures show from the fbi three are killed in the
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:20.480]  case of black people four are killed in the case of white people though again completely undermines
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:27.600]  the entire basis of this protest there you see his tweet right there brandham tatum tweeted today
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:35.520]  he's also black by the way there's about 44 million african americans in this country last year 245
[3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:44.560]  were killed by cops nine were unarmed if my math is correct that's 0.0000006 percent literally
[3:37:44.560 --> 3:37:51.600]  what are you all doing at this point john miller tweeted he's also black anyone gonna talk about
[3:37:51.600 --> 3:37:55.760]  how police shoot and kill twice as many white people as black people but does that ruin the
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:03.280]  whole oh lord we are being hunted narrative and of course stats put out by us news and will report
[3:38:03.280 --> 3:38:09.760]  using fbi data show that interracial killings whites killed by blacks is at least double
[3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:16.960]  blacks killed by whites and has been for the past 15 years but again hate facts don't matter when the
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:25.200]  truth is determined by a mob which intimidates people into having uniformity of opinion the facts
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:31.360]  don't matter the objective truth doesn't matter it's what you are intimidated into not only believing
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:37.440]  accepting but as we've seen with this blackout tuesday trend also amplifying if you don't amplify it
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:45.600]  then you're part of the problem meanwhile five years ago i wrote this article which is basically
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:51.520]  impossible to find now because google broke its own search engine to censors headline inspiration
[3:38:51.520 --> 3:38:58.160]  behind black lives matter is on the fbi's most wanted terrorist list yes the literal spiritual
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:04.480]  guru cited by the founders of black lives matter is literally a cop killing domestic
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:09.600]  terrorist on the run oh but it's a peaceful movement the inspiration behind black lives matter
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:15.680]  movement the individual cited by its founder regularly quoted by its supporters is a convicted
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:22.880]  cop killer who's on the fbi's most wanted terrorist list as far as i know still is black lives matter
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:29.760]  was founded by militant feminist elicia gaza patrice collars and opel tometi gaza widely
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:35.360]  recognized as the most influential of the three in an article which details the philosophical
[3:39:35.360 --> 3:39:41.440]  foundation of black lives matter gaza cites quote assaata's powerful demand in my organizing
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:46.640]  work who is she talking about she's talking about assaata chicor otherwise known as joanne
[3:39:46.640 --> 3:39:53.520]  debora chessy mod a radical feminist and marxist revolutionary who escaped from prison in 1979
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:40:00.480]  while serving a life sentence for the murder of new jersey state trooper werner forster that's right
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:08.000]  on may 2nd 1973 along with two other accomplices she killed forster execution style at point blank
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:14.080]  range during a routine traffic stop again this is the spiritual founder of black lives matter
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:19.840]  for chicor the shooting was culmination of years of militant radicalism during which she joined
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:25.440]  and left the black panther party because it was not violent enough and then the rest of the article
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:32.080]  goes through numerous other examples of her militant violence why she's on the run why she's
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:39.040]  in exile in cuba and why last time i checked at least she's still on the fbi's most wanted
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:48.560]  terrorist list but plm it's a peaceful organization of course during the 2014 to 2016 era there you
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:55.040]  see her most wanted page on the fbi's terrorist list website but it's a peaceful movement during
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:40:59.040]  that whole era before trump was elected in the two years before trump elected we saw
[3:40:59.040 --> 3:41:04.160]  much the same scenes as we're seeing now maybe we didn't see them in as many cities because you
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:09.200]  remember the ferguson riots the baltimore riots the pittsburgh riots during those riots
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:16.320]  blm protesters marched down the street in one case in new york enchanted what do we want
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:23.120]  dead cops when do we want it now but again it's a peaceful movement and as i document in this article
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:29.120]  last december this is talking about december 2014 ish mile brinsley you probably remember
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:36.400]  this one shot two nypd officers in the head as part of a quote revenge attack for the death of
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:41.680]  michael brown so these are literally terrorist attacks done in the name of black lives matter
[3:41:41.680 --> 3:41:46.960]  does that mean the entirety of black lives matter is terrorist no that's never been the argument
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:52.880]  but at its core it has a violent ethos and its spiritual guru it's literally a cop killing
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:59.840]  terrorists in june again this is 2015 two black lives matter supporters admitted to
[3:41:59.840 --> 3:42:04.960]  masterminding a plot to blow up a police station and kill numerous cops in ferguson Missouri
[3:42:04.960 --> 3:42:10.240]  again in an effort to avenge the death of michael brown armed black panthers also called for the
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:15.280]  murder of police officers during an open carry march the south by southwest festival in march
[3:42:15.280 --> 3:42:22.160]  2015 chanting the only good pig is a pig that's dead but again this is a peaceful movement you
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:27.520]  of course probably remember the horrific on air shooting of those two news reporters
[3:42:28.080 --> 3:42:34.560]  alison parker and adam ward by a gunman called brice williams that occurred back in 2015 why
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:40.960]  did he shoot them well in his own words to inflame a race war and as i document in this article
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:47.040]  both the nypd killings and the deaths of parker ward were celebrated by supporters of black lives
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:55.680]  matter then you fast forward to 2016 of course right before the election series election season
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:03.040]  really got into high gear we had the killings of police officers in dallas headline police chief
[3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:09.040]  suspect upset about black lives matter wanted to quote kill white people this was the guy
[3:43:09.040 --> 3:43:17.600]  who killed five dallas police officers back in july 2016 you probably remember the horrific
[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:22.160]  scenes during that time well dallas police chief david brown said the prime suspect behind the
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:28.480]  sniper attack on police was a black lives matter sympathizer who quote wanted to kill white people
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:33.200]  this is what he said quote the suspect said he was upset about black lives matter he said he was
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:39.520]  upset about the recent police shooting so we have numerous examples of black lives matter
[3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:46.320]  supporters literally carrying out terrorist attacks calling for dead cops killing cops including
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:52.240]  that horrific event in dallas and as you see from last night this video several examples
[3:43:52.240 --> 3:43:59.680]  three that i linked to just in the one article of quote protesters literally running over cops
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:04.480]  making their bodies horrifically contort and fly up into the air another police officer in this
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:11.120]  instance being beaten by two protesters on the streets but again it's a peaceful movement
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:18.000]  meanwhile new york cops enforce social distancing despite riots just two miles away
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:22.880]  which reminds me in the uk last week we had an entire week's news cycle of the media whining
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:28.080]  about one government advisor because he broke social distancing rules to provide urgent care for his
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:35.840]  child by driving up north few days later literally thousands of blm and tifa protesters congregate
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:41.760]  in london suddenly all concerns about social distancing remember they said to the anti-lockdown
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:46.960]  protesters in america that they were literally killing granny by going out on the streets and
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:53.360]  protesting when thousands of people riot and loot concerns about social distancing have suddenly
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:58.560]  been dropped haven't they meanwhile last vegas cop on life support after being shot in the head by
[3:44:58.560 --> 3:45:05.280]  rioter that's not getting very much news attention there were also four cops shot in uh so saint louis
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:11.200]  last night they're still in hospital thankfully it looks like they will survive meanwhile some good
[3:45:11.200 --> 3:45:16.320]  news poll finds clear majority of americans want military to help police deal with riots and even
[3:45:16.320 --> 3:45:22.480]  a majority of democrats want that so again the silent majorities may be now having its voice
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:27.120]  that's going to wrap it up
