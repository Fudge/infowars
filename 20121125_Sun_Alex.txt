[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.440]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.480 --> 00:17.520]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:17.520 --> 00:19.520]  Oh
[00:26.960 --> 00:30.800]  It is Sunday the 25th day of November
[00:32.360 --> 00:35.200]  2012 I am your host Alex Jones
[00:36.400 --> 00:42.680]  And we have got an incredibly important transmission lined up for you yet again today on
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.680]  a host of
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.520]  Of issues across the board here
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.200]  we're going to be getting into
[00:51.680 --> 00:53.680]  The cyber security
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.960]  Directive that Obama signed a week and a half ago, which Congress I was reading an article last night has
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.760]  Complained they're not allowed to see
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.160]  How is it that Congress that's co-equal to the executive in the judicial?
[01:09.160 --> 01:11.160]  How
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.920]  Can the legislative that's co-equal to the executive and the judicial
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.960]  How can it not be privy to the president's secret order see Congress wouldn't give Obama what he wanted on cyber security?
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.120]  In hands control the internet over to globalist over the UN and others and
[01:31.360 --> 01:36.760]  So it was really hitting me last night that he said he'd do a executive order to just do it
[01:36.760 --> 01:43.080]  But still that executive order would be public. So he just said I just signed another order and by the way it's secret and
[01:44.160 --> 01:46.920]  Whereas the internet's a double-edged sword you can use it
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.560]  To reach incredible amounts of people the system knows how to game it
[01:52.200 --> 01:54.200]  Just like a black box voting machine
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.560]  Here's an example
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.600]  20 plus videos just disappeared off our YouTube channel
[02:02.200 --> 02:04.920]  And I called and talked to the people involved with it
[02:04.920 --> 02:09.920]  They didn't delete 20 plus videos, but it says deleted by user
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.280]  And that's just an example of when you're on another
[02:13.960 --> 02:20.240]  Platform where you think it's your website. You think it's your content your ideas your video your art
[02:20.720 --> 02:24.520]  But they can just disappear it whenever they want
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.440]  One time they deleted change the channel. He was out of town visiting family didn't even have his computer with him
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.080]  He was at a picnic. I called his cell phone number
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.400]  Was named Ken Webb nice fella about a year and a half ago
[02:40.400 --> 02:43.000]  I've only had like seven million views on that particular video now
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.520]  It's like 12 million on that particular video plus there's a bunch of different versions of it
[02:47.520 --> 02:50.800]  But he uploads a lot of our documentaries so I and I've had him on as a guest
[02:50.800 --> 02:57.920]  So I found his number in my computer called him up and I said hey Ken. I said
[02:57.920 --> 03:01.600]  Did you delete that and he said no, I'm at a barbecue with family. I
[03:02.840 --> 03:05.240]  Said well, it says you deleted it deleted by user
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.840]  And by the way when a user deletes it you can't ever put it back up
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.200]  We raised a stink and Google admitted somebody hacked in and deleted it so they reinstated it
[03:17.840 --> 03:20.880]  Something they've said before and ever since is impossible
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.440]  So I don't know what's going on and we've got four or five big channels
[03:27.600 --> 03:35.160]  We've got over four hundred something million views and YouTube's an important outreach. It's maybe 15% of our outreach
[03:36.360 --> 03:38.360]  But it's a very wide diverse audience
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.000]  Our biggest audience is on terrestrial AM and FM radio
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.760]  That reaches the lion's share of the three million a day, but it's mainly a conservative libertarian type audience
[03:51.760 --> 03:55.680]  And it's great to talk to the choir, but it's important to reach out
[03:57.200 --> 04:02.200]  Places like YouTube. That's why it's important to buy the DVDs at
[04:03.240 --> 04:05.640]  info wars store.com and
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.520]  Have a library of them and also give them to people because then you have a hard copy
[04:11.520 --> 04:15.880]  Or if you're going to go watch the videos at
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.920]  Prison Planet TV our site so we have a backup or on YouTube download them
[04:23.200 --> 04:27.880]  Save them, you know, I've talked a lot about web 2.0. That's why we started
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.200]  The magazine because the globalists are moving to censor the web
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.320]  So we call it print 2.0 to have a hard copy of each month's key articles
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.080]  60 pages of it in info wars magazine, but
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.600]  Just interesting a little tidbit here at the start of the broadcast that that they can delete your videos
[04:51.640 --> 04:53.640]  And then
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  It says you did it
[04:56.200 --> 05:02.640]  All right, we'll be right back stay with us big show sick of the globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.840]  And laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with propure my friends
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.800]  I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is propure and it's available
[05:14.040 --> 05:21.200]  Discounted at info wars.com its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required
[05:21.200 --> 05:28.640]  It's NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95 percent easy to set up and use
[05:28.640 --> 05:36.040]  Doesn't require electricity purify water from lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[05:36.040 --> 05:43.320]  Which is key save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic propure is the best gravity-fed filter out
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.560]  There it's what my family uses info wars.com already has the lowest price on propure
[05:48.560 --> 05:54.200]  But if you add the promo code water at checkout you get an additional 10% off at info wars.com
[05:54.200 --> 05:58.560]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139
[06:01.680 --> 06:07.560]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[06:07.560 --> 06:25.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[06:38.560 --> 06:43.960]  Monday through Friday, I am live
[06:44.560 --> 06:51.080]  12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern with the weekday show and then I come back live every single Sunday
[06:51.720 --> 06:58.040]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time 5 to 7 Eastern now that is 2 to
[06:59.200 --> 07:02.120]  5 or I guess that would be 2 to 4
[07:02.120 --> 07:07.920]  In the Pacific 3 to 5 mountain, but it's all academic again
[07:07.920 --> 07:14.200]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday the 25th day of November
[07:15.640 --> 07:22.600]  2012 and we have again just a ton of key information that we're going to be covering today
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.360]  Coming up later in the hour. I just wanted to read a small stack of just the police state news
[07:29.360 --> 07:31.360]  today
[07:32.760 --> 07:37.280]  Just the out-of-control government news today
[07:38.480 --> 07:42.600]  Where violent criminals are allowed to go free, but the general public is
[07:43.440 --> 07:48.520]  Savagely abused by the system because the system sees you as the food
[07:49.120 --> 07:53.760]  Soylent green is made out of people. They don't want to physically eat you at least not yet
[07:53.760 --> 08:01.360]  But the bureaucracy and the megacorporations that are anti-free market monopolistic that control us through government and shut down their
[08:01.440 --> 08:07.280]  Competitions through government. They extract your labor and your energy and to control you
[08:07.280 --> 08:11.000]  They've distorted the educational process to where we have a dumbed-down
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.880]  Arrested development population that does not have any idea how this world even operates
[08:16.880 --> 08:20.200]  Let me just give you a few of these headlines first off some good news
[08:21.080 --> 08:22.240]  some
[08:22.240 --> 08:27.720]  Some sanity here Piedmont officer is fired over public
[08:28.440 --> 08:31.840]  urination ticket the three-year-old was seen
[08:33.120 --> 08:35.960]  Running around the front yard and peed up against a tree
[08:37.360 --> 08:41.760]  And I thought you weren't a red-blooded southerner unless you peed in your backyard
[08:42.760 --> 08:46.200]  But but the point is is the good neighbor call the police, of course
[08:46.200 --> 08:52.160]  Can't pass up any reason to call the police and the police came and knocked on the door and gave her a
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.160]  $2,500 ticket and they'd like to of course make the child a sex offender if they could
[08:57.840 --> 09:03.000]  But the police chief has fired the officer who ought to move to North Korea
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.080]  Don't worry though. The union will get him reinstated. This is all just for show. That's up in Oklahoma
[09:09.640 --> 09:15.440]  Florida woman arrested on charge. She rode Manatee. Manatee's come up. I want to swim with you. That's NBC
[09:15.440 --> 09:18.000]  And they want to put her in jail for a couple of years
[09:18.720 --> 09:20.480]  for that
[09:20.480 --> 09:27.040]  But don't worry more heads were found this week on the Texas Mexico border and there's all sorts of incredible crime going on and
[09:27.040 --> 09:29.040]  Stabbings and murders that aren't even investigated
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.960]  But the person riding the Manatee will get in a lot of trouble
[09:32.680 --> 09:39.440]  New York City storm victims homes looted over Thanksgiving. What is it three weeks after the hurricane and looting is?
[09:39.960 --> 09:42.680]  Is ongoing but hey, don't worry
[09:42.680 --> 09:48.520]  They are arresting people that try to truck in gas for their neighbors if it's in an improper container
[09:48.800 --> 09:52.200]  So California man jailed for four days recording police
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.440]  That's in the local news there
[09:54.440 --> 10:01.440]  It's also as the photography is on a crime comm the chronicles this and the guy's about 30 feet away legally lawfully videotaping
[10:01.440 --> 10:04.080]  I see I saw a video this week where they arrested people
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.280]  What was it in Chicago videotaping a illegal checkpoint just do you don't do that and land the free home of the brave?
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.640]  Continuing health care workers fired for failing to get flu shot vaccinations
[10:16.200 --> 10:21.880]  Even though it doubles your chances of getting the flu that year in major government studies and doesn't protect you and gives you brain damage
[10:22.520 --> 10:28.600]  And over in the UK there near they're now taking people's children who are members of the UK Independence Party
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.520]  Which is the third largest party in the country extremely mainline and simply wants the
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.320]  EU out of British politics and have sovereignty UK wide. It's the fastest growing party too
[10:40.320 --> 10:46.280]  And they say that being against the euro is illegal and your children will be taken. That's the one in Guardian
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.320]  Continuing its authoritarianism is what it's called Saudi husbands alerted by text of their wives leave the country
[10:53.920 --> 10:55.320]  the
[10:55.320 --> 10:58.200]  GPS tracking that's in all cell phones globally
[10:58.200 --> 11:05.520]  Under standardization that they used to track and trace us illegally here in the US and in Europe and North America as well in
[11:05.520 --> 11:06.960]  Australia Canada well there
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.080]  It's used to the government tracks the women for the husbands with it. So there you go. I mean don't feel bad
[11:12.080 --> 11:14.080]  They do it to all of us here laptops
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.560]  They issue the free laptops that taxpayers pay for from California to
[11:19.440 --> 11:26.200]  Pennsylvania they watch you at home and the government's now announced that and you must wear RFID trackers around your necks
[11:26.200 --> 11:30.240]  And San Antonio or you're expelled. That's been now national news
[11:31.160 --> 11:33.600]  Here's some of the other police state news. I thought I'd
[11:34.760 --> 11:41.160]  Get out here for you, but then I'll get no more detail on those United Nations wants to use drones weekly standard
[11:41.160 --> 11:43.480]  I mean everybody's getting the new drones and the
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.840]  The global government
[11:47.200 --> 11:49.360]  wants some drones as well
[11:49.360 --> 11:58.080]  And so the French news agency is also reporting that and the UN runs giant mass murder operations all over the world
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.080]  I was talking to a
[12:00.120 --> 12:05.200]  Young lady this weekend and she was telling me her dream to be a high commissioner in the UN to save people
[12:05.200 --> 12:07.680]  And I said you do you know about who founded the UN?
[12:07.680 --> 12:10.520]  Do you know about the Rockefellers? Do you know about eugenics?
[12:10.520 --> 12:16.000]  Do you know the UN runs murdering operations and white slavery of sex kidnapping worldwide?
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.960]  And she just didn't want to hear about it because you know what the television said the UN were great people. So they must be
[12:24.160 --> 12:30.960]  Shipping containers to become condos in Detroit. It's being reported on by ABC news. That's where the folks are moving in there
[12:31.560 --> 12:33.560]  We paid 20 plus billion to move
[12:34.040 --> 12:36.040]  General Motors to China
[12:36.040 --> 12:41.000]  Shipping containers, but but hey, don't feel bad in New York and in San Francisco
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.240]  This is out of CBS news San Francisco's supervisors approve 220 foot square foot apartments
[12:48.400 --> 12:55.200]  That's smaller than most jail cells. That includes the bathrooms the bathroom and the kitchen and the closet and
[12:56.680 --> 12:58.520]  There's barely room to lay down in it
[12:58.520 --> 13:04.480]  And it's a 10 to 1 vote and they say it's for the earth to cut our carbon footprint
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.640]  And of course what this is really about is see they can raise the taxes
[13:08.640 --> 13:11.720]  They're talking about making you in San Francisco pay
[13:12.920 --> 13:15.400]  $10,000 a year if you own a
[13:16.720 --> 13:18.720]  200 excuse me
[13:19.080 --> 13:21.080]  220 foot prison cell
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.360]  And see that's the model they're gonna raise property taxes on
[13:26.680 --> 13:28.680]  everyone
[13:28.720 --> 13:35.520]  Until you cannot live anything but this but in the globalist they're all exempt from the taxes
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.880]  Does you know in the EU the EU bureaucrats who run elected who actually run the EU?
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.000]  It's and and make 81% of UK laws now
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.040]  I know the UK isn't officially part of it. Does you know they're exempt from the EU wide VAT?
[13:49.040 --> 13:51.040]  You don't believe me just type in
[13:52.080 --> 13:57.080]  EU bureaucrats exempt from their own taxes. In fact guys if you type that in we'll show people a headline
[13:57.080 --> 14:03.840]  We're also streaming video at prisonplanet.tv. We like to have a video video record of that
[14:03.840 --> 14:10.000]  And by the way, if you want to have a video record of this show, you can go to prisonplanet.tv a
[14:10.600 --> 14:12.600]  Membership is 59 cents
[14:13.800 --> 14:18.080]  59 59 cents a what is it 59 cents a
[14:19.240 --> 14:25.520]  Week what is it 10 memberships for 595 a month? Whatever that comes down to you create a username
[14:26.040 --> 14:28.040]  Pass code just paste for the band
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.640]  Yeah, yeah 59 cents
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.240]  You get 10 memberships you get
[14:34.920 --> 14:40.040]  So I mean how much is that a month if folks through the math out there 10 memberships for
[14:41.040 --> 14:42.560]  595 a month
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.200]  So you just buy one membership for 595 the same username and passcode you can share with the 10 people so they can be
[14:48.520 --> 14:57.360]  Simultaneously logged in and read my book Paul Watson's books see all 25 of my films dozens of other films the nightly news and the live streams six days a week of the
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.880]  TV show the point is we have that there as an archive of all
[15:02.440 --> 15:06.960]  The footage and material of 17 years the site's been up for close to 10
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.280]  And it just gets better and better all the time and it does finance a lot of what we're doing here to have a prison plan
[15:12.280 --> 15:18.200]  A dot TV membership my point is the reason I say that is we also then a day or so later post this stuff to YouTube for everybody
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.040]  Those that are supporters at prisonplanet.tv kind of pay it forward and help get the word out
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.040]  But a YouTube just deleted 20 plus
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.000]  Of the last week's videos. We didn't do it. They just deleted them
[15:31.360 --> 15:33.280]  And then they say we deleted it
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.520]  So I mean you know you just can't trust the new web 2.0 system is where you're on their platforms
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.520]  And they control what you do in the new American magazine reported as well as the Associated Press last week
[15:43.520 --> 15:51.460]  The UN is set to be given control of the internet and domain registry as well as the DNS server numbers
[15:51.460 --> 15:56.040]  And Obama has signed a secret order that Congress isn't even allowed to see
[15:56.920 --> 15:59.480]  Taking over the internet with the internet kill switch
[15:59.960 --> 16:05.760]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power even save money on your electric bill if so
[16:05.760 --> 16:10.880]  This could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear solar power generators are now available
[16:10.880 --> 16:17.760]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly
[16:17.760 --> 16:24.240]  Um, it's no fumes and produces electricity from the Sun. It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home
[16:24.320 --> 16:31.120]  Run some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep your food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms
[16:31.320 --> 16:35.080]  Brownouts or blackouts you'll never suffer through painful power outages again
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.480]  And here's the best news a remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now

[19:58.000 --> 20:09.000]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting network network
[20:10.320 --> 20:15.440]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[20:18.560 --> 20:25.000]  By the way, if you are a new listener and you're tuning in for the first time and you hear some things that sound crazy
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.240]  We are not joking when I am engaged in satire which I do
[20:30.920 --> 20:38.240]  Occasionally I will tell you up front and at the end of it that it's satire. This is not satire. I do agree with you though
[20:38.240 --> 20:39.840]  It's crazy
[20:39.840 --> 20:44.640]  But I get called crazy a lot because I'm covering insane things
[20:45.840 --> 20:50.160]  You know Hitler did a lot of really crazy stuff doesn't mean you're crazy
[20:50.160 --> 20:58.200]  Have you wrote about what Hitler did though? I've read some books on Hitler that read like a horror novel
[20:58.960 --> 21:04.520]  Same thing on a book. I read about Caligula. I read several books about Roman emperors of
[21:05.680 --> 21:08.720]  Marrying their horses ordering people murdered for no reason
[21:09.720 --> 21:13.400]  Dressing up like vampires at night and going out and murdering people
[21:13.400 --> 21:21.440]  It's crazy, but we're not crazy for being informed and a lot of kind of the yuppie class out there
[21:21.640 --> 21:23.760]  They believe it's a sacrament of
[21:24.480 --> 21:26.920]  goodliness to be ignorant to be
[21:27.920 --> 21:30.600]  Foolish and to be easily bamboozled
[21:30.880 --> 21:35.440]  But when I get up here and explain that a world government is being formed a private
[21:36.040 --> 21:38.040]  corporate world government
[21:38.040 --> 21:45.680]  That the globalist crime syndicate bosses this this worldwide mafia themselves calls a new world order
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.240]  That is not my opinion. That is not my view. That is a certified public fact
[21:52.880 --> 22:01.760]  There are hundreds of videos online with heads of state of every major country calling for a private corporate global government
[22:01.760 --> 22:08.680]  And yeah, we made the film. I produced the film a few years ago. That's on DVD. That's excellent called
[22:09.800 --> 22:17.000]  Invisible Empire that Jason Burm is directed. It's got to have over a hundred clips in it with different world leaders calling for global government
[22:17.600 --> 22:24.800]  And it is an elected global government, you know, I have so many quote liberals come up to me and say well, hey, you know
[22:25.360 --> 22:27.200]  didn't we go from
[22:27.200 --> 22:29.200]  hunter-gatherers to
[22:29.200 --> 22:31.760]  agrarian farmers to
[22:33.360 --> 22:35.000]  small
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  civilization city-states to
[22:38.600 --> 22:44.920]  Regions to countries to empires and now it's time for Star Trek one world government
[22:45.200 --> 22:50.040]  Well, this is a one-world government run by very nasty social engineers
[22:50.680 --> 22:58.200]  Who think the general public are a bunch of dumb animals and have engineered things show that that is a self-fulfilling prophecy
[22:58.200 --> 23:02.240]  And so I find that so many people that sign on the new world order
[23:02.560 --> 23:06.280]  they they kind of are make believing that they're part of the system and
[23:07.800 --> 23:09.800]  That
[23:09.920 --> 23:16.000]  Well, yes, we are carrying out eugenics. Well, yes, they are putting things in the water, you know, there are too many people Alex
[23:16.680 --> 23:18.960]  And I'm like, but they're doing it to you too
[23:20.360 --> 23:26.240]  So what it is is a bunch of idiots who kind of follow along with the globalist juggernaut
[23:26.240 --> 23:30.480]  Overrunning society and they kind of run in front of it like they're part of it
[23:31.480 --> 23:34.040]  Even though it's going to suck them in as well
[23:35.400 --> 23:37.400]  But here is the
[23:38.400 --> 23:40.800]  Daily Express, it's also in the Sunday Express
[23:41.800 --> 23:43.800]  newspaper Eurocrats told
[23:44.720 --> 23:50.880]  Keep dodging taxes European Union court rules. They do not have to pay any income taxes
[23:50.880 --> 23:57.760]  I mean, there it is. Everybody else has to pay it and has to pay VAT. They are exempt because they're dictators and
[23:58.400 --> 24:00.600]  Who got the countries of Europe to sign on?
[24:01.200 --> 24:04.200]  back in 1967
[24:06.080 --> 24:12.080]  They had a meeting every 10 years 47 57 67 you can debate when the euro got really set up
[24:12.440 --> 24:15.560]  Or you can fast forward to 97 every 10 years. They met
[24:15.560 --> 24:21.920]  47 57 67 77 87 97 and then they had the
[24:24.160 --> 24:31.080]  What was it the 60th anniversary of the euro in 2000 so you can see where they think it began
[24:33.560 --> 24:39.320]  If they had the 60th anniversary in 2007 well, then you know when they believe the euro began
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.920]  But the general public's told it began in 2000, but it started by getting the countries
[24:43.920 --> 24:48.920]  Oh, we're just signing on to the economic deal. We're just signing on to a trade pack kind of like NAFTA again and
[24:50.080 --> 24:57.600]  Then the public's like we'll let us see us. Well, it's a secret order kind of like Bush's order creating the North American Union with Vicente Fox and
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  Mexico and
[25:01.280 --> 25:08.520]  Also the Canadian Prime Minister was part of that at Waco, Texas in 2005 that order is still secret though parts of it have
[25:08.520 --> 25:13.880]  been released under four-year lawsuits by judicial watch of all people of all groups and
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.560]  Right there we are under a North American Union and it's already signed a deal with the European Union
[25:20.560 --> 25:22.680]  And we're already under a global government right now
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.680]  And that's what's so frustrating is that we're so far down this thing and
[25:29.720 --> 25:35.560]  We've already lost so much sovereignty that Obama this year in two different
[25:35.560 --> 25:43.940]  Speeches and then in three different congressional hearings the joint chiefs and the chairman told Congress we played the clips here at nauseam
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.240]  You can type in Congress told NATO and UN over over military
[25:48.560 --> 25:55.600]  The president said not only is Congress not over war now even though over the purse and the power to declare war and everything
[25:55.960 --> 25:58.960]  Over taxes it's right there in the Constitution
[25:58.960 --> 26:06.920]  First they say the states don't count or exist and then now the Congress doesn't exist and they told our military and
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.560]  They tell the officer corps this and they tell the Congress
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.960]  They say hey the president sober the military and he gets his authority not as a dictator
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.080]  That'd be bad enough, but from the UN
[26:22.080 --> 26:23.440]  And
[26:23.440 --> 26:29.600]  Then I read Newsweek Time magazine Financial Times of London the Economist magazine. I've read these quotes here
[26:29.600 --> 26:31.800]  We wrote the article three months ago now
[26:32.320 --> 26:37.760]  First big cover story in our in the info wars magazine when the physical magazine started coming out three months ago
[26:39.280 --> 26:41.720]  Bankers declare they've conquered the US and Europe
[26:43.560 --> 26:46.360]  Economic takeover and in that
[26:46.360 --> 26:52.640]  Huge 12-page article. I don't know. It's got to have a hundred
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.080]  Bibliography links and I mean it's online to free online and
[27:00.080 --> 27:07.000]  Video clips of them saying they've conquered us. They're gonna shut off the economy make us all poor bankruptus and
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.960]  Socializes and then they're gonna carry out open eugenics on us one-child families
[27:12.960 --> 27:17.120]  forced abortions in fantasies of the young up to age three
[27:19.480 --> 27:22.880]  Getting rid of old people euthanasia
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.720]  Which they've made so fashionable forced government euthanasia and I sit here
[27:30.680 --> 27:35.120]  Realizing the general public doesn't even know what these words are
[27:36.080 --> 27:40.640]  When I sit up here and talk to them, you know, people think it's like people think intellectualism
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.160]  Even fake intellectualism is only for maybe one percent of the population
[27:46.400 --> 27:48.400]  You know, maybe one percent would watch
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.560]  Firing line like I would watch when I was a kid and even I knew that was affected and fake a
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.320]  Guy with a fake Atlantic accent up there with his feet kicked up like let me talk to you now
[28:00.320 --> 28:03.040]  Let's see here. Let's have this question now
[28:03.600 --> 28:05.600]  Yes, oh good
[28:05.600 --> 28:14.920]  Isn't that really what it's all about and then people sit around watching that thinking their intellectuals and even that isn't even real
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.440]  It's a sub basement of fake debate within a limited paradigm structure
[28:20.440 --> 28:27.120]  And I realize I'm sitting here with the textbooks and the documents like eco science right over there on the shelf
[28:27.120 --> 28:35.000]  Where the White House science are says they're putting poison in our water to reduce our fertility and reduce our lifespans and it's all happening
[28:35.160 --> 28:42.600]  And people don't even know what reduced fertility or lifespan means or if they do they're in such a catatonic dreamlike state
[28:42.640 --> 28:45.480]  They don't even understand they're under mortal assault
[28:46.680 --> 28:47.880]  brutal
[28:47.880 --> 28:49.000]  concerted
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.600]  Scientific attack. I mean we're being overrun taken over
[28:52.600 --> 28:58.440]  Civilization has officially collapsed. The family is gone. The general public are dumb animals
[29:00.280 --> 29:05.760]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary
[29:05.920 --> 29:12.080]  Economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down societies and starve

[33:15.320 --> 33:21.400]  Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[33:22.240 --> 33:27.560]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:32.720 --> 33:38.280]  We are back live and some people would tune into a broadcast like this and say oh this guy's negative
[33:38.280 --> 33:46.440]  Really, it's negative when now there's a scientific technocratic elite writing hundreds of books and white papers publicly
[33:47.160 --> 33:53.440]  Describing knowing back 80 years ago right through to today exactly what they're doing to us and talking about us like
[33:53.880 --> 33:58.200]  We don't even hear them or see what they're saying or doing in plain view
[33:58.880 --> 34:00.880]  You know, I personally
[34:01.040 --> 34:04.040]  Take that very very personally
[34:05.760 --> 34:07.260]  I
[34:07.260 --> 34:10.360]  As a man try to then learn more about these enemies
[34:10.360 --> 34:17.360]  I try to learn what they stand for what they believe in what their goals are and how that's going to affect
[34:18.120 --> 34:20.040]  Myself and my family
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.280]  Because I've noticed with the general public. There's a fake sentimentality
[34:24.040 --> 34:31.160]  They like the appearance of caring about their children. They like the appearance of caring about their society
[34:31.160 --> 34:37.360]  They like the appearance of being involved in their community or being informed
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.520]  But they are a mile wide and a millimeter deep
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.120]  There is nothing real there. They're not alive. They're not real people. They have no depth
[34:49.920 --> 34:51.440]  They have no depth now
[34:51.440 --> 34:56.840]  There are a lot of people that do have depth and there are a lot of good men and women of every race color and creed across this
[34:56.840 --> 35:04.520]  Club but I'll tell you this if you don't fight for liberty and freedom and if you don't fight for dignity and if you don't fight to be
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.200]  Treated with respect then you are a barbarian
[35:08.400 --> 35:13.440]  You don't want civilization and I'll tell you civilization as we know it is already gone
[35:13.680 --> 35:16.600]  We live in a facade a artificial environment
[35:17.880 --> 35:19.880]  Bombarding everyone with
[35:19.880 --> 35:21.080]  incredibly
[35:21.080 --> 35:28.160]  Negative anti-family pro-death. I've got a stack of articles here about new sitcoms in North America and in the UK
[35:28.760 --> 35:32.520]  New BBC where it's people committing suicide and how cool it is
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.280]  Other shows where it's bad to have a mommy and a daddy
[35:37.320 --> 35:43.800]  See, it's not just okay to have two daddies or two mommies. No, no, no, it's bad to have a daddy and a mommy
[35:44.520 --> 35:46.520]  you see I
[35:46.520 --> 35:53.200]  I was in Whole Foods yesterday because my wife asked me to go to the grocery store for and I don't go very often and there's a whole foods
[35:54.240 --> 36:00.680]  Closer to our house because I live out in the country. Believe it or not. There's there's a satellite Whole Foods sticking out towards the edge of town
[36:01.240 --> 36:03.240]  and I drove over to it and
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.480]  I was buying a bunch of vegetables mainly
[36:07.880 --> 36:09.880]  That's what my wife on the list and
[36:10.640 --> 36:12.640]  a
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.760]  A guy walks over and he says, oh, you're making some very healthy choices
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.720]  And I looked at the guy and thought does you know this guy know who I am and I said hi. How you doing?
[36:22.720 --> 36:25.040]  He goes, hi didn't know who I was
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.280]  You know walked on to the store ran into a few listeners and
[36:30.040 --> 36:36.080]  Then another woman walks over it says oh you've made very healthy choices and I thought
[36:36.800 --> 36:39.840]  Okay, this is on purpose and then I rounded
[36:39.840 --> 36:41.840]  the
[36:41.840 --> 36:43.280]  area
[36:43.280 --> 36:48.840]  Over where they got the yogurt and all the rest of it and there was a big hand-drawn sign
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.280]  Or meant to look hand hand-drawn over the over the cold cabinets
[36:55.440 --> 36:59.040]  And it said my name is blah blah and I should have taken a photo of it
[36:59.040 --> 37:00.800]  But I'm gonna go back in there and do a report on it
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.880]  And he said the reason I like working here 16 years is I get to influence what people eat
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.840]  It wasn't I get to work somewhere. We promote health healthy food. He goes. I get to influence what people eat
[37:11.840 --> 37:15.540]  And so I guess this is some new rollout where they don't just
[37:15.760 --> 37:20.800]  Peck at you shouldn't get plastic and then get rid of plastic entirely about social engineering
[37:21.320 --> 37:28.400]  It's it's all about being fully immersed and America is a giant reeducation camp. That's what it is
[37:29.600 --> 37:35.680]  Public schools are total systems that turn you against your parents dumb you down teach you to be herd driven
[37:35.680 --> 37:42.000]  And I've had the former head of the Department of Education and policy on many times Charlotte little field
[37:42.880 --> 37:44.880]  Charlotte, Isherby and
[37:48.640 --> 37:50.640]  You know just an amazing
[37:51.600 --> 37:54.360]  Lady and you know her dad was scum and bones
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.720]  Rest of it. That's she's the lady that leaked to Anthony Sutton into Congress all that info in the 70s
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.960]  But the point is I mean she's got all the documents where it was all planned. This is a planned
[38:06.360 --> 38:12.400]  Deliberate dumbing down. We sell the book liberate dumbing down if anybody still reads an info or store.com
[38:13.840 --> 38:15.840]  It's a size a little phone book
[38:16.440 --> 38:23.400]  Breaking all that down. This has been done by design and people should be upset about going into bondage
[38:23.440 --> 38:26.480]  They should be upset about social engineering
[38:27.240 --> 38:29.240]  They should be upset
[38:29.240 --> 38:30.840]  about
[38:30.840 --> 38:32.840]  Classical authoritarianism
[38:33.040 --> 38:35.200]  They should be upset when the White House
[38:35.960 --> 38:41.240]  First lady is is quote setting standards on what kids eat and from Colorado to Illinois
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.800]  There are mainstream news articles
[38:44.440 --> 38:48.440]  You can pull them up where the parents aren't allowed to pack the lunch
[38:49.040 --> 38:51.040]  The school decides
[38:51.720 --> 38:55.080]  I mean, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with
[38:55.920 --> 38:58.080]  And and Bloomberg comes out
[38:58.080 --> 39:04.720]  And says hey, I'm gonna tell you what to eat. I'm gonna tell you what to do and by the way
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.720]  I'm gonna sue gun manufacturers. So we bankrupt self-defense. I mean these are ravenous control freaks
[39:11.720 --> 39:13.720]  and what do you do when
[39:14.520 --> 39:17.280]  You don't want petty status because you're not a
[39:17.280 --> 39:27.280]  A troop of baboons where the dominant one gets the highest in the tree or a flock of cockatoos, you know in
[39:28.640 --> 39:33.640]  Australia where the dominant one gets in the top of the tree and chirps and sings proudly or
[39:35.520 --> 39:39.840]  Aguanas with the dominant iguana, you know gets up on the highest branch of the tree
[39:39.840 --> 39:45.080]  I mean, I'm not thrilled and excited by that. That doesn't make me happy and
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.640]  And running other people's lives and having power over people doesn't make me happy
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.200]  Inventing things creating things being private. I
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.920]  Mean, I'm on a search for normal good people that aren't users in mentally ill
[40:00.920 --> 40:03.680]  I'm on a search for people that could be my friend
[40:03.680 --> 40:08.640]  I'm on a search for any decent people that aren't backstabbing stupid
[40:08.640 --> 40:15.520]  Nothing's you know, and I never had a high view of myself. I just begin to realize, you know, this species is a stinking joke
[40:16.040 --> 40:23.960]  The elite are a group of knuckle dragging cancerous control freaks who are just psychopaths who've created a sadistic psychopaths
[40:23.960 --> 40:30.080]  Who've created a cosmology to carry out their control freak dreams and lust and things upon the population
[40:30.520 --> 40:37.000]  So they can have the most beautiful and creative and you know kneel down to them because they control the symbol of energy money
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.880]  Through fractional reserve derivatives fraud
[40:40.040 --> 40:46.040]  They control everything because they literally have a magic hat through through fraud because they control the media
[40:46.040 --> 40:51.360]  They bought off in the last hundred years to tell everybody that they're actually running everything and are good people
[40:51.440 --> 40:57.000]  So you've got a degenerate hunchback literally elite uglier than the day is long
[40:57.880 --> 41:01.560]  spiritually and physically who hate everyone that are pure beautiful and
[41:01.560 --> 41:09.320]  And then you've got they've turned the general public into mutated ugly slobs, and I mean spiritual slobs
[41:10.280 --> 41:12.280]  Just just I mean you look at men today
[41:12.280 --> 41:18.880]  And I mean they are just incredibly shallow nothing weaklings and they want to argue with you about sports
[41:18.880 --> 41:22.080]  And when you don't know about sports, they'll laugh and go. Oh, you don't know
[41:22.960 --> 41:26.000]  Like you're not yeah, man. I'm not cool
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.680]  Yeah, right. I know about the economy and quantum mechanics and
[41:32.240 --> 41:33.960]  engineering and
[41:33.960 --> 41:36.400]  societal development and sociology and
[41:37.120 --> 41:45.000]  Anthropology because it's addicting to know how the world really works except careful how much knowledge you get because then you come to grips with
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.800]  The fact that the humanity is rotting
[41:49.280 --> 41:51.280]  Absolutely rotting and
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.920]  And the only way to save my family is to go out and engage the rotting
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.120]  carcass and try to reanimate it against the globalist because the globalist are
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.760]  Engineering a world government shutting off the resources while posing as the savior
[42:05.760 --> 42:09.880]  They need to shut the resources off and so there's a lot lesser and less resources
[42:09.880 --> 42:15.000]  So you'll sell out for nothing so they can give you chicken feed for your birthright of liberty and
[42:16.160 --> 42:19.400]  So they can forge you into little armies of waddling
[42:19.400 --> 42:23.520]  Affeminate nothings these men
[42:24.720 --> 42:31.560]  Who who openly tell you they have power through the Borg hive collective who are proud of it?
[42:31.560 --> 42:37.360]  Who are proud of their pathetic weakness? They are proud of how destroyed they are
[42:37.680 --> 42:43.920]  They are proud of how spiritually dead they are these churches these Rockefeller World Council of Churches
[42:43.920 --> 42:51.360]  Literal government propaganda whorehouses the people they love most people love their kids dying of cancer nowadays
[42:51.360 --> 42:53.080]  Because they get attention from their neighbors
[42:53.080 --> 42:57.960]  They don't want to know why their kids are dying of cancer because they injected them in the vaccines with it
[42:57.960 --> 42:59.960]  They're murdering you
[43:00.920 --> 43:06.200]  We just had a terrible storm in the east, but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm
[43:06.280 --> 43:09.760]  We have the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.520]  America's worst drought in agricultural history and what about the presidential election?

[47:36.460 --> 47:42.420]  Only makes you stronger. You know, I study this. I'm not going to exaggerate
[47:43.100 --> 47:45.780]  Not as much as I used to 15 hours a day
[47:46.940 --> 47:53.620]  There's been times in my life where I've studied 18 hours a day on the New World Order and that's why it's so frustrating
[47:53.740 --> 47:58.980]  I study what the globalists write and say because they operate like you don't even know they exist
[47:59.860 --> 48:03.980]  The general public you go out and say hey, have you heard about the world government?
[48:03.980 --> 48:07.700]  They'll say oh, that's what kooks talk about even though. It's now admitted
[48:07.700 --> 48:13.620]  We're going under a private corporate world government and they think you care what they think
[48:14.780 --> 48:16.780]  About you
[48:16.780 --> 48:22.980]  And it's not that that affects you that they don't care in the way they think it affects you that you realize
[48:22.980 --> 48:24.980]  They're helpless and it's very upsetting
[48:24.980 --> 48:31.500]  And I liken it to you know telling somebody hey
[48:34.940 --> 48:37.460]  You know don't get in the car with that guy and
[48:38.420 --> 48:44.420]  Then the woman gets found two days later dead in a dead in the field. I mean, it's you don't feel good about the fact
[48:44.420 --> 48:46.420]  You were right about it
[48:46.420 --> 48:54.660]  You don't feel good about that. It's it's it's a very frustrating to be absolutely
[48:55.420 --> 49:00.900]  On target about where the world's going and to know so few even know it
[49:02.620 --> 49:04.620]  So few are even aware
[49:04.620 --> 49:18.660]  It is just so frustrating that the globalist openly announced what they're doing to us how they're socially engineering us
[49:18.860 --> 49:23.100]  How they're taking over our lives and how they're doing it towards a bad aim
[49:23.340 --> 49:28.700]  But they have this general PR cover story that all these incredibly
[49:28.700 --> 49:37.420]  Satisfied trendies who call themselves liberals buy into who just walk around with a satisfied look on their face and
[49:37.980 --> 49:40.180]  Who just will not face reality?
[49:40.820 --> 49:46.020]  You know at least conservatives think freedom and private property is a good thing
[49:46.260 --> 49:51.980]  Sure, they buy into mainline Republican leaders that will absolutely sell them out and they're con to a great extent
[49:51.980 --> 49:59.220]  But at least they have some of the basic facts. I mean
[49:59.220 --> 50:03.660]  I look at these articles I have here we're going to take calls in the second hour and get into a bunch other news and
[50:04.100 --> 50:06.700]  It makes my head spin
[50:08.420 --> 50:16.260]  Me look at this NBC world news headline kids were moved from UK couple over support for independence from Europe
[50:17.700 --> 50:19.700]  and
[50:19.700 --> 50:24.540]  They took their children and gave them to foster care
[50:24.980 --> 50:30.700]  Because they were politically active in the UK independence party now if they were active in a white supremacist group
[50:30.700 --> 50:34.020]  You shouldn't take their kids, but UKIP are frequent guests here
[50:34.020 --> 50:41.500]  They are the third largest party in England in the UK the fastest growing gaining all these seats in the European Union
[50:41.780 --> 50:46.180]  Parliament that's rubber stamp the bureaucrats run it, but at least they're in it
[50:46.180 --> 50:49.140]  Nigel Farage is an incredible speaker
[50:49.860 --> 50:58.380]  It's about getting sovereignty back. It's about cutting taxes. It's basically a mild libertarian group. They're not even libertarian
[50:58.700 --> 51:04.180]  They're so mainline conservative folks. They're taking their kids. They're arresting them
[51:04.780 --> 51:08.140]  Lord Moncton is one of the founders of it. You've heard him here on the show
[51:08.420 --> 51:14.580]  Lord Christopher Moncton I don't want to get him on this week about this or Nigel Farage member of the UK and the
[51:14.580 --> 51:22.220]  Independence party and you can go watch NBC News is covering this going should your children be taken if you're conservative and
[51:22.700 --> 51:26.540]  See, it's not just the standalone case. I happen to know
[51:27.900 --> 51:33.820]  About this in Europe and now starting in Canada and they're starting in here. They're arresting preachers
[51:34.980 --> 51:37.940]  That read out of the Bible criticizing homosexuality
[51:37.940 --> 51:43.300]  This is authoritarianism ladies and gentlemen and again, they're not even being authoritarian
[51:43.540 --> 51:50.620]  Because they want to be sweet to downtrodden groups. That's a cover. This is a cold-blooded program
[51:53.540 --> 51:56.900]  Do you ever hear of the gay and lesbian groups criticizing the fact that it's been
[51:56.900 --> 52:00.020]  Declassified that HIV this came out in Congress. Look it up
[52:00.580 --> 52:02.260]  You can debate whether it was manufactured or not
[52:02.260 --> 52:06.260]  But the point is in the late 70s. It was put in hepatitis shows
[52:06.260 --> 52:13.540]  In San Francisco, New York, London and Paris and given to gay men because they were having hundreds of partners a month at that time to
[52:13.540 --> 52:15.540]  spread it
[52:17.060 --> 52:19.540]  They use them to spread HIV
[52:22.260 --> 52:29.460]  It's all just a cover ladies and gentlemen when you come to grips with the full magnitude of what we're facing people ask
[52:29.460 --> 52:33.460]  Why am I still alive? Why am I still in the air? They think you're so lost?
[52:33.460 --> 52:39.220]  They think you're so lost. They think you're so pathetic. They think you're in such a trance
[52:40.580 --> 52:45.540]  That's so what if Alex Jones goes on the air and tells you about it Ron Paul gave his 49 minute speech
[52:45.860 --> 52:47.860]  Week and a half ago. We heard some of it last Sunday
[52:48.580 --> 52:52.980]  And he said we're going under world government run by private banks who pay no taxes
[52:53.060 --> 52:57.300]  You can go read the transcripts online or just type in Ron Paul's farewell address
[52:58.740 --> 53:00.740]  It's got millions of views online
[53:00.740 --> 53:02.740]  On c-span
[53:03.860 --> 53:08.980]  John Bowns doing a project. We're putting documents articles news clips to everything. He says we're going to be airing it
[53:08.980 --> 53:10.980]  It should be ready. What John by the end of this week
[53:12.500 --> 53:16.020]  I know you've been pulling I mean you've been pulling double duty, but I want to yeah, that's great
[53:16.020 --> 53:18.020]  So Wednesday or Thursday, but take your time on this though
[53:18.900 --> 53:23.460]  The point is is that all of this is going on and he says it is a
[53:24.260 --> 53:26.260]  group of organized
[53:26.500 --> 53:28.500]  Premeditated that these are quotes
[53:28.500 --> 53:30.500]  Authoritarian psychopaths
[53:31.540 --> 53:37.540]  That's right, and he is a real scholar. He's done the research. So am I and man, that's what that's what's so chilling about
[53:37.540 --> 53:38.660]  This is
[53:38.660 --> 53:44.980]  When you realize what this planet really is and what we're really in the middle of and the facades and the stores
[53:45.380 --> 53:48.180]  And all of it is just window dressing folks
[53:48.740 --> 53:52.740]  For groups that are spiking the food the water the air everything
[53:53.620 --> 53:57.620]  And our DNA is changing. I'm going to go ahead and show you
[53:57.620 --> 54:01.380]  changing I was listening yesterday to 5 90 a.m. Driving in the car
[54:02.340 --> 54:04.340]  And they had some doctors on
[54:04.660 --> 54:07.860]  Different group of doctors going yet about hormone replacement for women
[54:07.860 --> 54:10.420]  It's interesting shows on the weekend almost better than the weekdays
[54:10.420 --> 54:13.780]  The point is I tune in to different shows Kenny Romair you name it
[54:13.780 --> 54:17.060]  But I was tuning in the local for local people listening on our local affiliate
[54:18.100 --> 54:19.220]  and
[54:19.220 --> 54:20.340]  I listened about 30 minutes
[54:20.340 --> 54:26.020]  I got home and I was still listening in the car after you know sitting there for 10 minutes of my kids wanting to finish it
[54:26.020 --> 54:28.020]  And and the doctors were going
[54:28.020 --> 54:30.020]  Yeah, we used to do hormone replacement
[54:30.500 --> 54:33.060]  With progesterone and stuff, you know for older women
[54:33.060 --> 54:40.900]  But now it's young women's hair hairs falling out and thyroid problems and we're seeing increases in cancer and stuff. So
[54:42.100 --> 54:47.460]  On and on and on well. Yeah, of course you are again go look at the real numbers
[54:51.220 --> 54:54.420]  I mean if you don't take this stuff serious
[54:54.420 --> 54:59.140]  If you don't understand what's going on folks, you better find out real fast
[55:00.180 --> 55:02.740]  If you don't know what eugenics is in the name
[55:03.460 --> 55:07.540]  Of whatever gods you pray to or if you don't you pray to yourself, you know, you're a materialist
[55:07.700 --> 55:10.740]  Well, then I can't help you all I can say is
[55:13.540 --> 55:17.380]  Man this is so heavy it's above my pay grade and and I'll tell you right now
[55:18.100 --> 55:20.420]  I feel like a pile of garbage because
[55:20.420 --> 55:22.420]  I
[55:22.660 --> 55:27.300]  Know how hardcore this information is and I don't I can't come up with words
[55:28.020 --> 55:32.340]  I can't come up with the energy. I can't come up with the oratory
[55:34.900 --> 55:36.740]  Flourishes
[55:36.740 --> 55:42.820]  Strong enough to properly convey to you the magnitude of what we face and a lot of people say well Alex
[55:42.820 --> 55:46.580]  That's fear mongering. You're trying to scare people. No, I think you're like I am
[55:46.580 --> 55:52.500]  If a guy's coming to rob my house at night and I see somebody walking around out by my cars
[55:52.820 --> 55:57.460]  I don't want to hide under the bed and wish somebody wasn't trying to break in my cars or breaking my house
[55:57.860 --> 55:59.860]  I'm not happy about it, but I'm gonna
[56:00.340 --> 56:03.460]  Go to the instant access safe and I'm going to pull out my shotgun
[56:06.340 --> 56:11.220]  And I'm going to reach in and grab my holster and clip it on with two two handguns
[56:11.220 --> 56:18.500]  And I'm gonna open the door and I'm gonna tell you put your hands up and if you don't I'm gonna kill you
[56:23.060 --> 56:25.060]  Not because I live in fear I live in power
[56:26.740 --> 56:30.580]  I mean, I'm a throwback. I'm an old-fashioned guy. I'm looking for trouble
[56:31.380 --> 56:34.340]  But you know what will you start something with me? I'm not afraid. I'm
[56:35.540 --> 56:37.540]  I'm instinctive
[56:37.540 --> 56:42.500]  And you know what I've learned all this information and and and I would think you'd want to know this
[56:43.060 --> 56:47.700]  I think you'd want to know foreign banks conquer this and are bragging about it in literally hundreds of publications a month
[56:48.100 --> 56:49.940]  I think you'd want to know there's
[56:49.940 --> 56:55.060]  Probably a hundred books back there on our bookshelf for the globalist brag. They're poisoning our food and water and call us dumb animals
[56:56.900 --> 56:59.140]  I think you'd want to know there's hundreds of textbooks published
[56:59.140 --> 57:04.020]  They teach it right here at the University of Texas for the social workers that the families of disease that has to be gotten rid of
[57:04.020 --> 57:08.180]  I thought you'd want to know I thought you'd want to stand up for yourself
[57:08.340 --> 57:11.140]  I thought you'd want to live but you know what a lot of you don't
[57:12.340 --> 57:15.860]  A lot of you don't you're gonna sign your wife your children everything over to evil
[57:16.500 --> 57:21.060]  And you're just gonna go watch another football game and act manly and strut around and try to sound mainstream
[57:21.860 --> 57:23.140]  okay
[57:23.140 --> 57:29.700]  But let me tell you the facade is about to disappear and things are gonna get worse and worse very very quickly know that
[57:29.700 --> 57:35.620]  And understand that coming up. We got a key Ron Paul clip backing my call for secession
[57:36.180 --> 57:40.820]  Against the globalist not the secession the globalist told you about but the real secession
[57:41.140 --> 57:47.700]  Your phone calls and a lot more. I'll give the number out a ton of news on the economy and the military and so much more second hour coming up
[57:51.220 --> 57:56.260]  We just had a terrible storm in the east, but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm
[57:56.260 --> 58:02.660]  We have the most devastating economic conditions since the great depression America's worst drought and agricultural history
[58:02.660 --> 58:04.660]  And what about the presidential election?
[58:04.820 --> 58:08.420]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply
[58:08.660 --> 58:12.660]  E-Foods direct is preparing for the shortages and you had better do the same
[58:12.980 --> 58:18.740]  I can warn you but I can't feed you. You know that E-Foods is the best tasting and safest food on the planet
[58:18.900 --> 58:22.100]  We all need a bunch of storable and usable food from E-Foods direct
[58:22.100 --> 58:26.100]  None of us wants to be standing in a bread line trading our freedom for food
[58:26.420 --> 58:30.660]  Anyone who doesn't take control of their uncertain future has to be just a little bit nuts
[58:30.820 --> 58:37.860]  Go to e-foods direct comm slash alex starting thursday november 22nd at midnight through monday november 26th

[58:43.380 --> 58:46.980]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[58:47.140 --> 58:49.780]  Go to e-foods direct comm slash alex
[58:49.780 --> 58:55.060]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power even save money on your electric bill?
[58:55.220 --> 59:00.980]  If so this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear solar power generators are now available
[59:01.140 --> 59:07.620]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly
[59:07.780 --> 59:10.580]  Amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun
[59:10.740 --> 59:15.460]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home run sump pumps
[59:15.460 --> 59:22.420]  Shortwave radios computers and even keep your food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts
[59:22.580 --> 59:25.060]  You'll never suffer through painful power outages again
[59:25.220 --> 59:29.460]  And here's the best news a remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now
[59:29.620 --> 59:36.260]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator to find out why these solar generators are the best generators

[59:51.460 --> 59:54.260]  Coast to coast direct from austin
[59:55.060 --> 59:59.140]  You're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:08.020]  From his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:14.260]  It's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.540]  We are in the midst of the great animating contest of life
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.900]  struggle
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.900]  And in this age of wickedness
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:32.100]  We struggled for our immortal souls make no mistake about that fact
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:37.540]  Make no mistake about good and evil make no mistake that evil is real
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:44.580]  Make no mistake that a dark force in the universe is real that animates those that serve death and destruction
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.740]  As for me in my house, I choose life
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.140]  And I choose to be what god created me to be not what the new world order
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.660]  Who wants to counterfeit and play the part of god?
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.660]  As
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:06.340]  Layed out and planned for me and my family
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.860]  None of us are perfect, but the new world order tries to keep us from legitimate suffering
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.260]  And
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.260]  Seeks to steal our ultimate future
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:22.900]  Because to do the right thing sometimes is painful in the end. There's always a much greater reward
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.020]  Evil is quicker. It's easier
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.300]  What's the quote about Darth Vader the dark side is the dark side
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.820]  Stronger no quicker easier more seductive
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.660]  And it's in children's parables that we do find the truth
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:54.100]  Life is such an amazing adventure and one of the greatest lies is that it isn't an adventure
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.700]  I
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.700]  Look at people
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.260]  Who are so unhappy?
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:06.260]  Because they say the world is an interesting when there is explosive life
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.260]  and creativity and and and opportunities to
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:14.900]  Challenge yourself and others and opportunities to inform others
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.180]  Opportunities to build up others
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.540]  But instead in the modern world you're supposed to get ahead by pulling others down
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.620]  And I guess we're all guilty of that
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.700]  To some extent or another
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:46.180]  But life is a journey and we are meant to develop throughout our life we are meant to
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.340]  develop
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.380]  And build ourselves to a point
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.380]  And go through those trials and tribulations when we're young
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:06.180]  But through that process become a true developed sentient being
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:18.020]  That through space and time existed and stood for something good and helped pass on
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:23.380]  Experiences and ideas and inventions to the next group
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.700]  Instead humans have
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:35.300]  Failed to evolve and have instead devolved
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:45.060]  And I don't use the word devolve or evolve the politically charged and limited terms of someone like
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.660]  Charles Darwin, I mean evolve in that
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.860]  Humans have a predatory side
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:58.580]  To go out and catch fish or kill a deer
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:04.020]  But that's limited to simply acquiring protein and fat
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.540]  But taking our own species and and developing high-tech systems
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.700]  Of predatory activity
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.140]  And then building the whole society around a giant dumbed-down
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:30.100]  Reservoir of people to be fed on culturally militarily physically spiritually
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.780]  The the the social engineers must know
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.700]  That to even make that decision to consciously do that that's always going on at one level or not
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:46.980]  Is the ultimate act of dehumanizing themselves and the fact that they could consciously make that decision
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.140]  Was not about their survival or their ultimate
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:59.140]  Enlightenment but was based solely on their stunted malfunctioning destructive failure
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:08.580]  The silver lungs generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:14.820]  Right from the convenience of your home with recent regulations threatening the sale of silver based supplements
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:21.700]  Now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere anytime
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:29.540]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime anywhere for any application
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:36.580]  The silver lungs generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:41.380]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:49.060]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver colloidal silver and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.300]  Please visit our website at
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:59.140]  www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:13.860]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:40.900]  How do you know the enemy how do you know who seeks to enslave you
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.740]  And ultimately suck out your life force and kill you
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.660]  Anyone who tells you
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.340]  That humanity is inherently bad
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.100]  That humanity is inherently ugly
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.020]  That you should stand down that you should
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.100]  Give in to a collective that that we should live in 200 foot
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:12.900]  Square foot boxes for the planet that we should pay al gore carbon taxes
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:20.500]  That we should go under un agenda 21. I know who these people are they are eugenicist
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:26.900]  Who believe they are gods and that you are animals and they have engineered you to act like dumb animals
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:32.740]  And even though I get upset at the trance like dumbed-down zombie population sometimes
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.940]  They are not the enemy. They are the socially targeted
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.540]  engineered with high tech systems of social control
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.860]  Victims and those of us that are aware of this
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.580]  And that understand what's happening
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.340]  It's happening
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.340]  Must get aggressive
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:08:00.660]  With our deeds and our actions and that means when the system tries to hinder us and the system tries to social engineer us
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.060]  We need to get back in its face
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:11.620]  And we need to be at the county commissioners meetings and the city council meetings and the state house meetings and we need to be
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.860]  At the congressional meetings and we need to be going to the corporate meetings
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:24.580]  And we need to be getting involved because all that evil needs to triumph is when good men and women do nothing
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.500]  We have gotten to this point as a society by not being involved
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:37.620]  And by thinking that we can just worry about our job and worry about entertainment and somebody else will handle it
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.860]  Well, you know what somebody else did handle it
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540]  And the people that handled it are not
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:47.940]  Stupid in the classical sense. They're very smart, but they're smart like a wolf
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:53.300]  They're not smart long term. They can think a few steps down the road not 10 2030
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.180]  They don't care what happens to their kids. They don't care what happens to the species
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:04.100]  They don't care if humanity makes it to the nearest star systems and it goes beyond a type one civilization
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:10.500]  They don't care. They want to feel good and exercise dominant power over people now
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.420]  And if that means they got to bankrupt the economy to make you dependent on them
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.060]  There is only one god and it's the government and obama is his profit
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.580]  If they have to do that they will
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:31.060]  And that's only the best of the globalist the worst of them. I've read their literature. I've seen their art
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.700]  I know their culture and let me tell you it's indescribable
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.460]  You ever had to clean a dead possum out of your
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.500]  Eating and cooling vents your central air and
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.620]  And you know what I'm that's evil
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.860]  That smell is evil as close as I can get to it
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:55.540]  They just it's like a button they got to push the raw power to kill the raw power to take things away from people
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:59.620]  Because they're inherently weak and they hate the weakness
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:06.180]  Those that have inherent power are embarrassed by power those that have inherent grace and strength and honor
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:12.420]  Know that we are imperfect and twisted and so we are ashamed of our power
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:18.020]  Well, let me tell you you better get over that shame ladies and gentlemen and you better get on the field
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.260]  And you better stop
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.140]  second guessing yourself
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.780]  Because let me tell you we don't have long
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:36.980]  Speaking of solutions, you know, I called a week and a half ago for real succession via the declaration of independence
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.420]  That it is our right our duty the state's made the federal government
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.700]  It's our right in duty when the federal government's run by foreign banks
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.780]  Brad that's been hijacked says it'll secretly arrest us says it's gonna
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:54.820]  Pass vat and carbon taxes to give it to foreign banks while holding us hostage with the fiscal cliff and increasing spending
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:11:01.380]  That's their answer borrow borrow borrow more fiat from foreign banks who then get our real infrastructure for nothing
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.860]  Their answer
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:09.700]  Is just go into the night with them. My answer is have the states reorganize and from that position
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.740]  of constitutional authority and lawfulness
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:17.700]  Rebuke the out of control federal government not to to fully dissolve it
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:23.940]  But to remove the globalist and restore the republic a reupload of the bill of rights constitution declaration of independence
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.980]  No constitutional convention needed ron paul's written a editorial. It's at info wars calm
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:36.100]  Succession are we free to go and here is his talk earlier this week a little four-minute report where
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:41.700]  And I've talked to his office and talked to his crew. We've had his top advisors on they concur with my basic analysis
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:48.740]  Constitutional lawyer bruce fine constitutional lawyer both advisors to him edwin vieira were on again last week as you know
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:54.980]  And by the way youtube erased those videos today 20 plus videos just disappeared and said removed by user
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.060]  We're gonna have to reupload those and everybody has those were going viral with millions of views
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.460]  They did not want people seeing that info
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:06.900]  So we're gonna reupload those interviews and make sure people get them. But here is ron paul again
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:13.140]  Don't think you'll always just turn on the radio and get this. There are powerful forces that don't want you to hear this, okay?
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.180]  Here's ron paul
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:23.860]  Here's ron paul on right to revolt. Here it is. Hello. This is ron paul with your weekly update for november 19th
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:31.060]  Is all the recent talk of secession mere sour grapes over the election or perhaps something deeper
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:39.940]  Currently there are active petitions in support of secession for all 50 states with texas taking the lead in number of signatures
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:45.700]  Texas has gone over the number of signatures needed to generate a response from the administration
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.140]  And while I wouldn't hold my breath on texas actually succeeding
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.820]  I believe these petitions raise a lot of worthwhile questions about the nature of our union
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.060]  Is it treasonous to want to succeed from the united states?
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.980]  Many think the question of secession was settled by our civil war
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:09.700]  On the contrary the principles of self-governance and voluntary association are at the core of our founding
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:15.540]  Clearly thomas jefferson believes the secession was proper albeit as a last resort
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.900]  Writing to william giles in 1825 he concluded that states quote
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:29.460]  Should separate from our companions only when the sole alternatives left are the dissolution of our union with them
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.500]  Or submission to a government without limitation of powers a close quote
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:39.620]  Keep in mind that the first and third paragraph of the declaration of independence
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:46.980]  expressly contemplates the dissolution of a political union when the underlying government becomes tyrannical
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.420]  Do we have a government without
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:57.060]  Limitation of powers yet the federal government kept the union together through violence and force in the civil war
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:00.420]  But did might really make right?
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:07.380]  Secession is deeply american principle. This country was born through secession
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:14.340]  Some felt it was treasonous to succeed from england, but those traders became our country's greatest patriots
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:22.260]  There is nothing treasonous or unpatriotic about wanting a federal government that is more responsive to the people it represents
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:30.580]  That is what our revolutionary war was all about and today our own federal government is vastly overstepping its constitutional bounds
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.060]  With no signs of reform
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:42.260]  In fact the recent election only further entrenched the status quo if the possibility of secession is completely off the table
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:50.260]  There is nothing to stop the federal government from continuing to encroach on our liberties and no recourse for those who are second tired of it
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:55.460]  Consider the ballot measures that past in colorado and washington state regarding marijuana laws
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:01.300]  The people in those states have clearly indicated that they are ready to try something different
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:07.460]  Where drug policy is concerned that they will hit pause. We'll come back and play the last few minutes in the next segment
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:13.460]  And again, it's a much more powerful article that he wrote. It's an info wars.com secession
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.820]  Are we free to go?
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:17.780]  And he just breaks down the fact you're not in a free country
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:24.420]  If you can't leave. It's the states that created the federal government. The federal government was taken over by foreign banks. Read my article
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.340]  Banks bragged they've conquered the u.s. And europe
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:34.180]  For the dozens and dozens of quotes by the private mega banks bragging about it
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.780]  And so we've got to have the states
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:43.780]  Stand up and point this out if there's no hope. We can't keep rearranging
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:50.340]  Deck chairs on the titanic forever and then i'll give out the number for your take on this and a lot more coming up in the next
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:50.900]  segment
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:16:14.900]  Then i will also get into the big economic news straight ahead

[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:35.140]  You know a lot of people don't care if they're a slave they just don't want to be embarrassed about it
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:41.540]  So most people know we've got a corrupt out-of-control government run by corporate interests, but they don't care
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.980]  You know as long as as long as it's not rubbed in their face
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:51.780]  And the system likes to tell you how much power you got and how you're really voting for somebody at the federal level and
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.420]  You know the globalists come in and promote illegal aliens and say oh
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:01.700]  Obama winning shows that we've got to legalize all the illegal aliens now
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:06.660]  You know that validates obama's whole agenda and shows people want government run health care
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:12.580]  And shows people want socialism and the republicans better get in line and get behind that
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:18.500]  And so you see bainer come out and you even see ran paul come out i'm gonna talk about this tomorrow and say well
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.660]  We got to have an amnesty now
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.660]  The people have spoken
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:29.780]  Meanwhile there was proven election fraud nationwide. I had non-partisan election experts on like bev Harris
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.620]  She's been a democrat saying whole states romney clearly won
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.740]  They gave to obama and i wasn't even promoting romney
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.060]  The point is they want to create a mandate for everything obama's done
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:47.700]  I mean if the illegal aliens came and said hey, we want your guns should we turn all our guns in because there's a mandate
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.420]  There's not a mandate
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:56.180]  The foreign mega banks that have hijacked this country want us disarmed and want us bankrupted
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.100]  Do you understand that?
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.420]  and
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.420]  It is a hoax
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.660]  When they get up on the news and say
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:15.300]  Oh my gosh, we've got to be fair and friendly. We've got to legalize the 30 million illegal aliens here
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:19.620]  Because that's what latinos want
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.020]  And the media just says latinos want other latinos legalized
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.540]  And then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Well, I guess you're anti latino
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:37.140]  You're anti hispanic if you don't want people legalized really do they let people into guatemala?
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:42.100]  From the country south of there. No does mexico let guatemalan's in no
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:48.660]  Do they beat them up and put them in forced labor camps? Yes, I'm not saying that's good
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:53.060]  Does mexico shake down americans down there and rob them? Yes
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:58.340]  Can I go to mexico and show up at a hospital with my wife and say i'm here to have a baby
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.260]  Pay for it all and put me on full welfare. No
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.860]  I got an article right here. I'm going to finish the ron paul clip
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:12.580]  But you can go to the federal website
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:16.420]  And right there on the site

[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:35.140]  And it says you can get upwards of 60 000 dollars as a couple of years and have your baby here in the us for free go read it
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:39.780]  Of course, I can't go to the hospital and have it quote for free
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:45.300]  And again once they get a big enough group here who are clients of the corrupt government
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:49.460]  They will vote to take the guns the private property everything
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:55.060]  It's always the ultra rich university of texas has a couple billion in their permanent fund
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.940]  A billion and a half dollars in gold
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.740]  Over a hundred billion dollars in assets
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:08.740]  I don't know wikipedia says they have 20 billion dollars and in just physical assets real estate and eight billion in the permanent fund whatever
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:17.540]  But I get to pay now in their hospital district for their new medical school
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:22.980]  But it's only 300 bucks a year on top of the
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:31.540]  Massive amounts of money I pay in property tax and my property taxes go to the hospital district
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.620]  So I get to pay for abortions
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.060]  Only county in texas that does that. I mean, you know, it's it's all
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:41.540]  You see, I know the facts. I know I'm right and then I sit here
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:48.740]  And know whether you're black white whatever is ispanic
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.420]  that
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:56.340]  30 million illegal aliens in this country who now under the amnesty plans bush pushed and now they're pushing again
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:00.580]  Will be able to bring their families here. It'll just completely bankrupt the country
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.740]  I mean take california that's becoming completely bankrupted with the carbon taxes and the illegals
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:10.500]  What are they doing raising taxes again? They know when they do that it'll bankrupt things further. That's the consolidation plan
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.820]  I saw a few months ago in that big report that came out in the associated press
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:21.220]  Where all over the u.s. Tens of billions a year are sent to illegal aliens houses
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:25.460]  The irs will give illegal aliens as many tax ID numbers as they want
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:31.060]  And it was reported on one house in austin got 89 million dollars
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:37.060]  And there will be no prosecution of the 89 million dollars that one house got
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.380]  They went and checked the house. What was it 10 people were living there?
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.020]  89 million
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.060]  dollars
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:55.140]  I mean it was just a whole bunch of you can't even the fraud is so complete and people are like, why do they want fraud this this massive
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.860]  Because
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:04.180]  It's all to foreign banks that loan us zeros and ones. It's all burning made off. It's all made up
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.740]  It's all Ponzi
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.420]  It's all derivatives
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:13.940]  And the government wants the country fully bankrupt so bad and then they're going to say you're not going to get your
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.940]  Welfare you're not going to get your
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.540]  food stamps
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:23.220]  You're you know 50 million americans on it doubled in the last three and a half years from 25 million to 49 million
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:32.100]  Full step social security obama phone he gave us the phone he's going to do more guys pull up the weekly standard where the average
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.740]  welfare couple
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.740]  Get 61
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:43.940]  Well, they said 59,000 the numbers actually I looked it up 61,000 dollars
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.540]  And again, I'm not just throwing the illegal aliens under the bus a lot of them are so moral
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:55.060]  Comparatively that they refuse to take it some of them do there's a lot of criminal illegal aliens
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:59.140]  They're all criminals but you know technically but there's some that there aren't actual criminal types
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.140]  There it is over 60,000 welfare spent per household in poverty
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.140]  And that's the latest numbers
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.020]  From the community
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:10.420]  According to the census america community survey
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.100]  And you can't beat that you're not going to be able to stop that
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:25.140]  And as it all implodes they're going to say as they've done in europe three bailouts the last two years to foreign banks
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:29.460]  They go hey, we'll get more money for spain or greece for welfare and pensions
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:32.100]  and the rest of it
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:35.300]  If you raise all these taxes on the middle class
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:40.820]  When the middle class is disappearing, that's how the ultra rich extinct the middle class
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:45.860]  That's how they get rid of them. That's how they annihilate them
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:52.180]  And then they say give us vat. Give us carbon tax. Oh my gosh the fiscal cliff these new taxes
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.700]  Run by the federal government, which is really globalist controlled these new taxes
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.020]  They will keep the welfare payments going
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:05.780]  And I saw an article what was it in Reuters last week? I meant to cover but things are so crazy now
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.940]  This didn't even rate covering
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:13.300]  That they've had a whole bunch of congressional meetings in the congressional budget office of the white house the last few weeks
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.980]  And
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.980]  They're saying yes
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.540]  Yes, it's true. We're going to take
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.820]  The private pensions and the government's going to manage them now the 401ks and take
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:30.260]  Only about 20 percent the first time off the top
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.900]  And and again, you're like well, we've got to prop the system up can't let her all go down
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.940]  It's designed to bring it all down. They're bringing it down
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.820]  To consolidate it. They want you poor
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:48.500]  While training you to get the tiny chicken feed people will beg when they're done

[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.980]  Here's the type of stuff that catches my eye. This is out of bloomberg
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.700]  elderly
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:17.220]  at record spurs japan stores
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:28.980]  And it goes on to talk about the different uh stocks going up very weird headline elderly at record spurs japan stores
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:30.980]  Chase to 1.4 trillion
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.420]  and it goes on to say
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.340]  that
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:42.660]  The sales of adult diapers in japan exceeded those for babies for the first time last year
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:48.740]  At their major supermarkets nationwide customers
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:53.700]  Can feel japan aging literally it has made shopping carts
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.220]  lighter
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:03.140]  And it goes on to talk about the fact that not only is japan having on average 1.2 children
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.500]  I'm not making this up. There's another mainstream article on it
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:11.300]  But japanese women are jealous that men like to poop and urinate in their pants now
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:18.340]  This is a this is middle-aged men as part of decadence. So they now enjoy pooping and urinating in their pants
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.900]  Folks, I'm not I'm not making this up. Okay
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:24.500]  Again, it's not just the america that's collapsing into decadence
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:28.980]  Um, in fact, I read that last night another article researching this
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:35.460]  But you guys type in the huffington post had it, but it was also in roiders. It was uh, or people won't believe it type in
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:42.100]  Look at the exact headlines. I was seeing because I just I heard this on the radio as a news piece that
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:47.780]  Sales of adult diapers and aging japan outpaced that for babies or infants
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:52.580]  So I got home and searched it and found a whole bunch of mainstream articles about
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.580]  Uh
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.780]  Something like sales of diapers up
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.780]  Japanese more japanese women wearing diapers
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.860]  And then it just said that
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:08.900]  You know, they're rebelling against men that not only you know that the new fad with men is to
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:16.020]  Defecate in their pants. I'm not talking about old men that are incontinent. I mean, it's really cool and I'm not joking ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:21.300]  Yeah, there it is adult diapers big with young japanese women. You know, there it is
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.820]  What is that? What is that publication? Is that is that bloomberg?
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:30.660]  Okay, so that's huffington post. Yeah, I also saw roiders. Yeah, and it says it's the new trendy thing
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.300]  And if it's trendy, you got to do it. I mean, you know
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:37.700]  I'm not against having tattoos, but my god does everyone have to have one
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:42.420]  But at least americans kind of the trend is to act tough and have tattoos. I mean, I guess
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:49.700]  Acting like something is the beginning of maybe being tough. Of course in my book being tough isn't going to bars and
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:56.340]  Having ceremonial threats to fight with people that you then back down from if someone accepts the challenge
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.980]  ceremonial combat
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:04.740]  Uh, it would be actually being informed being involved to me. That's manly, you know, but not wanting to be a slave
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:12.340]  You know knowing that the cdc has hundreds of pages of adverse reactions from vaccines all the news says there's zero
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.740]  Side effects. I got a big stack of news here on the latest on gmo
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:20.420]  So causing massive organ failure all sorts of endocrine disruptions
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:25.460]  Diabetes just tons of scientific mainline studies how they're killing us by design
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:30.340]  But, you know, that's not manly, you know, I mean for a man to read studies
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.780]  So again, I uh
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:41.780]  But in japan it is more of uh, men have gotten because the japanese used to be totally into cleanliness, you know bathing twice a day
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.700]  You know into being very uh
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.660]  Hardworking decent people but see the new decadence is and the television sells this
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:53.220]  Because they're getting everybody ready to be euthanized
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.900]  Is uh to uh, I did some research on it. It was uh
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:02.340]  Over here. It's it's it's amputating limbs now. That's that's the new sexy thing to do
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.780]  It's like, oh, you only chopped your fingers off. I chopped my arm off
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:11.300]  Oh, really? I chopped both my legs off and the new trendy thing is here in america thousands have now done it
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.540]  I forget the exact name for you can look it up
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:17.140]  Uh men have their arms and legs cut off and then they're putting a diaper
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:23.300]  So actually maybe the japanese picked up on that and then you're taken care of by your uh by your uh
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:26.020]  Your male lover
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:32.900]  See societies do this once they get ready to totally collapse the romans did it the babelonians did it
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.700]  We're already collapsed. You know that, right?
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:40.980]  And and and it's just going to become more evident now in the next few years
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:47.620]  Oh, I'm sorry, uh, I'm the other news here. Yes, elderly, uh wearing their diapers
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.340]  Now the tsa mothballed and shut down the scanners almost everywhere that got picked up
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:58.340]  My cbs news and others on our call for national opt out day of the cancer causing scanners
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:03.380]  Two weeks ago congress had a report admitting it was causing cancer and the tsa had been caught lying about that
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:08.580]  Obama's secret directive again congress not allowed to see the new secret directive. Why?
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.300]  I mean the states have stood down the congress has stood down
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:15.300]  Because we're under a banking dictatorship and now they're saying
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:18.820]  Because oh
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:24.020]  That that goldman sacks and jp morgan they're going to pay for the president's inauguration
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:30.020]  We're now going to have corporate sponsorships and and that's a good idea. Maybe the president should start wearing like a nascar uniform
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.380]  I think it's jesse ventura said this on my show a few months ago
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:38.740]  I think that's where I heard it where they all just wear the logos of what owns them
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:41.700]  Of course most of them are Rothschild Rockefeller subsidiaries
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.020]  So how about just a big Rothschild Rockefeller?
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:47.620]  We want the world for ourselves and the life extension technologies
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:52.420]  We've almost got it once the robot armies are in place and the automated kill systems in place
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.500]  We're going to launch drones and kill all of you
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.900]  President could just wear a big big robe that said that on it
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.900]  I
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:05.940]  Know you think it's funny out there because under the new decadence you want to be killed
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:11.780]  They've got all the the future. You know soon there won't be any humans. It's going to be beautiful
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.780]  They're getting you ready to accept it. So you don't fight it
[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:20.420]  I understand I under and and you know what if you think you're trash
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.820]  And you think you're ugly and worthless and you want to lay down and die to the globalist. That's your issue
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.060]  I don't want to
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.620]  You know, I've studied the globalists. I don't like what they're doing. I don't like what they stand for
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:36.740]  And uh, I'm trying to organize people to resist it peacefully
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:43.780]  Because the globalists are often their ivory armored towers. They hope we have some fight with their dumbed-down police and military
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.780]  And I'm not attacking the police and military. They're dumbed-down like the general public
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:50.580]  They've been raised on adulterated poison gmo
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:55.460]  Additives they're really just drug chemicals set in front of a television from birth
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:58.260]  Have no idea. They're in a total daze
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:03.460]  And a lot of a lot of yuppies in mid-level globalist social engineer
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:09.300]  Psychologist types they get off advertising types. They get off admin
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:14.900]  Types, you know advertiser types they they all talk about how dumb the public is in their publications
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:20.820]  But they get off on it's like funny to them. Oh, you think it's funny. Your kids are going to live around these people
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:26.900]  There's total blowback from all this into the upper echelons. The upper echelons are a bunch of rotting scum
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:31.940]  By the way, their life expectancy is going down. Let me tell you how the universe works
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.220]  You're not really going to get all that life extension
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:39.940]  You may extend yourself in agony, but you won't even be what you were before
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:46.340]  But you'll have scientists that you know tell you fraudulently you are you've destroyed yourselves
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:50.980]  Good job new world order. If you were so elite, you would have lifted up everybody
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:53.860]  instead
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:58.660]  You try to drive everybody down so you could be on top because you're threatened by real consciousness
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.780]  But you will not enter
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:05.940]  Into the kingdom of heaven you will not enter into the next phase of human development
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:11.700]  You are a failure and I know that my gut knows that you know what my gut is everybody's got it
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:18.900]  It's called my spirit and the oh by the way the controllers all know that's real and all the science is just confirming it
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:23.460]  And they want you shut off from that. Well, you know what? I'm not shut off from that
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:26.260]  And my gut's never wrong
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:28.260]  ever
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.460]  ever
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:35.460]  ever
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:40.180]  The only time I fail is when I follow my flesh and not my spirit
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:42.180]  You know what my spirit says?
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:47.620]  Alex don't get sad that the wicked seem to thrive and can't be stopped
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:51.060]  They will be cut down
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:53.140]  Come the harvest
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.140]  They will cut themselves down
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.700]  They will destroy themselves the house of Rothschild will fall

[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.660]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.700]  All right, let's take some phone calls here in the final segment
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:34.420]  I'll be back tomorrow 12 noon eastern 11 a.m. Central with a three-hour mainline
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.900]  weekday transmission
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:41.860]  I've been kind of a dark mood today just because I I understand reality to a deeper and deeper level
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:46.100]  During the break john bound and they're running the board and the video cameras and the rest of it. He said
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.060]  I am force nightly news reporter
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:54.660]  The moonlight's here running the radio show. He said, uh, you know, they call our libertarian movement a movement
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:48:00.100]  They call conservatism a movement. They call communism a movement. Why don't we call this a movement? And I said it has a name
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:02.100]  It's called organized evil
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:07.540]  It's really a eugenics movement a playing god movement a mad scientist movement
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:15.700]  A final revolution is what they call it and they they said they would construct kind of a false political
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.500]  socio economic reality
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:25.300]  And use the media to keep us within that confined area and then without and then with a dumbed-down mass
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:31.140]  There's really no way to revolt against it because once you've dumbed people down multi-generationally
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:37.220]  And reduce the language which has now happened. It's it's almost impossible to even communicate with people
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.460]  especially when they've been given a psychological
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:44.260]  compulsion and almost psychological trigger to defend their servitude
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.140]  Because they don't want to admit their slaves
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:52.500]  Not just because they're cowards, but because at a base level they have no respect for themselves
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.460]  And don't believe they could do anything and they're lazy
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.180]  But it isn't up to ruined
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.300]  Dumbed-down sheeple to defeat this evil
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:05.220]  It's to those of us that aren't perfect but have enough virtue
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:09.300]  And understanding and who can glimpse the beauty of our species
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:16.980]  Our our greater angels instead of our lesser angels to reach towards the stars because we we certainly can do amazing things
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:24.820]  The globalists force us the most vile garbage to to kind of you know have us resonate at a very low level
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:27.780]  So that we're easily managed and I just
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:33.140]  I've never tried to keep people in darkness. That is so enathominal to what I stand for
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:37.220]  I would think that would be commonplace, but it turns out in this modern world
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:39.940]  That is so rare
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:43.860]  Because good people do not have an instinct to a will to power
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:48.740]  Evil does but you better get the will to fight these people
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:54.660]  And and so many good people try to overthink it. They've got to come with a master plan how you're going to beat them by yourself
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:58.660]  No, just start engaging them start speaking out start saying no
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.380]  Start educating others
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:07.540]  Now is the time ladies and gentlemen spread the word about info wars.com and prison planet.com

[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.660]  I was actually calling about the successionist movement go ahead an official start
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:10.580]  If we wanted to succeed from a federal government should we start a petition for that?
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:13.460]  Well, you don't go to the federal government
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:17.940]  It made news attention when people go to obama asking a foreign agent of the un
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:23.380]  Who violated article one section nine to become the head of the security council a few years ago?
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.380]  I mean that was high treason totally illegal
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:29.620]  Uh, but but it's a way to publicly say we don't like what's happening
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:38.420]  I'm saying not a civil war succession a declaration of independence the states are all that's left the only remnant of the old republic
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:44.020]  They've got to use the secession power because it says you can they can remake the government however they see fit
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:47.940]  Well, we choose the real republic who will argue against that
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:52.900]  They're trying to brand secession as you know the civil war kook lux clan notice
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:56.100]  They've been selling link in the last three four years is god
[01:51:56.580 --> 01:52:02.420]  With all these movies and books and video games and stuff because they want to have the federal government come in and crush the states
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:06.900]  They know when they put the economy into cardiac arrest the states are going to say no
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:13.300]  And any refusal by the states if congress says no to anything the president does they're going to be called secessionist
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:18.900]  Congress is told the un commands our military. We've been conquered sir
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.900]  Yes, that's all the reports on all the left
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:24.900]  Yeah, now they want to
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:29.300]  Now they want to mop up the states and the media and stuff and we got to dig in
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:32.180]  And say no go ahead
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.220]  What do we know about congress if congress is supposed to put a stop to all of this?
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:40.980]  Absolutely, but the you know, they've hired a bunch of criminals or they've got them blackmailed. I appreciate your call sir
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:43.940]  We're in deep trouble, but the only hope we've got is it made on
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:50.180]  How bad a trouble we've gotten into okay. Let's go to uh, mike and oregon real fast mike
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.860]  Hey, Alex. How's it going my bill around the brother good
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.220]  Well, I was calling you to talk to you about the
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:59.620]  disinformed
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:05.620]  People down here trying to tell me that the climate change in hurricane sanities caused by our subs
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:10.180]  Yeah, they think if they pay the Rothschild gore exchange, that's literally who owns it
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:14.500]  Al Gore and the Rothschilds are all invested in and it's a Rothschild owned exchange totally
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:18.340]  It's it's their exchange. Look at that mainstream news that that will stop hurricanes
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:20.100]  There's always been storms
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:24.500]  And it's the new global government tax and they tell a bunch of primitive dumb down idiots
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:31.700]  Look magic is back people believe in voodoo now again. There are a bunch of superstitious idiots that can't even read or write
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:35.380]  And they think paying the globalist money will stop hurricanes
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:40.500]  I know it's it's it's driving me crazy. I can't even conceive or
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:43.940]  Anything how these people are even thinking and it's driving me so crazy
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:46.740]  I was wondering if we could do a world a world ground on air
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:49.300]  Absolutely go ahead sir
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:56.180]  Wow, thanks for the call. I got a jump here man, uh, Daniel in Louisiana. Go ahead
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:00.500]  Hey, Alex. How are you today, man? I'm I'm pretty freaked out how bad stuff's getting
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:06.340]  Yeah, me too me too. I wanted I was just listening to you and I jotted down some points and I was going to make a couple points
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:10.340]  Go ahead. Okay. Oh, yeah, you know one of the things that scares me a lot
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:13.700]  is how people have thrown out their common sense
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:15.700]  and uh
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:17.620]  and also all people people
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.900]  Oh
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:19.940]  They uh
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:26.260]  They lack of respect for the invisible world and and and when we talk about the chemicals in the food water and also our invisible government
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:29.140]  People people have thrown out their common sense and they also
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:35.220]  They don't respect the invisible world like I was just talking about but the shadow government is now public
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:40.980]  Obama signs an order because congress wouldn't pass it. We know what the order was handed over to the u.n
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:44.020]  And he says well, I'll just sign it in secret and implement it
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:48.260]  And and congress for a week says we'd like to see that and obama says no
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:55.140]  Folks the congress writes the stinking laws the congress raises the taxes. They declare the war
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:59.220]  People man, we're in we're in trouble. I just get ready
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:07.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, we need reform in in in all of our institute institutions the educational our medical
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:10.740]  Of our government. We need mad reform
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:12.740]  I
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:17.620]  Agree brother great points. Sorry. I waited at the end to go to calls. I'll try to be better tomorrow
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.340]  Uh, frank louisiana real quick go ahead
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.300]  Yeah, alex. Uh, how you doing buddy?
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:27.620]  Uh, I'm pretty freaked out actually the legal basis that that you have to do on the secession movement
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:32.740]  Is not only the 10th amendment. It's the power for article 4 section 4 clause of the constitution
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:36.580]  the guarantee clauses the united states guarantees the
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:41.540]  Several states who have the power now because they're giving the guarantee a republic
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:44.980]  Well, if your congress doesn't issue your currency, you're not a republic
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.180]  You're literally a potocracy if your congress doesn't control your military
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:50.180]  You're not a republic if your congress
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:58.100]  Doesn't know what the cyber security order is. I mean that is red alert level, but I mean exactly
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:00.740]  These courts can beat him
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:04.100]  By using the power for article 4 section 4 guarantee clause
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:09.940]  And issue rits of court warrant to the court warrant to the federal reserve banks on the anti-monopoly laws
[01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:10.660]  I agree
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:17.380]  No, the power is all there for the states who can remake the government get rid of it remake it whatever they want anytime they want
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:19.780]  Declaration of independence and as you said
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:25.700]  Article 4 section 4 but look at obama violating article 1 section 9 heading up the un
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:30.340]  I mean, I mean that was like a king coronation when he did that and the media didn't even cover it
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:34.020]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to uh, mike and fema region 10
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:37.540]  I guess that's out on the old west coast. Go ahead, sir
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:41.380]  Yes, sir. Hey, I just got a crazy story real quick. Um, when I was 19
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:46.420]  I wasn't awake yet and uh, this girl who I went to high school with called me one day
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:52.260]  She's like, hey the police departments here. They're giving us a speech on domestic terrorism in our country
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:56.500]  And I'm like, okay, and she's like, um, you know back then my space, you know
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.820]  I had a picture of me with one of my rifles on my space
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:03.540]  And they were giving this presentation and they showed the picture of me during the presentation
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:08.340]  My eyes blacked out and we're like this is a domestic terrorist that could live in your area
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:11.540]  So she asked the officer. Hey, can you print this up all these?
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:15.140]  You know my uh powerpoint pictures on the you know print them up out of the printer
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:19.300]  So she brought me a copy of it and there I was domestic tears because I owned a gun
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:24.020]  Listen, I'm out of time but you should do a youtube video on it. I know I police have sent me those they
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:30.980]  They say George Washington and Thomas Jefferson or terrorist. I mean, I got it on video bigger than Dallas shot in Kansas City
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:34.580]  I had a time man. Look, we're all under attack. I
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:41.440]  Believe in you out there all of you you better get involved and get informed and find out just how bad it is
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:46.660]  If you look into what I'm claiming you're gonna find out it's true and then some what are you gonna do for your family?
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:54.660]  You're gonna roll over and die?
