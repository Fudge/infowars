[00:00.000 --> 00:05.240]  It's Tuesday, October 25th, 2022.
[00:05.240 --> 00:09.760]  Thank you for tuning in to the special edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09.760 --> 00:11.880]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:11.880 --> 00:17.200]  Coming up today, Owen Schreuer at Hotep Jesus will be co-hosting for the balance of the
[00:17.200 --> 00:18.200]  broadcast.
[00:18.200 --> 00:24.400]  But in the first 30 minutes, I'm going to cover some very, very positive news on multiple
[00:24.400 --> 00:30.280]  fronts and also some very, very negative, serious news so we can all identify the enemies
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.680]  of humanity and be aware of their activities and work together to stop them.
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.400]  And if we've shown one thing, it's that when humanity knows about a problem, we come together
[00:38.400 --> 00:41.800]  and we defeat it only by suppressing the truth.
[00:41.800 --> 00:47.880]  Again, these true agents of evil continue to expand their control.
[00:47.880 --> 00:51.480]  All right, here's some of the good news, and we'll come back from break and lay out a lot
[00:51.480 --> 00:52.800]  more detail.
[00:52.800 --> 00:58.800]  The Democratic Party had a large coalition of 30-plus prominent Democrats in the House
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.440]  of Representatives come out here today and have a press conference and send a letter
[01:04.440 --> 01:10.240]  to the puppet Joe Biden pointing out to him that in national polls, 80-plus percent of
[01:10.240 --> 01:15.720]  Americans bipartisanly are against the war in Ukraine and even more against the escalating
[01:15.720 --> 01:23.640]  war and the national polls, 99 percent of humanity is sane and does not want thermal
[01:23.640 --> 01:24.640]  nuclear war.
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.440]  So 80 to 85 percent don't want war, 99 percent do not want nuclear war.
[01:29.440 --> 01:31.920]  Seems like pretty common sense to me.
[01:31.920 --> 01:39.200]  And so now finally, thanks to Democrat, liberal, classical type liberal supporters going out
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.400]  and protesting, not just the squad, but other members of the Democratic Party and confronting
[01:45.400 --> 01:52.840]  Pelosi, confronting Biden and others on their warmongering, they are now having to back
[01:52.840 --> 01:53.840]  off of this.
[01:53.840 --> 02:01.880]  And the Democratic coalition that's now starting to go public and speak out, particularly this
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.080]  Democrat coalition in the House, is demanding that the funding for the war rapidly be cut
[02:09.080 --> 02:15.520]  off and that only the Mediterranean aid be given and that the United States, pressure,
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.560]  NATO, and Putin to come to the table with a peace deal.
[02:20.560 --> 02:24.080]  That is certainly a good idea on so many fronts, not just nuclear war, not just energy prices
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.480]  being out of control, not just a lot of the food out of Russia and Ukraine, not getting
[02:28.480 --> 02:35.560]  shipped or not getting even grown or picked, and not to mention all the fertilizer problems
[02:35.560 --> 02:41.200]  with about a third of the world's fertilizer coming out of Russia, all of that compounding.
[02:41.200 --> 02:49.640]  There's also the issue of how this war could, again, be used as the pretext of the false
[02:49.640 --> 02:56.920]  flag to basically have a wider war as the smoke screen for an expansion of the Great
[02:56.920 --> 02:57.920]  Reset.
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.200]  There's obviously a lot of other big facets to this, but this just shows that just six
[03:03.200 --> 03:09.080]  months ago when this war hadn't been going on for several months, out in the open, now
[03:09.080 --> 03:15.080]  an open, not just proxies war, but really de facto war with Russia, there was hardly
[03:15.080 --> 03:19.480]  anybody publicly protesting or criticizing or speaking out against it.
[03:19.480 --> 03:27.120]  But now across the board, from populist conservatives like Buchanan to populist leaders like Joe
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.120]  Rogan and, of course, Tiger Carlson and myself and many others and, of course, the general
[03:31.120 --> 03:37.960]  public, we have gotten the snowball rolling bigger and bigger downhill, and so it shows
[03:37.960 --> 03:43.680]  that resistance to this type of tyranny is not futile, but we've got to stay vigilant
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.680]  and really push hard, because when the globalist deep state realizes that the public's turning
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.440]  against them, which is now happening, and actually getting off their butts and getting
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.480]  politically, culturally engaged, they are absolutely set to stage a false flag.
[03:57.480 --> 04:00.400]  When Russia warns that NATO is getting ready to stage a dirty bomb false flag or other
[04:00.400 --> 04:03.680]  false flags, I believe them.
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.760]  The NATO coalition has been telegraphing this red line warning Russia is going to do it.
[04:08.760 --> 04:11.240]  That way people believe it when they blame it on Russia.
[04:11.240 --> 04:16.440]  But Russia doesn't have a motive, as they would say, in Latin, qui bono or who benefits.
[04:16.440 --> 04:23.240]  So Russia is already basically losing this war and bringing in NATO officially or this,
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.720]  quote, multinational coalition that's already massed in and around Ukraine and Russia into
[04:27.720 --> 04:35.480]  the war would hasten their defeat when Russia is waiting for the winter to come to put pressure
[04:35.480 --> 04:39.000]  on Europe and European population to demand a peace deal.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.760]  So Russia has no motive.
[04:40.760 --> 04:44.120]  The globalists have all the motives, and that's why we're at a dangerous point right now,
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.120]  because the New World War is in a lot of trouble, and this is the time of false flags, plus
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.320]  the deep state Dems are about to lose the election big in the midterms, so keep your
[04:51.320 --> 04:52.320]  eyes peeled.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.320]  We'll be right back.
[04:53.320 --> 04:54.720]  We're in the season of the false flag.
[04:54.720 --> 05:02.640]  It's our best seller.
[05:02.640 --> 05:06.920]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller, but as folks
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.600]  tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy
[05:11.600 --> 05:16.040]  it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller, and it's been sold out
[05:16.040 --> 05:18.360]  for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[05:18.360 --> 05:23.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[05:23.800 --> 05:24.800]  function of the body.
[05:24.800 --> 05:29.600]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[05:29.600 --> 05:32.160]  need to live and be healthy.
[05:32.160 --> 05:36.560]  Essential means without these things you die, and so much of the food is debased, there's
[05:36.560 --> 05:41.440]  so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with
[05:41.440 --> 05:42.440]  a product like this.
[05:42.440 --> 05:45.960]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[05:45.960 --> 05:50.480]  very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the info war, so the only way you lose is
[05:50.480 --> 05:55.920]  not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infowarstore.com
[05:55.920 --> 06:12.440]  for 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[06:12.440 --> 06:18.400]  From the front lines of the information for joining us on this live, original edition
[06:18.400 --> 06:25.400]  of the Alex Jones show, it is Tuesday, October 25th, 2022, and we've got a lot of really
[06:25.400 --> 06:29.400]  good news and also some very, very bad news as well.
[06:29.400 --> 06:31.640]  Let me break down some of what's coming up.
[06:31.640 --> 06:39.560]  Next segment, I want to lay out a very important article that details the system of elite capture,
[06:39.560 --> 06:43.520]  and the fact that if populations are aware of elite capture and how it operates, we
[06:43.520 --> 06:44.760]  can come together and defeat it.
[06:44.760 --> 06:50.080]  If we are not aware of elite capture and who the elites are, we don't have a chance
[06:50.080 --> 06:53.600]  in Hades, a snowball's chance in hell.
[06:53.600 --> 06:55.160]  So who's most powerful?
[06:55.160 --> 06:59.280]  CCP, Hollywood, the people in control of Pentagon, oil and energy sector.
[06:59.280 --> 07:03.640]  What is the most powerful elite capture organization on the planet?
[07:03.640 --> 07:08.320]  We'll be covering that coming up next segment and tying it into the amazing leaders we're
[07:08.320 --> 07:15.440]  seeing emerge nationally and regionally in Canada, like Alberta's premier, Danielle Smith,
[07:15.440 --> 07:20.680]  who is coming directly out against the WES, the forced injections, and the New World Order.
[07:20.680 --> 07:26.280]  We're also going to look at who is funding the stop oil extinction rebellion.
[07:26.280 --> 07:32.440]  We'll also be looking at the DeSantis, Chris debates that have been taking place, Megan
[07:32.440 --> 07:36.200]  Kelly's sister died of a heart attack at 58.
[07:36.200 --> 07:39.560]  Hillary Clinton's basically calling for a civil war, claiming Republicans are going
[07:39.560 --> 07:43.640]  to steal the midterms and the general election.
[07:43.640 --> 07:50.080]  She can say it, but you can't say they try to steal, and so much more here today.
[07:50.080 --> 07:55.640]  But the first thing I wanted to hit was some of this next level gaslighting taking place
[07:55.640 --> 08:00.640]  from the puppet Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and other globalist operatives.
[08:00.640 --> 08:04.360]  Now there's too many clips of this to plan all, but we're just going to play two right
[08:04.360 --> 08:06.400]  now back to back.
[08:06.400 --> 08:15.720]  Here is Biden yesterday saying that energy prices have gone down under his presidency,
[08:15.720 --> 08:24.040]  even though they have doubled on average in the last 23 months of the occupied government
[08:24.040 --> 08:26.680]  that we've had since they got into office.
[08:26.680 --> 08:36.680]  He got in there 20, 21 months ago, but he got elected by fraud 20, 23 months ago.
[08:36.680 --> 08:38.480]  The next clip is another short clip.
[08:38.480 --> 08:44.120]  It's Pelosi saying that inflation is not a big deal because it's happening all over
[08:44.120 --> 08:45.120]  the world.
[08:45.120 --> 08:48.760]  Well, yeah, central banks are coordinated in how they're doing this, but that people
[08:48.760 --> 08:50.760]  are concerned about inflation here.
[08:50.760 --> 08:56.920]  People are concerned about the cost of living going up, which is the main indicator of inflation.
[08:56.920 --> 09:00.760]  So this is the definition of gaslighting.
[09:00.760 --> 09:04.720]  It's like throwing somebody in the ocean and saying the ocean doesn't exist, or throwing
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.960]  somebody in a lake and saying water isn't wet, or pointing at the sun at high noon and saying
[09:09.960 --> 09:11.160]  the sun isn't yellow.
[09:11.160 --> 09:13.480]  I mean, these people are next level.
[09:13.480 --> 09:15.880]  And you watch this, you think, well, they're just senile.
[09:15.880 --> 09:16.880]  They're just idiots.
[09:16.880 --> 09:17.880]  No.
[09:17.880 --> 09:21.040]  They're always saying that they're all doing it, they're using psychological warfare to
[09:21.040 --> 09:27.800]  overwhelm you and condition you to just tune out and then see everything as basically propaganda
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.360]  so you're unable to separate truth from fiction and basically make people give up or break
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.360]  your will.
[09:34.360 --> 09:36.440]  Don't let them break your will.
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.400]  Here again is Biden and Pelosi gaslighting the American people.
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.440]  By bringing down the cost of everyday things they have to work their families through.
[09:46.440 --> 09:51.280]  It's not just food and energy, which is critical, we brought down the cost of energy.
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.640]  And the fact is, is that when I hear people talk about inflation as I heard them there,
[09:56.640 --> 09:58.680]  we have to change that subject.
[09:58.680 --> 10:04.600]  Inflation is a global phenomenon, the EU, the European Union, the UK, the British have
[10:04.600 --> 10:07.880]  a higher inflation rate than we do here.
[10:07.880 --> 10:12.160]  It's not, the fight is not about inflation, it's about the cost of living.
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.600]  And it's essential to understand that not only are they lying to us about inflation being
[10:16.600 --> 10:22.520]  a problem and the cost of living to go up, but they are also not telling you that they're
[10:22.520 --> 10:27.760]  the ones that have openly bragged that they would shut off and curtail US industry.
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.360]  Need I lay out some of the examples, turning off pipelines, killing oil and gas drilling
[10:32.360 --> 10:40.040]  permits, trying to restrict exports of our oil, which is also good for industry at every
[10:40.040 --> 10:43.840]  level, trying to shut down US industry.
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.560]  That's the goal, bring us to our knees through siege, through economic warfare.
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.200]  People really are waking up to this gaslighting and brainwashing.
[10:53.200 --> 11:00.320]  Now let's play a clip from last night on MSNBC, where they had a town hall in Western Pennsylvania
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.320]  and tried to project guilt onto the Pennsylvanians for January 6th.
[11:06.320 --> 11:10.240]  The MSNBC house got shredded, here's the clip.
[11:10.240 --> 11:15.440]  Maastriano was at the insurrection and he was photographed breaching one of the restricted
[11:15.440 --> 11:17.160]  areas.
[11:17.160 --> 11:18.640]  Is that okay?
[11:18.640 --> 11:19.640]  Which area?
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.840]  Because I saw a video where Capitol officers were taking away barriers and unlocking doors.
[11:25.840 --> 11:28.600]  So I mean, they opened the gates and let them in.
[11:28.600 --> 11:34.120]  So it shouldn't be disqualifying for an elected official if they participated in January 6th?
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.120]  He didn't strike anybody?
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.120]  He didn't hurt anybody?
[11:36.120 --> 11:37.120]  Yeah.
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.960]  And the only one that died was a protester there, not a Capitol police officer.
[11:40.960 --> 11:41.960]  An unarmed female veteran.
[11:41.960 --> 11:43.360]  That's the only one that died.
[11:43.360 --> 11:45.120]  That's the only one who died.
[11:45.120 --> 11:46.120]  A police officer did die.
[11:46.120 --> 11:47.120]  No.
[11:47.120 --> 11:48.120]  It was a stroke.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.120]  That's not on site.
[11:49.120 --> 11:50.120]  That's not on site.
[11:50.120 --> 11:53.480]  By that, that's because he shouldn't have been a police officer, it was one woman.
[11:53.480 --> 11:56.360]  So what do you make, though, overall of January 6th?
[11:56.360 --> 11:59.760]  I mean, it was watching that footage, it was pretty disturbing, I mean, there were people
[11:59.760 --> 12:03.120]  throwing X for a minute at the walls and it was, you know, it's the Capitol.
[12:03.120 --> 12:05.120]  It looked a lot like Antitha's, actually.
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.360]  It looked a lot, except on a much smaller scale, it looked the same as the Black Lives
[12:09.360 --> 12:10.360]  Matter rights.
[12:10.360 --> 12:12.360]  That's what I saw, the similarities to me.
[12:12.360 --> 12:14.360]  In Indianapolis, Burns, Kenosha.
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.360]  But so it was okay just because one side that you disagree with?
[12:19.360 --> 12:20.360]  No.
[12:20.360 --> 12:21.360]  I'm saying Antitha infiltrated.
[12:21.360 --> 12:22.360]  It was good for one.
[12:22.360 --> 12:23.360]  It's good for the other.
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.640]  Anybody who's armed, anybody, anybody who caused property destruction, that needs to
[12:27.640 --> 12:28.640]  be dealt with.
[12:28.640 --> 12:34.120]  But if you're there making your voice heard at the rightfuls' house, no less, that's
[12:34.120 --> 12:35.120]  it.
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.040]  And again, it's a fundamental constitutional right of an American citizen, and people should
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.240]  not be being held political prisoner because of it.
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.240]  For misdemeanors.
[12:44.240 --> 12:45.240]  That's East Germany.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.240]  That's East Germany.
[12:46.240 --> 12:49.000]  That's what's scary.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.720]  It was an actual fiery, but mostly peaceful protest.
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.560]  And the other ones that were the...
[12:55.560 --> 12:59.120]  Was a protest legitimate in your eyes?
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.720]  Administration, I feel like, is using it as their Reichstag fire.
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.400]  Well, that's exactly what they're using in their eyes.
[13:07.400 --> 13:12.680]  Now let's move to the giant awakening that's taking place in Florida.
[13:12.680 --> 13:18.840]  Polls a few years ago had to stand us down by 12 to 15 points, but he won by a hefty
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.840]  margin.
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.800]  Now those same polls that we know are oversampling Democrats show him winning between 10 and
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.240]  15 points against Crest, the old donkey, as he calls him.
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.800]  Here's a short clip from the debate last night where DeSantis brings up the fact that
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.600]  children can't get tattoos, or can't buy alcohol, or join the military for that matter,
[13:40.600 --> 13:43.440]  but they can have their breasts chopped off.
[13:43.440 --> 13:44.800]  You're a 15-year-old.
[13:44.800 --> 13:48.280]  You can't go get a tattoo in the state of Florida, yet we're saying you could get a
[13:48.280 --> 13:49.360]  double mastectomy?
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.360]  Of course not.
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.520]  It is inappropriate to do this for minors, and in Florida we are not going to allow that
[13:54.520 --> 13:55.720]  to happen.
[13:55.720 --> 14:02.480]  Not just Americans, but people across the world are waking up to the threat of the globalist,
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.840]  of the corporate, anti-free market, scientific dictatorship that's being set up to control
[14:08.840 --> 14:10.520]  our world.
[14:10.520 --> 14:16.440]  Another example of this is a big, important story on infowars.com with a headline, Democrats
[14:16.440 --> 14:22.480]  in panic mode, and it lays out countless polls and examples of where they even themselves
[14:22.480 --> 14:24.960]  admit they're in deep trouble.
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.400]  That's why Hillary Clinton has come out and said Republicans are planning to not just
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.480]  steal the midterms, but steal the general election coming up in two years.
[14:33.480 --> 14:39.320]  They know there is a massive political realignment against them, and they are trying to set the
[14:39.320 --> 14:44.360]  stage to try to steal the election, and if we question their theft, well, we're criminal
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.640]  terrorists, but they, if they're unable to steal it, are planning to then claim that
[14:49.640 --> 14:51.480]  we stole it.
[14:51.480 --> 14:53.760]  This is the upside-down world we live in.
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.560]  Now, I want to hit elite capture, it's a very important concept, it's a fact in history,
[14:59.560 --> 15:05.880]  and as people begin to learn about it, every different corrupt faction is in deeper and
[15:05.880 --> 15:06.880]  deeper trouble.
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.160]  But before we go to break, I want to thank Lester for your incredible support.
[15:11.160 --> 15:15.200]  You can see that infowars is the globalist number one enemy because we're over the target,
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.360]  and when you support the broadcast, you couldn't be supporting a more important organization
[15:19.360 --> 15:20.360]  in this fight.
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.240]  So please, there's only a few days left in the biggest cell of the year, go to infowarsstore.com,

[15:57.600 --> 15:59.680]  We'll be right back with a breakdown of elite capture.
[15:59.680 --> 16:05.480]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[16:05.480 --> 16:06.480]  you.
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.680]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence infowars because they rightly see
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.760]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[16:15.760 --> 16:19.960]  the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[16:19.960 --> 16:26.120]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links to infowars.com
[16:26.120 --> 16:30.360]  and to also financially support infowars.com for the most critical time on our fight by
[16:30.360 --> 16:35.600]  using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.200]  These people are coming for your birthright, they're coming for your First Amendment, they
[16:39.200 --> 16:42.480]  admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.680]  I'm in your hands and I'm asking if your support now, you have my commitment to never give
[16:46.680 --> 16:49.840]  up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[16:49.840 --> 16:51.040]  Thank you for all your past support.
[16:51.040 --> 16:56.880]  I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts at infowarsstore.com with promo code 1776
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.680]  for an additional 10% off on the already big sales and huge discounts.
[17:00.680 --> 17:06.560]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.920]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[17:11.920 --> 17:15.760]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[17:15.760 --> 17:16.760]  to speak freely.
[17:16.760 --> 17:20.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.480]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[17:21.480 --> 17:25.600]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.920]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[17:29.920 --> 17:30.920]  your support.
[17:30.920 --> 17:34.000]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.520]  as to America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[17:38.520 --> 17:42.200]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[17:42.200 --> 17:43.880]  because of your past support.
[17:43.880 --> 17:47.720]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[19:06.480 --> 19:11.400]  to persevere against the tats never before seen in the western world against independent
[19:11.400 --> 19:12.400]  media.
[19:12.400 --> 19:15.800]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight, and over the years you have come to the table, you
[19:15.800 --> 19:20.360]  have stepped to the plate so many times and kept Info Wars and free speech on the air
[19:20.360 --> 19:25.240]  and I thank you, but now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't
[19:25.240 --> 19:27.240]  pay them and I need your support.
[19:27.240 --> 19:31.640]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight
[19:31.640 --> 19:39.400]  against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com and saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.760]  gives you a go for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[19:43.760 --> 19:48.520]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making is almost over and right at
[19:48.520 --> 19:52.440]  the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[19:52.440 --> 19:56.080]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[19:56.080 --> 20:01.480]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[20:01.480 --> 20:21.280]  Leading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:21.280 --> 20:27.320]  Let's break down an extremely important concept that everybody knows is real.
[20:27.320 --> 20:31.760]  You see it every day in your life, you read about it in the history books and that is
[20:31.760 --> 20:38.840]  Elite Capture, very important article at townhall.com, Elite Capture, what it is and
[20:38.840 --> 20:42.240]  how it threatens America's future.
[20:42.240 --> 20:48.200]  Now the important part of this article delves on the CCP and how they own four of the six
[20:48.200 --> 20:54.120]  big Hollywood studio production houses and how they're allied with the left and big tech
[20:54.120 --> 21:04.160]  and the Democratic Party to sow social discord, crime, racial division, transgenderism, pedophilia,
[21:04.160 --> 21:05.160]  all of it.
[21:05.160 --> 21:10.600]  The very garbage being funded here in the U.S. by the CCP is illegal in their country
[21:10.600 --> 21:14.480]  because they know it undermines and destroys society.
[21:14.480 --> 21:15.960]  It's that simple.
[21:15.960 --> 21:20.040]  So we all know that the CCP is one of the dominant forces in the world, allied with
[21:20.040 --> 21:25.560]  the left trying to demoralize and break the will of the American people.
[21:25.560 --> 21:32.000]  But specifically when we look at Hollywood itself, yes, China owns the majority interest
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.280]  in the big production studios, but the individuals running Hollywood make extremely good bedfellows
[21:38.280 --> 21:42.360]  with the CCP because they hate America.
[21:42.360 --> 21:48.480]  The left hates America and they hate any type of cohesiveness in America that can bring
[21:48.480 --> 21:55.280]  us together because if we stand together, we are basically undefeatable.
[21:55.280 --> 22:00.400]  It's always been said that America could not fall from without.
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.680]  It could only fall from within and it's very important to understand that the CCP's elite
[22:05.680 --> 22:10.160]  capture of the universities, the Democratic Party, most of the major corporations they're
[22:10.160 --> 22:16.120]  buying up the land is an alliance with the European Union, with the private central banks,
[22:16.120 --> 22:22.920]  with the WEF and Hollywood, and it is the elites within all these different power structures
[22:22.920 --> 22:27.400]  that meet at the World Economic Forum and at other globalist confabs to combine their
[22:27.400 --> 22:31.400]  power for total elite capture.
[22:31.400 --> 22:38.400]  And that's why this clip of one of the up-and-coming big leaders in Canada is so important.
[22:38.400 --> 22:45.840]  Alberta Premier Danielle Smith in speech after speech has pointed out the shots are dangerous,
[22:45.840 --> 22:48.520]  they shouldn't have forced them on people, they should bring back government workers
[22:48.520 --> 22:50.560]  that were fired for not taking it.
[22:50.560 --> 22:55.640]  The big farmers should be investigated and that the World Economic Forum is openly bragging
[22:55.640 --> 23:01.320]  with a bunch of billionaires how they've taken over major governments of the world.
[23:01.320 --> 23:06.960]  She's calling out the main organization that organizes the different factions of elite
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.080]  capture groups into one unified front against humanity.
[23:11.080 --> 23:15.640]  As I've hammered and hammered and hammered, as we begin to identify these groups and organizations,
[23:15.640 --> 23:19.560]  it's the beginning of the end of their new world order because they can't get away with
[23:19.560 --> 23:23.080]  the shadow government corporate system if we the people are aware.
[23:23.080 --> 23:28.120]  I find it distasteful when billionaires brag about how much control they have over political
[23:28.120 --> 23:31.320]  leaders as the head of that organization has.
[23:31.320 --> 23:33.040]  And I think that that is offensive.
[23:33.040 --> 23:37.040]  The people who should be directing government are the people who vote for them.
[23:37.040 --> 23:41.000]  And the people who vote for me and for my colleagues are people who live in Alberta and who are
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.840]  affected by our decisions.
[23:42.840 --> 23:47.040]  So quite frankly, until that organization stops bragging about how much control they
[23:47.040 --> 23:50.560]  have over political leaders, I have no interest in being involved with them.
[23:50.560 --> 23:56.440]  My focus is here in Alberta, solving problems for Albertans with the mandate from Albertans.
[23:56.440 --> 24:01.520]  Now let's delve deeper into the organizations and groups that are part of this globalist
[24:01.520 --> 24:06.080]  new world order, great reset, elite capture system.
[24:06.080 --> 24:11.000]  There's a big article up on infowars.com, who is funding stop oil?
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.200]  Stop oil is the group blocking highways, blocking factories, blocking other systems
[24:16.200 --> 24:25.280]  like trains, airports, and gousing masterpiece paintings like Van Gogh's Sunflowers with
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.880]  cans of potato and tomato soup, and they've been given media support for it.
[24:29.880 --> 24:33.680]  When you go into who actually funds stop oil, oh, guess what?
[24:33.680 --> 24:36.560]  It's the Getys, made their money in oil.
[24:36.560 --> 24:38.160]  It's British Petroleum.
[24:38.160 --> 24:43.840]  These major banking corporations and major media corporations like Disney, because they're
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.680]  part of a larger plan because they control the energy to start curtailing and cutting
[24:47.680 --> 24:53.240]  energy off and charging you more for it to cut your standard of living.
[24:53.240 --> 24:55.400]  This is basic siege.
[24:55.400 --> 24:57.400]  This is classic warfare.
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.440]  So another great example, last week that was in the Gateway Pundit, where there's been
[25:01.440 --> 25:05.080]  a big formula shortage, as you know here in the United States, because of government regulations
[25:05.080 --> 25:08.000]  and supply chain breakdowns.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.360]  And so there are a lot of goat farms around the U.S. that already produce really high-quality
[25:12.360 --> 25:18.000]  powdered milk that's almost as good as human milk for babies that's made from goat milk.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.560]  In fact, with my five-year-old daughter now, when she was born, after about six months,
[25:22.560 --> 25:27.520]  my wife couldn't produce milk anymore for some reason, we had to order from Germany
[25:27.520 --> 25:33.160]  top-rated goat-powdered formula, because if you don't live near one of these farmers,
[25:33.160 --> 25:34.880]  they're not allowed to sell it to you.
[25:34.880 --> 25:36.320]  And that's what was in the news last week.
[25:36.320 --> 25:45.600]  Here's a small example of how Biden was working to block U.S. development and domestic use,
[25:45.600 --> 25:54.040]  but also export of powdered goat milk to Europe, but he allows the goat milk in from Europe.
[25:54.040 --> 25:56.800]  This is all part of keeping their foot on our neck.
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.280]  And again, it's just a very small piece of this whole situation, but why can't American
[26:01.280 --> 26:07.880]  farmers produce milk, have it turned into powder, that's safely stored, safely transferred
[26:07.880 --> 26:09.080]  to take care of children?
[26:09.080 --> 26:16.320]  Instead, we've seen U.S. say today articles and other publications come out and say that
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.640]  women should just stop having babies and then there wouldn't be a milk shortage or there
[26:20.640 --> 26:22.200]  wouldn't be a formula shortage.
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.160]  Again, they want to cut off the resources so you don't have money to get married, don't
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.520]  have money to raise children, don't have money to live a good life, because they're greedy,
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.160]  they're globalist bastards that want to depopulate you and your family.
[26:34.160 --> 26:35.880]  They are out to get you.
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.040]  And people have to understand that this is a conscious globalist operation.
[26:41.040 --> 26:44.080]  I know most of this audience understands that, but everybody else tuning in for the first
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.680]  time need to get through your head.
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.120]  When you pretend the Democrats care about you, or you pretend the big corporations care about
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.480]  you, when you pretend all of this or that the left's going to save you, you're a fool.
[26:54.480 --> 26:57.520]  You are being targeted by the globalist, period.
[26:57.520 --> 27:01.800]  And only until we wake up to that and say, no, do we have any chance of stopping it.
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.280]  And finally in this segment, I want to play a clip, because you've been recently out giving
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.760]  more speeches saying the same thing, of the UN World Food Chief saying, quote, hell on
[27:10.760 --> 27:19.880]  earth is going to be released if we don't give the UN tens of billions of dollars more.
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.960]  When again, the same organization ordered the lockdowns, carried out the lockdowns worldwide,
[27:24.960 --> 27:28.640]  erected the media censorship with therapeutic treatments, pushed the poison shots.
[27:28.640 --> 27:32.440]  And now the very group that executed this that I warned you almost three years ago,
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.760]  this would happen is posing as our savior.
[27:34.760 --> 27:38.240]  Here he is.
[27:38.240 --> 27:41.320]  We're facing a food pricing problem in 2022.
[27:41.320 --> 27:43.320]  This created havoc around the world.
[27:43.320 --> 27:47.640]  Well, if we don't get on top of this thing quickly, and I don't mean next year, I mean
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.880]  this year, you will have a food availability problem in 2023, and that's going to be hell
[27:52.880 --> 27:53.880]  on earth.
[27:53.880 --> 28:00.840]  We're looking at a $11 billion shortfall of food production inside Africa alone.
[28:00.840 --> 28:07.000]  The world produces enough food to feed everybody on the planet, over 7.7 billion people.
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.560]  Fifty percent of that food is because of fertilizer.
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.200]  They are literally starving the planet to death, and as the third world collapses, they're
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.480]  organizing the survivors to invade the United States, and they call them, quote, migrants.
[28:21.480 --> 28:23.480]  This is a tried and true plan.
[28:23.480 --> 28:27.920]  When we see people with Stockholm syndrome going along with the system, even though deep
[28:27.920 --> 28:30.320]  down, they know it's destroying them.
[28:30.320 --> 28:34.240]  Now we're going to go to break, Owen Troyer is going to take over, Ho-Tip Jesus is coming
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.680]  up, and so much more.
[28:35.680 --> 28:37.600]  This is a big broadcast today.

[28:59.360 --> 29:05.480]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[29:05.480 --> 29:11.160]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[29:11.160 --> 29:14.800]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[29:14.800 --> 29:18.320]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[29:18.320 --> 29:24.320]  This came over, and all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.

[33:00.640 --> 33:20.680]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.680 --> 33:22.400]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:22.400 --> 33:26.080]  Well so does he, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.080 --> 33:33.440]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer, desperate to stop tyranny, putting everything on the
[33:33.440 --> 33:39.360]  line, betting everything against tyranny, it's info war still live here on the air
[33:39.360 --> 33:43.960]  and we're back live in the info wars, world headquarters in Austin, Texas, Owen Troyer
[33:43.960 --> 33:50.560]  squeezing in a little host time today in between my two court dates, it's fun.
[33:50.560 --> 33:55.120]  I will have an update on that later today on the war room, update on my legal situation
[33:55.120 --> 33:59.760]  just FYI but I want to get into some news here importantly, I've got two segments to
[33:59.760 --> 34:06.360]  do this and then we're going to be going to maybe one of, I mean with every interview
[34:06.360 --> 34:11.160]  you could say every new interview is Alex's best interview because every day that goes
[34:11.160 --> 34:17.840]  by the Alex Jones was right jar continues to overflow and it's great to see so many
[34:17.840 --> 34:22.360]  people now and I still think the numbers are too low but you are seeing a lot of people
[34:22.360 --> 34:28.000]  covering the Alex Jones story, coming to the defense of Alex Jones right to speak, it's
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.200]  still not enough but to those that do, we salute them and so one of them was Jack Pasobic
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.760]  and he had an hour long or just shy of an hour long interview with Alex Jones and we
[34:39.760 --> 34:47.680]  are going to air that coming up in the second hour today, Jack Pasobic and Alex Jones and
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.600]  then we're going to have two great guests hosts or even three actually, I know Hotep
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.240]  Jesus, I know Eliza Blue, I think maybe some others as well as I'm going to have to leave
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.800]  here and get back to a second court date that I have today.
[35:01.800 --> 35:07.440]  So that's what's coming up, Alex Jones, Jack Pasobic, hour number two, Eliza Blue, Hotep
[35:07.440 --> 35:17.040]  Jesus, other great guests, hours three and four and in the meantime though, it's good
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.200]  that Alex is calling in and talking especially in the first hour because what happens when
[35:21.200 --> 35:27.960]  Alex is gone is the viewership goes down obviously and then the financial support drops dramatically
[35:27.960 --> 35:28.960]  as well.
[35:28.960 --> 35:33.040]  Now it hasn't been as dramatic as it normally is and that's given Alex a little peace of
[35:33.040 --> 35:39.480]  mind, a little peace of heart and we worked out some other financial stuff that was going
[35:39.480 --> 35:42.080]  on with some banking issues and stuff.
[35:42.080 --> 35:49.080]  We were able to work out that earlier today too and so that's all good news but you shopping
[35:49.080 --> 35:51.240]  at infowarstore.com is what keeps us on air.
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.440]  I know you know this, we hate to be redundant but that's just the way it is.
[35:56.440 --> 36:03.200]  You need to know that so that you understand, oh well, if Info Wars is going to be trying
[36:03.200 --> 36:05.920]  to take off, they're going to try to take Info Wars off there, what can I do to help?
[36:05.920 --> 36:08.200]  Well, that's what you can do to help but we have great supplements.
[36:08.200 --> 36:11.240]  I can tell you how great the supplements are but I don't even have to.
[36:11.240 --> 36:14.040]  The callers call in and tell you how great the supplements are.
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.080]  When we open up the phone lines, we don't even plan it that way, that's just how it
[36:17.080 --> 36:20.360]  goes down but I'm a regular user of the supplements myself.
[36:20.360 --> 36:29.320]  In fact, I do either Brain Force Plus or Brain Force Ultra, the extremely effective
[36:29.320 --> 36:35.320]  Neutropic every day before I go on air, whether it's for a seven hour, two hour, two show
[36:35.320 --> 36:41.160]  day or just 30 minutes of hosting here today or I got court or whatever.
[36:41.160 --> 36:45.280]  Trust me, you got a big exam, you got a big test, you got a big project, you got a big
[36:45.280 --> 36:51.680]  deal at work, a big presentation, what have you, it's better than any other pharmaceutical
[36:51.680 --> 36:56.040]  drug that they'll tell you is good for mental focus, mental clarity, mental energy, Brain
[36:56.040 --> 37:03.720]  Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com, alright.
[37:03.720 --> 37:07.040]  And guys, either bring me that other story or I'm going to try to remember to mention
[37:07.040 --> 37:08.040]  it.
[37:08.040 --> 37:18.120]  I don't know if it's down but I've got, this is every day a stack of news of people dying
[37:18.120 --> 37:24.920]  from heart attacks that shouldn't be dying from heart attacks and we know the number
[37:24.920 --> 37:33.040]  one side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine is the cardiac arrest, the myocarditis.
[37:33.040 --> 37:42.400]  Most people I talked to that know somebody, most people I talked to that know somebody
[37:42.400 --> 37:48.840]  that have taken the vaccine, if they know somebody that has been injured, it's about,
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.840]  if you know 10 people that have taken it, you probably know one, it's almost always
[37:53.840 --> 38:00.480]  a heart problem and they have to have, you know, the rest of their life on blood thinners
[38:00.480 --> 38:06.120]  or something like that, sometimes even surgeries, more rarely but still frequent the neurological
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.400]  problems but it's almost always the heart problems and it's the blood clots which aren't
[38:10.400 --> 38:18.120]  even blood clots, morticians, doctors that are discovering these things and almost every
[38:18.120 --> 38:24.640]  body that they get now and almost every body that they get now, they have these clots that
[38:24.640 --> 38:28.840]  are being called fiber clots or tissue clots because they're not actually blood clots,
[38:28.840 --> 38:34.720]  they're something inorganic to the blood vessels.
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.600]  So it's obviously being caused by the vaccine.
[38:39.600 --> 38:44.640]  We can have a debate on this and we should but it's pretty obvious that that is the case.
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.280]  People can wait another two years to admit that's the case if that's how they want to
[38:48.280 --> 38:56.800]  be but that is the deal and so here's the list sadly today, WWE icon Kevin Nash reveals
[38:56.800 --> 39:07.000]  his son Tristan's cause of death, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrest, Leslie Jordan killed
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.760]  in car crash after suffering medical emergency, has a medical emergency driving his car, crashes
[39:14.760 --> 39:19.440]  into a building and passes and he's on record promoting the vaccine.
[39:19.440 --> 39:27.080]  Now Kevin Nash is promoting leftist propaganda all the time and I wouldn't be surprised if
[39:27.080 --> 39:30.920]  he and his son have been vaccinated, I don't know if there's public record of that, there
[39:30.920 --> 39:41.240]  is public record of Leslie Jordan, Suffolk's Gen X radio presenter Tim Goh dies on air as
[39:41.240 --> 39:56.000]  a heart attack while on air, heart attack while on air, Ash Carter defense chief, former
[39:56.000 --> 40:09.960]  defense chief rather dies 68 heart attack and I'm sure he was a good a good democrat
[40:09.960 --> 40:17.840]  got his vaccine as well, Megan Kelly announces sudden death of her sister died of a heart
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.560]  attack age 58.
[40:23.560 --> 40:30.160]  So there's your list of unexpected dies suddenly heart attacks where they shouldn't be happening,
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.760]  some of which we know were vaccinated others, well you can either assume it or not assume
[40:35.760 --> 40:44.360]  it but there it is and so these stacks pile up on my desk every day.
[40:44.360 --> 40:50.000]  It's young children, it's young athletes, it's people middle aged, it's women having
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.320]  heart attacks, healthy men having heart attacks and I mean that's the thing is I could just
[40:56.320 --> 41:03.920]  sit here and I could compile all the news I've covered on this alone and it would be
[41:03.920 --> 41:12.520]  stacked so high I could you know I could hide behind it like Daryl Brooks in a courtroom.
[41:12.520 --> 41:19.080]  But okay so how ironic is this in the New York Times today, exercise may enhance the
[41:19.080 --> 41:25.840]  effects of a COVID or flu shot wow oh exercise will enhance the effects of a COVID or flu
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.480]  shot now what do they actually mean is there a science there is there some sort of a science
[41:30.480 --> 41:36.400]  that says if you exercise the vaccines will be more effective no they're saying if you're
[41:36.400 --> 41:42.000]  healthy and you have a strong immune system then your body will be more resistant to getting
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.320]  a flu or COVID oh you don't say but see they tied into the vaccines because they got to
[41:47.320 --> 41:53.960]  promote the vaccines so they can't just say hey being healthy being in good health having
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.320]  a strong immune system will help you resist getting sick no they have to say that plus
[41:58.320 --> 42:04.400]  but it's got to be the vaccine no exercising being healthy being in good shape not being
[42:04.400 --> 42:10.120]  overweight not being obese will help you avoid getting sick and we already knew that but
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.640]  see now it's oh it's the vaccine plus the exercise it's not the exercise and then maybe
[42:14.640 --> 42:23.040]  plus some form of medicine no it's get the medicine and then exercise no it's exercise
[42:23.040 --> 42:30.280]  and then it's exercise again and and quite frankly avoid the vaccines but good news in
[42:30.280 --> 42:35.120]  New York New York Supreme Court reinstates all employees fired for being unvaccinated
[42:35.120 --> 42:43.000]  and orders back pay huge victory for those brave heroes that were able to stave off all
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.880]  the social pressure and cultural pressure to get that injection but still now we heard
[42:47.880 --> 42:51.760]  in Boston they made a COVID virus kills 80% of humans they claim now right across the
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.640]  street in Maryland lab in Maryland plans to create hybrid monkey pox strain more contagious
[42:56.640 --> 43:02.840]  and lethal oh don't shut those labs down though it's our best seller we first came out with

[44:16.600 --> 44:22.960]  by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Ball Sonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[44:22.960 --> 44:30.720]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the new world order
[44:30.720 --> 44:36.480]  the only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners

[46:26.800 --> 46:30.800]  Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.960]  successful warning the population of the planet not just America we're public enemy number
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.440]  one when it comes to globalist agenda that's why it's more important than ever to realize
[46:39.440 --> 46:43.560]  how successful info wars has been because of your past support so I salute you and I
[46:43.560 --> 46:47.840]  thank you and I ask you now the critical juncture of the battle free double your efforts of
[46:47.840 --> 46:54.160]  visiting infowarstore.com getting amazing products that keep us on air 1776 the promo code the
[46:54.160 --> 47:02.160]  destination is infowarstore.com I thank you all for your support leading a frontal assault
[47:02.160 --> 47:21.920]  on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones I want to explain something before I
[47:21.920 --> 47:36.640]  get into the content of this segment and that's I look for logical consistency and when I see
[47:36.640 --> 47:48.080]  illogic I attack it and when I see logical inconsistency I attack it and so that is the
[47:48.080 --> 47:59.520]  real issue to me in regards to the Kanye West yay saga that is ongoing all I see is illogic
[47:59.520 --> 48:07.680]  and logical inconsistencies in this story and that's what bothers me I don't know Kanye West
[48:07.680 --> 48:17.680]  I've never been anti-semitic so I don't I don't have a personal interest in this saga other than I
[48:17.680 --> 48:24.960]  resent illogic and I resent logical inconsistencies so let me explain what I'm talking about here
[48:26.880 --> 48:33.840]  now it's it is ironic I think we understand now when Kanye West said who invented cancel culture
[48:33.840 --> 48:42.320]  he's expecting the answer to be Jewish people that's why he posed that question now that that's
[48:42.320 --> 48:49.600]  the assumption that people took considering he's now labeled the top anti-semit now but then what
[48:49.600 --> 48:58.560]  happened a bunch of rich and powerful Jewish people called the cancel Kanye West so did that
[48:58.560 --> 49:05.760]  prove he was right or not for example endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel one of the most influential
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.080]  people in Hollywood has called on all companies to cut business ties with Kanye West including
[49:10.080 --> 49:17.280]  Apple Spotify and Adidas and now those companies are indeed cutting ties with Kanye West he gets
[49:17.280 --> 49:23.120]  dropped by his talent agency he gets dropped by his law firms that have been representing him
[49:23.120 --> 49:30.560]  and now he gets dropped from Adidas now Adidas was kind of holding out but their stock tanked
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.920]  in the last 48 hours and I think that that's really what led to the statement is their
[49:35.920 --> 49:42.320]  stock tanking so you might ask well who sold the stock who forced that stock down to get Adidas to
[49:42.960 --> 49:50.320]  cut those ties but see it's never enough here's Democrat propaganda agent Tyler Cohen
[49:50.320 --> 49:57.120]  it's too late for Adidas now Kanye basically said he can spew anti-semitic vile and Adidas won't
[49:57.120 --> 50:01.840]  do anything and Adidas literally did nothing except they did they've now dropped him so it's
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.560]  never enough it's never enough for the cancel culture people it's never enough once they've
[50:06.560 --> 50:12.640]  demonized you and made you the bad guy even when you abide by what they want it's never enough but
[50:12.640 --> 50:18.000]  okay so that's just some of the latest as far as the news is concerned now let's get into where my
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.280]  issues lie that is the logical inconsistencies or or the illogic in regards to all of this news
[50:26.160 --> 50:33.280]  here's a couple headlines for you why is it so hard for white people to talk about race a conversation
[50:33.280 --> 50:40.960]  with white fragility author Robin D'Angelo speaking at BU Monday so again it's mainstream to be
[50:40.960 --> 50:47.680]  anti-white it's mainstream to call out white people you can write books about how white people
[50:47.680 --> 50:53.440]  are bad they make the New York Times bestseller list you can do speaking tours about how white
[50:53.440 --> 50:59.600]  people are bad and get invited to speak at colleges and that is all fine and good
[51:02.080 --> 51:09.280]  how about this from ABC News America's national parks faced existential crisis over race what's
[51:09.280 --> 51:18.480]  the problem too many whites an entire story from ABC News too many white people and of course
[51:18.480 --> 51:23.840]  white people are inherently bad and it all goes back down or up the vine whatever you want to say
[51:23.840 --> 51:33.280]  to white supremacy and systemic racism by white people so see that's all fine and good you can
[51:33.280 --> 51:39.360]  say white supremacy you can say white people bad white people influence bad all fine and good here's
[51:39.360 --> 51:47.600]  mainstream media talk show host Andy Cohen yes I am racist I hate white people so there you go
[51:47.600 --> 51:51.760]  he did he ever lose a job did he ever get canceled from any of his talk shows did he ever get banned
[51:51.760 --> 51:58.400]  on social media no and by the way I don't think he should be do you want to hate white people fine
[51:58.400 --> 52:06.160]  fine jameel hill untalented unworthy sports commentator
[52:08.960 --> 52:14.160]  powerful white folks will gladly screw over their own as long as it screws us black folks
[52:14.160 --> 52:21.840]  even more powerful white folks what powerful white folks are she talking about what powerful
[52:21.840 --> 52:26.720]  white folks she's certainly not talking about Jewish people right because that would be anti
[52:26.720 --> 52:36.400]  Semitic ah and now you see the logical inconsistency so if Kanye West comes out and criticizes white
[52:36.400 --> 52:43.760]  people then everything is perfectly fine no problem at all won't be canceled won't be censored won't be
[52:43.760 --> 52:49.520]  debanked won't be de-platformed won't lose all of his stuff but if Kanye West calls out white
[52:49.520 --> 52:56.560]  people that are Jewish then he loses everything he's an anti-Semite he's the bad guy he's the
[52:56.560 --> 53:02.800]  worst person ever and so I don't know how much premeditation Kanye did before all of this
[53:03.760 --> 53:10.240]  but I mean in hindsight you would say Kanye really could have won this culture war if he
[53:10.240 --> 53:16.000]  would just have named names and never said anything about the Jewish faith and if he just would have
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.200]  named the names of the the influential people in media in Hollywood in the music and entertainment
[53:21.200 --> 53:26.080]  industry and he just would have said names and never said anything about Jewish people then
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.160]  would that have been okay and if he would have said that these are white people so you can say
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.920]  white people are bad white people are too influential that's okay but if you say Jewish
[53:35.920 --> 53:40.640]  people that are white are bad or Kanye didn't even say they're bad he just said they're influential
[53:40.640 --> 53:45.840]  so if you say white people are bad that's okay if you say white people that happen to be Jewish
[53:45.840 --> 53:53.680]  are influential then you're anti Semitic so that is a logical inconsistency that rubs me the wrong
[53:53.680 --> 54:06.720]  way I don't like logical inconsistencies now here's again perfectly acceptable this is what
[54:06.720 --> 54:10.720]  this is how black people talk about white people not all black people by the way these are mostly
[54:10.720 --> 54:15.280]  just liberals you'll notice the big problem here is the American left that that's the big problem
[54:15.280 --> 54:20.560]  here whether whether they're always the ones causing the problems here so here you go again
[54:20.560 --> 54:25.760]  you're perfectly allowed to say this about the new Wakanda forever movie the black panther got
[54:25.760 --> 54:32.080]  famous I guess was like an all-black cast promoted as a black hero and so uh made major box office
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.320]  gains even though the movie sucked this next one is going to be a total flop because the first one
[54:36.320 --> 54:42.240]  was bad but oh here's a here's a black woman's take on white people going to see Wakanda forever
[54:42.240 --> 54:52.720]  what do you think about this in clip two this message is to all our would-be accomplices
[54:53.360 --> 55:01.120]  and white allies this message is to all the white people who have BLM in their bio if you really
[55:01.120 --> 55:06.000]  want to prove to black people that you love us and you care about us and you are down for the cause
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.880]  do not go see that movie opening weekend you buy your ticket you give it to a black person or a
[55:12.880 --> 55:18.960]  black family who can't afford to go and then you go sit at that theater in front of the doors you
[55:18.960 --> 55:25.120]  make sure that every black person in that theater can enjoy that movie in peace you make sure that
[55:25.120 --> 55:31.280]  you use your body to block us from anybody who would be coming in that theater to do us harm
[55:31.280 --> 55:37.120]  that is your job as if that's even a thing you can go see it on another weekend oh yes because
[55:37.120 --> 55:40.800]  white people committing crimes against black people is the big phenomenon in this country of
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.920]  course we all know that's not the case but oh yes give your money to black people to prove you're not
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.720]  a racist uh and don't go see the movie opening weekend because you're inherently bad for being
[55:50.720 --> 55:56.800]  white so that's perfectly fine by the way i wonder what movie house is produced that film boy i hope
[55:56.800 --> 56:04.160]  they aren't white people and certainly they wouldn't be jewish people that are profiting off of black
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.120]  entertainment and culture certainly that wouldn't be the case because kanye west is wrong for saying
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.000]  that so that can't be going on but see okay again it's the inconsistencies that bother me
[56:16.720 --> 56:22.880]  it's kind of like the inconsistencies with oh blackface is bad cultural appropriation is
[56:22.880 --> 56:30.080]  bad but oh men pretending to be women is a good thing it's the same thing oh we can't have halloween
[56:30.080 --> 56:35.120]  anymore cultural appropriation is bad oh you a white person can't wear blackface because that's
[56:35.120 --> 56:40.800]  racist and that's bad but a man can pretend to be a woman and that's good and and how does this all
[56:40.800 --> 56:46.960]  get covered up what it what is what is it that they hide behind to do all of this stuff it's
[56:46.960 --> 56:56.560]  oh lgbtq so oh it's man dressing as a woman well that's not sexist that's lgbtq oh men dressing as
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.880]  women to get access to children oh that's gay pride oh see and so where does this whole kanye west
[57:02.880 --> 57:10.240]  thing lead i think right here folks and this is an old talking point brought back from about a year
[57:10.240 --> 57:16.160]  or two ago anyone saying globalist as a term of abuse is using an antisemitic slur and shouldn't
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.960]  be invited to appear on radio slash tv in any capacity that's from sam freeman and there it
[57:20.960 --> 57:27.680]  really is folks there it really is it's creating a victim class putting them above you making them
[57:27.680 --> 57:33.120]  above reproach beyond reproach reproach and then if you say anything about them well then now that's
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.520]  that's homophobic or that's racist or that's antisemitic and so now they say you can't say
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.560]  globalist because that's antisemitic they already tried that talking point a year or two ago it
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.720]  didn't work then and it's not going to work now even with all the kanye west noise behind it
[57:49.760 --> 57:54.560]  i am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy
[57:55.840 --> 58:02.880]  i am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[58:02.880 --> 58:09.440]  with silencing us they know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed it's came over

[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:18.080]  during the week but we're playing here on sunday night with a man who I don't think needs any
[1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:23.840]  introduction he's probably in more news today than anybody else on the face of the planet other than
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:31.360]  maybe Kanye West Elon Musk and and God himself ladies and gentlemen mr. Alex Jones Alex thank
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.680]  you for joining us here human events Jack love your work you've always done a great job but you're
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:40.880]  really a thoroughbred these days and I'm so glad you're out there fighting the tyrants but yeah
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.320]  I've definitely gotten the global deep state's attention I'm definitely the democrat party's
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:51.920]  two toy well it's also I want to say thanks because you know we you played a segment of ours
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:56.960]  from on your show I think on your Sunday show last week and you know we were just explaining here
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.800]  on the program my my view of this is is that setting aside right the issue of the case itself
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:09.120]  what they've done here in your in this instance to you is create a new precedent and a new playbook
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:13.920]  and you're seeing that played out against whether it be Kanye West and George Floyd right now
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:17.840]  because he said well hey I look I saw this documentary and I'm looking at the coroner's report
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:22.480]  and said this guy had a lethal dose of fentanyl so I think he doubt well now he's being sued by the
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:29.440]  family right this is the new playbook and they're going to use this on everybody they want to if
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.160]  they want to rein somebody in or as the Chinese the Chinese have a saying an ancient saying in China
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:39.040]  where they said you kill the chicken to scare the monkeys right so it's not even necessarily about
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.640]  what they're doing to one person even though what they're doing right there is part of it it's also
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:50.160]  the effect it has on the rest of society what do you think they're trying to do here well that's
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:55.120]  right they're trying to send a message so they took a few things I said out of context blew it all up
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:58.800]  made it a huge media issue went and told the families have been mean to them they admitted
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:02.960]  on the stand didn't hear about until they got approached by the Democrats like four years ago
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.760]  then they sue me and then the judge finds me guilty with default then all they hear is evidence
[1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:12.640]  against me out of context then they judge you know me guilty for a billion dollars and the
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:17.120]  Democrats have been all over every major channel saying once we get the Alex Jones precedent
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:22.880]  we're going to use it against the entire nationalist populist population and now we've got
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:30.160]  first of two mother of George Floyd's daughter files 250 million dollar lawsuit against Kanye
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:36.080]  West for comments on his death and all he did was say I've got the coroner's report we can show you
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:41.280]  a document camera shot of that and they said they believed that that might have been part of it
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:46.320]  because he had an overdose of fentanyl and other drugs in his body well whether Kanye's
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:52.240]  right or wrong he has a right to say that but this is the new Alex Jones precedent it's very very
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:57.680]  dangerous what and Alex you can actually see um I don't know if that's the same one I had because
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:04.320]  I remember the one I posted was circled right at the top the very first thing that it says on page
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:08.720]  two of the coroner's report of George Floyd again their report not Alex Jones not jack
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:16.000]  vasovic not Tucker not Steve Bannon Charlie Kirk etc it says no life-threatening injuries
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:21.200]  no life-threatening injuries and then there was another piece that if you went back to the actual
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:25.680]  the actual case the actual trial when Eric Nelson who did a great job by the way I thought he did a
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:28.800]  great job I think the jury was already in the tank and we know that there was a juror there
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:33.440]  who was just a BLM activist who actually knew George Floyd's uncle had been friends with him
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:38.800]  just lied his way under the jury that they came up and said if you would they had a medical
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:43.360]  examiner on the stand I remember this part and they said if you had found George Floyd in his
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:49.280]  home right and he had passed away and he had this level in the toxicology report of not just
[1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:54.720]  fentanyl by the way fentanyl nor fentanyl which is a type of synthetic and methamphetamine that

[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.880]  mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:18.480]  resistance alerting the people not as of america but the world for the threat of the globalist
[1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:24.400]  and their censorship and tyranny that's why it's so essential today now more than ever to share

[1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.720]  go back in that same page that you have alex one broken rib on the front and it says the
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:20.400]  only evidence of injury they could find was a broken rib from cpr
[1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:28.640]  and that's exactly what the corners report shows so kanye west quotes the corners report
[1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:35.120]  250 million dollar lawsuit and again what they'll do is they'll tell kanye give over all his records
[1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:38.720]  give over everything he's done he'll do it even though it's nothing to do with this statement on
[1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:43.280]  air and then the judge and democrat party jurisdiction they've announced this is the plan
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:48.800]  will say you didn't comply you're defaulted they'll tell a jury he's guilty of defaming george floyd
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:56.560]  million dollars now have you seen at all by the way the way because one of the things i've also
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:02.320]  been pointing out is so that's how you were treated in that courtroom in connecticut but we're also
[1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:07.120]  looking now at this trial of darryl brooks where darryl brooks this is the guy the mass murderer
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:12.240]  psychopath who drove that car into a christmas parade deliberately by the way and we know that
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.280]  he's been blackheaver israelite and the anti-white rhetoric all this crazy stuff that obviously was
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:23.360]  tied into it he's representing himself the judge this guy's been stripping in the courtroom this
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:30.160]  guy's been uh just going completely not attacking his own witnesses 45 minute die in the wash yeah
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:35.680]  five minute die trust but i was told by my judge in connecticut she said you're already guilty yes
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:39.920]  no or i don't know or i'm putting you in jail so we finally didn't even put on the defense because
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:44.320]  she said we couldn't talk i was supposed to sit there like a crash dummy you're like a mannequin
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:51.120]  and say nothing so that's admitted they default you using that what they call in texas the death
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:58.080]  penalty sanction that nobody ever uses that's if you had tax evasion you owned a house they caught
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:02.720]  you dead to rights with fraud you flee the carabiner you flee to europe or wherever and then they
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:07.360]  still got to have a trial on the damages and decide to take your property that's if you don't show up
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:11.760]  so when they say well jones should have showed up for discovery they have all the emails all the
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.280]  text messages my bank records they're showing for five weeks in connecticut but i can't respond to it
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:22.720]  they can cherry pick it manipulate it lie about it it's just insane i mean here's an example of texas
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:30.800]  just illustrated it looks the jury in texas and they said mr jones made 61 million dollars in 2021
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:37.360]  he put it right in his pocket well no we grossed 61 million dollars and i made less than a million
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:41.920]  dollars because we sell product and have all these expenses and legal and satellite and bandwidth and
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.360]  all of it so the point is we had sworn declarations in bankruptcy court how much money had that had
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.640]  been given to their financial expert but their financial expert never covered any of that he said
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:58.560]  i'm worth 400 million dollars total and so when you look at it when you go to my net worth online
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:03.440]  now it says 400 million dollars i don't have two million dollars in cash i got a house in a lake
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:07.760]  house both of them are pretty modest compared to most people that are as big as i am on air so
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:13.040]  i've never measured myself by money but they're in for a rude awakening now in my bankruptcy
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:17.280]  because that's sworn in federal court and there's no money so the media spun and said
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:23.440]  jones claims he will not pay the billion dollar judgment well if you have two gallons of blood
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:27.680]  in you jack and they the court says you've got to give a thousand gallons it's not that you're
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:34.160]  denying the two thousand gallons or the thousand gallons you don't have the thousand gallons so
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:38.320]  where do things stand right now um you you've said that you're going to go for appeal are you
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.520]  pursuing that in all the cases what are you looking at from your perspective where do things go next
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:48.880]  sure in key jurisdictions people ask why do you live in austin which is like a communist state
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:52.640]  because that's where i've grown up it's where i live it's where we started in fours where my mom's
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:56.160]  family friend i grew up in dallas but been here in high school but i i should move out of the
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:03.920]  jurisdiction dc new york and austin are the three worst leftist controlled jurisdictions on record
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:11.600]  and so two chenny hook lawsuits in texas in in travis county austin one in new haven connecticut
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:16.640]  where the killing happens i don't get a fair trial and in texas it's a 50 million dollar
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:21.280]  judgment but it's capped at five million five million six hundred thousand still really couldn't
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.800]  pay that but we were trying to appeal it we are going to connecticut has caps but it's per
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.680]  defendant so they're capped at like four million dollars but you've got 15 defendants so yeah they're
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:36.400]  like 90 million to you 60 million to you 80 million to you 40 million to you almost one million
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:43.760]  then there is the uh punitive damages the judge decides there's a tutma uh false trade thing that
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:48.240]  she's going to go forward it'll probably be two million dollars so it's total overkill it's a joke
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:53.120]  that's why we have bankruptcy and and even if my personal debt's not dischargeable bankruptcy
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:58.240]  it doesn't matter free speech systems is and so if i want to keep working here basically for almost
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:02.320]  no money i think the deal with the court now is a fraction of us being paid that's fine
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:06.880]  i will stay on air because the freedom matters my crew matters this infrastructure we built
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:12.000]  matters uh and so as long as we make it through this current bankruptcy free speech systems then
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.960]  will pay any profits in a five-year plan to the ambulance chasers but the profits have only been
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:21.840]  maybe a million or so a year that went to me so that's no problem i've said i'll do it and i'm
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:27.040]  going to agree to basically stay here and work here to keep this operation uh on air and do that
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.640]  personally they'll come after me but i've got a little lake cabin and another house and a couple
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:38.160]  cars under texas law they can't get uh my main house under homestead law i never even go to the
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:42.320]  lake house they can have it so they're not going to shut me up and the lawyers admitted texas and
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:46.480]  connecticut in press conferences they said we don't want the money we know he doesn't have money
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:51.360]  they got my financials we want to silence him and shut him down so as long as listeners
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:57.840]  support info wars and buy products and t-shirts and books and films and keep us on air we will
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:02.160]  stay on air and we'll be able to finance which aren't that expensive compared to trials the
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:09.920]  Connecticut and texas case appeals uh and every lawyer i talk to top national names say this was
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:14.320]  the biggest kangaroo court ever where the judge found you guilty or they wouldn't let you put on
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:21.280]  evis overturned or we know the country's gone not a little pessimistic i think it won't be overturned
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:25.520]  on appeal because of this corruption unless we take the country back but that's okay that's at
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:30.320]  least two years in texas and connecticut and two years is a million years well it's happening
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:35.840]  political so today we're still on air if listeners support us at info warshore.com and continue to
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:41.600]  spread the word and quite frankly the strizan effect info wars was the biggest thing there was
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:48.080]  in 2016 undoubtedly way bigger than joe roganberg anything 20 30 40 million real listeners a day
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.840]  riding a rocket there after the platforming crushes down to our most hardcore fans still
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:59.280]  three four million people a day but since then with all of this we have not gotten back to
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:05.120]  2016 numbers but it's it's approaching that with the strizan effect so they have actually it's like
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.440]  the cheesy superhero movies but it's an art type it's true where somebody gets thrown in radiation
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:14.000]  or somebody falls in a toxic waste dump or somebody whatever that comes out of superman
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.240]  or or or like Deadpool or wherever where they try to artificially make you mutate become more
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:25.200]  powerful what they've done is actually scary now when i go out on the street i used to shake 20
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:30.800]  hands before i got one f you now i shake a hundred hands before i get one f you i'm getting people
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:35.280]  buy my dinner everywhere we're getting more support to any time all these liberals i know we're
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:40.640]  apologizing people see through this billion-dollar garbage so all glory goes to god and our supporters
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:45.520]  and folks and defendants like you jack passovic but i think it's all these major headers like you
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:49.760]  and steve manon and others that have come to our defense realizing that we all hang together and
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:55.120]  separate that's caused a chain reaction and it's undoubtedly blown up in their tyrannical censoring
[1:13:55.120 --> 1:14:00.320]  faces alex we're coming up on just uh on the break here in about 10 seconds but when we come back
[1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:06.640]  in the next segment i want to parlay this because it's also translated a little bit into book sales
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:10.720]  you got a new book out called the great reset we're going to dig into it stay tuned human
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:20.880]  events are special sit down with alex jones i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a

[1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:54.240]  are coming up saying hi to you 100 handshakes before you get one you know one f you but it's
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:00.400]  also translated into book sales because you've got the new book out it's really the number one book
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:04.800]  in the country even though the new york times won't touch it and i thought what was so interesting
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:08.800]  in the way that you've you've positioned this so the book is actually called the great reset
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:14.080]  but what you're actually saying though is and the message of the book it's not just about what
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.480]  claus schwaab is telling you is the great reset and i was over there in davos and his thugs tried
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:23.440]  to grip us up they detained us they put the mp5s in our face everything else the world health the
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:27.360]  world economic forum police you know or if the reuters gets very upset when i say that it's
[1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:32.240]  even though the badge says world economic forum police you have to say the police assigned to
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:37.360]  the world economic forum fact check um they're putting files why are you filming stop the camera
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:44.560]  stop the camera and you know first desk front and back all that fun stuff but you're not just
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:48.800]  talking about the world economic forum that's a piece of it obviously maybe the head of the snake
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:56.560]  but you actually posit that your entire body of work over the last 30 years has really been
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:01.840]  about combating the great reset tell us how does that look like from your perspective from your
[1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:09.520]  perspective well exactly but i mean you go cover debos and they're the spokesperson of the global
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:15.680]  elite of the banking cartel of the corporate fascist that are allies of communist china and others
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:20.320]  and there they are trying to threaten you till you didn't back down by the way alex just on that piece
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:25.680]  on the allies of communist china the ccp is all over davos all over everything
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:30.960]  ukraine ukraine ukraine ukraine world war three that's what they're all talking about the word taiwan
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:36.080]  not even mentioned in a single breakaway session nothing about taiwan that's how you know the elites
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:42.800]  are there absolutely and and and so yes studying history studying world leaders of india brazil
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:47.040]  and others they always talked about this new world order this global government this corporate
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:51.600]  fascist model they would use to shut down their competition create digital ids so i was not that
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:56.640]  smart i realized that these top globalists were actually already powerful or already in charge
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:02.000]  30 years ago and i knew that they were actually trying to set this up and so for decades we've
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.560]  been working against them and when we talk about the world economic forum it's the spokesperson
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:13.760]  of this or the mouth of this global tyrannical uh system that that is literally pushing cutting
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:19.920]  off our pipelines cutting off our energy dissolving our borders of corporate financing of the
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:27.040]  sexualization of our children and the great exciting news is no matter where you are sweden or
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:33.760]  idly or brazil or the u.s or canada australia the up and coming leaders and the people winning
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:38.960]  major national elections for prime minister and president sound like hack was so but they you
[1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:43.440]  know they sound like steve vannon they sound like alex jones it's not because they're cult members
[1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:49.120]  that listen to us and repeat what we say like that's do they're watching the people running
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:54.800]  their country saying build back better saying great reset saying they're under claus wab's command
[1:23:54.800 --> 1:24:00.080]  and claus wab bit off more than he could chew bragging and saying we penetrate the cabinets
[1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:04.720]  we control half the governments now i mean that's what they were meant to do claus wab was the main
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:12.560]  manager of the builder bar group and then the and the wef is just an externalization of that whole
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:19.120]  hierarchy of corporate fascism the opposite of capitalism monopoly capitalist using fascist
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:25.920]  techniques and communist techniques you know they're very very libertarian how they use any system
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:32.880]  they need to get full centralized control the holy grail is a world id for a world carbon tax
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:38.880]  with a world social credit score with a world universal basic income where you behave the way
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:44.400]  we want or we debit your bank account or kill your bank account just like paypal just did
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.640]  with the two thousand five hundred dollar fines now that was a test run of a social credit score
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:53.280]  this is whoops sorry no we're just kidding it wasn't that okay but then what happens when it's not
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:58.320]  even paypal because we see we can see a merger coming it's you've got electronic you've got
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:03.920]  digital currency that's connected to a central control so the so bitcoin was always digital
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:09.760]  currency that's decentralized no control that's satoshi what we're trying to do is now central
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:15.040]  bank digital currency so not only do they have direct control over what you can get in and out
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:19.760]  of your wallet they've got direct control over your currency i mean they kind of already have this
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:24.160]  but with a central bank digital currency they can they're basically just taking the entire
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:28.640]  band-aid off at that point because when you look at it what 99 percent of us dollars of digital
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:33.040]  what as it begins with right now but what they're doing with that they can artificially control
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:37.360]  how much of it there is where what the flow of it is back and forth and that's what the
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:42.400]  Saudis and the chinese and the russians and the indians too by the way in the south africans
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:45.680]  they're all pulling out of this saying you know we don't want to be part of this we're setting
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:49.680]  that's the goodness and we're going to do it our way and that's the goodness you just said
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:54.240]  people are revolting because even the bank of england said this year oh yeah we're going to program
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.280]  the token and decide where you can spend it when and how much value we'll have day to day so
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:04.240]  so think of the surveillance of this it's not that anything to hide but it's none of their business
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:10.080]  how many steaks i bought or if i bought a bottle of uh you know bottle of whiskey or or you know
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.960]  whether and i don't even do this but whether i went to vegas or whatever to go gamble it's none
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:20.640]  of their business and this is literally the end of privacy how many how many guns you purchased
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:26.160]  how many guns you purchased uh everything i mean i mean let's talk about it they're
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:31.600]  going to use everything you do against you and imagine again people say well i don't care if i
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:36.080]  have privacy i don't have to hide folks you lock your doors at night not because you have something
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:42.000]  to hide you have something to protect you have you have windows on your house keep the air conditioning
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.800]  in and the mosquitoes out you don't have screen doors because you're a terrorist you have it
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:52.080]  because it's your house you're controlling the environment and if they control the the privacy
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:57.760]  if they control the currency they control you right that's right no alex you mentioned something
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:02.160]  about up-and-coming politicians and how there is this new wave that's going on but i want to talk
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:05.920]  about and and we'll bridge this over you know depending how it is because i got to pick your
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:11.200]  brain about this while i have you on is that we used to have this there was another way that they
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:18.000]  would control up-and-coming politicians or elites uh financiers harvey winesteens in the news again
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.800]  saying that he had a consensual affair with the wife of gavin nuesome when she was up and coming
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.040]  we're also hearing that which i mean that's california in one sentence right there basically
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:32.880]  you know that's hollywood that's all of it but jeffrey eppstein so the and not just jeffrey eppstein
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:38.160]  as the person or gillian maxill as the person but what i've always said that is and what you've
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:44.480]  always said this that was that was an intelligence community backed blackmail operation controlling
[1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:48.720]  the elites or elites who didn't want to play ball that was a way to always have something to hang
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:53.360]  over it's called brown stoning that was a way to have something hang over them and my question is
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:58.640]  if you're looking at the great reset okay fd's off the playing field but what's going on now we
[1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:03.440]  just supposed to expect that those networks which were never rolled up aren't playing some role in
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:08.400]  this today currently well what you're saying is just exactly one on one of intelligence that's
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:13.520]  gone on for thousands of years and it's been currently codified for several hundred and it
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:18.320]  was ian phleming who was high level os s and like number three in command and mi6 that wrote the
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:24.320]  james bond books that became the james bond movies and you'll see like the us and russia and china
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:29.920]  being played off by specter that has agents in all three groups manipulating for specter's power
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:35.120]  and that's exactly what the debauched group or bill deberg is and phleming gave interviews saying
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:40.480]  no what i talk about in my books and movies is what i really saw there's these criminal mafia
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:47.120]  elements or secret society elements that are involved at every level and so when you look at
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:53.600]  people say is it cia is it massad is it mi6 that ran jeffrey obscene it was all three
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:29:00.640]  because at that higher level of actual blackmail and sex ops and and don't let the globalist monsters
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:06.720]  and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you and the globalist number one

[1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:29.920]  and so when you look at people say is it cia is it massad is it mi6
[1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:36.080]  that range every obscene it was all three because of that higher level of actual blackmail and sex
[1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:41.600]  ops and and you know not sex ops to infiltrate some islamic group or sex ops to infiltrate
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.680]  you know some other group at a mid-level that definitely goes on with honeypots but
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.840]  when it's politicians and world leaders that's not authorized by regular massad or mi6 or cia
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:58.720]  it's breakaway networks with gisling maxwell's dad on record running the major british network
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:05.280]  that liaison with the israelis liaison with the europeans liaison with the us higher levels
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:10.320]  to basically go out while at the same time providing prostitutes for the elites which they
[1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:14.560]  ran as international brothels where the people going there knew they were part of it and it wasn't
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:19.680]  a honeypot but for everybody else when the hookers weren't being used or the sex slaves underage
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:23.760]  kids weren't being used they were then being given to these operatives to go out in the honeypot
[1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:29.520]  people or brownstone folks and so one trillion percent that's what harvey winestein was involved
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:36.080]  in the next to him called all these are just breakoff group feeders into these larger systems
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:41.600]  of compromise where they compromise the highest levels the british royal family and with jimmy
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.440]  savail and the rest of but and then they move down to your local sheriff your local police chief
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:51.600]  he thinks some hot-looking 20 year old hit on him and the burger king or the water burger and the
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:57.280]  mcdonalds he gets her in the car learns he's 16 a day later but don't worry they get a knock on
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.400]  the door by some people that are with an agency they don't really say who but don't worry sheriff
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:07.920]  brown or sheriff johnson or sheriff sanchez we're gonna work with you and we're gonna we're gonna
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:12.880]  take care of this that's why i went public three years ago when i got sent child porn
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:17.840]  tons of it in hidden images then we got deposed they demanded all our raw emails we give it to
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:23.200]  them unopened they find the hidden links to child porn and they leak and they reach out and they go
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:27.040]  we don't want to make a big deal about this we want to work with you right now
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.600]  we're not going to talk about this child porn in public i went right on air and talked about it
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:36.160]  the minute it happened because i never opened it i didn't send it and then instantly headlines
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:42.480]  johnson's child porn the sandy hook family so you can make up what you will but i smelled it for
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:48.240]  what it was and i immediately out of it because i wasn't gonna sit there and go oh please don't say
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.760]  i didn't open emails and then unopened emails and child porn in them that again they specifically
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:36:00.480]  demanded in depositions they specifically subpoenaed and then they found hidden links in there that with
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:05.120]  metadata scans they went and found i'm not saying they were involved in of course not these are
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:08.960]  good people these are loving democrats but the point is this is how these people operate
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:14.880]  right no you're exactly right and they had the the ability to do that digitally now it takes away
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:19.520]  so much of the the ability for because when we look at it right that's the crime and they've
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:23.520]  got you by the crime then they've got the email then they say you transmitted because you forwarded
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:28.320]  the email even though that's you know embedded in all this other stuff you see there's viruses
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:31.840]  you see there was phishing everything else you can embed this code by the way when you see a
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:37.120]  little email attached to the end of an of a you know or the images attached to the end of an email
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:40.960]  you know that could have a child porn embedded within the code of the email exactly i send you
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:47.520]  a Kanye West article out of houston news and in it's a little link you don't even open it and it's
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:52.640]  there yeah if you click download the images well you just downloaded the image so now you've
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:57.120]  downloaded it we're coming up on our next break alex but in the next segment i want to get into
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:03.920]  how all of this is coming together how your book plays a role in it and what is coming up next for
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:08.160]  our society and what people really need to pay attention to stay tuned we're coming back with
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:15.920]  the one and only alex jones in the last 28 years i've carried out what many would call a mission
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:22.800]  impossible but i believed in myself i believed in you i believed in humanity i bet on myself i bet
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:30.640]  on you and info wars has had devastating effect against the globalists we have come so far and
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:35.520]  there have been many times when we're very close to being shut down when it seems like the enemy's
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:42.000]  goddess but because of god working through you and working through me we have been given
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:48.960]  what really is diviner division but i gotta tell you as the world awakens and populist
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:54.000]  anti-globalist leaders elected all over the world and the new world order responds by starting wars
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:02.480]  and dissolving borders and devaluing currencies the fight has now really intensified and and and
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:11.440]  info wars is facing the greatest challenge in our history info wars is an institution info wars
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:16.800]  is an icon of resistance against the globalists for free people everywhere that's why the enemies

[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:25.040]  reset alex we were we were just talking about how they use the brownstone operations but how it's
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:29.200]  actually moved digitally now to the sense where they're just sending people files that they don't
[1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:34.560]  even know about it's almost they they don't even need the full on jeffrey ebstein level operations
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.600]  in order to compromise people because at the end of the day that's what it's all about it's about
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:42.720]  the compromise it's about having actionable intelligence or actionable evidence against
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:47.760]  you that they can use in court they hang it over your head and they say we will control you now
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:53.600]  you have to be done for now look what when i look out on the world stage i see people like
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:40:00.160]  putin i see zealinsky i see biden elon musk even people are talking about world war three people
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:06.400]  are talking about we have to go toward the threat of nuclear war whether or not we agree if we don't
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:10.400]  go along with whatever the latest current thing is whatever the funding in ukraine is
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:16.080]  i hear people they're saying they're losing hope i hear people saying this is terrible i also hear
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:20.320]  people real thinking that it's not real that uh you know a nuclear war it'll never come to that
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:24.960]  they're not even realizing there was a something i saw on the internet where some guy was saying he
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:29.120]  was explaining to his girlfriend about uh you know what intercontinental ballistic missiles were
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:32.320]  and then she turns to him and says wow do you ever think that would be able to invent something
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:36.960]  like that and i said you know we've had that we we've had these things for years and years that's
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:41.760]  what usually a short destruction is but they want you to forget that we have this on the table
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:47.520]  biden acts like it doesn't even exist so which is it right which is it are we at a point now
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:52.960]  where people should lose all hope whatsoever is this train completely so far down the track that
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:59.840]  we can't stop it or can we put the brakes on what say you well i think we're we're at the major
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:04.400]  inflection point where it's a crossroads in a decision but we see a global awakening with
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:10.000]  populist and nationalist and capitalist and and and pro-human people being elected all over the
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:15.600]  world and that means the global establishment these out of control corporations that are monopolistic
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:22.320]  are very upset that's why they're trying to hold the world with nuclear blackmail uh unless we accept
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:26.640]  the new global digital currency unless we go along with what they want they're going to throw us
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:34.560]  us into nuclear war everywhere we see the major signs of of awakening and so want people to have
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:39.440]  faith and know your voices are more heard than ever i mean take tulsi gabbards she just left
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:46.160]  the democratic party she said the democrats are a power mad cult of war mongers which is totally
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:51.760]  true and we have more and more republicans getting elected that are populist and and just common sense
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:56.800]  and so we're in a paradox where people are waking up but that makes the establishment even more
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:01.680]  dangerous and so everybody needs to be more engaged than ever obviously nuclear war is a
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:08.960]  very real threat i'm no fan of putin i'm a big big enemy of gg ping but at the same time we have
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:17.280]  to pull back and realize that what's happening with russia is being used as a political diversion
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:23.760]  uh by people that know they've lost control at home and who think the threat of nuclear war
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:28.400]  is the only thing that will bring us back under their control but instead of it working we see
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:33.360]  all the numbers i see national polls 80 plus percent of americans no matter what color they are
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:40.400]  what sex they are what democratic party republican party they are against this war and so i see people
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:48.080]  like trump and and others you and myself and others embracing that reality that we have to be the
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:54.000]  anti-war folks because the truth is soros and the globalist overthrew ukraine eight years ago
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:58.880]  they move weapons up against russia's border doesn't mean we support russia's doing once a
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:06.080]  tragedy reaches a level of national significance american citizens should be allowed to basically
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:11.520]  question that event in any way that they deemed fit the first amendment is unique in the world
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:15.520]  that's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely so they're going to go from michael
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:19.200]  indell next or are they going to go for steve bannon or are they going to go for tucker carlsson
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:24.080]  i studied the globalist 30 years ago but on air 28 years and i knew they were planning all of this
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.480]  and i warned the public as a modern paul revere but i couldn't have done it without your support
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:32.560]  and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet not just america
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:37.120]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda that's why it's more important
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:42.160]  than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support so i salute you

[1:46:54.240 --> 1:47:05.120]  infowarstore.com x3 leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:19.360]  it's the globalist left it's waging war against russia waging war against america
[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:24.480]  we're not just blowing up Nord Stream 2 they're shutting off the keystone and so once we come
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:30.000]  back to that realization uh it's game over but i'm seriously concerned about the deep state
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.360]  staging cyber attacks and blaming russia they've really been pre-positioning that pre-programming
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:41.040]  that i'm really concerned about them provocaturing some white supremacist attacks with 21 days left
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:45.840]  the election i mean people need to know that yes we're winning intellectually we're winning
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:51.440]  culturally we are turning the tide the pendulum swinging back but what will the power structure
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:56.400]  do out of desperation to try to freeze that pendulum for me that's the biggest question
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:01.440]  so when you ask about these different power structures and you look at it's putin china the
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:07.280]  us this sort of the globalists left that really is in the driver's seat and you know i was actually
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:13.200]  looking at i went through some of your recent episodes even this question of elon musk right
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:18.800]  and he's an interesting kind of character to psychoanalyze from from a distance you know some
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:22.960]  people say okay he just sucks up to the left you're always sucking up to the right he sucks up to
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:28.400]  the ccp okay but he also seems like he's making some moves on his own right a little bit of
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:34.160]  independent activity what is your take is he just somebody who's sucking up to them or does he
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:40.560]  realize that he actually has influence in this game as well well give me some inside baseball
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:44.320]  because it's time to put this out jack and your show is so huge this is the place to do it
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:49.440]  obviously i know some of the biggest podcasters in the world and elon musk lives most of the time
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:56.080]  here in austin right by one of those podcasters and i was told two years ago at dinner elon musk
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:59.840]  is really fully awake and hates the new world order believes in a premium in the future he's
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:04.320]  had to play ball with him to get to where he's at but you're about to see him really go wild
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:09.840]  i said i'll believe it when i see it and so before is he good is he bad was kind of a question the
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:15.280]  jury was out but as he does more and more says don't trust these shots and as he says we need a pro
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:19.680]  human future and as he says we shouldn't have censorship and as his text messages come out
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:25.920]  the twitter lawsuit that he wants to unseat the leftist cabal uh and and you know and and how
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:30.320]  they're the main authoritarian threat which the unibar by the way wrote in the mid-1990s i was
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:34.800]  rereading his manifesto not endorsing him but you know people really realize the threats to left
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:39.600]  and and so i was going to see that by the way who who was in an early form of the mk ultra
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:47.120]  experiments cia mk ultra absolutely tato kazinsky so so before two years ago elon musk is a balance
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:53.520]  i'm the jury's out but right now the fact he's a good guy jesus said you judge a tree by fruits
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:59.600]  right now that he's a good guy is overwhelming obviously he played ball the electric cars made
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:05.360]  obviously he played ball to get in the positions he's been in we know he was given the keys to
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:10.240]  nasa the secret space program i'm going to leave it at that so i'm sitting there with dinner with
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:16.240]  this person and he said oh by the way uh jack dorsey's a big fan of yours and didn't want to ban
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:20.320]  you but the shareholders took over and i said yeah right and they said let me show you the text
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:25.280]  messages and it was like alex jones is always right he's my guru i think he's amazing i'm not
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:29.280]  trying to say this impress people this i was shown this okay by one of the top people let's just leave
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:35.200]  with that and then later i got contacted people people forget that the left actually used the
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:39.920]  anti-war left used to love you they put you in movies they put you in scanner darkly or kiana
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:44.080]  reeves uh it used to be the sort of this like hipster thing like oh yeah i listen to info wars
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:49.040]  or listen to alex jones because back then you were anti bush back then you were anti war on
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:54.560]  terror you haven't changed on any of those positions you go back and watch any old alex jones it's the
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:59.360]  same stuff in the last two years of obama's administration and not bragging you've been
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:03.600]  in intelligence you know it's it's all over the place they sent a high level cia gotta meet with me
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:08.960]  and he said listen obama likes you he cares about you just stop attacking him come on board come to
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:13.760]  us you know to new york also i had the roth cop the head of the kisser group reach out in front
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:16.960]  of my crew and say the same thing i know they've done it to you jack they do it to everybody
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:20.720]  they try to absorb everybody but but but exactly but but it's not about me i just want folks to
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:26.960]  understand you ask you on musk question right that i can't say everything at this point but
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:33.520]  when you actually get told directly by these people and i'll leave it at that when you directly
[1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:37.760]  have dinner with these people and i'm not gonna say you on musk but i'll leave it at that and they
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:42.080]  tell you to your face no no we know you're right and we actually want a pro human future if people
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:45.680]  want brain chips we're gonna sell it to them that's free market right alex i'm like yeah people want
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:49.920]  it they're an adult get it great we're libertarians we want just do whatever but we do not want
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:54.880]  communism we do not like monopolies we do not like the ccp are you on board and i'm just like
[1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:59.280]  wow this is the next level of this so i don't i'm not getting orders from anybody i'm not getting
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:04.320]  directors from anybody i have just had a lot of these high-level people the last two years reach
[1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:09.600]  out they started with that meeting two years ago and then since then saying watch what we do you'll
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:15.200]  believe us once we do it and i gotta say i don't see how it helps the old and trench globalist
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:19.680]  what elon musk and all these other big guys are doing i'm not gonna name names i don't see how
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:25.680]  that helps the globalist so i think a lot of elites have realized this path of the new world
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:31.520]  order neoliberalism ally with the ccp is destructive and i think that's why the globalists are so
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:35.600]  panicked right now because there's not just an awakening in the masses of people there's an
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:41.920]  awakening in elites from google to you name it uh to elon musk that do not want to be part of this
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:48.000]  so i think that's where we are and they they try to use me as a sounding board like i actually know
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:52.400]  the answers i don't i know what they know i've studied history but i'm no smarter than you or
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:56.880]  steve bannon but but i can tell you and i'm sure you've been reached out to that some of the biggest
[1:52:56.880 --> 1:53:03.040]  names in the world are actively trying to create another alternative to the globalist control
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:09.600]  collapse it's in 2030 world government nuclear war which makes a lot of sense to me well no and
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:14.160]  you hear some of this too because it's also a question of influence right because they realize
[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:18.720]  they're not going to to be able to influence the ccp they're not going to be able to influence
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:23.200]  shijun ping and you've heard people for years always going to collapse the factions jeng zemin
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:27.200]  is going to come into it no none of that's going to happen shijun ping is total control the ccp
[1:53:27.200 --> 1:53:31.840]  and it was the goal was always this right we outsourced the millet we outsourced the energy
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:37.760]  to the middle east we outsource manufacturing to the ccp to east asia we bring in labor agriculture
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:41.040]  that's all going to be through now you know was nafta we're going to bring that through the open
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:46.400]  borders now all that's out the window because they realize that the systems become more powerful
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:50.640]  than the elites themselves and so suddenly they got to realize wait a minute we have this global
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.440]  empire but we don't actually control it anymore exactly i read on an airplane like a year and a
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:54:01.280]  half ago a five page i mean full page washington post article and it wasn't their normal propaganda
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:05.360]  i forget the headline it was about jiji ping and he just had that big security meeting for a week
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:11.680]  at a hotel and jiji ping announced i'm going to take out google facebook all the big people
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:15.840]  we're not going to let any of these corporates rule anymore we're going to take them over
[1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:20.880]  and i think these guys finally got the clue that they need nation states and they need
[1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:25.520]  freedom for wealth and generation and they're not as arrogant as they used to be they're not as
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:31.040]  hateful of the lifeboat of a free republic as they were before when they're pushed up against
[1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:36.880]  jiji ping and vladimir putin and the rest of it no because they've hit the wall themselves and
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:42.640]  realized that you know sure all this stuff works as long as everybody else agrees with it too right
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:47.760]  but you got the ccp that's going back to tried and true mercantilism by the way the same mercantilism
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:52.320]  that you would have seen from the british empire from early on the early stage of the american empire
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:57.120]  after world war two yet they didn't start this we were the ones who dropped it we were the ones who
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.960]  said we're not going to act like a nation state anymore we're going to merge everything together
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:08.880]  into this this global synthesis of a globalized homogenized system now finally there's some aspect
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:13.840]  of the elite and and maybe just maybe like to your point that elon musk is someone that's kind of
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:18.000]  cluing into this alex we're coming up on another break but for the in the last segment i've got
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  some interesting questions for you i think you're gonna like it stay tuned everybody alex jones

[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:11.520]  lot you do and you mentioned the bible you reference the bible people don't realize you know maybe they
[1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:14.640]  don't pay attention that you do that all the time because they always hear little you know
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:19.440]  media matter snippets of you what role does faith play in and not only your life but in your family
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:25.680]  life well i don't claim to be a pastor or some ordained person or be holier than now in fact i'm
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:32.160]  a sinner and i actually have a great understanding of evil because i'm falling in evil but i 100%

[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:42.720]  it's just not about the or the organization it's about a relationship with christ and you judge

[2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:13.040]  what's up people hope to have jesus we are back with another info wars production info wars exclusive
[2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:20.400]  i'm your co-host today aliza blue i'll be joining her in just a few here and we're going to talk
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:29.760]  about some very interesting topics for the past week i've been in the youtube gulax i got a seven
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:38.480]  day uh notice seven day suspension and uh i wasn't sure at first why i was suspended but i did find
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:46.320]  out and what it was is a uh geron davidson campaign ad i don't know if the guys can bring that up for
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:58.480]  you but uh he had a campaign ad with a semi-automatic rifle some kkk actors and he said uh he likened the
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:07.280]  kkk actors to the democratic party there was no violence in this ad uh there was a bit of
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:16.640]  insinuation maybe because the ad basically ends with a kkk hood in the pool like just the the
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:23.200]  hood in the pool which i guess is insinuating that somebody had been um shot or de-hooded
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:29.680]  how we plan on looking at this thing but there was no actual violence and that's what youtube
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:36.000]  hit me for they hit me for a violation saying that uh you know i was uh i don't know something
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:41.200]  about promoting violence or violent behavior something to that effect and i don't think that's
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:48.800]  exactly what it was i think what it is is when you say the democrat to the kkk that's a really huge
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:54.400]  red pill like humongous red pill and many people can't swallow the left certainly cannot swallow a
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:01.520]  red pill of that size and um i think that's what it really is you know they have to stop some of these
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:06.960]  you know you got little red pills you got your medium-sized red pills that's a big one because
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:12.800]  then people might start digging and saying wait hold on wait are they the original party of democrats
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:21.920]  and that's what things could get scary for them i believe that this ad was just severely effective
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:30.160]  severely effective in getting a point across and they had to find an excuse to take it down
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:38.720]  all i did was play it um and because i played it um they suspended my channel this is uh
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:43.840]  obviously censorship but youtube is a private organization you know if that's how they want
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:48.960]  to run their business that's how they can run their business um what did it what this means
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:53.200]  what does this mean now this means that it's time for the parallel economy on men of order.com i wrote
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:03:01.120]  a blog post 11 dystopian parallels to uh the movie demolition man and in demolition man you
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:04.960]  have the people that live underground in the movie they call them scraps well i guess i'm a scrap
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:13.040]  but really what this illustrates is the fact that there is now a need for a parallel economy
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:18.640]  it's going to be an alternate economy this is something i've been talking about for a while
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:23.600]  now uh we saw that with the emergence of crypto where people are going to crypto to get away from
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:28.880]  the fed some of the fed notes dollars etc etc i'll be a decentralized miami where we're talking about
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:33.520]  some of that stuff there um but what i want you guys to do is i want you guys to follow me on
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:39.200]  rumble i'm now on rumble i'm officially committed to building an audience on rumble because it is
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:46.560]  not safe for myself and others on the leftist platforms the leftist controlled platforms
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:52.240]  and i always come back to this point you know if if if there is a system of white supremacy
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:57.840]  if there is a system of racism it must be the left that owns and controls it because
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:04.720]  who was denying black people jobs all these years who was censoring black people all these years
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:11.680]  who was taking the likeness of black folks and desecrating it and make us look like criminals
[2:04:11.680 --> 2:04:16.720]  and dugs the republicans don't control these platforms the republicans don't control the music
[2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:21.680]  industry they don't control hollywood they don't control the advertising industries
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:28.080]  they don't control any of this stuff this is all liberal leftist democrats so if we fast forward
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:34.560]  now to today well i guess they should be blaming themselves but that's not what they're doing
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:38.800]  they're blaming republicans they're blaming conservatives for things they are guilty of
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:44.320]  right out of sotolinski's rules for radicals blame others for that which you are guilty of
[2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:51.840]  and i just find it quite ironic that we are still in alignment with this type of agenda
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:55.520]  we'll be back after the break i'll have a lot of blue i am hotep jesus
[2:04:58.240 --> 2:05:03.120]  i am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy
[2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:11.520]  i am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore but the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:18.000]  with silencing us they know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed it's came over
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:24.960]  and all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main tool is free
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:30.240]  speech and the truth we promote using free speech that's why when you share articles and videos
[2:05:30.240 --> 2:05:35.360]  from man dot video or info wars dot com or news wars dot com it changes the world and that's why

[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:24.880]  hello hote thank you for that beautiful intro i absolutely love you and i'm so honored to be here
[2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:30.080]  today straight from the heart of the resistance info wars dot com i can't believe it i can't
[2:06:30.080 --> 2:06:35.360]  believe we're here together i was listening to you talk beforehand about censorship and things of
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:40.160]  that nature i'm sorry that you are currently censored sometimes i found in my personal journey
[2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:45.120]  that uh when i when i get some of that pushback and censorship it actually pushes me to uh think
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:51.840]  outside the box and i'm really grateful that that's where we're seeing things go with decentralized
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:58.960]  platforms and also i do believe that some of this played into elon really wanting to purchase twitter
[2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:05.360]  and uh other you know other things like that i think because of this horrific censorship
[2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:11.680]  consistent horrific censorship on behalf of the corporate media companies uh that has pushed
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:17.200]  a lot of change so it stinks that it's happening right now but i think the future looks bright
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:20.880]  i'm for anyone that doesn't know who i am my name's eliza i'm a survivor advocate for those
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:26.080]  affected by human trafficking i am also a survivor of human trafficking uh hote of jesus is one of my
[2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:30.960]  dear friends he was one of the first people to interview me when i step forward as a public
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:36.480]  survivor and i'm always so grateful for that interview because his fans really embraced me
[2:07:36.480 --> 2:07:42.240]  and uh so that's sort of what brings me here today so uh do you want to talk a little bit
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:48.560]  about the potential of elon taking over and how that means to what i yeah i have a question about
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:57.360]  elon in in regards to a building a parallel economy can we expect twitter to become uh alt
[2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:03.120]  social media or is it still going to be a lot of normies and leftists on this platform
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:10.160]  just tolerating elon or will they vacate i think that there some will rage quit
[2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:16.720]  well it's difficult to predict the future right i think that some will rage quit um i don't
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:21.920]  necessarily care what happens you can quote me on this i said the devil himself could take over
[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:25.760]  twitter and i don't think it could be much worse but that's because i pay attention to the dark
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:32.000]  underbelly of twitter so i i truly believe that in my heart um i pay attention to the darkest
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:38.720]  parts of twitter um that is sort of my area of expertise so i it's i i don't really care what
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:44.080]  happens at this point um they've been a stain on society they're a global embarrassment some
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:49.200]  folks will rage quit some normies will come on what i hope is that uh elon open sources the
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:54.800]  algorithm uh you know just opens it all up makes it a completely free speech platform and solely
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:09:01.440]  focuses on removing child sexual abuse material uh terrorism severe doxing death threats at scale
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:07.600]  which they're not currently doing yeah yeah um totally makes sense you know just i just want
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:12.800]  to add to to that a bit uh we definitely don't want them to open source the algorithm because
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:17.680]  all that's going to do is open the world up to ai and bots and actually it'll exasperate the human
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:24.720]  trafficking problem but um the rest of what you said i totally agree with um and uh you talk about
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:33.040]  this dark underbelly what do you mean yeah sure so uh like i said earlier on i'm a survivor advocate
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:38.880]  for those affected by human trafficking one of my primary areas of focus is child sexual exploitation
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:45.440]  and child sexual abuse material in the digital space um one of my ultra primary areas of focus
[2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:51.360]  is twitter um i started with the john doe one and john doe two case uh two minors are currently
[2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:57.280]  suing twitter if elon does indeed take over twitter and acquire twitter this week unfortunately this
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:10:01.920]  is part of the baggage he's going to acquire acquire is this lawsuit um of course the lawsuit
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:06.720]  won't be against him personally it'll be against twitter still but um we could kind of go in a
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.560]  little bit to that case um the case of john doe one and john doe two the two minors currently
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:18.640]  suing twitter their child sexual exploitation material ended up on twitter um it it acquired
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:27.360]  over 160 000 views and over 2 000 retweets i'm going to repeat those numbers over 160 000 views
[2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:33.840]  over 2 000 retweets the two minor male survivors were 13 years old in the video
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:40.160]  john doe number one a minor at the time provided twitter with government photo identification
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:45.840]  showing that he was a minor at the time of the report twitter reviewed the content and said
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:51.600]  that they would not take the content down i'm going to repeat that because i say it so often i
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:57.040]  want to make sure that folks are catching what i'm saying john doe number one was a minor at the
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:03.600]  time of the report he had government photo identification that he sent to twitter twitter
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:09.920]  refused to remove the video depicting he and john doe number one and john doe number two's child
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:17.120]  sexual exploitation they are both suing twitter um twitter's consistently kicked this a lawsuit
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:23.520]  down the road and now it's headed to the ninth circuit court um so unfortunately if if elon
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:29.920]  acquires this platform this week or sometime in the near future he will acquire this uh this case
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:37.120]  i wish that this case was a one-off i wish that this wasn't a common thing that happened on twitter
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:43.600]  unfortunately it happens time and time again a few weeks ago um there are over 30 plus blank
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:49.360]  brands major brands removed their advertising from twitter once they found out that their ads
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:55.120]  were running next to child sexual abuse material twitter had to send out a mass email to all of
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:12:00.720]  their advertisers stating that their ads had potentially or had for sure ran next to child
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:05.840]  sexual abuse material uh disney unfortunately was one of the brands that didn't pull out i'm sure
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:09.680]  that that won't come as a surprise to folks listening at home but there are some awesome
[2:12:09.680 --> 2:12:14.720]  brands that did pull out roiders is the are the ones that broke that story and you can see that
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:20.320]  there so that's going to be in roiders the fact that major brands pulled away from twitter because
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:25.520]  of their child sexual abuse material problem this happens time and time again i wrote an article
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:32.720]  for the blaze uh there was a child sexual abuser that was paying children sometimes 80 cents to
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:38.720]  sexually exploit them he posted the child sexual abuse material on the main feed of twitter for
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:48.080]  four years when he was caught this summer he had 290 thousand followers um we see these cases
[2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:52.800]  time and time again there was another individual this summer that pled guilty an american citizen
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:59.440]  that pled guilty to exploiting many many minor male survivors we're getting close to over 40
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:05.440]  minor male survivors that we have located as part of this uh ring uh he would sexually exploit them
[2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:11.280]  these children he would they would beg him not to sexually exploit him he made over 8 000
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:17.280]  dollars selling child sexual abuse material on twitter from 22 different accounts so this is
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:23.600]  the type of things that this is what i fight and i am very hopeful that if and when ilan musk acquires
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:30.000]  the platform that he will tackle this issue at scale sorry hotep that's a lot of information
[2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:38.560]  no that's that's that's wild so they ran ads next to pornographic material um child child
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:46.800]  child sexual abuse material wasn't yes child right um it's one it's one thing for a new company to
[2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:52.240]  run an ad next to willing adult pornography uh it's another thing to run it next to child
[2:13:52.240 --> 2:13:58.080]  sexual abuse material the difficulty is that the algorithm will run ads that pertain to children
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:01.760]  next to this child sexual abuse material please go check out the writer's article if you're
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:08.160]  listening at home um it details in great detail exactly what we're dealing with here i'm trying
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:12.800]  to figure out how twitter didn't catch this i'm trying to figure out how twitter's running ads
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:17.920]  because i know on youtube you upload something that you know i one time i uploaded a thumbnail
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:23.440]  and it was just a little bit of a risque photo of nicky menage and they were like yo this thumbnail
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:28.480]  does not belong here get rid of it i appealed and they were like no forget that thumbnail
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:34.160]  and it wasn't even that bad right we can get into a little bit of how it slips through the cracks uh
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:39.520]  i think after the break because that's a nuanced conversation in with it you know in with itself
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:45.040]  but i think the end uh of everything that we're talking about here is that twitter and these other
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:53.440]  social media big tech corporate tech platforms have always put censoring speech thought and ideas
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:15:01.280]  over censoring the massive problem the human rights violation against children child sexual
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:07.280]  abuse material and child sexual exploitation material and that's what i want to say is basically
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:14.800]  what you're saying is i'm much more likely to be banned from twitter if i say something bad about
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:23.760]  vaccines or if i call an lgbt person a groomer then if i was to actually post child exploitation
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.720]  material online is that what you're saying that's a hundred percent what i'm saying in the fact speak
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:35.200]  to that that's insane that is take us to the break up please please just go ahead take us to break
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:45.040]  i need i love you hotep this is wild this is absolutely wild if i call a gay person i look
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:49.840]  like the withered wojak out here because i deal with this every day but i care about these survivors
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:54.000]  and i'm gonna keep fighting for them no matter how depraved the global elites are i don't care
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:16:00.240]  i'm gonna keep fighting for them everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny

[2:20:18.800 --> 2:20:24.560]  aliza blue aliza i'm reading this blaze media article here you wrote very well written and it
[2:20:24.560 --> 2:20:31.520]  says here uh russia has found twitter multiple times india their government has filed multiple
[2:20:31.520 --> 2:20:36.400]  cases against twitter so i gotta ask you what exactly is the united states government doing about
[2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:44.000]  this problem little to nothing but i want to caution folks you know when governments like
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:50.480]  india or russia russia really started to clamp down before our current situation that we're having
[2:20:50.480 --> 2:20:57.680]  uh with russia or that ukraine's having uh with russia before um the entire issue that's going out
[2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:03.360]  you know i don't want to call what we're we're not involved in the war yet but we could be um
[2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:09.680]  but i want to caution folks very much so when speaking about these issues because the way that
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:15.840]  the government could use this issue that's not being handled at scale by an american company
[2:21:15.840 --> 2:21:22.400]  nonetheless is that what they'll do is they'll use it as an excuse to gain more access and control
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:29.280]  over their citizens by um looking for grooming behavior scanning for grooming behavior think
[2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:35.600]  like the patriot act 2.0 you have to be very mindful so even though uh child sexual abuse
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:42.000]  material and child sexual exploitation is very prevalent on these platforms i want the info
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:47.600]  wars listeners to be mindful that we don't want the government to overstep and use this as an
[2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:54.880]  excuse to gain more access and control over its citizens we've seen how that goes does that make
[2:21:54.880 --> 2:22:01.440]  sense so it seems like a slippery slope because on one hand we could be inviting big brother in
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:08.080]  but um is there something we can do to mitigate big brother from growing and do you think the
[2:22:08.080 --> 2:22:15.760]  government should have any role in this or how do we fix this problem yeah sure so my top solutions
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:22.000]  which i added in that article are always going to be to encourage the platform to innovate um so
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:26.960]  that's going to be the number one thing you always want to encourage these platforms to innovate
[2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:32.400]  to hire more individuals that are trained to remove this child sexual abuse material at scale
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:38.080]  um the difficulty is that we push and push and push these platforms to remove child sexual abuse
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:45.040]  material at scale um facebook and meta instagram has been one of the best at collecting data and
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:48.960]  removing it of course they're the biggest platform with the most money but then another
[2:22:48.960 --> 2:22:54.240]  article came out more recently than in kenya a survivor of human trafficking step forward
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:23:01.120]  they're currently suing uh meta facebook uh an individual from kenya that was hired by facebook
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:07.440]  to remove images of child sexual abuse material and be headings off of facebook for two dollars and
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:13.920]  twenty cents an hour so we have to be extremely careful and mindful that we're not pushing for
[2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:18.480]  the government to step in because no one here trusts them um if we're being i don't i don't
[2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:24.480]  trust them with this issue um it would be easier for me to rest on my laurels and say oh i wish
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:32.400]  that the government should step in and handle this but um you you don't make a nation or a you
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:39.440]  don't make a prison planet or a nation of slaves under mass surveillance to solve one crime you
[2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:45.200]  have to innovate around the issue so um i firmly believe that if and when musk acquires twitter
[2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:49.680]  that he will be willing to tackle it at scale i know that he knows about this issue he commented
[2:23:49.680 --> 2:23:53.680]  on the writer's article said that it was uh i think he said something along the lines of extremely
[2:23:53.680 --> 2:24:00.320]  concerning interesting wow so facebook's able to do something about this instagram obviously under
[2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:04.880]  the meta umbrella is able to do something about this because instagram you know you post something
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:09.520]  and they're right on it you say something about the vaccines and there's a label right there on
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:15.840]  your stuff even on twitter is is uh you know if you go to re-tweet an article without reading it
[2:24:15.840 --> 2:24:22.800]  they're like hold on wait did you read this so why does a report come from a minor who's been
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:28.960]  sexually exploited doesn't it go to a human being after the report or what what what is the process
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:35.520]  you know better than me sure yeah anyone of you that's reported things on twitter twitter at a
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:43.440]  certain point uh last year did change the reporting process for child sexual exploitation uh to a
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:49.600]  three-step reporting process they have a separate form for minors to fill out if they're being
[2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:55.360]  sexually exploited but at the end of the day they do not prioritize the reports of child sexual
[2:24:55.360 --> 2:25:02.640]  exploitation finding a way to report child sexual abuse material and i just to let folks know um in
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:08.800]  the country of india they demand that twitter give a monthly transparent transparency report
[2:25:08.800 --> 2:25:13.760]  i know what folks at home are probably thinking oh maybe it's one or two pieces of child sexual
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:20.800]  abuse material that come up you know every now and then last month alone and this was in the
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:30.880]  transparency report that twitter is required to give to india twitter removed 56 000 profiles
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:37.840]  depicting child sexual abuse material so this isn't a small number and all of this is public
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:46.720]  information um so according to twitter's own public information off their blog 97 percent
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:51.840]  of child sexual abuse material that's detected and removed off of twitter is removed using
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:59.360]  microsoft photo dna microsoft photo dna is a product that was made i think in 2008 or 2009 and then
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:04.880]  twitter has implemented their own proprietary tools which pretty much all of the tech companies have
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:12.720]  um the best thing to do would be to make the speech make the platform pardon me a free speech
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:20.880]  platform and to prioritize the most egregious the removal of the most egregious reports first
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:28.000]  the government is not needed here to step in and to mass surveil citizens or to even act like
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:36.480]  they're going to deal with this issue i don't trust them do you do you hotel i'm just so um
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:45.360]  and all at this point i'm befuddled i'm flabbergasted why isn't this stuff being removed they have
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:50.800]  these tools you said they have this microsoft microsoft tools these all types of measures
[2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:57.760]  in place but yet the stuff stays why is it not being removed as as quickly as as swiftly as
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:07.520]  other platforms or as swiftly as it should be because they have a communist marxist woke ideology
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:13.680]  agenda and the sexual abuse and slavery of children does not fit their agenda as far as removing if
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:19.440]  i'm going to be keep it all the way real everybody knows it um it's as easy to see you know they have
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:23.680]  their agenda i don't know who or what they're working for and honestly i don't care but what
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:28.400]  i do care about is the survivors and they are not going to win this one the survivors are going to
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:34.320]  win i could tell you that long term the survivors are going to win and the global elites and those
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:38.880]  who control twitter and god only knows what else will not win they just had a head start but i'm
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:46.160]  hopeful you know i don't like to call them elite because they're not elated anything except exploiting
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:52.880]  people um i like to call them i like to call them the ruling class um and that's not to disbarge you
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:56.720]  or anything for using that term you know i just like to put that out there because i think sometimes
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:01.920]  people need some of these ideas put into your mind so we can you know the language is very powerful
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:05.360]  when we say they're elites you know they'll think oh yeah we are elite and that's why we deserve to
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:13.360]  be over you etc etc you know so i you know i um i try i usually say ruling class or i'll add in
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:18.640]  ruling class but i was like really ticked off just then because i'm mad about this hotep i've
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:26.880]  been fighting this for years yeah and i'm not gonna actually right done you said what
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:33.360]  i said i've been fighting this for years and i'm not gonna stop until it's pretty much handled at
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:40.480]  scale to remove at scale so i hope that elan really uh tackles this issue i really do i don't
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:45.920]  want to have to fight him i hope i hope he does too because the last thing i want to see on my
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:52.080]  timeline is a lot of blue uh you know tearing him a new one because i know that's exactly what's
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:55.360]  gonna happen if it doesn't do anything we'll be back after the break ladies and gentlemen

[2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:32.240]  yeah i just wanted i definitely want to shift gears a little bit because i can rant about that
[2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:37.120]  forever if folks want to know more information about that i post all the time almost daily on
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:44.400]  my twitter i'm at aliza blue elize a bl eu um i'll definitely keep you up to date about the case if
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:49.760]  you looked at my pin tweet in the thread um you can read the story of john doe um there's bullet
[2:33:49.760 --> 2:33:56.880]  points on my pin tweet as well i would love hotep to speak about the lex freedman podcast that
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:02.880]  dropped last night with yay the artist formerly known as kanya west are you comfortable talking
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:16.160]  about that um slightly yeah i that's i'll take that as a no um you know i really i want folks to
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:24.000]  go check that out regardless of what they think of the situation i'll tell you why um i think that
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:34.400]  lex freedman in that conversation truly became the podcaster that he can be that was the moment i
[2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:40.240]  really saw him become i don't want to say the man because i'm sure it was always there but i mean
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:49.040]  as far as podcasts go i don't know that podcast will live in history forever like the alex jones
[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:56.880]  on joe rogan like the ila musk on joe rogan some podcast will go down in history as some of the
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:03.120]  best podcasts ever and i just truly think that lex freedman nailed it i think one thing that was
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:09.200]  so amazing for anybody that doesn't know lex freedman is a data scientist and sort of a robotics
[2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:15.120]  engineer and it sort of specializes in artificial intelligence he's been a guest on the joe rogan
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:20.720]  podcast i think seven times or something and he's also met alex jones i believe they had dinner
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:30.240]  together um and uh he interviewed conya west lex freedman also happens to be uh jewish and i think
[2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:35.920]  it was a beautiful conversation both men came to that conversation with a lot of pain and i can
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:42.880]  honestly say that they left it all on the court and really started to untangle this this difficult
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:50.320]  painful journey it was it was intense honestly i hope you check it out potap i did i watched about
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:55.120]  an hour of it last night uh what did you like about the interview they talked about a bunch of
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:59.440]  different things in the beginning or the little hour that i saw what what what what about it you
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:07.280]  know intrigued you i think it was the fact that they were both that they both had a lot of pain
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:14.080]  um lex freedman has a lot of pain as a result of the holocaust based off of his family and other
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:20.080]  atrocities of course that have happened for the jewish people and then conya west uh this is
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:26.560]  difficult answer for me right now because i don't want to make it sound like i am uh trying to stand
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:33.680]  up for conya west i'm going to just speak from my heart i feel that in this conversation conya was
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:42.320]  too was able to unpack some of the pain that he has been bringing into the world um over the last
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:50.000]  few weeks he's had a lot happen uh and i'm not saying that as an excuse um but i i just i felt
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:55.040]  like there were moments where i thought that each man was going to reach across the table and
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:37:00.880]  strangle each other and they just didn't and actually not for nothing alex jones got a little
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:07.360]  shout out in that podcast at a point conya west said shout out to alex jones because he said he
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:12.880]  wanted to remain peaceful he was a man of peace and he was citing alex jones sort of uh he said
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:19.920]  shout out to alex jones i want to make sure i clarify that just as he always does yeah i that
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:27.680]  was in the beginning i did see that part um now he today he's been canceled by um adidas adidas
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:32.640]  has said they own his designs and he ain't getting paid and i don't know how that story is going to
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:39.440]  end um but essentially i want to know how you feel about the fact that he's canceled by everybody
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:45.760]  you feel it's warranted does he need to apologize to the jewish community um what are your thoughts on
[2:37:45.760 --> 2:37:53.840]  that well at the end of that interview he did apologize to anyone that he heard and i feel
[2:37:53.840 --> 2:38:00.240]  uh that it was a sincere apology he apologized to lex freedman for hurting his feelings during
[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:07.600]  the interview um speaking from you know with the perspective of a jewish man interviewing him and
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:14.160]  also to other folks who are jewish who who who's feelings he heard um i feel that he was abundantly
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:22.400]  clear about the fact that he didn't want any violence um you know i i don't uh i don't know
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:26.880]  everything that he said so it'd be hard to say i don't know everything that he said prior to that
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:32.640]  interview they didn't go by line by line everything that he said and actually the last time um the
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:40.560]  night that kanye had really i think started to blow up on twitter i was speaking i was advocating for
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:46.160]  juliana sange at a rally in front of the doj that day so i was really busy that day and so i
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:51.920]  wasn't catching what kanye said my general rule of thumb not specifically about kanye but just
[2:38:51.920 --> 2:38:58.880]  about anyone is uh we we deserve freedom of speech speech to a free speech is an innate
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:05.040]  and inalienable human right that everyone has with or without the government the fact that
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:12.800]  folks feel this incessant need to try to navigate what others say um the fact that folks uh claim
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:23.520]  that some speech will turn to violence um can i suppose some violence i i just i fail to see the
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:31.760]  correlation between uh words equaling violence and and maybe this is a gap in my own understanding
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:36.000]  because i'm a survivor of human trafficking so i've been beat up multiple times i've been in
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:43.600]  jail multiple times i've been of course sexually assaulted beyond so many times i can't count um
[2:39:43.600 --> 2:39:49.120]  so it it's difficult for me when folks say that words equal violence i've experienced actual
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:54.400]  violence and i'm not trying to sound like a a major victim here i'm just keeping it real i've
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:40:00.880]  experienced real violence and i serve survivors that have experienced real violence um actually being
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:06.480]  doing actual you know slaves or folks that are coming from warren torn countries uh folks that
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:10.320]  are immigrants that are trafficking here in the united states children that have been sexually
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:17.360]  abused online so it it's hard for me to understand how folks think that words are violence in other
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:23.760]  words i want to keep the speech as free as possible and how i feel that this plays out for myself
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:30.960]  as a survivor and as an advocate is that um survivors need the ability to be able to speak
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:37.120]  freely when we start narrowing down more and more and more what the general population can hear
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:42.720]  what people can say on social media what people can say impressed what people can say on independent
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:49.520]  platforms um survivors will not have the same ability to step forward that they do now so i'm
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:54.800]  trying to keep speech as free as possible i want to keep the freedom of the press and of course
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:40:59.840]  whistleblower protection because i'm trying to look out for survivors in the future does that make
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:07.040]  sense hotep uncle hotep has had an amazing conspiracy theory in regards to kanya west and
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:12.400]  basically what he says is this whole thing is an op right and the thing that made me uh
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:16.560]  reminding me of his conspiracy theory is what you said like there's some hurt that's being
[2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:23.200]  that's being expressed by yay but uncle hotep said that ski was planted there into his life to
[2:41:23.200 --> 2:41:32.960]  destroy his marriage with kim kardashian and then this whole idea of you know yay has a dangerous
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:39.360]  speech right but yet somebody keeps platforming him he's like oh you have dangerous speech let's
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:43.520]  put him on tucker oh you have dangerous speech let's put him on legs freedom oh he has dangerous
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:47.680]  speech let's put him on paris morgan oh he has dangerous speech let's put him on drink champs
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:53.760]  and uncle's like if his speech is so dangerous why does everybody keep platforming him and i'm just
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:42:02.640]  like is this an op is this an op to destroy free speech that's what he believes i mean i want to
[2:42:02.640 --> 2:42:08.880]  remind everyone that the corporate media has no problem interviewing mass murderers and evil
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:17.680]  dictators they monetize interviews with mass murders and evil dictators um you know war criminals
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:24.640]  coming from the united states they have no problem interviewing folks that work for the cia uh so who
[2:42:24.640 --> 2:42:32.640]  i think are you know uh domestic terrorists so um the fact that kanye west um shouldn't be platformed
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:38.320]  because of some of his thoughts and ideas i like i said i'm extremely grateful that that likes
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:42.880]  freedman interview happened i really would encourage folks to check it out to last through
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:47.360]  the entire interview because i know at times it's grading you want to turn it off it's long
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:53.520]  it's arduous it's an arduous journey but i think it's a beautiful example of how folks with a lot

[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:43.040]  you know what we haven't said this entire time what is that folks need to go to info wars.com

[2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:57.120]  we're on air to go help support keep this broadcast on air obviously they need to keep funding

[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:06.720]  and i think it's worth keeping free speech alive i mean this is kind of a beautiful moment in
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:12.560]  broadcast history i'm a survivor of human trafficking that means i came from the gutter
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:17.760]  when i left my former abuser i left with left less than nothing and within a few years i'm
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:24.000]  sitting here broadcasting to god only knows how many people around the world and that makes me
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:30.800]  so excited and this moment would not be possible unless info wars.com had been selling their selling
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:36.640]  their vitamin supplements and other things that they sell so i want to thank everyone that has
[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:41.680]  this platform and you know thank everyone that supported info wars i appreciate it so much to
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:48.640]  even make this moment possible and i'm sure that hotep feels the same way it's only four days left
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:57.280]  in the sale up to 50% off the info wars store if you ain't got no info wars product in your cupboard
[2:48:57.280 --> 2:49:04.240]  you must be a globalist if you ain't got no info wars product in your cupboard you must be a marxist
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:10.000]  if you ain't got no info wars product in your cupboard you're probably transgendered if you
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:16.560]  ain't got no info wars products in your cupboard in my cruelty far in here covered you're probably
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:22.960]  a communist, a progressive, a democrat, a liberal, you're probably scum of the earth. The globalists
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:28.080]  are coming. Are we allowed to say that? The internationalists are coming, okay? And if we
[2:49:28.080 --> 2:49:33.680]  don't start supporting the alternate economy, like the InfoWars store, well, guess what? They're
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:38.800]  coming for you next, brother. They're coming for you next. We got to support Alex Jones.
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:44.880]  Yes, they heard. They tried to hit him with a $500 quadrillion lawsuit. Basically, they want to take
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:51.360]  all the money in the world and say, Alex Jones owns it. Alex Jones currently owes more money
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:56.320]  than the entire GDP of the United States of America, apparently, according to these people.
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:50:01.040]  It's absolutely ridiculous. I need everybody to go in your wallet. I need you to pull out some money,
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:05.440]  and I need you to go to infowars.com, and I need you to make sure you get your purchase on,
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:08.720]  because if you don't, you're a communist. If you don't, you're a Marxist. If not,
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:16.240]  you're internationalist. infowars.com. Four days left on the sale. 50% off, up to 50% off those
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:23.360]  products. If you ain't got none of your coverage, change that now. How was that, Eliza? Rip your
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:35.920]  shirt, Ho-Tip. Rip your shirt. You should tell him beforehand. You should tell him beforehand,
[2:50:35.920 --> 2:50:44.000]  and I would have the shirt ripped. No, it ain't going to work today. Regardless,
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.720]  you get the point. If I had on something I wanted to rip or something I wanted to beat on.
[2:50:49.600 --> 2:50:55.280]  Yeah, no, I'm glad, man. I'm really excited to be on. This is a big deal. I love being on with you.
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:51:00.080]  I always love talking to you. I always love hearing your perspective on a multitude of things. I
[2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:04.560]  always love it, Ho-Tip, and you and Uncle Ho-Tip, and all the Ho-Tips have always been extremely
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:12.880]  kind to me. I think it's pretty cool. Just back to the other conversation. Lex Enye,
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:19.920]  the artist formerly known as Kanye West, unpacked a lot of that baggage. Like I was saying,
[2:51:19.920 --> 2:51:25.360]  please, everyone, go check out that conversation. It's worth listening to the entire podcast.
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:30.160]  That podcast will go down in history. Please do not judge a book by its cover on this podcast.
[2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:35.920]  Listen to the entire thing, if you so choose, if that's your type of thing. What were they
[2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:40.240]  unpacking on this podcast? I heard some innovation in the very beginning. Like I said,
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:47.920]  let me watch the first hour. I heard some innovation talk, and then I tuned out a little bit. What did
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:52.800]  you find so compelling about the conversation that they were unpacking or the pain or whatever?
[2:51:52.800 --> 2:52:03.040]  Lex Friedman is one of the kindest souls in the world. He believes in love. He believes in deep
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:09.040]  conversation, and he tries to approach everything and everyone with love and empathy. Kanye,
[2:52:10.400 --> 2:52:14.400]  love him or hate him, he needs some love and empathy or needed to have a conversation with
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:20.640]  someone that could have that type of love and empathy. The corporate media is not going to
[2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:24.640]  give him that. Pierce Morgan's not going to give him that. Pierce Morgan's not going to meet him
[2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:32.800]  where he's at. He's going to throw blows and try to get the clicks. Lex Friedman is a kind soul.
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:41.120]  He's a beautiful soul, but also he's not a wimp. He's not a wimp, and he, as a Jewish man,
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:48.400]  Lex Friedman's a Jewish man, had some honest concerns and said them in a really based and
[2:52:48.400 --> 2:52:57.520]  kind of harsh way. I think Kanye respected that and reacted in kind. What I took away from this
[2:52:57.520 --> 2:53:04.880]  conversation personally was I carry around some baggage. I carry around some baggage from my past.
[2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:09.920]  I pick up bags I don't need to pick up anymore because what happened to me is in the past,
[2:53:10.720 --> 2:53:16.000]  and it reminded me not to take some of that old baggage that I don't even need to carry around
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:22.800]  anymore into my daily life, which I think is really hard. I know not everyone listening is a survivor
[2:53:22.800 --> 2:53:27.920]  of human trafficking or a survivor of trauma, but everyone listening has been through something,
[2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:35.920]  has gone through something, is going through something. You know what I mean? It's like
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:42.320]  you don't have to take the past with you. We need to have a clear mind, a clear heart to go into
[2:53:42.320 --> 2:53:47.600]  this next stage of things because I want to stand shoulder in shoulder with all of you folks as we
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:54.080]  fight for our own freedom. Because at the end of the day, the child sexual abuse material
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:54:02.240]  and whatever Kanye says really won't matter if we go into nuclear war or if things start going
[2:54:02.240 --> 2:54:08.880]  more horribly in the country, the type of stuff that we talk about will sound like luxury problems,
[2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:15.680]  which is wild because I talk about some of the worst stuff known to man. But compared to nuclear
[2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:21.600]  war. Yeah, I don't know how you talk about some of the stuff you talk about. When you talk about
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:27.600]  it, my stomach starts to turn. I have four kids, so it's very hard for me. Even when I see it on
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:31.760]  my timeline and I see you type this stuff, I'm like, scroll past. I'm like, scroll past because
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:38.000]  I don't see children in those instances. I see my children in those instances, and then my blood
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:43.280]  starts to boil. And I start to feel like notions of violence. And I'm like, okay, no, I don't want to
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:51.600]  be that person. Because it could be very toxic. And I just don't need those levels of toxicity
[2:54:51.600 --> 2:54:56.320]  running through my veins. In regards to the Dita situation, a lot of people are calling for boycotts.
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:03.280]  Are you going to boycott Ditas? I know you support, yeah. But are you going to boycott Ditas?
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:07.760]  Sorry, can I comment a little bit on that? Just because I think you made an important
[2:55:07.760 --> 2:55:12.960]  point there and I don't want to lose it. I know that it's easy to turn a blind eye. I know that
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:17.600]  it's easy to get emotional about these things, especially child sexual exploitation and child
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:24.080]  exploitation. But this is why predators continue to thrive. Because we are unwilling to remove our
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:28.880]  emotions from it and look at the problem for what it is. As far as whether or not I'm going to boycott
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:37.280]  Adidas, because of what Kanye West has said, I'd first and have been boycotting Nike over their
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:47.520]  repeated slave labor. So yeah, I shot a video. Maybe maybe the guys can pull this up. Long ago,
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:56.240]  I shot a video when I was a rapper was Daddy Boston, B-A-W-S-T-E-N. And the name of the track
[2:55:56.240 --> 2:56:02.160]  was Winner. Now don't play the one with the boobs. That was the NSFW version of my video. There's
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:09.040]  another version of my video. And in that video, I am burning Nikes. This is years ago. I want to
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:14.640]  say it's like maybe 2012, I want to say. In this video, I'm burning my Nikes. I grabbed my collection
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:20.080]  of Nikes. We went out into the woods, shot my music video, and I burned them. I burned my Jordan's.
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:24.400]  I think it was the Brett 11's or something like that. And I made all my homies bring their Jordan's
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:28.080]  too. Of course, they only brought the Jordan's they didn't want anymore or the Nikes that they
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:33.520]  didn't want anymore. They weren't going to burn their new stuff. But I burnt a brand new pair
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:41.680]  with Jordan's that I probably wore one time. And it was because I saw behind the swoosh.
[2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:48.640]  And when I saw that labor for $2 a day, I said, I can't support this. So I totally agree. When
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:51.360]  you see something, if you know better, you got to do better.
[2:56:51.360 --> 2:56:57.760]  So yeah, I mean, we could talk about actual slavery and violence in the supply chains
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:03.360]  of some of these products. I, you know, that's why it's like the fact that folks would start
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:10.960]  with boycotting Kanye over something he said is once again, I think sort of like a magic trick.
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:14.640]  Look over here, but don't look over here. Let's start with the slavery and the supply chain of
[2:57:14.640 --> 2:57:19.920]  some of these products. If you're going to boycott for any reason, I think that's a great place to
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:28.960]  start. Yeah. Boycott Adidas by Infowars. Infowars sale right now. Infowars.com, band.tv, go to the

[3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:31.600]  supporter, etc, etc. And again info wars store.com. I said that wrong in the last segment. I want to
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:37.760]  say it properly here info wars.com. Next up, I want to bring a very special guest on Arthur
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:44.960]  Quandley. I can bring him in now. This guy is a very well accomplished artist, especially in the New
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:51.840]  York scene. Arthur, what's up, man? How you feeling bro? Okay, but so long overdue. Thanks for having me brother.
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:59.040]  Oh, way too long way way too long. A friend of mine introduced me to your work and I immediately
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:05.040]  fell in love with it. When I saw that Jesus piece, I was like, Yes, this guy totally gets it. However,
[3:01:05.040 --> 3:01:12.240]  your story has taken quite a turn. At some point, you decided to go against the grain.
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:17.600]  Maybe you did it by accident. Maybe you did on purpose, but you came out correct me if I'm wrong
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:25.360]  as a Trump supporter or or or something else. Yeah, so I won 2019 artists of the year and I
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:30.240]  eventually got blacklisted in the New York City Circuit for my conservative and Christian values.
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:36.640]  I identify myself more as an anarchist more than anything, but nonetheless, you know, today you're
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:42.960]  going to be on the right side of the aisle. So yeah, it was interesting because I'm visually
[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:49.040]  known for promulgating masculinity and I shared religious nature on one hand, but I was in social
[3:01:49.040 --> 3:01:55.680]  camouflage as a right leaning artist will call it. So eventually I was kicked out of the circle,
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:02.560]  we'll call it. Wait, wait, wait. You were 2019 artists of the year. Did I hit that correctly?
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:08.800]  Correct. And then what changed? What did you say? Where did you say it?
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:14.400]  You know, it's one of those things with this story has been heard quite a bit. You know,
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:20.960]  this idea that, you know, the left owns all of the cultural pillars, you know, it's very evident
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:25.440]  whether it's big tech, academia, art gallery, Hollywood or entertainment. And then we're on the
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:31.280]  right always spreadsheet and talking about data and polling and the numbers stoically gathered.
[3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:36.800]  And it's so important, right? But the reality is you cannot openly share values that are
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:42.560]  promasculine or Western or want to spread christened on that, you know, obviously. So the
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:46.240]  moment you start to speak that up, what's going to happen is you'll get castigated.
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:56.560]  So 2019 artists of the year, then you clarify that for me. Where would these comments mean?
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:03:01.200]  Was it Twitter? Did you say it to a friend that you whispered in a private conversation
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:05.040]  when you're in the news? How did they even know what your thoughts, because they can't read your
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:11.520]  mind? Sure. So I mean, you got to understand, I had six pretty good art gallery results signed with.
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:16.400]  So I'm having multiple solo shows, especially in the Lower East Side. And a big part of the
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:21.760]  art world is, you know, there's a lot of nepotism, you're constantly hanging out with these people.
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:26.800]  So we'd be, you know, often what happens is these circles are really just places to bash
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:32.960]  those who are not on the left, right? And eventually, you know, the distance in my heart,
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:38.480]  I had to push up against that. And I basically, I remember, I'll share this story with you,
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:43.680]  because I remember, this isn't paraphrasing, by the way, but I was sitting in this pizza shop,
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:48.880]  and we had multiple dealers and curators and critics, and they go, you know, it's Arthur,
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:53.760]  you know, right now there's this whole stop Asian hate movement. You know, I think it would be
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:04:00.080]  great if we did a collaboration with one of my BLM advocate artists with your art. So it's like
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:04.560]  stop Asian hate meets Black Lives Matter. That was sort of the texture they're playing with,
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:10.000]  you know, more identity politics, horse manure, whatever we'll call it. And I basically told them,
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:14.880]  you know, at this point, I was just fed up, brother, and I'm sure you've heard this ad nauseam
[3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:20.560]  as well. And I just looked at them dead in the eyes and said that I believe that Black Lives
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:26.160]  Matter is a modern blackface where white liberals like you are utilizing the black identity to push
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:32.160]  your liberal agenda. You know what I mean? So things like those comments basically kicked me out
[3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:39.200]  of the club, obviously, you know, but now I'm independent and, you know, licking in retrospect,
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:45.200]  it was really disconcerting. But now I want to encourage all artists who are not in line with
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:51.120]  the left who can never speak up to have the confidence to separate from the Leviathan.
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:56.240]  We're going to come back with Arthur after the break infowarstore.com. Hurry up and grab something.

[3:06:05.600 --> 3:06:12.880]  still support infowarstore.com. Arthur, your story is rather intriguing. I have another question for
[3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:17.520]  you. The person that you made this pushback to, which I think was absolutely courageous,
[3:06:19.120 --> 3:06:22.720]  it's kind of wild that you would put your whole career on the line. Well, let me ask you this
[3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:28.480]  first. Did you know you're going to be canceled when you made that comment to that person? Because
[3:06:28.480 --> 3:06:33.200]  some people don't know. It's completely ignorant to it. Some people know the risk that they're
[3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:40.160]  taking. Did you know when you said that, like, yo, I'm putting all six of my yearly gallery
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:46.400]  showings on the line here, and this is it? Well, you know, it's funny that you sort of courageous,
[3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:51.280]  and of course, I appreciate that, brother. But I must say that it was really more of like my couple
[3:06:51.280 --> 3:07:00.080]  of BS was just so full. You know what I mean? So it's less, it's more of my tolerance for evil.
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:06.000]  You know what I mean? That's what was being tested rather than courage. You see what I'm
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:11.760]  getting at? Like the cultural fabric has changed so much where it basically has to be a dissidence
[3:07:11.760 --> 3:07:18.400]  and iconoclast to be a man today almost. And I knew that I've seen much of the degeneracy that
[3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:23.840]  occurs inside the art industry being a part of these circles. You know, the art industry is
[3:07:24.960 --> 3:07:29.120]  lean alcohol as it is, you know, it's either a financial instrument or it's an arm of social
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:36.720]  propaganda. So me working in this field, I realized I had to go independent eventually, but I didn't
[3:07:36.720 --> 3:07:41.600]  realize how quickly they will turn their back on me this way. And it's, you know, it's disconcerting
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:47.600]  when you lose your sources of income, right? But there just was no other way, man. I was just
[3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:53.280]  kind of I didn't want to cut them with this is head of that. So severing ties with them was
[3:07:53.280 --> 3:07:59.920]  the only way for me. I mean, it's kind of crazy because I thought Asian lives matter. And here
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:08.320]  you have an Asian man who's expressing his opinion. And let me tell you, this is like a base rush hour
[3:08:08.320 --> 3:08:13.600]  over here, right? Let me tell you, brother, they like us as their little pets. You know, I mean,
[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:18.000]  the left, you know, it's like, if you fit their plantation narrative hotel, same with Asians,
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:24.880]  by the way, then then you're a good Asian, right? That's that's their whole thing. But again, man,
[3:08:24.880 --> 3:08:31.200]  I just I want to be like the anti Marina Abramovich, if anything, right? Because I've seen
[3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:37.440]  the decadence. So what I want to do, and I believe this is the ideal functionality of an artist is
[3:08:37.440 --> 3:08:43.760]  to be a spiritual servant, then distill our values and kind of promote socially cohesive,
[3:08:43.760 --> 3:08:49.440]  symbolic gesture, you know, so that's what I'm trying to do here, man. And it's important to
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:55.520]  recognize that it when I said that the art galleries today are an arm of propaganda, I mean, like,
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:09:01.680]  we have to sort of elevate our understanding of aesthetics today. And let me tell you as an artist,
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:07.120]  look, these singles, you see, whether it's the black flag with white bull black glass matter or
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:14.800]  the rainbow flag, we see like, this is propaganda for collectivism. We need to frame this properly.
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:19.680]  It's not just an invitation for a discourse. This is propaganda by the state.
[3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:27.600]  You mentioned a very popular name. I was introduced to her in a music video with Jay Z.
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:34.640]  You said a Marina Abramovich, you mentioned seeing some decadence in this art world.
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:41.200]  Can you reveal or pull back the curtain on some of the things you saw in this art world? Because
[3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:45.280]  I don't know anything in this art world. You know, when I think about art, I thought they were
[3:09:45.280 --> 3:09:51.280]  distinguished people, you know, defined people, noble people, people with dignity. And you're
[3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:57.440]  telling me it's just another propaganda arm, or they're just about money. Can you pull back the
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:03.440]  curtain on this whole industry and tell me? Yeah, so you look at the top of the pyramid,
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:09.760]  right, of the art industry. It's interesting because the fact that 50% of purchases are by
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:14.240]  about 20 collectors through five galleries, tells you it's a very small inner circle.
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:17.680]  Mary and Goodman Gallery, Halsey and Ward, David's were in a gag ocean in this.
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:20.320]  The fact that those five galleries basically run the top sphere,
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:26.160]  there is, it's a financial instrument at the head sphere. Now, you look at the middle tier,
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:30.000]  where there's legitimate sales and it's sort of the Wild West. There's actual artisans,
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:34.640]  but ultimately, most of the galleries are propaganda tools. It's not a coincidence that
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:40.880]  most of these artists are promoting, you know, the rainbow coalition or want to take down the
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:46.480]  patriarchy, these feminists, right? So that's not a coincidence. And that's sort of an invitation,
[3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:50.320]  because you can sort of go into that a little bit further and you realize a lot of the political
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:54.560]  and financial elite are behind the scenes congregating. You know, these are,
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:02.240]  it's, it's, there's underground occultic sort of themes that take place behind the scenes.
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:06.800]  And, you know, Marina Abramovich, while we look at her face here on the screen,
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:12.480]  she's a literal satanist witch, masquerading as a performance artist. You know, it's, it's,
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:17.760]  she's friends with Lady Gaga, Hillary Clinton. You know, she's behind the whole piece of gay
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:26.240]  spirit cooking debacle. Like it's, it's the aesthetics of the disciples tell you everything,
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:32.560]  you know, of the ideology. So she gets support to go on these world tour exhibitions to glorify
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:38.320]  degeneracy and transhumanism. So there's other things going on. The art world is
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:50.400]  an invitation to some of this. Whoa, the art world is an invitation to dance with the devil is,
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:55.600]  is how I interpreted it. That's, that's, that's crazy. So you said there's some decadence. Did
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:12:02.080]  you see them drinking blood? Did you see him chopping off goat heads? What, how do you know
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:08.320]  this is happening? The vetting is, there's, you know, the vetting happens to schmooze and you hang
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:14.000]  out. I've been taken out to sushi by some of these top tier galleries. They've hung out this down
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:18.320]  the other, but they're not going to let you in unless you're either compromised or part of
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:24.160]  their same ideological club. So I didn't get to see anything of that sort, but I smelled it.
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:29.920]  You know, I remember when I went to Art Basel 2019, and I sold it, I shared and sold a couple
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:35.920]  works there in Miami. And, you know, we go to this club, you get to drop off your phone into
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:42.800]  this little cubby, because, you know, you can't be on any recording. And I, I, I saw heathenism,
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:49.200]  but I didn't see anything off the walls beyond, you know, just, just the range, you know,
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:55.920]  morally, you know, off center, we'll call it, but I didn't see anything like
[3:12:55.920 --> 3:13:06.080]  demonic. But you can totally see how it's a place where those who serve the dark one can
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:11.680]  come together. You know, and actually Tom Wolf, what wrote the painted word, he's an American
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:15.920]  cultural critic, some time ago, predicting that the radical left will end up utilizing the art
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.480]  industry to congregate together. But obviously, I don't think he could have predicted how bad it
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:29.280]  would have become, you know. Oh, yeah. It seems like it accelerated. It seems like it went from
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:37.440]  zero to 60 in 4.3 seconds during the Trump era. And then, you know, zero to 60 in one second
[3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:44.080]  during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sometimes I make the joke, and I think that somewhere along the
[3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:50.800]  line, we went through a wormhole and out of space and ended up in a whole parallel universe. Because
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:58.000]  right now, life is a parody. Are you familiar with the, what's going on with Kanye West now?
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:07.360]  Brother, I mean, Kanye is the depivotal example. You know, what happens if an artist goes off the
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:14.000]  plantation towards any all things political, economic, or philosophical, as they put you
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:18.960]  into the corner and they call you crazy. But you know, it's worth saying, while we're on the subject,
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:24.960]  that this is nothing new when it comes to understanding strategy and the cultural wars
[3:14:24.960 --> 3:14:30.560]  from the left. You know, socialists and, I mean, the collectivists have always utilized the creative
[3:14:30.560 --> 3:14:36.960]  class. And it's always been a pendulum between propaganda and art that venerates God. It's always
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:42.000]  been either the state or the soul. And it has always been this case. And the reason why Kanye
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:49.600]  makes me bring this notion up is because, you know, you can look at every successful tyrant,
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:55.200]  and they either had training in the arts or they utilize the artist in one shape or another.
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:15:00.960]  And the most obvious example would be how the Nazis were massacred propaganda. Well, Joseph
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:07.840]  Gerbils literally contacted William Joyce, who was like top tier comedian who was crushing the ratings
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:15.280]  and secretly funded him as part of the Nazi propaganda branch to normalize values. So my
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:20.480]  point is this is how important artists are. It's important to utilize the artists because
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:26.560]  when you take an art, you are in your relaxed state. It's just, it's like a form of hypnosis
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:33.040]  almost, right? And life imitates art, man. So, you know, the left has been so wise to, you have to
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:37.600]  give this credit to them. And we need to use this against them. It's guerrilla warfare. We need to
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:46.800]  understand that, you know, they run art galleries, Hollywood and entertainment. You hit on something
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:51.360]  there. You hit on something there. Art is going to access your monkey mind. We'll be back. We're
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:58.080]  going to go to break info wars store.com. Go get yourself some products. Look around you.
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:02.800]  Everything I predicted from the global stone documents from their own admissions is now
[3:16:02.800 --> 3:16:08.560]  happening info wars credibility. My credibility has never been higher. And it's because of your
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:14.640]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship and the boycotts and the
[3:16:14.640 --> 3:16:21.520]  attacks and the lawsuit stay on air. But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight
[3:16:21.520 --> 3:16:28.160]  together. So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air. In my decades on air,
[3:16:28.160 --> 3:16:32.560]  I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:39.040]  40% of the legal fees. And I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable. So please visit
[3:16:39.040 --> 3:16:45.920]  it. Save info wars.com. Save info wars.com where you can make straight donations, five,
[3:16:45.920 --> 3:16:51.200]  10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up. I'll

[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:10.160]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[3:17:10.160 --> 3:17:16.000]  with silencing us. They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed. It's
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:21.760]  came over and all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:27.440]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech. That's why when
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:32.960]  you share articles and videos from man.video or info wars.com or news wars.com, it changes the
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:38.800]  world. And that's why when you go to info wars.com and get amazing products that empower you and your
[3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:44.080]  body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:49.600]  the fight against the globalist. The fight starts at info wars.com and the support of the fight
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:53.600]  starts at info wars.com. God bless and thank you all for your support.
[3:17:53.600 --> 3:18:00.880]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:07.840]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem
[3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:11.680]  fit. The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away,
[3:18:11.680 --> 3:18:14.880]  your ability to speak freely. So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next,
[3:18:14.880 --> 3:18:17.920]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:22.800]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all of this
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:27.200]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere. But I couldn't have done it without your support
[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:30.240]  and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:34.800]  not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:38.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been
[3:18:38.640 --> 3:18:42.400]  because of your past support. So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now,

[3:19:56.400 --> 3:20:12.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[3:20:12.400 --> 3:20:20.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. It's the HOTEP Hour. I'm joined today with a very well known,
[3:20:20.560 --> 3:20:25.440]  very accomplished artist Arthur Kwan Lee. Arthur Kwan, I was texting you behind the scenes
[3:20:25.440 --> 3:20:31.200]  before this segment and I asked you some things that you wanted me to ask you about
[3:20:31.200 --> 3:20:36.080]  and you said something that made me spit out my coffee. You said the left creates ugly art.
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:44.240]  What do you mean the left creates ugly art? Isn't art subjective? How can there art be ugly?
[3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:51.280]  So let me first say beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. The reason why I say this is because
[3:20:51.280 --> 3:20:58.320]  this idea of what political correctness and critical theory as a sword and shield like
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:04.960]  what is collectivism? What are they essentially trying to promote? It's all relativism.
[3:21:04.960 --> 3:21:11.280]  That is the North Star. What I mean by that is you actually look at the art today ever since
[3:21:11.280 --> 3:21:19.760]  postmodernism came into the picture. You can see large brushstrokes or splatter paints and they
[3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:30.880]  deem that as the same height as the Pieta or some masterclass works. So for me, when you study
[3:21:30.880 --> 3:21:38.320]  actually the ancients across all civilizations, they regarded the true, the good and the beautiful
[3:21:38.320 --> 3:21:42.960]  as fundamental building blocks for society. But it's important to understand this is
[3:21:42.960 --> 3:21:50.000]  regardless of any culture as well, brother. This is cross-continental. And when they talk about
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:56.640]  beauty, they're actually talking about the sacred. And I believe usually today, because we've fallen
[3:21:56.640 --> 3:22:01.120]  so much from gates, Grace, when we hear the word beauty, we get confused with hotness or something
[3:22:01.120 --> 3:22:05.920]  like that. But beauty is supposed to point upwards. So my point is that when you see art that is
[3:22:05.920 --> 3:22:11.840]  produced by the left, they're promoting aesthetic relativity. And you see art that is produced by
[3:22:11.840 --> 3:22:16.080]  more right-leaning folks, it tends to promote universal standards because we're pedagogical.
[3:22:16.080 --> 3:22:21.760]  We believe in objective boundaries, standards, and we believe in lines. And because we have
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:28.000]  that territorial instinct, that also implies to how we develop our discipline. So I guess what
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:33.280]  I'm saying is all these things that are spoken about on Info Wars, all these themes are excavated
[3:22:33.280 --> 3:22:37.520]  inside our minds liberally. They also manifest outwardly when you just look at the actual art
[3:22:37.520 --> 3:22:47.840]  that is produced. And it's really enlightening to see this. So for me, a really great example of this
[3:22:47.840 --> 3:22:55.120]  is when 2019, again, Art Basil, I'm going to mention, the same Art Basil exhibition that I was in,
[3:22:55.120 --> 3:23:01.680]  there was a banana duct tape to a wall, and it sold for $150,000. And often people will say,
[3:23:01.680 --> 3:23:09.280]  how? But then other people will say, because it's subjective. Well, I believe the reason why people
[3:23:09.280 --> 3:23:14.720]  can't even get away with calling this art without recognizing that it's actually just insulting to
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:20.960]  our intelligence is because only a person who believes that gender is a social construct
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:26.720]  or that masculinity is toxic, anything that's deconstructionism, right, that gets rid of
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:31.760]  your morality, you know, your moral, your moral is so low that you're going to buy that this is art.
[3:23:32.560 --> 3:23:38.880]  Right. So yeah, the left makes ugly art because essentially, they're against beauty. And beauty
[3:23:38.880 --> 3:23:45.600]  is a very important tool that, you know, we need to utilize, brother, men like us, man, we have beauty
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:53.360]  on our side too. It's important. So that's very intriguing. What you're saying is, and correct
[3:23:53.360 --> 3:23:59.680]  me if I'm wrong, what you're saying is that it is the virtue of the artist that defines the beauty.
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:04.160]  So if the virtue is pointing up towards something good nature, it's something that's
[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:11.120]  going to support life, nurture life, something that is moral, this is beauty, right, no matter
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:17.200]  how the strokes may lay. Brother, if you go into any of these galleries, and you see something
[3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:23.520]  miasmic that is almost nothing identifiable, that doesn't take skill, I would bet that that was produced
[3:24:23.520 --> 3:24:27.920]  by someone on the left. I would go that confident because I've worked 10 years in the gallery scene
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:33.760]  and I've seen this pattern enough. So you're saying they can get away with that because
[3:24:34.560 --> 3:24:40.880]  they're selling this idea of art to the same people who believe there's 345 genders. Is that
[3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:49.680]  correct? Exactly. Yeah. That says it all, you know, because it's a reflection of the culture's
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:54.400]  values. And again, I guess what I'm saying is that rather than emptily repeating the mantra that
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:59.360]  politics is out of culture, I'm trying to encourage people to become either active participants or to
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:04.880]  patronize those people who are actually in the cultural forefront because believe me, artists
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:11.520]  of either faith, and look, I'm a Christian, like artists who want to promote wholesome values and
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:18.960]  benevolent, honorable masculinity, we're outnumbered like it all is into one man. And it's a shame
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:25.120]  because we make better art by, without the intellectual training, just at a gut level,
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:28.960]  you can tell when art is beautiful, right? It's one of those natural instincts, but
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:34.560]  they've made the art world pretentious. The left has done all this to make every day man
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:39.840]  feel separate from appreciating aesthetics because, you know, they want to be the one who control
[3:25:41.120 --> 3:25:46.880]  the narrative, right? And they're successful at this. And again, like I said before the commercial,
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:52.080]  like, this is brilliant strategy. We need to recognize that it is effective so we can use
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:58.080]  it against them. You're an art guys. I have to ask you this question. It's hot in the news right now.
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:06.480]  Last week, there was a Van Gogh painting. They threw soup on it. This week was mashed potatoes on,
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:12.880]  I forget who that artist was. How did you feel when you saw this? Did you take offense and say,
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:18.160]  oh my God, they're ruining good art? Or did you say, oh, they're activists and the art will be
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:23.360]  fine? Where did you, where are you on that whole thing? Of course, as an artist number one, I'm
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:30.000]  saying these people are trash. You know, I mean, let's be real here. Like, at any time,
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:38.640]  and ideologues of a group have destroyed art, they've always been in support of tyranny,
[3:26:38.640 --> 3:26:44.240]  one ship or another. You know, it's in the same fashion that literally the first thing
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:48.640]  that Adolf Hitler did when he came to power was close on the art school Bauhaus because he did
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:54.000]  not want any chance of a counterculture, you know, or why in that same way in 1933, he burned
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:27:00.560]  down all non-German works of literature, poetry, like it's the same spirit. You want to get rid of
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:09.840]  any other distillation of aesthetic values because it's very difficult to understand,
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:15.280]  but because it's not like you're engaging or debating information, but art literally controls
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:22.080]  most people's, it dominates most of our life. We're just not conscious of it because it seems
[3:27:22.080 --> 3:27:26.080]  static. You know, when you look at a work of art, you're relaxed, right? But that's my point. It's
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:34.320]  life imitates art and we're just not, it goes over your head, but it's so powerful in that regard
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:38.080]  because it's almost like it automatically just imbues into you what you put in your own home,
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:48.000]  how your own family and friends are influenced by it. And this is why, again, I think that we
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:52.240]  need to have more of our artists in the cultural forefront, man, and this is why exactly what's
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:58.560]  happening with Kanye, like this doesn't surprise me one eye with us because if it occurred to me,
[3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:04.800]  you know, in a microcosm comparing to his following, right, of course it's going to occur
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:10.560]  to somebody at that scale. It happened to Gina Carano as well, obviously, as we know. It happened to
[3:28:13.520 --> 3:28:19.280]  multiple comedians who are more right-leaning, like it happens to Dave Chupel. Yeah, it happens
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:27.120]  to anyone who goes Joe Rogan. Yeah, Joe Rogan. So this never surprises me because the reality is,
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:32.400]  is we're basically playing in their, under their shadow, you know, so it's a big,
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:38.400]  big thing will stop your relevance out of existence. So yeah. Oh yeah. Tell me about it.
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:44.000]  I'm a victim of it myself. I'm on infowarstore.com and I'm looking at this book, The Great Reset

[3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:14.320]  of the new world order. It's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Hotep Takeover. I am
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:21.840]  your host, Hotep Jesus. You can keep up with me at HotepJesus.com. I'm joined here today by Arthur
[3:33:21.840 --> 3:33:28.880]  Kwan Lee. Arthur, I have to say, man, when it comes to Asian people, I am absolutely jealous
[3:33:28.880 --> 3:33:36.560]  and envious of you guys and your culture and you know black people love Asian culture. We are in
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:42.880]  love with the kung fu movies and everything else that comes along with that, right? We're enamored
[3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:52.640]  with the anime, et cetera, et cetera. I have to ask you because here's how I recently have approached
[3:33:52.640 --> 3:34:00.880]  Asian culture, Google, okay? I'm raising two boys and two girls and I'm asking myself,
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:07.600]  I wonder how Asian people would do this. What happens in their household that they're creating
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:13.680]  successful people and the rest of us Americans aren't, right? So I want to know as we dive into
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:20.880]  this topic of culture, what is happening in Asian culture where you're not being usurped by leftist
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:28.800]  propaganda as wholly as maybe the black community and the white community in America? What is your
[3:34:28.800 --> 3:34:37.600]  raw insulator? So I mean, I believe that the success of Asian Americans in the U.S.
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:46.880]  evolves onto the fact that we have a patriarchal system. And for me, the most important thing to
[3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:53.440]  venerate as a precursor, a stepping stone towards religious virtue is masculinity. And I mean a
[3:34:53.440 --> 3:35:00.560]  wholesome, honorable, benevolent masculinity that recognizes the center for what's right,
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:07.440]  essentially. And I believe that masculinity is the most vilified, looked upon as toxic above all
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:13.840]  else. I mean, all you have to do is look at every cultural phenomena that has taken our culture by
[3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:22.480]  storm, you know, whether it's hip hop music or Donald Trump or Andrew Tate, it's all just unapologetic
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:29.280]  masculinity and the absence of actual wholesome masculine fathers. So I guess what I'll say is
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:36.800]  that, you know, I was brought up under a very strong, old school, tough father, but with a lot
[3:35:36.800 --> 3:35:42.240]  of love. And that is why going through the art world, I ended up becoming like this art rodent
[3:35:42.240 --> 3:35:47.600]  almost just because if I'm going to be, you know, utilizing my brush, it's going to be for something
[3:35:47.600 --> 3:35:55.760]  righteous because I need to honor my father. And that's a big part of the family core for East
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:36:00.880]  Asian custom, which is you have to honor your father, you know, and it's sort of like archetypal
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:06.720]  precursor to honoring the greater father. So it's about a mission almost, you know what I mean?
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:13.600]  It's like, you know, you have to, it's almost like, how is this action going to reflect and look upon
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:22.720]  your parents? You see what I'm saying? Okay, so I need you to break this down. The honor your
[3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:30.240]  father part, totally get it, totally love it. How is that instilled in the child? Is it told to him,
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:35.200]  hey, you must honor your father, or is it something that's done through demonstration instead of
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:40.960]  explication? How does this happen? Is it done through maybe he's telling some stories, some
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:50.000]  folk tale? How do you imbue that in the child? Well, I mean, it's, I've seen it done very incorrectly
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:56.800]  in Korean culture as well. I mean, I will say before I go forward, like, my parents are,
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:02.320]  they're very Korean in nature, but you know, they're Americans now. I was born here. I'm very
[3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:10.960]  westernized. But my house was raised under these mixed values, right? It's like child of two cultures,
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:19.440]  right? And I'll say that, like, my father, but for me, I'll say, because, you know, he's a,
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:29.200]  he's a pastor as well. So I think I was especially blessed to have a man of God be this holy example,
[3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:36.080]  you know, and also like physically good shape, strong, so like old school kind of tough guy.
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:41.280]  So that was like a blessing for me. But I believe that that also applies to a good amount of the
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:48.240]  Korean and Korean American community, besides this, this weird liberalism of the K-pop and all
[3:37:48.240 --> 3:37:56.240]  the stuff, which we need to crush that we need to crush those bugs. But that's kind of like the
[3:37:56.240 --> 3:38:01.520]  template that we're brought up under that the dad is a king. But understand that if you're going to
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:06.960]  be the king of the house, you also have to be the one who is able to bear the weight and responsibility.
[3:38:07.760 --> 3:38:12.720]  And it's sort of intrinsic that when you come into the house, this, you know, you're,
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:18.800]  that there's a, it's a beautiful order actually, you know, it's, I guess what
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:22.720]  here in the West would be regarded as toxic masculinity is respected.
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:34.880]  Oh, wow. Okay, so toxic masculinity here, or just masculinity period is considered toxic masculinity,
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:40.560]  the traditional masculinity, the way a man would talk to a son would be considered toxic,
[3:38:40.560 --> 3:38:46.640]  boys fighting, that's considered toxic, having aggression, that's, that's, that's, that's figured
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:53.600]  to be toxic. There's an agenda of play. I'm so funny because, you know, it's because on average,
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:57.920]  you know, actually, Asian men have like the least testosterone usually on average,
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:04.080]  but it's more that the actual cultural framework of where the men are categorized
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:12.800]  is, is proper. So they can look like nerdy, skinny. I don't know, like they can look like
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:18.240]  like, you know, they can look weak and almost effeminate. But the way Asian structure is designed
[3:39:18.240 --> 3:39:24.800]  is so puts men in this position where they can have order and, and, and rise to the occasion
[3:39:24.800 --> 3:39:30.880]  when it comes to what's actually on paper. So it's, it's, I think that's very powerful.
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:39.840]  And I often say that this is why the Asia has a, they use this cohesive force of shame
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:44.640]  in a proper way. You know what I mean? Like there's no, there's no fat shaming. There's no
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:50.320]  slut shaming. There's none of these terminologies in East Asia or it's growing, it's growing a
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:57.120]  little bit, but on average, it's like all these things, all these stigmas are held and men can
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:01.280]  openly talk about it. They're not going to worry about some HR lady firing them. You see what I'm
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:08.880]  getting at? It's boundaries, you know? And the reality is, yeah, no man was a woman with a huge
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:14.880]  high body count and none of us are attracted to obese women. But it's funny because like we can't
[3:40:14.880 --> 3:40:19.120]  talk about that as men here. And that's like the first way they set it up. So we can't talk about
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:25.600]  anything deep going forward as well and talk about real philosophical depth. But if we can have that
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:33.440]  substrate openly able to be discussed, you know, then we can go forward. And again, it's just masculine
[3:40:33.440 --> 3:40:39.440]  and talking about whatever they want to do, the positioning, right? Not the, not the trappings
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:45.280]  of big muscles and red cars and the actual positioning of masculinity. The frame is correct
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:54.880]  in Asia. Yes, I totally agree. You know, I say that once upon a time colonization happened because
[3:40:54.880 --> 3:41:01.360]  some pirates had a pirate ship with the skull and crossbones on a black flag. Now that flag is rainbow
[3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:07.760]  and pink and blue, right? So colonization now comes in a form of pronouns. What's the agenda here?
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:12.800]  Why do you think there have so much a vitriol and attack on masculinity?
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:23.120]  Because first of all, masculinity itself is the characteristic in psychologically speaking
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:30.000]  that draws identifiable boundaries and standards. So once that's out of the equation,
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:35.840]  obviously promoting relativism again, right? So you basically lose your social cohesion.
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:41.760]  And when people are running amok and they're not able to stand together as firmly,
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:47.280]  that's when you can take an empire down. Like how is it that, you know, the Ottoman Empire
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:54.640]  took down Rome? It's because Rome's social cohesion was degenerate and it was all falling
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:59.360]  apart because every great empire falls from the inside out, every single one. And this is how
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:04.240]  you do the same here. You know, this is not a coincidence. Patterns are meant to be recognized
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:11.040]  as wisdom. And we're at the point basically where, you know, they're removing fathers at such an
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:17.200]  alarming rate. And I can tell you, Hotep, when we look at the single mother motherhood rate in the
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:22.800]  black community, and all these men in prison that are basically raised by single mothers and all
[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:29.280]  this like whenever I went to Korea, all the men dealing drugs, committing crimes, getting into
[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:36.960]  nonsense, they're all also raised by single mothers. And none of them are black.
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:43.360]  That's a profound thought. We're going to come right back. That's a profound thought you had
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:49.680]  right there. Masculinity draws the line. It tells you, here's where we're going to stop.
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:55.280]  I love that thought. We're going to come back in a few moments, visit InfowarsStore.com right now.

[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:04.080]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:18.480]  oh my god what a bomb are they dropped in that last segment amazing amazing though are
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:25.120]  there it's still on my mind here so masculinity sets borders it sets boundaries and when these
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:32.080]  borders and boundaries are not set then you said we have social chaos and that's what I see today
[3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:36.560]  can you expand on that thought a little bit more about you know the boundaries and the social
[3:47:36.560 --> 3:47:41.520]  chaos theory that you have because I wrote a book on masculinity unbreakable rules of masculinity
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:48.880]  go get at ahotepjesus.com and you know I now I have to write a version two based upon that statement
[3:47:48.880 --> 3:47:57.520]  I'm like I can go riff on this forever well well this is why I'm an anarchist my friend you know
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:48:02.800]  it's the proliferation of the state seems to be synonymous with masculine degeneracy
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:10.080]  and I believe that it is the role of men to stand up for what's right and speak up and the reason
[3:48:10.080 --> 3:48:16.320]  why all this chaos ensues is because men like you and I you know I mean I mean we're doing our part
[3:48:16.320 --> 3:48:22.480]  here but everyone in one ship or another house you know has to stand up for the truth brother
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:30.480]  that's that's really what it is because I mean we can just look at the the percentages the
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:35.440]  actual numbers of how women and men vote right women tend to be the ones who are voting in
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:43.200]  the expansion of the welfare state allowing widespread immigration all of this because
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:49.440]  you know it's it's it's bowls down to like everyone can just look at their mother and their father
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:55.200]  right I can I'll share a personal story anecdotal though my brother and I we once got into a big
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:49:05.120]  scuffle big fight after school punching each other a couple black guys my mother gets home she says
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:12.880]  what happened you guys go into a fight like you're both wrong equally that was you know I love you
[3:49:12.880 --> 3:49:19.040]  both equally both of us are really worried about my dad getting home because my dad is going to come
[3:49:19.040 --> 3:49:24.720]  up and say who started the fight right my brother said I hit him first he said you're the one that
[3:49:24.720 --> 3:49:32.800]  was wrong you see what I'm saying like that's that applies from the for the bottom up that also applies
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:40.720]  politically because we are all you know animals here right so um I mean I feel like that says
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:48.720]  at all that's relatable for everyone absolutely I seen uh I forget what state it is but there's a lot
[3:49:48.720 --> 3:49:55.760]  of pushback on you know uh there's uh sexually explicit material in schools and the islamic
[3:49:55.760 --> 3:50:00.000]  community has been pushing back on this and the conservative community has been pushing back on
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:04.800]  this and I made this funny joke uh before the summer I said it's got to be a he jab summer we
[3:50:04.800 --> 3:50:09.440]  got to bring the he jab back wrap women up in these because otherwise we're just going to lose into
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:15.200]  debauchery lechery and and everything of the sorts so where do we start to draw the boundary
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:20.800]  it's not to be respected incredibly masculine you see what I'm getting at but you got to understand
[3:50:20.800 --> 3:50:26.560]  as you look at um the two or older forms of of christian denominations we're talking about like
[3:50:26.560 --> 3:50:34.400]  orthodox and um Lutherans as well I mean christianity is incredibly masculine
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:39.040]  in matter of fact typically talk about how it's blasphemous to depict christ
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:44.240]  we must understand it's blasphemous if you want people to worship it as an icon uh but usually
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:49.600]  that is not the intention of the artist the reason why I'm sharing this is because one of the oldest
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:56.080]  depictions of christ was uh titled called christ patecrator so the christ came that you saw that
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:00.320]  was my depiction of christ as well and it's always christ as sort of like this warrior-esque figure his
[3:51:00.320 --> 3:51:06.240]  face looks like strong and and and um stoic and some of you would not want to mess with it's only
[3:51:06.240 --> 3:51:10.720]  when the enlightenment came to the picture that we have this depiction of jesus as like this
[3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:17.920]  this liberal white hippie who's who's always uh sensitive in all this right you got to understand
[3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:22.240]  they have that was art and look at how everyone believes
[3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:28.320]  image you know imagines christ now they succeeded you see what I'm getting at the art so what I'm
[3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:33.440]  saying life imitates art and it's automatic because human being is heavily circumstantial if you
[3:51:33.440 --> 3:51:37.120]  can change the cultural fabric people will automatically change and be put under to the
[3:51:37.120 --> 3:51:41.600]  right position so like well I would love to just say things like cut off welfare and abortion and
[3:51:41.600 --> 3:51:45.840]  things will become naturally in the right place in gross agenda dynamics we need to first of all
[3:51:45.840 --> 3:51:52.000]  make the actual cultural fabric in line for people to feel confident to state things like that at a
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:59.920]  larger scale so the art artistry and the aesthetics have to be aligned in that way first oh my god
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:09.280]  that's such a bomb right there they've taken the image of jesus christ my homie and and
[3:52:10.320 --> 3:52:15.520]  turned them feminine I never even thought about that that is quite profound that is a great way
[3:52:15.520 --> 3:52:21.760]  to attack people now look at this one here this is this is if you bumped into this man in a bar
[3:52:21.760 --> 3:52:30.160]  you would apologize right away yes lux nova and it's a bloody lux nova but there's all these the
[3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:36.400]  bodies and the souls of the damned around him too because remember you know christ uh he comes back
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:44.320]  and he comes back not to sing kumbaya and it's very important to understand that that you know
[3:52:44.320 --> 3:52:49.600]  religious thinking is not just this is this is very important to understand what makes christianity
[3:52:49.600 --> 3:52:53.840]  different and what made me into a christian actually is a fact not just because my father's
[3:52:53.840 --> 3:53:01.120]  a pastor but will really crystallize my identity as a christian is the fact that it's not this pagan
[3:53:02.240 --> 3:53:08.880]  almost eastern mysticism vibe that spirituality is all about being in an undifferentiated state
[3:53:08.880 --> 3:53:13.600]  it's all love and it's all one and and because actually that ends up making you
[3:53:13.600 --> 3:53:19.840]  uh in line with collectivist political thinking when you go from spiritual to political because
[3:53:19.840 --> 3:53:25.680]  even if someone that stuff is real from an ontological experiential lens the actual
[3:53:25.680 --> 3:53:30.800]  building of society we need to recognize that there's boundaries and there's order and there's
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:36.960]  hierarchy and christianity is a religion that acknowledges that notion as well whilst being
[3:53:36.960 --> 3:53:44.880]  spiritual so for me it's um it's so incredibly cohesive to depict an image of christ that is
[3:53:45.920 --> 3:53:56.080]  mega based right so that's that's why torture brother i love that you know it reminds me of
[3:53:56.080 --> 3:54:02.160]  the story where uh jesus goes into the temple and he starts kicking some banker ass you know he
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:10.800]  says you guys in here uh doing um committing acts of ill intent and uh you know he's whipping them
[3:54:10.800 --> 3:54:16.400]  he literally whipping some ass this is jesus whipping ass in the bible so i i love that story
[3:54:16.400 --> 3:54:20.320]  can you tell me more about your art what you plan to do with your art because you've been
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:25.600]  canceled by the left so i you know i don't know you know what kind of success you'll have but just
[3:54:25.600 --> 3:54:33.920]  like info war store dot com i think people need to get behind uh that store and and your artwork um
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:37.760]  and uh so yeah tell us about your art what your intent is with the art and where you're going
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:43.920]  with it for the next few pieces um first thing is uh the works that we just showed there i mean
[3:54:43.920 --> 3:54:50.240]  they're very large scale so i look i make large scale luxury world class art so um uh you are
[3:54:50.240 --> 3:54:55.120]  correct i cannot work with the traditional institutions that i used to have relationships
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:55:00.400]  with i can't go back to them that's not going to happen um so that's it i'm independent now
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:05.440]  and because i'm independent you know you look at people like marina abramovic should go on world
[3:55:05.440 --> 3:55:13.440]  tour exhibitions just showing this hedonism and and evil and she gets funded she gets large scale
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:19.840]  patronage um what i realized is that as a man of the people i need to get collected patronage so
[3:55:19.840 --> 3:55:23.840]  if you would like to support me you go to my website arthur paul made you click support
[3:55:23.840 --> 3:55:29.760]  anything helps and it goes a long way because i'm the guy who's trying to go into the most radical
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:34.320]  states where they have all these exhibitions that are propaganda and showing art that counters
[3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:39.600]  it that is beautiful that is true and that is good um so that's one that's one avenue if you would
[3:55:39.600 --> 3:55:47.200]  like to um purchase works and put some beautiful works in your home empty walls are a total waste
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:53.280]  by friend right so it starts locally so put some art in your home and allow the energy to permeate
[3:55:53.280 --> 3:55:59.520]  everywhere so those are two ways you can contact me you can find me on social media on arthur paul
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:06.000]  me that's my instagram and twitter and finally last thing is if you are an artist if you are a
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:11.600]  creative person i started an art collective so that we can congregate and fight in the culture
[3:56:11.600 --> 3:56:19.280]  front called the genesis council and that is also uh that's a space for artists whether of god or
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:25.520]  want to save the west to come together and fight in the cultural wars together we're like the rebel
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:32.080]  alliance what's it called the genesis collective the genesis council we're we're like we're like
[3:56:32.080 --> 3:56:38.000]  i love that we're alliance so that's for the artists who are listening who want to congregate
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:42.640]  and work with and connect and collaborate with other artists you know because um i was actually
[3:56:42.640 --> 3:56:51.680]  inspired by this underground occult society that really was used to uh i want to say inspired i mean
[3:56:51.680 --> 3:56:57.520]  guerrilla warfare to use it against them this society is called a tool society and this was uh
[3:56:57.520 --> 3:57:04.560]  actually was like the way the nazis came to power and they would it was literally a a place designed
[3:57:04.560 --> 3:57:10.080]  for the political and financial elite to congregate with morally inline talent and that is so smart
[3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:15.040]  and what is these are tools we can use against those who are evil as well these are swords yeah
[3:57:15.040 --> 3:57:22.160]  we're not using it but this is a place where people who believe in in god and the truth and the west
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:29.680]  who are also artistic can come together you know so it's kind of like the genesis the the genesis
[3:57:29.680 --> 3:57:35.760]  council ladies and gentlemen this is arthur kwan lee i'm your host hoteb jesus make sure you go to
