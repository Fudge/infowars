[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  So, you hear the air raid siren going off, and you know that means it's an emergency.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  And we have a new system now, the Amber Alert System, that lets you know there's a child
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  that has been potentially kidnapped in an area near you.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  It's an emergency, it's a warning, look out, child predator on the loose.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  So it's really an amazing thing, in the last week, maybe ten or so days, since the Sound of Freedom came out,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  and the issue of child sex trafficking has become, to the front of the conversation,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  how much the left, the Democrats and the Liberals, don't want to have it.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  Well, Donald Trump took it in a different way, and after seeing the film, he had this to say.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  I was thrilled to host a screening at Bedminster of the important new film,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  Sound of Freedom, about the power of faith in overcoming evil, and in particular, the evil of child trafficking.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  Big problem. We had it down to the lowest number in many years, just four years ago,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  and now it's gone through the roof.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  Even though the fake news media has tried to ignore it, Sound of Freedom has been a national sensation
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  and a colossal success at the box office, really big numbers.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  Everyone should see it. This is a very important film and very important movie,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  and it's a very important documentary all wrapped up in one.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  It's really about an issue that has to be discussed.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  Under my leadership, we did more than any administration in history to combat human trafficking
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  and to end modern-day slavery.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  In one of my first acts in office, I signed an executive order targeting transnational criminal organizations
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  that traffic and exploit innocent people.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  I signed the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  authorizing $430 million to fight sex and labor trafficking.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  I signed legislation to crack down on foreign countries who are not meeting standards
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  for eliminating trafficking, of which there are many.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  I also signed into law the Abolish Human Trafficking Act,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  which strengthened programs supporting survivors and provided more resources for ending modern slavery.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  We do have modern slavery, if you can believe it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Additionally, I created the first-ever White House position focused solely on combating human trafficking.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  And perhaps most importantly, we created the most secure border in U.S. history by far,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  dealing a major blow to the cartels and traffickers.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  We built hundreds of miles of wall.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  We renovated hundreds of miles of wall.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  We never had anything like it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  And then I got Mexico free of charge to give us 28,000 soldiers
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]  to protect us from people coming into our country illegally.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  When I am back in the White House, I will immediately end the Biden border nightmare
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  that traffickers are using to exploit vulnerable women and children.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  We will fully secure the border.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  I will wage war on the cartels.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  Just as I destroyed the ISIS caliphate, 100% gone, 100% destroyed.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  They'll come back now because we have a weak administration.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  I will use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries and without delay.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  And I will urge Congress to ensure that anyone caught trafficking children across our border
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  receives the death penalty immediately, and that includes also for women,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  because women, as you know, are number one in trafficking.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  Children are actually number two.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  I want to thank Eduardo, Jim, Tim Ballard, and everyone else involved in this film
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  for their incredible efforts and their great genius.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  Together, we will end the scourge of human trafficking,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  and we will defend the dignity of human life.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  Thank you very much.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  Thank you very much, Donald Trump.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  Death penalty for all child traffickers.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  Now, who doesn't agree with that?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  Well, we found out, haven't we, in the last 10 days.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  We have found out who doesn't agree with that.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  Now, we are really going to get into the 2024 presidential election again here tonight
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  because just like last Sunday night, there have been major developments in the last week.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  So we're going to look at some polls and break it all down right here.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  We've got a limited shipment.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  Hopefully, we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  have in your preparedness arsenal high-quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  we have it right now private-labeled under the name Silver Bullet at Infowarstore.com.

[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  Transcription by CastingWords
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  And honored to be here with you on this Sunday, July 23rd,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  2023 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  I will tell you, Alex Jones is in studio.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  He's working on some other stuff right now.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you, but let's just say big book,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  big book going to be hitting the shelves very soon.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  So he's got some work he's doing on that right now.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  I told him to come in here, pop in if you need a break from that.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  He said, no, no, I'm going to be busy with this.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  So we'll see.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  We may be hearing from Alex at some point tonight as well.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  And just a quick programming note here, for Infowars Sunday Night Live,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  after the Alex Jones Show, two hours right here on Band.Video,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  Harrison Smith is going to be joining me in studio,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  and we're going to be chopping it up on everything I'm about to cover here
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  with your calls as well.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  So going to be a lively four hours here at Infowars tonight,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  and I am excited and honored to be here with you.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  Let's get into it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  So let's talk about where we're at politically in America today.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  If you look to your left, you're going to see somebody that has the basic
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  worldview and understanding that crooks run the country,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  and we are in a much worse place since Joe Biden has taken office,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  and we were doing much better under Donald Trump.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  If you look to your right, you're going to see somebody that understands that
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]  but also believes that the election was stolen from Trump.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  And then if you look behind you, you're going to see somebody that agrees
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  with all those ideas but also thinks that there's a pedophile cult blackmailed
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  running the country with the likes of Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  And you look around and you say, well, gee, I used to be in the minority here.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  Now everybody agrees.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  Why aren't we winning politically?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  Why aren't we crushing politically?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  Why are we still dealing with the corruption, the criminals in D.C.,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  with the lies and deception of the American left?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  What is going on here?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  Well, it just highlights, it's just the evidence of all the corruption
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  that we know we are living under.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  Your worst fears that your elections are rigged and stolen from you,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  perhaps confirmed with this real-world experience.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  So we've got this strange phenomenon where seemingly more than ever,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  the average American just gets it, just gets it, might not fully understand
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  everything, might not be immersed in it like you or I.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  But no, they see that since Biden's gotten to office, it's much worse.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  They know the media's lying to them.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  They know the government's extremely corrupt.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  They know D.C. is the district of criminals.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  It's basic common knowledge.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  And hell, a lot of people are really starting to get ticked off about it too.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  And that's a whole other level of this.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  But my guess is you've probably experienced this, as I have experienced this.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  And now the polls are reflecting this.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  Not just with Donald Trump surging right now to the top of the Republican
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  nomination polls.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  It's basically like 60% is the lowest he's polling at now.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  So it's pretty much over.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  It's done.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  But you've got the little kamikazes being run by Ronna McDaniel,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  which is now confirmed.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  Ronna McDaniel is running the kamikazes of Chris Christie and Nikki Haley
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  and probably Asa Hutchinson and Mike Pence too.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  It's Ronna McDaniel.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  Ronna McDaniel is not moving the ball forward for what are supposed to be
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  Republican values.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  Ronna McDaniel is not moving the ball forward for what are supposed to be
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  conservative values.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  Ronna McDaniel is not trying to make the Republican Party victorious
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  politically.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  No.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  Her job is to sabotage Donald J.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  Trump.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]  And so she's trying to trick Trump right now to get on the debate stage
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  with her kamikazes, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, amongst others.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  Now Trump's smarter than that.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  It's a shame because I'd like to see Trump on the debate stage.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  That's the lion.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  That's the lion on the stage with the hyenas.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  It only helps him in my view.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  But why would you?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  When you know it's a trap, when you know it's a setup, and you don't have to
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  because you already have the nomination, you have nothing to gain.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  So I don't blame Donald Trump for not taking the bait.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  But Ronna McDaniel is trying to trick him.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  Does Ronna McDaniel think she's smarter than Donald Trump?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  Maybe it's a good thing.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  If you're an optimist, you're looking at all of this and you're saying,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  okay, it's a good thing that the country got to see what Joe Biden's
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  presidency was like.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  It's a good thing that the country gets to see what Kamala Harris is and what
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  affirmative action did to the Supreme Court with Judge Brown Jackson.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  This is a good thing.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  It's a good thing that Ronna McDaniel is running the Republican Party right
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  now so that people that actually care about the country can see that she's
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  not actually working for the values of the voters.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  She's working to get Donald Trump.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  She's working for the political elite.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  She's working for the political establishment.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  Maybe it's a good thing we're seeing all of this right now, and then maybe
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  by way of a miracle we can have a fair election and Donald Trump gets in
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]  and we can actually turn all this stuff around.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  That's the optimist.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  But then you just see how absolutely corrupt things are right now.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  I'm anticipating hundreds if not thousands of more arrests coming this year.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]  I mean, for what?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  I don't know, January 6th?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  Talking bad about the Bidens?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]  Yeah, that's where this will go, absolutely.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  IRS going after anybody that questions the Bidens?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  I expect to see all of this.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  And it doesn't matter that Joe Biden is now at a 39% approval rating,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  the second lowest of all time, but totally got 81 million votes.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  Totally for sure got 81 million votes.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  I guarantee it, 81 million votes, more than Obama.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  Obama was actually popular.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  I knew people that liked Obama.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  I knew a lot of Obama voters.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  When Obama won, I was not shocked.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  But Biden voters?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  I do still wonder how far this RFK Jr. campaign is really going to go
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  within the confines of the Democrat Party or beyond the confines of the Democrat Party
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  or maybe even into the arms of Donald Trump.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  Because you know they're not going to let him get the nomination.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  I mean, at this point, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  The bait and switch.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  Oh, Joe Biden's running.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  Everybody get behind Joe Biden and then pull him out last minute, put in Gavin Newsom
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  or as Ryder Stone thinks, Michelle Obama.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  I would put zero faith in the Michelle Obama theory except that I just know Ryder Stone too well
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  and his political compass is about as true north as it gets.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  So when Obama, sure.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  Oh, yeah, they're going to run Michelle Obama.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  Oh, yeah, she wants to be back in the White House.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  Yeah, sure she does.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  But if Ryder Stone says it, I'm telling you, his political compass is true north.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  So whatever the plan is, there is no way they can run Biden.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  There's just no way.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  It's so obvious that he can't, that the whole thing is a fraud.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  And now with the lowest approval rating since Carter and it's tanking fast,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  not to mention all the crimes, all the crimes, the Hunter Biden bribes, the Joe Biden bribes,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  the Ukrainian bribes, the Russian bribes, the Chinese bribes.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  And we still only have seen the tip of the iceberg on that.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  The oversight committee still is looking for other Biden bank records that they are going to get
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  that are probably going to divulge even more millions of dollars going into the Biden family.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  And in most polls even, it's really the polls between Biden and Trump.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  It's just like you can't even really take him seriously.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  Some have Biden up by a couple of points.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  Some have Trump up by a couple of points.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  I'd throw those polls out the window.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  The nominee polls are pretty accurate on the Republican side.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  Trump's obviously winning.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  On the Democratic side, I'm a little skeptical.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  I think RFK is a little more popular than 20, 25 percent.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  But it's the real world test.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  It's the real world test.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  I'm telling you, folks, you want to find out how popular Trump is?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  Go where Trump at.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  You're going to be getting high fives.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  You're going to have people saying, yeah, Trump's my guy.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]  I'm telling you, for Biden, though, no, not even one.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  this is the most concentrated, high-quality bone broth there is.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of bee pollen,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  a gigantic dose of highest-quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  It's about to sell out.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  Available now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladly.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]  and so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at Infowarestore.com.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarestore.com.

[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.720]  And he said that his hookers and blow parties were a business expense, and it wasn't.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:56.080]  But he did also use a business expense to put Joe Biden up into a hotel, which was confirmed
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.200]  via receipts with his signature on it, that he said was a business expense.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]  But Joe Biden said he never did any business with Hunter Biden.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.400]  So what's that about?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.920]  It doesn't matter because the IRS refuses to investigate, and the FBI covers it up,
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.760]  and the DOJ won't investigate either.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:18.940]  But Marjorie Taylor Greene needs to hear about it, because she showed you that in the hearing.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.040]  And all, and I'm sorry, because it's a lot of people I respect, some people that I even
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.480]  know, all you people that were going after Marjorie Taylor Greene, oh, she shouldn't
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.760]  do this, oh, the quorum, oh, she's shock jock.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.240]  She just threw a haymaker, and now they're complaining.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.720]  So actually, maybe you should change your mind and support Marjorie Taylor Greene, whether
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.120]  you like her or not, or like her half the time or none of the time.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.720]  I mean, she's up there trying to score points.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.480]  She's up there moving the needle.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480]  I'd do it again.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.480]  In fact, I bet she will.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.600]  I bet Marjorie Taylor Greene goes to Congress and shows more images from the Hunter Biden
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]  laptop.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.600]  Why?
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600]  Because F them.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600]  That's why.

[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.200]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.680]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.360]  So let me get this straight.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.340]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.760]  Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter to force
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.960]  the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.400]  Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.040]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.960]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.720]  swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.400]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.840]  letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.960]  launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.400]  by the Clinton campaign.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.600]  Do I have that all straight?

[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.960]  of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.

[00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.210]  Now, there are some other news stories here.
[00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:26.410]  I do intend to dive back into the 2024 race and the political stories when Harrison Smith
[00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:31.410]  joins me at 6 o'clock here, so about an hour and a half from now.
[00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.690]  But let's look at some of these other stories.
[00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.650]  And these are still all over the news.
[00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:44.610]  And what I notice now too, people are talking about it in public, and specifically more so
[00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:51.050]  when you go into the comment sections or the reply sections where you have stories of 23-year-old
[00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:56.210]  dies suddenly, young athlete, female, male, whatever, tennis star, track star, all of
[00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.210]  it.
[00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.850]  And people are like, hey, I've really noticed that these young people dying is happening
[00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:01.850]  more often.
[00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:02.850]  What's going on?
[00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.970]  And then it's 100 people saying it's the vaccine, stupid.
[00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.529]  You live under a rock?
[00:36:08.529 --> 00:36:12.009]  So people are starting to get it.
[00:36:12.009 --> 00:36:13.770]  And more and more documents are coming out.
[00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:22.650]  Last week, Child's Health Defense just shared how they tested, I think it was Pfizer, tested
[00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:28.290]  the vaccine on pregnant rats and, well, the babies didn't make it out.
[00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.250]  But they told you it was safe and effective.
[00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:34.290]  So they tested it on pregnant rats, wasn't safe or effective, but then they told the
[00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.570]  pregnant mother it's safe and effective.
[00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.490]  What a shame.
[00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.850]  What a criminal shame.
[00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:52.610]  But that's what they did, and they just released that study last week.
[00:36:52.610 --> 00:37:00.890]  Leaked report confirms myocarditis cases spiked in U.S. military following forced COVID shots.
[00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:05.890]  So now you know more about it.
[00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.730]  And another military document where, you know, they keep good records there in the military
[00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:16.570]  and they see myocarditis is spiking all of a sudden.
[00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.810]  What is going on?
[00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.450]  This has been after the vaccine.
[00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:25.450]  The study looked at over 32,000 individuals who had received either the Pfizer, BioNTech
[00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:29.970]  or Moderna vaccines and monitored them for heart-related conditions.
[00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:39.810]  32 of the study subject were admitted to the hospital with heart and chest-related symptoms.
[00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:47.569]  So let's say there's a 1% shot, and you knew it, 1% shot, you go in there and take
[00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:53.410]  that COVID vaccine, that you're going to have a life-altering health side effect.
[00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.490]  Would you have taken it?
[00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.490]  Probably not.
[00:37:58.529 --> 00:38:03.330]  Because 1% is not safe and effective, is it?
[00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.010]  No.
[00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:11.050]  And pregnant rats, their little rat babies not surviving after taking the COVID vaccine
[00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:16.370]  is not safe and effective, is it?
[00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:20.690]  But they said safe and effective over and over and over and over.
[00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.650]  But it doesn't just stop at the military, everybody's seeing it.
[00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:30.170]  Cleveland Browns 32-year-old wide receiver Marquise Goodwin diagnosed with blood clots
[00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:34.650]  in legs and lungs.
[00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:39.010]  And now his football future is in question.
[00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:46.450]  Hall of Fame NFL cornerback and Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders is now having more
[00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.850]  surgeries dealing with the blood clots in his toes and legs.
[00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.250]  But don't ask about that vaccine.
[00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.690]  Oh, they wanted to know.
[00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:02.970]  They wanted to know your vaccine status real, real intimately, didn't they?
[00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.130]  In 2021, if you wanted to go to get groceries or go into a restaurant, they wanted to know
[00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.290]  your vaccine status, didn't they?
[00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:13.330]  And they had a little piece of paper they wanted you to have to prove your vaccine status.
[00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.850]  Oh, but now people are falling left and right and having blood clots, and we want to know
[00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.490]  their vaccine status.
[00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:19.770]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.370]  You're not supposed to ask about that.
[00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.290]  So you want to go have dinner.
[00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.690]  You want to send your kid to school.
[00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.810]  You need to go have a operation at the hospital.
[00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.450]  We need to know your vaccine status.
[00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.930]  Hey, all these people are keeling over with heart problems, getting blood clots.
[00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.210]  What's their vaccine status?
[00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.130]  Don't you dare ask that.
[00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.010]  No.
[00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:48.970]  Don't you dare ask if Jamie Foxx had a vaccine side effect.
[00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:53.690]  Look, I'm not I'm not going to get conspiratorial here, OK?
[00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:59.210]  I'm not going to tell you that there that Jamie Foxx is dead and they have some actor
[00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.050]  pretending to be Jamie Foxx to save the story.
[00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:08.910]  But clearly, before and after Jamie Foxx with this this recent illness that he has gone
[00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.950]  through with heart problems, I mean, the man looks different.
[00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.990]  I mean, this this really, really messed him up clearly.
[00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:26.630]  So whatever you think about Jamie Foxx, this is a guy who dedicated his life to being to
[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:30.069]  being an elite individual.
[00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:35.590]  And when it all gets ripped away from you like that can be a little devastating.
[00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.270]  But I'm sure he's glad he's still alive.
[00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.910]  But man, what is it?
[00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:44.270]  What is it that caused Jamie Foxx to go through that, that he comes out on the other side
[00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.690]  looking like a completely different person?
[00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.910]  Don't ask about that vaccine status, though.
[00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.670]  Don't even bring that up.
[00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:59.750]  How dare you?
[00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:04.150]  Daughter of Johnson and Johnson, COVID-19 vaccine executive dies suddenly following
[00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.430]  seizures.
[00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:12.590]  Ten-year-old ten-year-old Casey Corinne Moran suffered a fatal brain injury following a
[00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.830]  seizure on July 3rd.
[00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:22.550]  Our ten-year-old daughter, Kelsey Morad, passed away unexpectedly.
[00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:27.390]  Reads a fundraiser in memory of Kelsey seeking to enhance children's services at a local
[00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.430]  soup kitchen.
[00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:37.350]  And of course, we know what everyone is thinking.
[00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:43.630]  Israel's Netanyahu goes to hospital for pacemaker.
[00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:49.910]  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rushed to the hospital early Sunday for an emergency
[00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:56.830]  implantation of a heart pacemaker, plunging Israel deeper into turmoil after widespread
[00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:03.350]  protests over his contentious judicial overhaul plan.
[00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.110]  So they kind of just, this story here, they kind of just breeze over the fact that he
[00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.110]  had to go get a pacemaker.
[00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:16.029]  They kind of just breeze over whatever's going on with his health.
[00:42:16.029 --> 00:42:19.310]  Netanyahu keeps a busy schedule and his office says he's in good health, but over the years
[00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.630]  it has released few details or medical records.
[00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.270]  On July 15th, he was rushed to Sheba with dizziness.
[00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:33.990]  He later said he had been out in the hot sun and had not been drinking enough water.
[00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:39.750]  He was a big pusher of the vaccine though, but see, he wanted to know, all the Israelis
[00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:45.470]  had to get the vaccine and we had to know their status, but what about yours, Netanyahu?
[00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:46.470]  Did you take a vaccine?
[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:47.470]  Did you have a side effect?
[00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:52.150]  Is that why you had to be rushed to the hospital for a pacemaker?
[00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.750]  Are we not allowed to ask that only when citizens of the planet just want to go to
[00:42:55.750 --> 00:43:00.550]  the grocery store, that's when you ask?

[00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:14.710]  They are both clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.510]  supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at
[00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.950]  a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:26.069]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:32.190]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:37.270]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.990]  inductive to pain.
[00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.270]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:48.390]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively
[00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.470]  at InfoWarsTore.com right now.

[00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.670]  fund our operation.
[00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:06.950]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth and they've got our children
[00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.150]  drinking that.
[00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:13.910]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:18.910]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:22.190]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:26.550]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.750]  that sells for twice the price and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.430]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:36.430]  two or three times.
[00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:39.310]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:43.510]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:49.190]  leading competitor and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should
[00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:50.190]  filter your water.
[00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.710]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.750]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.430]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:01.350]  They're discounted right now, finally back in stock.
[00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:07.310]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:33.670]  Well, I can tell you that the city of Austin has pretty much turned into Grand Theft Auto,
[00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.870]  it feels like.
[00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:40.029]  Feels like I'm living in Grand Theft Auto now, just sirens all the time, police pulling
[00:47:40.029 --> 00:47:44.029]  people over 24-7.
[00:47:44.029 --> 00:47:52.870]  The homelessness, poverty, degradation, derangement, just walking around on the streets, sad.
[00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.230]  Austin wasn't like this, not too long ago even it wasn't like this.
[00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.870]  But it's not just Austin.
[00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:59.870]  It's not just Austin.
[00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:05.710]  In fact, you guys, if you had that video from San Francisco that I sent you, I'm gonna play
[00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.990]  this later with Harrison, but let's just, this is insane guys, just roll it.
[00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:19.710]  This person, I mean, who knows what you're doing when you drive your car off a cliff,
[00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.190]  but that's San Francisco for you.
[00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:29.110]  It's just Biden's America, it's Democrat run America is what it is.
[00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.790]  Pete Booty juices on it.
[00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:40.230]  How insane is this story, or how insane is it that we continue to see this happen?
[00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:48.029]  Elderly Lowe's worker, a lady by the way, 68-year-old Donna Hansbrough, fired after
[00:48:48.029 --> 00:48:51.350]  getting repeatedly punched in the face trying to stop thieves.
[00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:59.870]  So the three alleged thieves, a grown man and two young boys, try to steal from Lowe's,
[00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:03.390]  she tries to stop them, she gets beaten up, and then she gets fired for trying to stop
[00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.390]  them.
[00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:06.070]  What is this clown world we live in?
[00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.029]  And of course Lowe's public statement as well, she violated company policy, oh, she
[00:49:10.029 --> 00:49:15.150]  was supposed to let the criminals steal, and I guess if they wanted to smash her face and
[00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:20.350]  stomp on her head on the way out too, then she should probably say thank you, may I have
[00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:21.350]  another?
[00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:28.830]  Lowe's, I guess I won't be shopping at Lowe's anymore.
[00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:32.950]  And that's not the only one, you had the Lululemon story that went viral, it's happened
[00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:42.910]  at all kinds of stores in California, oh, it's store policy, we don't let our employees
[00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:48.509]  try to stop criminal behavior, specifically thieves.
[00:49:48.509 --> 00:49:56.630]  Now this whole argument of life is more important than property is such a misrepresentation
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:04.630]  of the debate, it's such a low IQ response, and it's just so typical from the American
[00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.950]  left.
[00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.290]  This isn't about people over property, okay?
[00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:17.830]  This is about we want to live in a civilized society, and when you break down the foundations
[00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:25.790]  of that by letting people run wild, and the good people get punished, and the bad people
[00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:34.150]  get rewarded, you are breaking down the very foundations of the civilized society we want
[00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:36.810]  to live in.
[00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:43.390]  We don't want to see carjackings walking around in the middle of downtown in broad daylight.
[00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:50.570]  We don't want to be eating lunch outside and we hear a smash and grab.
[00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:56.490]  We don't want to go to the grocery store or go to a whatever store and see people running
[00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.529]  in and running out with a bunch of stolen loot and nobody can do anything about it.
[00:51:00.529 --> 00:51:05.850]  We don't want to get on the subway and have deranged lunatics threatening people, getting
[00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:10.330]  aggressive with people, and then nobody's allowed to do anything or they get in trouble.
[00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:14.890]  This is the breakdown of civilization.
[00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:17.610]  It's completely insane.
[00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:23.250]  It's against all common sense and logic and reasoning and basic human decency, and it's
[00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:30.490]  all coming from and towards the same direction, from the American left towards criminals getting
[00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:36.850]  treated better than you, and that's why the New York City Police Union, they had one of
[00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:42.410]  those digital billboards that they were driving around all day this weekend, Alvin Bragg says
[00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.690]  criminals have more rights than you.
[00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:48.810]  New York City Police Union blasts Alvin Bragg with billboard truck after he indicts police
[00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:49.810]  officer.
[00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:54.610]  Yes, the cop that wants to stop the criminals was the bad guy, just like Daniel Penney is
[00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:55.610]  the bad guy.
[00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.010]  Oh, the deranged lunatic that threatens people and runs around on the subway train and is
[00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:06.010]  well-known for at least five years of being a disturbance, he's the victim here.
[00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:16.850]  It's like, you ever had a friend that just couldn't help but run his mouth, you're at
[00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.970]  a party, you're at a bar, he's just running his mouth, and then eventually somebody pops
[00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:26.370]  your friend in the face, pops him in the jaw, and then he's looking up like, well, why didn't
[00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.370]  you back me up?
[00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:28.370]  I'm like, back you up?
[00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:29.370]  You asked for that.
[00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:32.610]  What are you talking about, back you up?
[00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:34.010]  That was totally earned.
[00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.330]  You earned that punch in the face, buddy.
[00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.970]  Now, I'm not going to let you get hurt, but let's be honest about it.
[00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:45.010]  But see, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:49.890]  You run around on the subway, you run around the streets, you get aggressive, you're deranged,
[00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:54.770]  you harass people, nobody's allowed to touch you.
[00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.330]  No, it's common sense.
[00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:05.090]  If you run around acting like a jerk and an a-hole, somebody's going to knock you down
[00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.890]  because that's what you deserve.
[00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:09.950]  But oh, once again, it's the same thing.
[00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:14.069]  You let criminals run the country, you let deranged lunatics run the streets, you're breaking
[00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:20.690]  down the foundations of civilized society, and that's why it's not civilized anymore.
[00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:27.170]  Top Japanese diplomat violently assaulted in Portland in anti-Asian hate crime attack.
[00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:30.710]  What happened to stop Asian hate?
[00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:32.930]  What happened to stop Asian hate?
[00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.450]  Well, they found out the attackers weren't white.
[00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.010]  Yeah.
[00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.850]  And so now the stop Asian hate phenomenon isn't.
[00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.650]  It's kind of like the Me Too movement.
[00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:45.890]  What happened to the Me Too movement?
[00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:49.650]  Well, all the liberals were assaulting women, and so it went away.
[00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:52.330]  What happened to the stop Asian hate movement?
[00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:58.730]  Well, it was not white people assaulting the Asians, so they quit caring.
[00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:04.090]  Pro-life activists attacked while protesting outside D.C. Planned Parenthood.
[00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:07.490]  Police refused to charge attackers despite the video evidence.
[00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:09.690]  Yeah, seen that too many times.
[00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:18.010]  No, it's actually sad because somebody asked me this weekend when you're out, because if
[00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.490]  I go out, I'll get recognized sometimes.
[00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:24.450]  It's like, do you ever people attack you or anything like that?
[00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.010]  And I don't really think much of it, but then I kind of sat and I thought about it.
[00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:31.810]  It was kind of like, geez, you know, actually, yeah, I mean, I've been assaulted on video
[00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.850]  probably at least 10 times.
[00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.970]  I've been sucker punched multiple times when I've been out.
[00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:38.050]  I've had drinks poisoned when I've been out.
[00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:42.970]  And it was just kind of going through all that, and it was just like, man, I'm just numb
[00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:47.010]  to it, and I know I'm going up against the liberal terrorists and the biggest hate group
[00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:52.930]  in the country, the Democrats, but it's just like, these people are just total scum.
[00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.529]  Now the good news is it's not really like that anymore.
[00:54:54.529 --> 00:54:58.130]  I go out anywhere and it's pretty much all love now.
[00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.770]  And maybe I'll talk about this story.
[00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:02.730]  I wore a Trump hat at a ball game this weekend and everybody loved it.
[00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.850]  I mean, everybody loved the Trump hat.
[00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:05.850]  They loved it.
[00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:10.170]  They love the Trump hat guy.
[00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:16.290]  By the way, there's a big, I think it's in California because California is now going
[00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:20.850]  to allow abortions up to birth.
[00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:25.730]  And so in a couple weekends from now, there's a Christian group organizing a massive prayer
[00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:29.610]  vigil in California that's going to be outside the, I think it's a Planned Parenthood in
[00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.050]  California, where they're going to abort up to birth now.
[00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:39.130]  I mean, yeah, let's just rip them right out of the womb and just feed them to the satanic
[00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:40.450]  cult in DC.
[00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:41.569]  Just do it all live on camera.
[00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:43.010]  It'll be the top rated show.
[00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:46.250]  And then the liberals will still deny it exists, and they'll say, that's not real.
[00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:50.210]  That's QAnon.
[00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:54.330]  Just stop oil climate activists blocked by counter protesters wearing just stop pissing
[00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.290]  everyone off T-shirts.
[00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.690]  And this is where it's going.
[00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:04.970]  And this is what I think is the natural, this is kind of the natural path with this.
[00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:09.410]  It's not a political path, but it's going to be organic.
[00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:13.210]  The average American that might have leaned left for whatever reasons, maybe it was a
[00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:18.170]  disgust towards Bush, or maybe they do have more political leanings that are leftist or
[00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.970]  liberal.
[00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:25.370]  But now it's reached this point where the average American that maybe leans left or
[00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:31.170]  votes Democrat looks at what a liberal progressive is and is so disgusted and knows it's such
[00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:35.330]  an embarrassment that they don't want to be associated with it anymore.
[00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.450]  And this is a perfect example.
[00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:42.890]  All these just stop oil people that are blocking up traffic and destroying art and historic
[00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:47.130]  monuments and disrupting sporting events.
[00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:48.130]  Everybody's just sick of them.
[00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.050]  But it's the same thing.
[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:54.370]  It's leftists like this everywhere.
[00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:59.010]  And that's why you have all these people leaving the Democrat Party.
[00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:03.090]  And that's why you have people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and everybody else making fun
[00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:06.650]  of liberals now, when they might have been leaning left their entire lives.
[00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:09.529]  Now they're like, yeah, these liberals, I'm not associated with them.
[00:57:09.529 --> 00:57:16.170]  They're deranged lunatics, pedophilesque, if not just straight up, nope, not me.
[00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:19.490]  Not with the liberals anymore.
[00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:20.490]  That's what it is.
[00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.330]  They just they got to suck the fun out of everything.
[00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:27.210]  It's a bunch of people that never earned any power, that never earned any influence.
[00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.210]  It was all stolen.
[00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:30.410]  It was all given to them.
[00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:34.490]  And now they're riding that high horse all high and mighty, realizing that that that
[00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:38.050]  horse they rode was never a horse at all.
[00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.250]  It was a jackass.
[00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.850]  It was a jackass.
[00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:46.730]  And now it's Joe Biden, the jackass in the wild.
[00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.250]  What's Joe Biden doing right now?
[00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.850]  Every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it, you just click it and then
[00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:13.490]  you decide when you want to make a donation.
[00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.569]  So please do that as well.
[00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:19.010]  That way we get 95 percent of it after credit card fees that are making 20, 30, 40 percent
[00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:20.010]  like we do on the products.
[00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.010]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.490]  The big July 4 sell is going on right now.
[00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:26.090]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.210]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:29.550]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:33.890]  But in this major recession, going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's
[00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:34.890]  hard.
[00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:35.890]  I know times are tough.
[00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:36.890]  So thank you for your support.
[00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:40.850]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos that
[00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:41.850]  you can do for free.
[00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:44.250]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.650]  So however, God leads you in your heart to support us.
[00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:47.650]  Please support us now.
[00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.210]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:50.210]  God bless you.
[00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:54.890]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:57.010]  We made it even stronger.
[00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:00.970]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:07.650]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:14.170]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.810]  called 10 hour energy.
[00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:21.250]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:26.490]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:27.490]  it.
[00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.850]  It is the super fuel.
[00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.330]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:33.330]  Rainforce Ultra is great.
[00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:34.330]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:35.330]  They go good with this.
[00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.569]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:59:37.569 --> 00:59:39.569]  This is the boss.
[00:59:39.569 --> 00:59:42.490]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted.
[00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:43.490]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:46.490]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:56.490]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:14.490]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex
[01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.490]  Jones Show.
[01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:18.490]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.490]  All right.
[01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:31.490]  We will be opening up the phone lines shortly.
[01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:36.490]  And we also have Harrison Smith coming in studio in an hour from now to talk shop with me on
[01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.490]  all of this as well.
[01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:41.490]  We got Twitter about to change the logo.
[01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.490]  I'm going to tell you about that.
[01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.490]  Some other news out of the Biden campaign.
[01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:49.490]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.490]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:54.490]  I'm sorry.
[01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.490]  The Biden baggy at the White House.
[01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.490]  That story just won't go away.
[01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:01.490]  And it shouldn't, by the way.
[01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.490]  Now, they're doing the same thing to RFK Jr. that they did to Donald Trump.
[01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:08.490]  And that's calling up anybody that knows him or any of his family that is willing to speak
[01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:13.490]  out negatively against him and then probably offering them money or jobs or some such form
[01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:15.490]  of payment.
[01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:20.490]  Or maybe like the Bidens, they get a nice Rolex, nice big pure diamonds.
[01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:25.490]  Maybe they get paid like the Bidens do off the radar under the table.
[01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.490]  But so now it's a grandson.
[01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:29.490]  And this is really just pathetic.
[01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:37.490]  But the left has now got an RFK, excuse me, a JFK grandson to go after RFK Jr.
[01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:41.490]  And by the way, this will have absolutely no effect.
[01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:44.490]  This will have zero impact whatsoever.
[01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:47.490]  So you know what?
[01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:49.490]  Should I even air it?
[01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:54.490]  Just so you can see, just for proof that this isn't what they're doing to RFK Jr. now,
[01:01:54.490 --> 01:02:00.490]  here is JFK's grandson endorsing Joe Biden.
[01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:01.490]  Hi.
[01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.490]  I'm Jack Schlossberg.
[01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:03.490]  OK.
[01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:04.490]  And I have something to say.
[01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:05.490]  Oh.
[01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:07.490]  President John F. Kennedy is my grandfather.
[01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.490]  And his legacy is important.
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:11.490]  It's about a lot more than Camelot.
[01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:12.490]  You know, it's so funny here.
[01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:13.490]  Just go ahead and pause it.
[01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:14.490]  This is just pathetic.
[01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:15.490]  This is so pathetic.
[01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.490]  So I don't know this guy.
[01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:18.490]  Nobody knows of this guy.
[01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:19.490]  You don't know of this guy.
[01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:20.490]  And that's fine.
[01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.490]  He can live a private life.
[01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.490]  It's not necessarily an insult.
[01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:26.490]  But you've never heard of him.
[01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:29.490]  And now all of a sudden he wants to be an influence on your politics.
[01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:33.490]  And his whole selling point is JFK is my grandfather.
[01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:37.490]  So what have you done?
[01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.490]  Exactly.
[01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:42.490]  Oh, JFK is your grandfather.
[01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:44.490]  So I'm supposed to listen to you.
[01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.490]  Well, OK.
[01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:46.490]  All right.
[01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:48.490]  Well, what do you have to offer?
[01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:50.490]  Oh, I'm going to endorse Joe Biden.
[01:02:50.490 --> 01:03:00.490]  So you mean the family member of yours that's actually trying to uphold the Democrat Party values of your grandfather
[01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:08.490]  and the deep state that killed members of your family, R.K. Jr. is trying to stand up to them,
[01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:14.490]  and your choice is to endorse Biden?
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.490]  Interesting.
[01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.490]  Interesting choice there.
[01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:19.490]  But you know what?
[01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:21.490]  I don't need to see anymore.
[01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:22.490]  So that's it.
[01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:24.490]  That's all the airtime.
[01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.490]  Because the story isn't who he is or what he's saying.
[01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:31.490]  The story is that they're going after R.K. Jr. a lot like they went after Donald Trump.
[01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:33.490]  So he's the real deal.
[01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:34.490]  R.K. Jr. is the real deal.
[01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:39.490]  They're not as scared of R.K. Jr. as they are Donald Trump, at least right now.
[01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:46.490]  But there's no doubt they see the threat that R.K. represents, specifically to Joe Biden and the Democrats during the nomination,
[01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:54.490]  or even furthermore, when the presidential election actually comes up, should he decide to leave and go third party.
[01:03:54.490 --> 01:04:00.490]  So they've got to do as much damage to R.K. Jr. as possible.
[01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:06.490]  They have to do as much damage to him as possible, as quickly as possible, because all he's doing is gaining momentum.
[01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:09.490]  All he's doing is gaining popularity.
[01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:17.490]  And the more they attack him, the bigger his platform gets.
[01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:22.490]  I mean, R.K. Jr. says the media is hitting him harder than Trump.
[01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:26.490]  I mean, he might be right, folks.
[01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:34.490]  Now, I would say that the corrupt bureaucrat administrative state is attacking Donald Trump more than R.K.
[01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:40.490]  But I mean, I actually I think the media is attacking R.K. more than Trump now.
[01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:44.490]  I think he's actually right.
[01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:47.490]  The same media that lies to you about everything.
[01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:50.490]  That's the election we deserve. R.K. Jr. versus Donald Trump.
[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:55.490]  That's an American on both sides, not a sellout, but an American.
[01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:58.490]  That's why they don't want him on there. That's why they don't want him in there.
[01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.490]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:09.490]  I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is.
[01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:13.490]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:15.490]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.490]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.490]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:22.490]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:24.490]  Krill oil is the best.
[01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.490]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:27.490]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this?
[01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.490]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.490]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:31.490]  It's so good in my view.
[01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:33.490]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.490]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:38.490]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:44.490]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:49.490]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.490]  But you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:54.490]  I just can't do it.
[01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.490]  Infowarsstore.com
[01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:07.490]  You've found it.
[01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:09.490]  The tip of the spear.
[01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.490]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:33.490]  So Twitter, well Elon Musk rather, is about to change the Twitter logo.
[01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:38.490]  This actually has an impact.
[01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:41.490]  You might think it's trivial.
[01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:42.490]  I don't think so.
[01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:45.490]  But I might be the lunatic on this one.
[01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.490]  I might be in the lunatic fringe with my take on that.
[01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:49.490]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:54.490]  We've also got some news out of Ukraine we're going to cover as well.
[01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:59.490]  Some other cultural news we'll be talking about with Harrison Smith in an hour,
[01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:04.490]  including some of the polls showing how Trump is surging and skyrocketing.
[01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:06.490]  And then we're also going to take your calls.
[01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:11.490]  And I mean, I do this about once a month and it usually gets the same result.
[01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:14.490]  People calling in and confirming, but people wanting to talk about their own thing.
[01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:16.490]  So it's not the most effective practice.
[01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:19.490]  But I'll just say, what are you experiencing?
[01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:20.490]  You go out in public.
[01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:21.490]  You talk to people.
[01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:22.490]  You hear people talk.
[01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.490]  I mean, folks, I'm not trying to exaggerate here.
[01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:34.490]  I was at a ballgame this weekend, and the entire section was like an Alex Jones show.
[01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:36.490]  I'm not even kidding.
[01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.490]  And I'm just sitting there.
[01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:40.490]  I'm sitting in the front row of this section.
[01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.490]  It's like six rows back, maybe.
[01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.490]  Maybe like 30, 40 people in this section.
[01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:49.490]  And I mean, it was just like the whole thing was just Alex Jones left and right.
[01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:50.490]  I had a Trump hat on.
[01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:53.490]  Everybody loved the Trump hat.
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:08:04.490]  So that is just undeniable real-world evidence that, yes, Trump did get the most votes ever of any other president.
[01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:08.490]  And, yes, he is still the most popular president in modern American history.
[01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:11.490]  And, yes, he is the most popular man running for president.
[01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:12.490]  Nobody else has that.
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.490]  Nobody else can do that.
[01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:24.490]  But beyond just Trump versus Biden or whoever, the fact that I'm hearing people talking about Jeffrey Epstein just at a ballgame behind me,
[01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:30.490]  talking about, oh, wow, the economy got real bad after Biden got in.
[01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:34.490]  So, I mean, the awakening is on.
[01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:37.490]  So I want to take your calls on that if you're experiencing something similar.
[01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.490]  And, I mean, maybe I'll just tell the story of what happened.
[01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:42.490]  But, I mean, I'm just telling you, I'm at a ballgame.
[01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:43.490]  I got a Trump hat on.
[01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:48.490]  A whole section sounds like a damn Alex Jones show going on behind me.
[01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:49.490]  I'm like, what the hell?
[01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:54.490]  Like this woman is telling me she wants to send me classified documents that she gets from working at the Pentagon.
[01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:57.490]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:08:57.490 --> 01:09:01.490]  I'm like, what in the hell is going on here?
[01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:05.490]  Am I at a baseball game or am I in a studio at Infowars?
[01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:08.490]  What in the world?
[01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:14.490]  Folks, there were people debating flat Earth.
[01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.490]  What?
[01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:18.490]  So it's on.
[01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:19.490]  The awakening is on.
[01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:27.490]  The human mind, the spark, the life force, the curiosity, the bewilderment, the wonderment, it's all returning.
[01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:28.490]  It's all coming back.
[01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.490]  The heartbeat of the human soul.
[01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.490]  We're breaking out of the trance.
[01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.490]  It feels good.
[01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:37.490]  Are you experiencing this?
[01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:40.490]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.490]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:47.490]  We're going to take a ton of calls tonight right here on The Jones Show and into Sunday Night Live with Harrison Smith.
[01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:50.490]  But let me just tell you, I am not exaggerating.
[01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:52.490]  I've got multiple eyewitnesses.
[01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:56.490]  I've got even photo evidence, people wanting to take pictures with the Trump hat guy.
[01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.490]  It was crazy.
[01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:00.490]  I've never seen anything like that.
[01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:02.490]  Like I said, I do this about once a month.
[01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:11.490]  Maybe I'll go out and do something about once a month or go out to a bar or go out to a ball game or something like that and just kind of get a feel for things around me.
[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:17.490]  I've probably gone to, I mean, really, 400 baseball games in my life.
[01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:21.490]  I have never 500.
[01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:23.490]  I mean, maybe sometimes in the booth.
[01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.490]  If I'm sitting in like a radio booth, people will talk politics.
[01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:38.490]  I have never sat in a section of a baseball game where everybody is talking politics and it's just like a red pill festival happening.
[01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.490]  Crazy.
[01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:44.490]  I'm going to check out at the concession.
[01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:48.490]  The guy checking me out is like, hey, got a nice hat, man, gives me a fist bump.
[01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:52.490]  Crazy.
[01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.490]  But my guess is you're probably experiencing something similar.
[01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.490]  But that's the twilight zone that we're in.
[01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:59.490]  We know we were right.
[01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:00.490]  We've been proven right.
[01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.490]  We've won the political debate.
[01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:03.490]  We have the numbers.
[01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:04.490]  We have the momentum.
[01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:05.490]  We are the majority.
[01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:08.490]  We're just not getting the political results.
[01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:12.490]  So the gears start to shift and we start to figure out why.
[01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:15.490]  What can we do?
[01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:17.490]  It's a slow burn to us that are impatient.
[01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:21.490]  It's a slow burn that have been watching this go on for decades.
[01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:25.490]  But the burn is heating up.
[01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.490]  The burn is heating up.
[01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.490]  I tell you, just wild.
[01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:32.490]  All ages, too.
[01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:33.490]  All ages.
[01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:34.490]  Younger than me.
[01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.490]  Older than me.
[01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:39.490]  Just crazy.
[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:40.490]  Crazy.
[01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:43.490]  Couldn't make it up.
[01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.490]  Yeah, let me tell you.
[01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.490]  Back when Rob Dewey and I went to the game,
[01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.490]  that was probably like five years ago now,
[01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:51.490]  with the Trump-Hillary masks.
[01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:54.490]  Ain't no, ain't no, nobody was talking politics, really.
[01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:56.490]  I mean, they liked our shirts and stuff.
[01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.490]  But this was, it was totally different.
[01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.490]  But I guess that's a good comparison, though.
[01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:04.490]  We were popular then, too.
[01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:07.490]  We were in the majority then, too.
[01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.490]  Oh, man.
[01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:10.490]  So there you go.
[01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:11.490]  There you go.
[01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:15.490]  Now, let's pepper in some other news here,
[01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:19.490]  before we do take your calls.
[01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:22.490]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott rejects Department of Justice demand
[01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:24.490]  to remove floating border barriers.
[01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.490]  We'll see you in court.
[01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:28.490]  So, I mean, how effective can these things really be?
[01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:33.490]  Well, I guess they're effective enough that the Biden DOJ wants to get rid of them.
[01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:36.490]  Because if you asked me, I would say, no, they're ugly.
[01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:38.490]  It's an eyesore.
[01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:39.490]  How effective is it?
[01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:41.490]  I think it's dumb.
[01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.490]  Put more barbed wire up.
[01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:48.490]  You just sent 500 Texas DPS agents to Austin to pull people over for traffic stops.
[01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:50.490]  Send them down to the border.
[01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:53.490]  Stop all the illegals coming in.
[01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:56.490]  But now it's the Biden DOJ that's livid because Greg Abbott
[01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:59.490]  is putting some barriers up at the southern border?
[01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:03.490]  Okay, well, I guess Abbott's on to something.
[01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:08.490]  I don't want to be the dog getting wagged by the tail,
[01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:12.490]  but I think it's a fair pressure point to say,
[01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:17.490]  well, gee, if the Biden administration hates it, maybe it's good.
[01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.490]  So it's kind of like I was skeptical of Greg Abbott sending all the illegal immigrants
[01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:23.490]  to New York and Chicago and Los Angeles,
[01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:25.490]  and then the left just started complaining,
[01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.490]  and now they've shut down their cities for illegals.
[01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.490]  I'm like, oh, okay, gee, Greg, I guess you did do it then.
[01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:31.490]  All right, good job.
[01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:35.490]  So all he does is he puts up a floating barrier,
[01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:39.490]  essentially a floating wall, if you will,
[01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:41.490]  in between the United States and Mexico,
[01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.490]  and the Department of Justice demands he removes it.
[01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.490]  Why?
[01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:49.490]  Humanitarian concerns.
[01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:50.490]  They lie so much.
[01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:55.490]  A pregnant woman was crossing the southern border illegally.
[01:13:55.490 --> 01:14:01.490]  She crosses, and she runs into barbed wire set up there to protect our border.
[01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.490]  She runs into it, and then the media says,
[01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:07.490]  Greg Abbott laid a trap that caught up a pregnant woman.
[01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:10.490]  Laid a trap.
[01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:12.490]  Laid a trap.
[01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:17.490]  If I break into somebody's house and the alarm goes off
[01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:20.490]  and maybe the owner comes out and shoots me or the cops show up and arrest me,
[01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:22.490]  oh, did I fall into a trap?
[01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:24.490]  Am I the victim?
[01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:26.490]  Oh, I fell into a trap.
[01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:28.490]  I broke into your house to rob everything,
[01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:31.490]  and you shot me because your alarm system went off.
[01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:35.490]  Why did you trap me?
[01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.490]  Why doesn't the Department of Justice want a border?
[01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:41.490]  Why doesn't the Department of Justice want any barriers at the border?
[01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:45.490]  Why does the Department of Justice want the floating wall to be removed?
[01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:47.490]  Why, why, why, why, why?
[01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:50.490]  Is the Department of Justice profiting?
[01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.490]  Who wouldn't ask this?
[01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:54.490]  This is the most fair and obvious question to ask.
[01:14:54.490 --> 01:15:00.490]  Is the Department of Justice profiting off of illegal immigration?
[01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:05.490]  Is the Department of Justice running an illegal immigration pipeline that they are profiting off of?
[01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:09.490]  Is the Department of Justice profiting off of child sex trafficking
[01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.490]  and human trafficking going on at the southern border?
[01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:17.490]  Otherwise, why else wouldn't they want to stop it?
[01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:18.490]  It really is that basic.
[01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.490]  It really is that open and shut.
[01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:26.490]  That is the question that should be asked every time a member of the Biden administration
[01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:28.490]  or the Department of Justice ever does a press conference.
[01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:31.490]  But, of course, they don't.
[01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:33.490]  You know, another debate I want to have.
[01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:35.490]  Is it time to impeach Joe Biden?
[01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.490]  I've been on the fence about this and mostly saying no.
[01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:39.490]  I am now changing my stance.
[01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.490]  I do believe it is time to impeach Joe Biden,
[01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:46.490]  but it needs to be done very strategically,
[01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:50.490]  very methodically and strategically.
[01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:52.490]  We'll talk about that as well when we come back.
[01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:05.490]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:07.490]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:08.490]  It is.
[01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:12.490]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:14.490]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:16.490]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:18.490]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.490]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:24.490]  Krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:25.490]  And I'm sorry.
[01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:26.490]  You want something like this?
[01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:27.490]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:29.490]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:30.490]  It's so good in my view.
[01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.490]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:35.490]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:38.490]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:46.490]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.490]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:51.490]  But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got,
[01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:52.490]  I just can't lie to you.
[01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:53.490]  I just can't do it.
[01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:58.490]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:00.490]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:02.490]  Sold out for eight months.
[01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:03.490]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:05.490]  We made it even stronger.
[01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:09.490]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:16.490]  Turbo Force is back in stock at infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:22.490]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:24.490]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:28.490]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:33.490]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:36.490]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:39.490]  It is the super fuel.
[01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:41.490]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.490]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:17:42.490 --> 01:17:43.490]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:44.490]  They go good with this.
[01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:46.490]  But this is the king kong.
[01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.490]  This is the boss.
[01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:51.490]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted.
[01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:53.490]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:59.490]  More power, more strength, more energy.

[01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:08.490]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy,
[01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:13.490]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years
[01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:14.490]  back in stock.

[01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:07.770]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.860]  Put him on the screen. We've got a shiny chrome dome.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:14.860]  You told me to come in here.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.860]  We've got a shiny chrome dome here.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.860]  You told me to come in here.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:24.860]  Alex may or may not be in the room behind the studio working on the finishing touches of a new book.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.860]  May or may not be.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.860]  I got a deadline of three days, so we had to cut it down from 800 pages to 500.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.860]  And I'm just, we're double sourcing everything. It's just, it's a really good book. Really powerful.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:40.860]  Well, it's like there's so much information about how the globalists are trying to destroy America.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.860]  How do you, how do you decide what's the most important?
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.860]  Well, the craziest part, it's all their admissions.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.860]  Their own documents.
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.860]  Well, they're really getting arrogant now.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.860]  Have you seen Harari? He's on the site today.
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.860]  Going, there's no globalists, no elite.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.860]  No such thing as a New World Order.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.860]  He says these speeches like, total elites will run everything.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.860]  We will have robots that will land in mosquitoes that will inject you with the vaccine.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.860]  He says there's no freedom, you have no free will, you have no dignity.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.860]  We rule you, we control you.
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.860]  A super elite will be the new gods.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.860]  Remember his quote?
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.860]  I don't believe in Jesus and the clouds, but we will be gods and the clouds the elite.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.860]  But now he says there's no elite.
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.860]  The one thing about them is they didn't have a very good disguise.
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:19.860]  I mean, you look at Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.860]  You look at Joe Biden.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:21.860]  You look at Noah Harari.
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:22.860]  You look at Klaus Schwab.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:26.860]  I mean, they look like the demon freakazoid tyrants that they are.
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:27.860]  That's right.
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:28.860]  You can't even hide that.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.860]  Owen Schreuer looks like the young, handsome Abraham Lincoln.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:32.860]  That's right.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.860]  Well, they clone.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.860]  And I look like a little bit overweight Lex Luthor.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.860]  I get back to work.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:37.860]  Great job.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.860]  All right.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.860]  Hey, I appreciate everybody.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.860]  Go finish up that book.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.860]  Go finish up that book.
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:46.860]  Folks, you're going to be able to find that at Infowarsstore.com, but he's got to finish
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.860]  it first, all right?
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.860]  So he can't be here in studio all day.
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.860]  He's got to go finish that book, but it'll be available for you at Infowarsstore.com
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:53.860]  shortly.
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.860]  I can assure you, let's make it a New York Times bestseller when that day comes.
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:00.860]  But the Patriot Pride Month is live right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:03.860]  So you've already got huge discounts on top-selling, top-rated supplements.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:09.860]  And I mean, when you've got, you're looking at Russia, you're looking at China, you're
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:12.860]  looking at Taiwan, you're looking at Ukraine, and you've got Joe Biden in the White House,
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:18.860]  folks, I'm telling you, Russia and China are going to be making big, massive moves in the
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:19.860]  next 12 months.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:24.860]  They're going to make whatever their big strategic moves are before Biden, before the 2024 election,
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:28.860]  because they know Biden is weak and they probably both have Biden blackmailed.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.860]  So whatever they're going to do in Taiwan and Ukraine, it's coming.
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:35.860]  Whatever they're going to do with the gold-backed currency in BRICS, it's coming.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.860]  So I just think you need to be prepared.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.860]  And quite frankly, I'm already prepared.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.860]  Maybe even for myself, I guess you can never be over-prepared.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:49.860]  But I mean, even I'm thinking about, like, I got emergency food supplies, but even I'm
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.860]  thinking, like, is it time to, do I need to get even more now?
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.860]  It's like, it feels instinctual, really.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:01.860]  So we got 10% off all emergency food supplies right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:05.860]  You'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.860]  It's that obvious.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:11.860]  It's insurance you can eat, and it's the highest quality storage as well.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.860]  So you don't even have to worry about it, folks.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.860]  It shows up and it's ready to be stored.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:17.860]  You don't even have to worry about getting it prepared to store.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.860]  It's ready.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.860]  It's storable food ready when it shows up to be stored or to be eaten.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.860]  You can take it out on a camping trip.
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.860]  So Infowarsstore.com, Patriot Pride Month rolls on, and it's your support there that
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:29.860]  keeps us on the air.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.860]  And hey, as long as you continue to shop at Infowarsstore.com, Alex Jones is going to
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.860]  keep working and writing new books and launching new shows and doing everything he can to defeat
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:41.860]  these tyrants, as is his life mission.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.860]  So that's at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.860]  All right, we're going to come back and take calls.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.860]  We're going to be joined by Harrison Smith.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:54.860]  But since I mentioned the NATO, Russia, Ukraine situation, there is some news here, and it's
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:58.860]  mostly just the same news that's been going on, and then your media lying to you about
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:02.860]  it, the American media, and the White House, the Biden administration lying to you.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:09.860]  They had a new supply of Leopard and Bradley tanks show up for the Ukrainian army, and
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.860]  they were destroyed immediately.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:16.860]  And it was 15 Leopard tanks, 20 Bradley tanks destroyed in one day.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.860]  Large number of Western mercenaries eliminated.
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:21.860]  And everybody knew that was going to be the case.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:22.860]  But who cares?
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:27.860]  Because I don't think Lindsey Graham owns any stock, and nobody Lindsey Graham knows
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:33.860]  owns any stock in any of the weapons manufacturers or contractors that are making more money
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.860]  than ever before.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.860]  I'm sure that's not what's going on here.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:41.860]  So they're really heartbroken that every time they send a new shipment of weapons, and
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:49.860]  every time they send a new shipment of tanks, it either gets stolen or destroyed upon arrival.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.860]  But see, you don't hear about that.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:58.860]  Oh, did they make a big fuss about the inspector general's report last week that most of the
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.860]  arms and ammunition and money that's gone into Ukraine, they can't track or trace?
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.860]  They don't know where it went.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.860]  Oh.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:14.860]  Yeah, that one kind of just flew right under the radar, didn't it?
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.860]  Inspector general report, the ammunition and arms and money going to Ukraine is disappearing.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:23.860]  How do you steal a fighter jet?
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.860]  How do you steal a fighter jet?
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:32.860]  How do you steal a shipment of 20,000 guns and 100,000 rounds of ammunition?
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.860]  They did a movie actually about that.
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.860]  It's called Lord of War.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.860]  And you know the individual who was the Lord of War?
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.860]  He was Ukrainian.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:42.860]  He was a Ukrainian.
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.860]  He did a lot of business in Ukraine.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.860]  It's like they knew.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.860]  It's like they knew.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.860]  So that's what's going on.
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.860]  A gigantic money laundering operation, a gigantic weapons laundering operation,
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.860]  $200 billion to Ukraine.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:01.860]  It could have been brought right back here to the United States, and it would have improved our lives.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:06.860]  But we should really just be improving the lives of the D.C. elites that don't care who they send to die
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.860]  or whose money they steal and give to themselves.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:13.860]  Putin issues stark warning to Poland and NATO.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.860]  So there's just more aggression going on there.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:21.860]  Ukraine's lack of weaponry and training risks stalemate in fight with Russia.
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.860]  That's the Wall Street Journal today.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.860]  Stalemate.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.860]  Stalemate.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:28.860]  Stalemate.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.860]  Yeah.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:31.860]  Thank you for reminding me.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:35.860]  You want to see the video that explains the Ukraine-Russian war?
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:39.860]  It's Ukraine bashing its head against the Russians and not doing anything,
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.860]  and then America saying, no, bash harder, bash harder, bash, bash, bash.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.860]  We'll bash for you.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860]  I mean, that's it.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.860]  That is your war in Ukraine right there.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.860]  Stalemate with Russia.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:52.860]  Oh, it's a stalemate.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860]  It's a stalemate.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:56.860]  Ukrainians are dying by the tens of thousands.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:00.860]  Anybody volunteering for the Ukraine army is getting killed or captured
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.860]  almost immediately having their legs blown off.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.860]  It's cost the American people $200 billion.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:10.860]  It's cost NATO some $50 billion, probably.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.860]  All the weapons, everything that's been stolen, laundered, blown up,
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.860]  and that's a stalemate.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.860]  So, I mean, so I guess what?
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.860]  If Russia would have to blow Ukraine off the map
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.860]  and raise the Ukrainian flag in Kiev,
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.860]  I guess that would be a stalemate or would that be a Russian victory?
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.860]  So this is a stalemate.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.860]  So Ukraine is getting murdered and destroyed,
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:39.860]  and Ukraine is being set up for a fall,
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.860]  and weapons and money are being laundered,
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.860]  and that's a stalemate.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.860]  Amazing.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:46.860]  That's a stalemate.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.860]  And now what is this from the U.S.?
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.860]  Not a good sign.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:50.860]  Not a good sign.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:57.860]  Once-in-a-generation opportunity is what CIA chief William Burns says
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.860]  the U.S. is recruiting spies in Russia.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:01.860]  Once-in-a-generation opportunity.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.860]  Oh, once-in-a-generation opportunity to step up for World War III
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:11.860]  for the most blood-lusting criminal elites in the history of this planet.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.860]  Once-in-a-generation opportunity.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.860]  Step right up, folks.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.860]  Step right up.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:25.860]  The Biden administration will send you to Ukraine to die.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.860]  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:32.860]  Step right up and stand right in front of those Russian bullets and missiles,
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.860]  and don't worry because the ammunition and the arms that we sent you didn't show up,
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.860]  and the tanks are all blown up too.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.860]  But step right up.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:41.860]  Step right up.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:45.860]  Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to die for Lindsey Graham and Joe Biden.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:49.860]  And now a leaked video shows retired forestall general McChrystal claims
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.860]  that the U.S. is behind Nord Stream Pipeline bombing.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.860]  Yeah, we all knew it.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.860]  It's a war crime.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.860]  Biden did it, but the media just covered up for him.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.860]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.860]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.860]  So let me get this straight.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.860]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.860]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:15.860]  Joe Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:19.860]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.860]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:24.860]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.860]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.860]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.860]  which the FBI also had,
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.860]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.860]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:41.860]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:45.860]  about the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.860]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:53.860]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.860]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.860]  You wanted to plug Rainforce. Do you like Rainforce?
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.860]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:05.860]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:07.860]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz,
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.860]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.860]  two books with Alex Jones.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:14.860]  That's because I use Rainforce every day.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.860]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:22.860]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:27.860]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Rainforce.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:31.860]  I'll take Rainforce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:35.860]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:39.860]  So it really is true that Rainforce is something I use every day,
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.860]  and it helps me with my writing.
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:42.860]  All right. We love you.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.860]  We'll be right back.

[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.860]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:36.860]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.860]  There's major research behind this all.

[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.860]  What's better, down and out?
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:12.860]  What's better?
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.860]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:19.860]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.860]  So one person might like this coffee.
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:23.860]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:24.860]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.860]  They're all very diverse.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:31.860]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love

[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:20.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.600]  the InfoWar.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.440]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:32.280]  All right, we got callers on the line.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.680]  We got Harrison Smith coming up in studio.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:40.640]  We got lots of live InfoWars transmission remaining.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.180]  I want to talk about Twitter changing its logo to an X.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:51.120]  I want to talk about what we need to do as far as the impeachment of Joe Biden is concerned.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.960]  But we do have callers on the line, and so I see a couple callers on this.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:01.180]  And let me just, without being too redundant, I do this about once a month or so as kind
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:05.340]  of a barometer from what I'm seeing, what you're seeing.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:11.940]  But I was at a ballgame this weekend, and I had a Trump hat on, and I'm not even kidding
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.940]  you.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:13.940]  We're not even talking politics.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.940]  We're there minding our own business.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.660]  I'm there with some friends.
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.900]  And like the whole section sounds like Alex Jones, people talking about Trump, people
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:24.820]  talking about Epstein didn't kill himself, deep state, 9-11 inside job, like going into
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:25.820]  detail.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:28.880]  So I'm like, what in the heck is going on?
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.080]  And then the situation just got totally out of control when I caught a foul ball with
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.000]  a Trump hat on.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.480]  And then there was a little girl whose birthday it was, gave her the ball.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480]  It was a whole thing.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480]  And it was the guy in the Trump hat.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.480]  Everybody wanted a picture.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.640]  So it's like I felt I'm at a ballgame.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.800]  Usually that's not my political element.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.200]  I'm just there with friends.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:53.720]  And now it's, oh, wow, it's like, hey, like everybody here knows what I know.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.700]  Everybody here understands what I understand.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.900]  Everybody here is getting it.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.380]  Wow.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.380]  This is reassuring.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:04.140]  But my guess is you're experiencing that.
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:05.140]  What about your friends?
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.140]  What about your family?
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.140]  You go out.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.140]  Do you see this?
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:11.060]  I've never I have never in my life.
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.940]  So aside from let's say aside from working baseball games in a booth or something, if
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:19.620]  I'm sitting in it, I'm sitting in the stands, probably hundreds of baseball games.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:24.480]  I have never, ever heard a section of people sounding like Alex Jones before.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.840]  This weekend sure did.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.240]  So let's go to Trent in Texas to lead us off tonight.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.240]  Trent, you're on the air.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.240]  Go ahead.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:34.240]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.240]  Am I loud and clear?
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.240]  You are.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.240]  Cool.
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.320]  So basically, I had a guy working for me today.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.240]  He's the vaccine damaged his hands.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.280]  He can't feel anything.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:49.600]  It feels like either electrical burst and fire in his fingertips from it.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:56.400]  My mother, she has had cysts on her ovaries form and three strokes in just less than two
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:03.080]  years from just taking one shot and everybody that I encounter, everyone, they all don't
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:04.080]  like Joe Biden.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.080]  Nobody.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.080]  I can't.
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.200]  I couldn't find a Joe Biden voter unless he's wearing a mask.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.160]  There's two dudes that actually go to him.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160]  I guess.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.160]  Yeah, that's one way.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.400]  If they have a face mask on, they probably vote Joe Biden.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.400]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:19.400]  At the corner store around from my house, there's a guy who regularly comes in and I
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.160]  wear that, you know, mask free, have a medical condition.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.640]  And he was like, dude, what does that mean?
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.240]  I'm like, the mask is an IQ test.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.840]  If you wear it, you're not that smart.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  And I apologize.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.000]  I'm not trying to insult you, but it's a serious deal.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.080]  And the only way to you get serious change is by putting serious things in people's faces,
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:42.600]  especially if they're like you said, and everyone else is saying hypnotized or brainwashed,
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.520]  which is coincidentally what everything is right now.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.200]  And circles is really the truth.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.800]  Everything is connected from the educational system being destroyed for children.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.920]  And I'm the guy who writes the children's books, by the way.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.920]  Right on.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.800]  We met last summer.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800]  And I hope to be there again.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.720]  I have a bad ass little gift bag for you, sir.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.760]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.560]  The the 150 year plan that the Rothschild family and everybody has had for the beginning
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:17.560]  before World War Two, you know, the censorship of Nikola Tesla, which is immense.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.520]  You know, there's so much technology out there that could potentially actually make
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520]  communism work.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.520]  And I'm not a communist.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.520]  I don't believe in that crap.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.640]  I'm just saying that there's technology that could be from outer space or that exists that
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.840]  could at least make all of our lives a lot better.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.960]  No, see, but you bring up you actually bring up an important point.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.800]  And I don't want to pontificate on this too much.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.800]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.320]  It's why I say this all the time.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:45.080]  If you're if you're a communist in America, then you should love the free market system.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.080]  It's the best.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.800]  It's the best system you have to be a successful communist.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.040]  You can form your own commune.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.720]  You can form your own communist society.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:54.720]  You guys can pull the money, buy a house, whatever.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.000]  That's the best way to actually be a communist is in the free market.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.960]  But you're taking it one step further and you're just thinking pragmatically.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.360]  And this is another great response that I would love to have from or to get to liberals
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.200]  is, hey, look, if you want to talk about free health care or free this or free that or whatever,
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  I'm not for it.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.680]  I'm not for government freebies.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.680]  Nothing is free.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:21.720]  But if you start the conversation by saying, hey, we just sent two hundred billion dollars
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720]  to Ukraine.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.760]  Instead, let's bring that in domestically and help Americans.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.680]  Well, OK, now maybe you're actually speaking my language and we can do something.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.800]  But you notice that's never where the conversation begins.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.560]  It always begins with we need to take more of your money, Trent.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560]  It does.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:42.760]  Well, I don't know, we're all broke now living in Biden's America, so I don't know what they
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:43.760]  want from us.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.320]  Let's keep this business dry.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.320]  Hey, Trent, I hope we see you again.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.320]  We're going to have more details.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.320]  I got to take a call, man.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.320]  I just I got to.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320]  I got I'm going to have a ton of calls tonight.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.600]  I hope I see you at the Summerfest coming up on the weekend of August 12th, the American
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  Liberty Awards.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  We'll have more on that later.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.320]  But, Trent, I just got I can't stay with you.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.320]  We got so many calls.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.000]  Let's go to Robert in Alabama.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Go ahead.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Hey.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  I was listening to you before you took the call.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.200]  You said I want to hear what what you're seeing on the streets.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:18.520]  And I already thought of my topic, how everyone, you know, we're all Alex Jones.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.600]  And then sure enough, you said it now, anywhere you go, you hear people saying everything
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.040]  Alex Jones has been saying for, you know, two decades.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.120]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, it's like I'm sitting in a ballgame and the section, it sounds
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.960]  like I'm listening to an Alex Jones show.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.320]  Yeah.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.760]  I worked at the for the Oakland A's for four years and I had never heard anyone, especially
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:50.520]  that part of California, sound anything like a patriot or anyone who's a populist.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.400]  And, you know, it's amazing, you know, all the things that are happening would make the
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.000]  average person lose hope.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.080]  But there's so many of us opening our eyes every day and, you know.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.760]  I see it everywhere.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.000]  And look, I'm I would never ask people to do something I wouldn't do.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.400]  And I get why people don't want to walk around with a political message on their shirt.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.600]  And that's fine.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.040]  But I'm telling you, folks, now's the time to pressure test it.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.320]  Now is the time to pressure test it.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.680]  I don't walk around in a Trump hat very often.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:28.400]  In fact, the only reason I decided to wear it to the game, because I've been very proud
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.640]  of what Trump has done recently.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.000]  I like the way he's blown up the sound of freedom.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  I like the way he screened it.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.560]  I like his policy death penalty to child sex traffickers.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:39.480]  I'm like, yeah, Trump's kicking ass.
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.840]  I'm wearing my Trump hat today.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.520]  It felt good.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.760]  And then to have the response like that.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.480]  So I'm just telling you, now's the time to pressure test.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480]  Now's the time.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.960]  Now's the time to put your message out there.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.280]  Now's the time to show courage.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.000]  Now's the time to show bravery.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.360]  It's contagious.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.880]  And it's time to start the momentum now.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.520]  And I understand not everybody likes Trump and I want to vote for Trump.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.520]  That's fine.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.520]  He's going to get the nomination.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.720]  So you'll have to deal with it when that moment comes.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.160]  And I understand a lot of people like RFK Jr. and that's fine, too.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.760]  I think he's great.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.880]  Very important man to support right now, but the Democrats are going to steal it from him.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.440]  So I'm just saying, pragmatically, now's the time to do the pressure test and start wearing
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:20.000]  messages around and just getting the momentum going so that other people feel that, oh,
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  I am in the majority.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  Oh, people do think like me.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.160]  I don't I don't have to be scared to talk about this.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.160]  OK.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.160]  Thank you for the call, Robert.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.520]  Apparently, I got something going on with Sean in England here.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.280]  The crew's telling me I need to jump to Sean.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.840]  So, Sean, what is the situation you have?
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.280]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.520]  You don't need to be, especially I just I want to answer the subject you put out about
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.400]  about how awake people are and give you the side of the view from over here.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:47.320]  And of course, we've got we've got idiots running around with a horse.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.320]  Just stop oil.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.320]  Please just stop.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.320]  Yeah.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.320]  OK, so how bad is that?
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.680]  Because, I mean, I see four or five videos a day where they're getting dragged off the
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.680]  street.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.200]  Well, yeah, this is the kind of thing that's going to mean people become more awake because
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.560]  it's pushing all the wrong buttons.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.480]  And there is a small minority of people that go along with that.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.680]  And they are very disruptive and they are extremely unpopular.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.280]  And even I may even lead eventually to people questioning the whole climate question itself.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:14.520]  But just stop oil might actually achieve the biggest defeat.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.440]  And then people may realize that the whole thing is a scam because of what they're doing.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.960]  But that is waking more people up.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  Definitely.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.520]  I think generally we're probably getting to the limit both here and over there of how many
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.520]  people you can wake up.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.240]  If you're not going to wake up now in this environment.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:36.760]  Well, I saw I saw that the conservative parties in Spain are barnstorming right now and making
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.000]  big headway.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.600]  And I saw the same thing in Europe and in Germany, where there's a famous soccer player
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.600]  that they're going after.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.480]  Oziel right now, who had some tattoo on his chest and they're saying, oh, my gosh, he's
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.480]  a conservative.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.560]  He's he's right wing.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560]  We have to destroy him.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560]  I mean, who knows?
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.840]  These people freak out at sidewalk talk.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.360]  So that just shows there is a threat to the leftist power structure everywhere.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.080]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:09.720]  high quality bone broth there is concentrated chicken broth, patented, amazing.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:15.760]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of bee pollen, a gigantic dose of highest
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.080]  quality turmeric.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.120]  And then it just gets crazier from there.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.400]  It's about to sell out.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.880]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.960]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.560]  sell out.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:04.800]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.960]  children drinking that.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.720]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:17.720]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.000]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.360]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy, best water filter system out there
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.560]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:34.240]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.240]  two or three times.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.120]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.360]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.360]  leading competitor.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:48.800]  When the media says we're bad and a cult, we're telling you you should filter your water.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.520]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.560]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.680]  The point is you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back

[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.440]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.880]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:35.000]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  it.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.480]  It is the super fuel.
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.960]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.960]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.960]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:46.240]  They go good with this, but this is the king Kong.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.240]  This is the boss.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:58.440]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.160]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:03.920]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:04.920]  defeated.
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:08.640]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop, but one thing you can
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.280]  do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.320]  that you drink and that you cook with, and you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.720]  filter out there.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:21.920]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.600]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.920]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.200]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:35.160]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on

[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.800]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.760]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.440]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.080]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[01:46:58.050 --> 01:47:08.050]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.290 --> 01:47:24.490]  We're going to take a couple more calls here, then Harrison Smith is going to join me in
[01:47:24.490 --> 01:47:25.490]  studio.
[01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:28.530]  We're going to talk about Elon Musk changing Twitter's name and logo.
[01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:31.850]  We're going to talk about, should we impeach Joe Biden?
[01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:35.970]  I say yes, but it needs to be very methodical, very strategic.
[01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:38.769]  I'll explain that as well, as well as some other news.
[01:47:38.769 --> 01:47:39.769]  We will take calls as well.
[01:47:39.769 --> 01:47:44.970]  I'm going to take calls the rest of this segment, and then we'll do calls as well with Harrison
[01:47:44.970 --> 01:47:48.250]  after we chop it up.
[01:47:48.250 --> 01:47:52.730]  Let's go back to the phone lines here, and let's go to Brandon in North Dakota.
[01:47:52.730 --> 01:47:53.970]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:54.970]  Go ahead.
[01:47:54.970 --> 01:47:55.970]  Hey, Owen.
[01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:56.970]  You there?
[01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:57.970]  Yes.
[01:47:57.970 --> 01:47:58.970]  We have you.
[01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:59.970]  Hey, bud.
[01:47:59.970 --> 01:48:00.970]  Greetings to you.
[01:48:00.970 --> 01:48:02.610]  Greetings to Harrison and Alex as well.
[01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:03.610]  Long-time listener.
[01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:04.610]  First-time caller.
[01:48:04.610 --> 01:48:09.250]  Big fan of the show and the store, TurboForce Plus all the way.
[01:48:09.250 --> 01:48:14.290]  Just wanted to give you some feedback on ... It was up to the Minot State Fair, or North Dakota
[01:48:14.290 --> 01:48:16.650]  State Fair, Minot, North Dakota yesterday.
[01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:23.250]  Two very positive responses to the Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt, a couple fist bumps
[01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:24.250]  and all that.
[01:48:24.250 --> 01:48:30.410]  Then, just to recap, I was wearing the same shirt at the Independence Day Parade, Mandan,
[01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:36.850]  North Dakota, and took a mini frisbee to the groin, which had a little bit of humor
[01:48:36.850 --> 01:48:37.850]  to that.
[01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:42.290]  You didn't have to admit that.
[01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:46.210]  But all in all, some positive, some negative.
[01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:51.210]  But yeah, that's how I try to make it quick and succinct, but again, just appreciate all
[01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:52.210]  you guys do.
[01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:53.690]  Just keep on rocking the free world.
[01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:56.410]  I do have a guest suggestion, if you wouldn't mind bouncing me over.
[01:48:56.410 --> 01:48:59.250]  Well, you obviously ... You're a listener of Infowars.
[01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:00.370]  You wore the Alex Jones shirt.
[01:49:00.370 --> 01:49:01.370]  You use our supplements.
[01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:07.530]  So obviously, your groin area is a large target, so we can understand why the mini-disc ... I
[01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:08.530]  can relate.
[01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:09.530]  But yeah.
[01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:10.530]  No, go ahead.
[01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:15.330]  Oh, I just have one guest suggestion, if you wouldn't mind parking me with some folks that
[01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:17.250]  could take that info.
[01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:24.050]  It was an individual that was highlighted back in April, just a deal that Alex highlighted.
[01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:27.090]  And who is it again?
[01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:30.410]  It was an Instagram profile gal called ValorForFreedom.
[01:49:30.410 --> 01:49:36.930]  She did a little blurb on ... She had a video on the appeal, and I think she'd be an awesome
[01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:41.130]  person to have on as just a guest, whether it be Zoom call or whichever, but just throwing
[01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:42.130]  that out there.
[01:49:42.130 --> 01:49:43.130]  All right.
[01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:46.690]  The crew will take note of that, and we'll see if we can make that happen, Brandon.
[01:49:46.690 --> 01:49:47.690]  Thank you for the call.
[01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:50.050]  Let's go to John in Florida now.
[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:53.130]  Oh, there's two ... We have two Johns in Florida.
[01:49:53.130 --> 01:49:54.130]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:55.570]  I did not mean to gaslight the other John.
[01:49:55.570 --> 01:49:56.970]  I'll take you next then.
[01:49:56.970 --> 01:49:57.970]  That's John in Florida.
[01:49:57.970 --> 01:49:58.970]  Go ahead.
[01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:59.970]  Me first.
[01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:00.970]  You're up.
[01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:01.970]  Is he there?
[01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:02.970]  Yeah.
[01:50:02.970 --> 01:50:03.970]  Hey, Owen.
[01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:04.970]  Yeah.
[01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:08.970]  I just want to talk to you about Trump and all the ... I guess I would say it's the Stockholm
[01:50:08.970 --> 01:50:11.330]  syndrome and all the Trump supporters.
[01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:12.330]  I voted for him.
[01:50:12.330 --> 01:50:13.330]  I went to his rallies.
[01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:15.410]  My whole family voted for him.
[01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:22.650]  But when I see what the guy produced, which was nothing less of just mediocre D-minus,
[01:50:22.650 --> 01:50:27.970]  I would say, in his presidency, he said he was going to get to the bottom of 9-11.
[01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:32.090]  He said he was going to do something about the deep state, and none of that really ever
[01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:33.090]  occurred.
[01:50:33.090 --> 01:50:34.850]  And then when I hear Patrick Burns come out ...
[01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:36.890]  Well, let me just stop right there.
[01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:38.530]  Let me just respond one second at a time.
[01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:41.610]  I don't think it's fair to say that Trump did nothing to the deep state.
[01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:47.410]  If nothing means totally exposing them, well, then he totally exposed them.
[01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:51.410]  And to say ... If you want to give Trump's presidency a D-minus, then that's fine.
[01:50:51.410 --> 01:50:54.530]  But here's the thing that's completely undeniable.
[01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:58.269]  The economy under Trump was much better, and that means so much for the average American.
[01:50:58.269 --> 01:51:00.890]  That means so much for our prosperity and our future.
[01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:04.290]  That alone is something that is noteworthy.
[01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:07.530]  I understand why people might not want to vote Trump or have a sour taste in their mouth
[01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:15.769]  for Trump, but I'm just a pragmatic person, and he's the best shot we got right now.
[01:51:15.769 --> 01:51:17.970]  And I understand that, and I know where it comes from.
[01:51:17.970 --> 01:51:25.410]  And like I saw, I saw reports of him taking 388 days on vacation out of one administration
[01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:26.730]  and all the money it costs.
[01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:27.890]  And I don't care about the money.
[01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:30.650]  He raked in billions of dollars from China.
[01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.690]  There's no contention on that.
[01:51:32.690 --> 01:51:37.690]  But the fact of the matter is when you've got him pushing these vaccines, you've got
[01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:43.210]  him going berserk and saying he took the booster on O'Reilly's show and all that.
[01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:48.610]  And then you got Byrne saying, that was on Alex the other day, hey, listen, we gave him
[01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:49.610]  the layout.
[01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:50.610]  He could have done this.
[01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:51.610]  He could have done.
[01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:52.610]  He could have stopped the elections.
[01:51:52.610 --> 01:51:53.610]  He could have had a full recount.
[01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:55.610]  He could have redone the elections.
[01:51:55.610 --> 01:51:57.930]  He didn't do anything about that.
[01:51:57.930 --> 01:52:00.530]  All he's worried about is just, I guess, hype.
[01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:02.610]  He says he's going to lock Joe Biden up now.
[01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:05.290]  What happened to the last one he said he was going to lock up?
[01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:07.170]  Well, I would just say this.
[01:52:07.170 --> 01:52:11.650]  If Trump does none of that, but at least gives us a good economy again for four years, then
[01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:15.690]  it's still worth it to me, because, again, like I said, from a pragmatic standpoint,
[01:52:15.690 --> 01:52:17.770]  I just don't see any other option.
[01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:21.050]  Well, I mean, RFK sounds good.
[01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:23.570]  I just don't trust the Democrat Party.
[01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:24.570]  And exactly.
[01:52:24.570 --> 01:52:27.410]  They're never going to let him get in on the Democrat ticket.
[01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:29.650]  And he's not popular enough to win third party.
[01:52:29.650 --> 01:52:31.250]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:35.690]  I think hands down, Trump's going to win it in a landslide as far as the nomination.
[01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:40.490]  But I mean, if they took it from him and he had the opportunity back then, that's called
[01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:41.630]  drain in the swamp.
[01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:47.710]  Let me just ask you this, then, because there's no denying what you're saying is true, obviously.
[01:52:47.710 --> 01:52:52.670]  Now, let's say Trump gets back in there.
[01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:57.630]  And actually does arrest people and actually does do some of the stuff that he said he was
[01:52:57.630 --> 01:52:59.030]  going to do and didn't.
[01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.990]  I mean, do you think there's any chance of that?
[01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:03.270]  Do you have any hope that that's the case?
[01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:06.670]  Are you just saying, nope, no chance, no hope, never going to happen?
[01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:10.309]  Yeah, as far as him actually doing something about it now.
[01:53:13.150 --> 01:53:13.750]  You have no faith.
[01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:19.910]  No, no, I mean, I'm just saying, I mean, if he wins again, I mean, you almost have to.
[01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:24.470]  I mean, he's got to come up with more about talking about Hunter and this and that.
[01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:26.590]  I want to hear what he's actually going to do.
[01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:28.670]  I mean, we've already heard the rhetoric and all that.
[01:53:28.670 --> 01:53:32.150]  And I know politics, you got to say something.
[01:53:32.150 --> 01:53:39.150]  But when I heard that Burns interview with Alex Jones the other day, and he was with
[01:53:39.150 --> 01:53:43.910]  Sidney and they were all sitting down, they all had it laid out of what to do.
[01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:48.070]  And the guy basically allows January 6th to happen.
[01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:51.670]  And Trump has to make his own decisions, whether they're good or bad.
[01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:52.870]  He makes his own decisions.
[01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:56.030]  And that can't be said for many people in Washington, D.C.
[01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:57.510]  So that alone, I feel is a positive.
[01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:58.590]  I understand the frustration.
[01:53:58.590 --> 01:54:00.630]  Believe me, I get the frustration.
[01:54:00.630 --> 01:54:03.470]  I think Trump made the decision where he said, you know what, I'm not going to be the
[01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:04.550]  one that does this.
[01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:08.790]  If I if I stand up for the stolen election or whatever, it's just going to cause more
[01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:10.150]  problems.
[01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:12.150]  That's the decision he made, whether it's good or bad.
[01:54:12.150 --> 01:54:13.150]  That's the decision he made.
[01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:15.670]  And so now now here we are.
[01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:16.670]  John, thank you for the call.
[01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:18.710]  Let's go to the other John in Florida.
[01:54:18.710 --> 01:54:20.190]  We had a bit of a confusion here.
[01:54:20.190 --> 01:54:21.750]  This is the other John in Florida.
[01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:22.750]  John Florida.
[01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:23.750]  Go ahead.
[01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:24.750]  Hi, Owen.
[01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:25.750]  This is John.
[01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:26.750]  I'm calling from Northport, Florida.
[01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:31.190]  I live in a Democrat city.
[01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:36.390]  The person that works for used to work for Obama is now our city manager.
[01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:39.630]  And we have mostly all Democrats that are running our city.
[01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:43.590]  What happened to us last year was a nightmare for myself and my wife.
[01:54:43.590 --> 01:54:49.270]  My wife was headbutted and a man pulled a gun at her head for taking four pictures of
[01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:53.490]  a drainage pipe near right next right next to our house.
[01:54:53.490 --> 01:54:57.930]  We called the police department for help on a 911 call.
[01:54:57.930 --> 01:55:01.170]  The police come and they never helped us.
[01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:03.370]  I have them all on body cam.
[01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:09.170]  They called my wife, but you know, I hate to say it, but a slut on body cam.
[01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:13.770]  And it was a nightmare for myself and my wife.
[01:55:13.770 --> 01:55:15.650]  And the police never helped us.
[01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:17.809]  We have all the proof, all the documentation.
[01:55:17.809 --> 01:55:23.010]  They wrote up a false report to make us look like the bad people, because I still believe
[01:55:23.010 --> 01:55:26.330]  because where I live and we don't have no police record.
[01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:27.330]  My wife was never arrested.
[01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:30.370]  She never had a speeding ticket, nothing.
[01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:32.050]  And it's a sad situation.
[01:55:32.050 --> 01:55:38.410]  We just bought a shotgun, a double barrel shotgun to protect, you know, to protect us because
[01:55:38.410 --> 01:55:40.250]  we can't call the police.
[01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:43.890]  Then we come to find out it's not just me, it's other people.
[01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:48.730]  There's six police officers going to court this year in Tampa, Florida, where they let
[01:55:48.730 --> 01:55:51.170]  a dog rip a guy's arm off.
[01:55:51.170 --> 01:55:54.370]  And they text about it and they were happy about it, that they did this.
[01:55:54.370 --> 01:55:55.370]  All right.
[01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:58.170]  Well, you got a bit of a problem there.
[01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:02.250]  I'll explain why I'm asking this, but are you are you black or are you white or are you
[01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:03.250]  Mexican or what?
[01:56:03.250 --> 01:56:04.250]  What is your ethnicity?
[01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:06.330]  What's your skin color?
[01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:07.330]  I'm a white male.
[01:56:07.330 --> 01:56:09.570]  I hope that's your problem.
[01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:10.570]  And I'm a Trump supporter.
[01:56:10.570 --> 01:56:11.570]  Yeah.
[01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:12.570]  Oh, geez.
[01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:13.570]  Oh, geez.
[01:56:13.570 --> 01:56:14.570]  Yeah.
[01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:15.570]  Yeah.
[01:56:15.570 --> 01:56:16.570]  You're not.
[01:56:16.570 --> 01:56:17.570]  No.
[01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.570]  No.
[01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:19.570]  See, because here's the thing.
[01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:23.410]  And you brought this story to the liberal media or some liberal attorney.
[01:56:23.410 --> 01:56:27.890]  They would make it a top story and say how you got abused and your wife was, you know,
[01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:28.890]  shamed or whatever.
[01:56:28.890 --> 01:56:30.170]  You know, look at this racism.
[01:56:30.170 --> 01:56:33.410]  But because you're white, you need to just shut up, OK?
[01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:34.410]  Yeah.
[01:56:34.410 --> 01:56:37.050]  It's a sad situation.
[01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:38.050]  And I can't.
[01:56:38.050 --> 01:56:39.050]  You know, we keep fighting.
[01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:40.050]  We keep fighting.
[01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:43.250]  But, you know, they just just two months ago, they threw a woman down.
[01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:44.250]  They choked the woman.
[01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:46.010]  They threw her down to the ground.
[01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:48.130]  And it's it's just going to continue.
[01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:51.130]  No, I'm telling you, we've been talking about this, John.
[01:56:51.130 --> 01:56:52.130]  Thank you for the call.
[01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:56.290]  It's I mean, look, I'm not trying to be all doom and gloom.
[01:56:56.290 --> 01:56:59.610]  And I can still go out in Austin, Texas and get a nice steak dinner.
[01:56:59.610 --> 01:57:01.490]  And, you know, I don't have to experience too much.
[01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:03.450]  I mean, I'm probably see a homeless guy naked.
[01:57:03.450 --> 01:57:08.690]  I'm probably going to get panhandled five times and probably see, you know, four cop cars pulling
[01:57:08.690 --> 01:57:09.690]  people over.
[01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:11.410]  But I mean, I can still go out to dinner and enjoy a night.
[01:57:11.410 --> 01:57:17.250]  But it's just man, these Democrat run cities, folks, they really are becoming Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:20.290]  I'm telling you, it's it's insane.
[01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:25.490]  We'll talk more about that with Harrison Smith coming up in studio.
[01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:29.090]  Sunday Night Live coming up right here on Banned Out Video.
[01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:30.090]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:31.090]  Harrison Smith joining me in studio.
[01:57:31.090 --> 01:57:33.250]  Remember, folks, InfowarsStore.com.
