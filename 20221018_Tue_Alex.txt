[00:00.000 --> 00:18.800]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.960 --> 00:36.960]  I've never done more of a vaccine. Allow people access to a vaccine, an approved vaccine,
[00:38.240 --> 00:43.520]  without getting liability protected. Now the the emergency use authorization vaccines
[00:45.200 --> 00:51.840]  have liability protection under the PREP Act and the CARES Act. So as long as you take an emergency
[00:51.840 --> 01:01.440]  use, you can't sue them. Once they get approved, now you can sue them, unless they can get it
[01:01.440 --> 01:08.400]  recommended for children. What? Because all vaccines that are recommended, officially recommended
[01:08.400 --> 01:15.120]  for children, get it liability protection, even if an adult gets that vaccine. That's why they're
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.000]  going after kids. They know this is going to kill an injured, a huge number of children,
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.520]  but they need to do it for the liability protection.
[01:28.720 --> 01:32.480]  But of course, they want to kill children. That's why they did it in the beginning,
[01:32.480 --> 01:36.880]  and why they put liability protection in. But yes, here it is from the CDC's own
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.360]  globalist website, cdc.gov, the captured federal government at war, the American people.
[01:43.360 --> 01:50.400]  CDC expands updated COVID-19 vaccines to include children ages five through 11.
[01:57.280 --> 02:03.440]  So this is the big issue. This is the giant 50-foot vampire in the living room.
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.680]  And I've got so much news to deal with that issue today. Also, the next phase of the war on speech
[02:11.680 --> 02:17.600]  we warned you of is here. We'll be laying that out. The next target is, of course,
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.000]  Kanye West, George Floyd's family threatens to sue. Kanye, we're telling the truth about his death.
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.080]  Whether it's right or wrong, the coroner said it was probably fentanyl, not the knee on the head.
[02:31.920 --> 02:36.720]  It doesn't matter. The Democrat Party lawyers said that they're going to use the Alex Jones
[02:36.720 --> 02:43.120]  exception and take him out next with a rigged case and a rigged jury after Kanye's defaulted.
[02:44.160 --> 02:51.920]  So he can't defend himself. So that's how they roll. I tell you, this is such a disgraceful
[02:51.920 --> 02:58.800]  statement by the disgraced former FBI official who tried to overturn the 2016 election with fraud.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.840]  We even have his text messages where he said, I'll never allow Trump to become president.
[03:03.840 --> 03:06.880]  And once it happened, he said, now we're going to remove him. We're going to stop him
[03:06.880 --> 03:14.800]  with the fake dossier and all the rest of it. Peter Strock has now gone on national television
[03:14.800 --> 03:19.360]  and said something even worse than what Chuck E. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi set up for January 6.
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.960]  Remember, they said, this is the worst attack in U.S. history, worse than 9-11 and Pearl Harbor.
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.560]  Now, 9-11, he says, doesn't even compare. Here it is.
[03:32.560 --> 03:38.560]  Can you look at something that is an attack on democracy, something that could actually bring
[03:38.560 --> 03:44.160]  about a fundamental change to American governance as we understand it? 9-11 is nothing compared
[03:44.160 --> 03:48.960]  to January 6. And the fact that the FBI and the rest of the government, if they are not on the
[03:48.960 --> 03:55.760]  same sort of war footing that we were on in the weeks and months and years after 9-11, shame on
[03:55.760 --> 04:02.800]  everyone. So this is a guy that not only helped run the Russia hoax to overturn an election
[04:03.360 --> 04:09.200]  and an impeachment in the whole nine yards, so he is what he says we're doing. He says
[04:10.880 --> 04:16.240]  that 9-11 doesn't even compare. 3,000 dead people, firemen and police dying in mass,
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.120]  people jumping off the top of the burning building, it collapsing.
[04:19.120 --> 04:27.360]  3,000 dead, hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to the world economy, absolute tens of
[04:27.360 --> 04:34.880]  thousands dying later from the poison dust, that is nothing, nothing. The gaslighting of
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.040]  these people is just incredible. So I'm bad for saying maybe Sandy Hook didn't happen years ago.
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.680]  They said, oh, you belittled the deaths not happening, you owe a billion dollars, but he says,
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.920]  the deaths happened, but they're nothing. But under the Hurt Feelings Rule,
[04:49.920 --> 05:16.240]  Peter Strock owes the families of 9-11 victims quadrillions. They'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:20.240 --> 05:29.520]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.960]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system. So X3, despite the fact
[05:34.960 --> 05:43.520]  there's a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now at infowarstore.com and it funds
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.480]  the info war, which is a 360 win. If you've not experienced the power of iodine, takes two weeks
[05:48.480 --> 05:57.280]  to kick out on average, you've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off. X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[06:18.480 --> 06:44.800]  It is Tuesday, October 18th, 2022.
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.080]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here live for the next four hours
[06:50.080 --> 06:53.520]  for the most censored attack demonized program in the world because we're pro-family,
[06:53.520 --> 07:00.800]  pro-America, pro-God, pro-justice, pro-self-defense, pro-capitalism, pro-humanity,
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.880]  and I am honored to be the most hated, probably the most hated person in the world
[07:06.880 --> 07:09.200]  by the pedophiles, by the Satanists, by the globalists.
[07:09.200 --> 07:16.000]  Yes, they think of the bringer of death against humanity and their great new population,
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.280]  but the trap that the New World Order has laid for us will be the pick
[07:19.280 --> 07:22.800]  in which they are buried in the ash heap of history.
[07:25.840 --> 07:31.280]  It is not Satan that is the bringer of death, it is God that controls life and death,
[07:31.280 --> 07:41.440]  creation and destruction. It is Azrael, the angel of death that delivers death under the orders of God.
[07:41.440 --> 07:55.600]  Azrael works for God, not Satan.
[08:12.160 --> 08:22.000]  All right, thank you for joining us. Let me tell you what's coming up today. Boy, there's a lot
[08:23.600 --> 08:27.440]  as the New World Order pretends that they control life and death and commit mass murder
[08:27.440 --> 08:34.240]  that they'll be punished for greatly. CDC is quietly slipping it in to go after newborn babies
[08:34.240 --> 08:38.800]  with poisoned injections, not just six months old and up, and to make it mandatory in public
[08:38.800 --> 08:43.520]  schools under federal regulations to inject five-year-olds and up with the experimental
[08:43.520 --> 08:47.760]  death shot. No other country on earth is doing this. Everybody else is banning the shots
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.560]  hell of a year ago. European countries started banning it. As of a month ago, more than half
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.920]  of them have banned it, but they're just moving forward, attacking us, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:58.720 --> 09:04.240]  And the media spends it, the corporate enemy of America, as if it's a good thing. And they're
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.360]  now available to you. Now, the school is going to say it's on the list of mandatory, but that's a
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.600]  fraud, too, under law. It's not really mandatory. They're just saying that it's what they want you
[09:13.600 --> 09:18.640]  to take. The waivers are not to get around a law. They just trick you into signing the waivers.
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.560]  Come out of Babylon, my friends. We're going to hit the massive new developments with the situation
[09:24.560 --> 09:30.960]  in Ukraine as we sleepwalk into World War III. It's posted on the front page of infowars.com.
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.360]  We've written an article about it. It broke here yesterday. Francis Boyle, who's introduced
[09:36.160 --> 09:42.800]  legislation that's become impeachments before, big time law professor, has written Biden impeachment
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.680]  bill. And it's circulating on Capitol Hill in response to World War III threat. I hope everybody
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.960]  goes infowars.com against the article that has a link and a copy of the impeachment legislation.
[09:54.960 --> 09:58.720]  And we'll play a clip of Tulsi Gabbard's coming up next segment. Again, we already played it on
[09:58.720 --> 10:05.680]  Friday and Saturday on Sunday, but it's important where she says the Democrats are a power cult
[10:05.680 --> 10:14.400]  of warmongers. And that is absolutely what they are. They are a cult. And if you like living,
[10:15.360 --> 10:19.200]  and you don't like dying, and if you like being successful and having a future,
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.960]  you need to battle with every ounce of your energy and time to stop these monsters.
[10:24.960 --> 10:31.680]  We have the economy news that is insane. We're going to be laying out as well. The attacks
[10:33.120 --> 10:39.920]  on free speech. We have the latest move by the deep state psychos to sterilize children.
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.920]  Virginia Democrat wants to criminalize parents who misgender their children. So the school treks
[10:45.920 --> 10:49.760]  your six-year-old to think they're really a boy or a girl when they're a girl or a boy.
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.880]  They trick them to think they're another gender. They create that mark in their record, begin
[10:54.880 --> 10:59.280]  special propaganda and rainwashing for them. The removing of your parental rights and control,
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.000]  using the rebellion your child will have later as a teenager to be sterilized because mommy said
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.040]  it wasn't their right to do it. It was a bad idea. Daddy did. She wants you locked up if you get
[11:09.040 --> 11:16.480]  between them and the pedophilic, sicko government that wants to rape your children's bodies to
[11:16.480 --> 11:22.720]  the point of massive mutilation. So these Satanists are in overdrive right now. We've got a lot of
[11:22.720 --> 11:29.920]  big election news as well and so much more. So when I hit this story, it's not our top story,
[11:30.880 --> 11:37.360]  but more and more I want to start the show or soon into the broadcast early in
[11:38.880 --> 11:45.360]  to just give an example of gaslighting every day. Yesterday it was the Kenosha killer saying he's
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.800]  not the Kenosha killer and doesn't know that person is. Darryl Brooks doesn't exist. And Biden's
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.080]  saying we've got one hell of an economy right now. You're best ever. I wanted to hit this first
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.440]  today. It's extremely illustrative and we'll play the full clip now. I already played a little
[12:01.440 --> 12:08.320]  short clip at the very start. Disgraced former FBI official declares 911 is nothing compared
[12:08.320 --> 12:14.080]  to January 6th. That is a quote. Let me just read slowly to let it sink in a little bit
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.920]  because I got up this morning at 5am and there's just been updated info wars and I said I got to
[12:19.920 --> 12:26.160]  watch the clip and I went and sure as hell Steve Watson doesn't exaggerate. He actually said
[12:26.880 --> 12:39.120]  word for word. Let me read it slowly. 911 is nothing compared to January 6th. 911
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.520]  killed at least 3,000 people that day. It's estimated last time I checked that more than 10,000 people
[12:45.520 --> 12:54.480]  died early including police dogs die within a year. But within just the first few years 10,000 plus
[12:54.480 --> 13:00.560]  people from the deadly inhalation of the powdered glass and concrete and toxins computer parts
[13:00.560 --> 13:11.280]  you name it. So conservatively 13,000 people have died and it hit the world economy for probably
[13:11.280 --> 13:28.560]  trillions. No one can estimate that. So we saw Chuck E. Schumer say this is worse than 911.
[13:28.560 --> 13:34.240]  Worse than 911 and as bad as Pearl Harbor. We've led the quotes many times. You know he said that
[13:34.240 --> 13:43.760]  I'm not going to bore you with this horrible voice. But now Peter Strock has to go on further and say
[13:45.040 --> 13:53.200]  that it's nothing. It's nothing compared to a million people showing up in DC peacefully
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.280]  and a bunch of federal provocateurs and others manipulating a few hundred to break through
[13:57.280 --> 14:05.760]  the small police line and go in and poop on Pelosi's walls. Oh and drink her beer and then
[14:05.760 --> 14:13.680]  the cops killed four citizens. So four citizens got killed. A few hundred broke in. A few thousand
[14:13.680 --> 14:19.520]  got waved in. I tried to stop them. I got there an hour into it and that is the worst attack
[14:19.520 --> 14:28.400]  in U.S. history. Not World War One. Not World War One. We're going to break. Come back and play it.
[14:29.360 --> 14:35.120]  Not World War One. Not World War Two. Millions dead. No, no, no, no. This is the worst attack
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.240]  ever. This is an attack on our institutions and our government.
[14:40.480 --> 14:44.240]  Directed by these very same people and let's just add the gravy to this.
[14:44.240 --> 14:52.240]  This is the guy and we have his text messages. We'll remind you with them. We'll show you it
[14:52.240 --> 14:58.640]  to you in the next segment. This is the guy that he's talking to his girlfriend, the other FBI
[14:58.640 --> 15:03.520]  agent, and she says he's going to win. He goes, never will stop him with the Russian hoax. And
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.720]  then later he wins. Doesn't matter. We'll still stop him. Remember this is Mr. Insurance Policy.
[15:08.720 --> 15:14.960]  So he's actually tried to overturn an elected president with fraud that he says is the most
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.400]  evil thing you can do. And I think it is bad. It is an attempt at a coup d'etat. It is one of the
[15:20.400 --> 15:24.800]  worst things you can do because then they put a tyranny in over you, but they have done it. They
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.760]  stole the election two years ago and now they want to outlaw people questioning that. They're
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.960]  already censoring people. Trying to get the compilation, two of all his demonic faces he
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.560]  made in Congress. I want to show that when we come back. We're going to play the clip, but
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.960]  the host is calling it the worst thing in U.S. history. And then all breathlessly,
[15:42.960 --> 15:44.640]  he goes on and says, yes, it's true.
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.880]  It's the worst thing ever. But of course, the polls show nobody's buying it. And it's been
[15:54.880 --> 16:03.440]  a giant flop for these gaslighting frauds. It's our best seller. We first came out with it five
[16:03.440 --> 16:08.960]  years ago and it was a moderate seller. But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.160]  the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall
[16:14.160 --> 16:17.680]  best seller. And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[16:17.680 --> 16:23.600]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[16:23.600 --> 16:28.480]  function of the body. It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential
[16:28.480 --> 16:34.000]  vitamins that you need to live and be healthy. Essential means without these things, you die.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.960]  And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment. It is critical
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.360]  to bolster our body defenses with a product like this. Now, there are other great vitamin
[16:43.360 --> 16:48.160]  mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.040]  the info war. So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.560]  finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 50% off. Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock
[16:58.560 --> 17:06.640]  infowarstore.com. Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and
[17:06.640 --> 17:12.080]  think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together. This family
[17:12.080 --> 17:18.960]  that is info wars. Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[17:18.960 --> 17:27.120]  Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing
[17:27.120 --> 17:33.840]  up their main base to defeat the new world order. The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[17:34.640 --> 17:39.760]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this
[17:39.760 --> 17:47.280]  show. I don't take the credit. I give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[17:47.280 --> 17:53.040]  It isn't going to give up. Without your support we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com
[17:53.040 --> 18:14.960]  today and donate for our legal defense fund. Well it's the same thing for America and the rest of
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.320]  the world. When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live
[18:20.320 --> 18:24.720]  and people don't listen and they don't supplement it's literally an intervention.
[18:24.720 --> 18:30.640]  I lead an incredibly stressful life. I don't play with Mr. Health but if I wasn't taking products
[18:30.640 --> 18:37.920]  like x3 from info wars.com I could not continue to do what I'm doing today. The energy, the stamina,

[19:01.360 --> 19:09.200]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very
[19:09.200 --> 19:15.200]  heights of politics not just in America but the world. We are engaging the globalists at point
[19:15.200 --> 19:21.280]  like range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit. Yes I persevered but the
[19:21.280 --> 19:26.000]  listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason you've had the success.
[19:26.720 --> 19:32.160]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[19:32.160 --> 19:39.600]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever
[19:39.600 --> 19:43.920]  realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing
[19:43.920 --> 19:50.960]  out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to intensify
[19:50.960 --> 19:56.160]  what you're doing now because we are over the target and this is happening. The fight is my
[19:56.160 --> 20:18.160]  fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all. We now take you live to the Central
[20:18.160 --> 20:28.800]  Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance. It is the vaunted feared Alex Jones show. The real
[20:28.800 --> 20:35.120]  power of this broadcast is you. The viewer and listener that's who the enemy hates. That's why
[20:35.120 --> 20:39.680]  they want to take us off the air so this focal point of resistance they believe can be dissipated
[20:39.680 --> 20:49.600]  but let me give our enemies a clue. We've already damaged them irrevocably. Everything else we do
[20:49.600 --> 21:01.360]  against them with this platform is only gravy. Now let's talk about a real piece of trash.
[21:02.640 --> 21:06.880]  Peter Schrock is the archetypal example. Let's put some of the sickening mural of him up in
[21:06.880 --> 21:11.680]  Congress and the weird satanic faces he was making of everything we face in the permanent
[21:11.680 --> 21:18.320]  bureaucracy and deep state of the type of guys that were like Eddie Haskell in high school that
[21:18.320 --> 21:22.880]  wanted to be the class president but would rip you off anytime they could. They believe if they
[21:22.880 --> 21:26.320]  can just get into the FBI and the Justice Department they can be above the law and
[21:26.320 --> 21:32.400]  community crimes they want. He has caught red-handed trying to remove a duly elected president.
[21:32.400 --> 21:39.280]  Then he turns around and accuses a million people that come to DC being terrorists and in this clip
[21:39.280 --> 21:48.080]  at the end says this needs to be a mobilization like the war on terror and 9-11 to stop these
[21:48.080 --> 21:55.920]  people. So he declares authoritarian war just like oh Biden did a month and a half ago an
[21:55.920 --> 22:02.720]  independence hall in Philadelphia with the blood-red speech. So he declares war on America, says we
[22:02.720 --> 22:08.560]  need to have the entire deep state come down against the American people and the CIA and the FBI
[22:08.560 --> 22:16.880]  tag team us and 9-11's nothing compared to somebody drinking Pelosi's beer and pooping on the walls
[22:16.880 --> 22:23.680]  and a guy in a buffalo outfit running around yelling and saying yes sir and yes ma'am to the
[22:23.680 --> 22:31.840]  police and then the cops kill four people. With Ray Epps now in Pelosi's daughter's documentary
[22:31.840 --> 22:36.240]  leading everybody in and climbing the scaffolding and saying invade. Now we have footage of him
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.320]  ramming the police with barricades and they call him a wonderful person in the New York Times.
[22:40.320 --> 22:45.600]  These people are so obvious. So they try to overturn the election criminally, try to have
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.360]  multiple impeachments. Peter Strucks involved in all of it, he's disgraced and it's emblematic
[22:51.360 --> 22:55.120]  that he then gets up on television. This is part of the course but it's Peter Strucks
[22:56.320 --> 23:03.040]  and says we need to have a war on terror on Trump supporters which just means populist Americans
[23:03.040 --> 23:06.560]  that have their heads screwed on straight because the numbers are coming in. I saw,
[23:06.560 --> 23:16.800]  got some polls here, a 30 point swing in women 18 to 64 working age women. That means white,
[23:16.800 --> 23:23.200]  black, Hispanic, Asian. Women see the crime, they see the depression, they see the insanity,
[23:23.200 --> 23:27.920]  they see Biden groping everybody, they see Hunter Biden, they see the open borders
[23:29.280 --> 23:36.480]  and what do they do? What do they do? They go and they say I'm going to vote Republican.
[23:36.480 --> 23:40.640]  Not that that's perfect but that's the insurrection to at least take over one of the parties
[23:40.640 --> 23:44.640]  that we're doing politically lawfully. That's why they're in panic. That's why they're saying
[23:44.640 --> 23:48.720]  outlaws. That's why they bet everything on January 6th but the national polls are out.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.360]  Less than 6% of Americans in multiple polls. It's like four, five, three, two. I mean I saw one
[23:55.360 --> 24:02.000]  poll 6%. So the highest poll where they ask a bunch of questions, what do you think's most important?
[24:02.560 --> 24:12.400]  The economy, war in Ukraine and then they'll put in there January 6th and less than 10%
[24:12.400 --> 24:15.680]  think that's a big issue and that's total leftist cult members, the ones that run Twitter.
[24:17.280 --> 24:25.920]  So here they are trying to make it the front and center to launch these attacks
[24:28.560 --> 24:32.160]  and nobody's buying into it.
[24:35.840 --> 24:39.040]  They want to distract with the economy imploding, distract with all this
[24:39.040 --> 24:45.760]  and the crew looking just found another national poll. Oh, 7% think January 6th is the most important.
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.280]  Up at the top, price increases inflation, economy and jobs, immigration,
[24:51.280 --> 24:56.960]  crime and drugs, women's rights, healthcare, guns, environment, climate change, national debt,
[24:56.960 --> 25:02.080]  federal budget deficits, terrorism, national security, corruption, school safety, coronavirus,
[25:02.080 --> 25:12.160]  taxes, voting rights, income equality, inequality, criminal justice, the courts, prison, education,
[25:12.160 --> 25:13.600]  then January 6th.
[25:18.720 --> 25:24.320]  So here's Peter Strzok in a loaded minute and a half with the reporter reading the script
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.440]  that the most important date in American history is in George Washington finally turning the tide
[25:29.440 --> 25:36.640]  at Trenton, New Jersey. Is it Valley Forge? Is it the defeat of Hitler? Is it the invention
[25:37.200 --> 25:45.120]  of the light bulb? No. Ladies and gentlemen, it is someone drinking Pelosi's beer and pooping
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.800]  on the wall. Here it is. You know that Mueller ethos emanated I'm sure from his own personal
[25:50.800 --> 25:55.680]  code but also post 9-11 and I worked in the administration in which he served as FBI director
[25:55.680 --> 26:02.400]  and what he sort of gave birth to in the lexicon was the FBI would never again, first of all,
[26:02.400 --> 26:06.720]  fail to sync up with the CIA and all sorts of artificial and real walls were torn down
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.440]  and they would never again fail to connect the dots. I've not heard one utterance of connecting
[26:11.440 --> 26:17.440]  the dots from Christopher Wray in the days after the deadliest attack on the US Capitol in our,
[26:17.440 --> 26:23.280]  you know, in history. Nicole, I think that's right and I think if you look at the scale in
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.720]  terms of the threat to democracy, I mean 9-11 was a tragedy. We lost thousands of lives in a
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.000]  horrific way and we still mourn to this day but when you look at something that is an attack
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.880]  on democracy, something that could actually bring about a fundamental change to American
[26:38.880 --> 26:45.120]  governance as we understand it, 9-11 is nothing compared to January 6 and the fact that the FBI
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.840]  and the rest of the government, if they are not on the same sort of war footing that we were on
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.480]  in the weeks and months and years after 9-11, shame on everyone.
[26:56.560 --> 27:02.960]  Shame on everyone if we're not on a war footing against anybody that doesn't support the Democratic
[27:02.960 --> 27:08.800]  Party. What does Tulsi Gabbard's column, we have the clip, let's play it. She calls them a power cult
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.480]  of war mongers and that's what it is, here it is.
[27:14.480 --> 27:20.080]  I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that's under the complete control of an
[27:20.080 --> 27:27.200]  elitist cabal of war mongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing
[27:27.200 --> 27:34.240]  every issue and stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.320]  that are enshrined in our Constitution, who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality,
[27:40.320 --> 27:45.520]  who demonize the police but protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans,
[27:46.080 --> 27:50.960]  who believe in open borders, who weaponize the national security state to go after their
[27:50.960 --> 27:57.120]  political opponents, and above all, who are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.240]  Now, I believe in a government that's of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[28:04.240 --> 28:11.440]  Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not. Instead, it stands for a government that is of,
[28:11.440 --> 28:18.960]  by, and for the powerful elite. Now, I'm calling on my fellow common sense independent-minded
[28:18.960 --> 28:25.680]  Democrats to join me in leaving the Democratic Party. If you can no longer stomach the direction
[28:25.680 --> 28:32.080]  that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues are taking our country, I invite you to join me.
[28:32.080 --> 28:42.160]  I'm here to tell you, folks, that a DeSantis Gabbard's ticket would be unbeatable. And she's
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.280]  for real, folks. She's not perfect. They'll say, oh, well, she went to the Davos thing. They all
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.000]  do. I mean, Trump's been to that. But she's been fully against that now. And she is getting women
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.880]  big time to vote Republican. She's good, folks. She's awesome. She's got a soul. We'll get right
[28:54.880 --> 29:03.520]  back. Stay with us. I don't promote things unless they really work. When it comes to politics or
[29:03.520 --> 29:09.600]  culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge in the tip of the spear. And when we talk about

[33:05.600 --> 33:07.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:07.600 --> 33:26.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[33:37.600 --> 33:57.600]  Tomorrow, we are going to have on the broadcast the directors and filmmakers for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new film, and I'm told this is stunningly powerful.
[33:57.600 --> 34:08.600]  And that is the real Anthony Fauci film, not just the best-selling book, but the film that will reach even more people than the millions sold of the book.
[34:08.600 --> 34:23.600]  I wanted to finish up here with Peter Strock. Here's Peter Strock, the guy that says 9-11 was quote, nothing compared to January 6. The American people are terrorists, and there's to be a war against all conservatives using the CIA and FBI.
[34:23.600 --> 34:31.600]  We just played the clip. You've already seen Biden announce that, but I thought I would just show you some of his famous text messages.
[34:31.600 --> 34:53.600]  Unelected bureaucrats in permanent Washington who tied, tried to influence an election, tried to overturn it, has some thoughts about democracy. Lisa Page. Trump's not ever going to become president, right? Right? Peter Strock. No, no. He's not. We'll stop it.
[34:53.600 --> 35:06.600]  So he gets up there and says, the number one most dangerous thing you can do is question an election or drink Pelosi's beer or poop on the wall. That is the worst attack in U.S. history.
[35:06.600 --> 35:19.600]  Meanwhile, he actually did, behind a powerful federal agency running a program against Trump, exactly what he's accused all of us collectively of doing, and he's arrogantly walking around outside of jail cell.
[35:19.600 --> 35:29.600]  And that's why we're in so much trouble. Now, I want to get into the really big news here, the real crimes of these people that if we don't stop them, it's on us.
[35:29.600 --> 35:44.600]  CDC expands updated COVID-19 vaccine to include children ages 5 through 11. The CDC is now making it recommended, which then gives liability protection to Pfizer, Moderna, and the other criminal organizations that gave us this poison gene therapy that's killed millions of people worldwide.
[35:44.600 --> 35:55.600]  That's all come out. That gives them liability protection. Now, once the schools make it a quote listed recommended vaccine, they lie and say it's mandatory. It's not.
[35:55.600 --> 36:02.600]  So no other countries giving it to children. Other countries have suspended it for everybody. There's criminal investigations in the EU.
[36:02.600 --> 36:21.600]  They had to fire three boards at the FDA and the CDC to be able to even get this done. The booster shots, the rest of it. And then they double down and say, we're going to go into the public schools, other schools, and most of the private schools roll over.
[36:21.600 --> 36:27.600]  And say, yes, we're going to put all these things into the children.
[36:27.600 --> 36:35.600]  And if they survive that, well, they're coming for their testicles and breasts when the government schools and other schools form a relationship with your child.
[36:35.600 --> 36:47.600]  Have them as we show the San Francisco School District documents that are the same nationwide where they secretly form a relationship with your five, six, seven year old, teach them they're really another sex, put them in a file, and then the school basically comes in and takes away parental rights.
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.600]  Now they're introducing legislation across the country to criminalize parents who try to stop it. That's coming up.
[36:53.600 --> 37:02.600]  I mean, the evil meter here is so off the chart, it's just unspeakable.
[37:02.600 --> 37:08.600]  And the average person just can't believe this is happening, but it really is.
[37:08.600 --> 37:13.600]  But here is Tony Lyons of Skyhors Publishing that published the Great Reset in the World for the World.
[37:13.600 --> 37:23.600]  Here he is talking about the most corrupt and greedy people in the country have taken over and he's talking about the globalist and the big pharma companies that now run our country.
[37:23.600 --> 37:28.600]  They're just making money. Their mission is to kill us on record.
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.600]  It came out in Bayer documents. You name it, that it's about the population. Here he is talking about the new film.
[37:33.600 --> 37:47.600]  I'm bringing Tony Lyons now to join Jeff. Tony, tell me about Skyhors and all the times you've published a couple of three controversial books on the scale of what Skyhors considers controversial.
[37:47.600 --> 37:50.600]  How controversial is the real Anthony Fauci?
[37:50.600 --> 38:01.600]  So I don't think that it should be controversial, but I think that viewers have to realize that the most corrupt, the greediest people in this country have taken over the government.
[38:01.600 --> 38:05.600]  They're trying to control your ability to see what's going on.
[38:05.600 --> 38:13.600]  And this has to be stopped. People have to watch this movie and understand how this country is run.
[38:13.600 --> 38:22.600]  You had a vision for this when we first talked about the book and Bobby, you had a vision for this becoming a film.
[38:22.600 --> 38:25.600]  How did you guys, how did you get Jeff and how did you get it done so quickly?
[38:25.600 --> 38:36.600]  Because bringing a filmmaker myself, given the complexity of the topic, it's kind of stunning to me that you guys are finished already at the quality level of the film I've seen, which is absolutely brilliant.
[38:36.600 --> 38:40.600]  How did you envision this and how did you get it going so quickly?
[38:40.600 --> 38:56.600]  Also, we were desperate to get this movie made because we felt that it's a big, complicated book and I think that there are tens of millions of people in this country who want to hear this story.
[38:56.600 --> 39:10.600]  Some of them were prevented from doing it because there was a censorship campaign that was waged against this book that's unprecedented in US history, that on every level it was censored.
[39:10.600 --> 39:15.600]  But even people who wanted to read it, in some cases, just couldn't do it.
[39:15.600 --> 39:18.600]  It was just too big a mountain to climb.
[39:18.600 --> 39:25.600]  And this is a long, complicated, incredibly exciting, but also shocking book.
[39:25.600 --> 39:39.600]  But I think that this is the most important movie of the year and we wanted it to come out quickly while it was still so relevant to decisions people make and to politics in this country.
[39:39.600 --> 39:51.600]  So we had a couple of different people who wanted to make it and we heard a presentation from Jeff and he just seemed like the perfect person who was going to get it done, work day and night, and that's what he's done.
[39:51.600 --> 40:01.600]  Tony Lyons, correct me if I'm wrong, with all the damning evidence and his interview on War Room blew up, he's calling guys murders, you never got sued.
[40:01.600 --> 40:09.600]  So what is it in the book that Jeff Hayes made a film out that would have every distribution platform shut down to you, sir?
[40:09.600 --> 40:26.600]  Because this book is saying that the most powerful health official in this country, the person who was essentially running the country during the pandemic is absolutely corrupt, is working for the pharmaceutical companies at the expense of public health.
[40:26.600 --> 40:33.600]  And that he's been doing that now for two and a half years, that hundreds of thousands of people have died unnecessarily.
[40:33.600 --> 40:53.600]  And that it's the point now where we need truth and reconciliation, we need tens of millions of people to watch this movie, to share this movie, to get a hold of it in any way they can in order to begin to understand what's happened, to be sure that it never happens again in this country or hopefully anywhere.
[40:53.600 --> 40:54.600]  Absolutely.
[40:54.600 --> 41:04.600]  And we're going to have the folks on tomorrow that made the film, or probably get Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on soon, but I'm not being paid to promote this film, though I'm going to try to get DVDs of it.
[41:04.600 --> 41:07.600]  Even though DVDs are old school, they can't censor that like digital stuff.
[41:07.600 --> 41:17.600]  I am going to try to get involved and obviously we sold the real Anthony Fauci book as well and then forward to where I come, but I'm just promoting this because the book put a major hole in the globalist.
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.600]  And then when Roger Rogan come out against him was also huge, obviously all of our work got that event horizon to the point of no return.
[41:24.600 --> 41:28.600]  So we were the ground troops that established the beachhead.
[41:28.600 --> 41:29.600]  It's not about who gets the credit.
[41:29.600 --> 41:38.600]  I'm just laying out how we won this audience, the beachhead, and then Rogan, JFK Jr., or RFK Jr.
[41:38.600 --> 41:40.600]  All of that we got that done.
[41:40.600 --> 41:44.600]  And now a film will be 10 times bigger and we're going to arrest these people.
[41:44.600 --> 41:45.600]  They're going to go to prison.
[41:45.600 --> 41:47.600]  They're going to pay for what they've done.
[41:47.600 --> 41:49.600]  So that's why this is so incredibly critical.
[41:49.600 --> 41:57.600]  And speaking of Fauci, we're going to come back from break with him now all over the news saying he never was for lockdowns.
[41:57.600 --> 41:59.600]  He was never for social distancing.
[41:59.600 --> 42:01.600]  He was never for any of this.
[42:01.600 --> 42:09.600]  And I just searched Anthony Fauci calls for schools to stay closed and found all these videos and all these articles, but I don't need to even play those.
[42:09.600 --> 42:11.600]  You remember it.
[42:11.600 --> 42:14.600]  You remember it.
[42:14.600 --> 42:16.600]  So he's just a total monster.
[42:16.600 --> 42:23.600]  And they count on you and I and all of us not having a memory.
[42:23.600 --> 42:32.600]  And then I've got the clip I mentioned that we're going to be getting back into in the news articles where they're coming for the children forcibly now.
[42:32.600 --> 42:34.600]  And for me, this is a lie in the sand.
[42:34.600 --> 42:35.600]  I'm trying to fix this peacefully.
[42:35.600 --> 42:38.600]  I'm not going to offensively go out and attack anybody like they are us.
[42:38.600 --> 42:44.600]  But they try to come take your kid and give him all these shots or somebody does it without political consent, which they're doing all over the world.
[42:44.600 --> 42:45.600]  Not just here.
[42:45.600 --> 42:46.600]  Well, it's an act of violence.
[42:46.600 --> 42:52.600]  It's an act of rape with a biological system that implants them with a system that basically causes AIDS.
[42:52.600 --> 42:55.600]  They want to inject your children with an AIDS causing compound.
[42:55.600 --> 42:58.600]  I think we have a right to say no to that.
[42:58.600 --> 43:00.600]  It's our best seller.
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.600]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[43:04.600 --> 43:13.600]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced what made it feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[43:13.600 --> 43:16.600]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[43:16.600 --> 43:23.600]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[43:23.600 --> 43:30.600]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[43:30.600 --> 43:32.600]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.600]  And so much of the food is debased.
[43:34.600 --> 43:36.600]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[43:36.600 --> 43:40.600]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[43:40.600 --> 43:47.600]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the infill war.

[46:41.600 --> 46:46.600]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making is almost over.
[46:46.600 --> 46:48.600]  And right at the end, we're not giving up.
[46:48.600 --> 46:50.600]  We're not giving in, but we could give out.

[47:20.600 --> 47:42.600]  All right, we got some big guests lined up today.
[47:42.600 --> 47:59.600]  Gavin McGinnis comes up next hour and Ingrid Karkvist is a highly recommended journalist in Europe from Sean Stone on the Russia war, the Ukraine operation, the forced injections, the whole new world order.
[47:59.600 --> 48:11.600]  She's got a lot of big news. Royce White is going to be talking Kanye West and what he talked about in Hollywood and all those issues in the fourth hour today.
[48:11.600 --> 48:15.600]  Don't want to miss that. Royce White is always a very thought-provoking, smart guy.
[48:15.600 --> 48:23.600]  Okay, look, I got tons of news here I want to hear, but I just got to go back to the kids here.
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.600]  I love Trump. He's getting a lot of great Republicans elected. The new world order hates his guts.
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.600]  He got a lot of other therapeutics rammed through.
[48:31.600 --> 48:43.600]  I know Trump's number and he got the Regeneron through. He battled to get Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.
[48:43.600 --> 48:52.600]  He just trusts the medical system and help people that know Trump well. He's a germaphobe. He doesn't go to the doctor a lot, but he really listens to doctors.
[48:52.600 --> 49:02.600]  And he signed on to this. They told him it would work. They lied. They set him up and I'm not giving him a pass, but he's doing a lot more good on our team than putting him in prison.
[49:02.600 --> 49:10.600]  So I'll take what we've got from Trump now. It's terrible that he won't come out against the shots that everybody else says and 1% are taking the shots compared to what were.
[49:10.600 --> 49:24.600]  So government is now coming with a mandate, color of law, through the schools with a federally mandated shot in CDC regs. They're pushing out today.
[49:24.600 --> 49:39.600]  And DeSantis and his Surgeon General have already come out against it. I wish Trump would, but his strength is that he is a donkey. He's a Republican, so he's an elephant, but he's a jackass.
[49:39.600 --> 49:44.600]  Anybody who's been around donkeys or mules know they are stubborn as hell. They're going to do what they want to do.
[49:44.600 --> 49:54.600]  And so they can't make him do what they want, but we can't make him do what we want. That's a separate issue, but we're just going to have to sit here and ourselves expose this.
[49:54.600 --> 50:02.600]  Too bad Trump won't do it because this is just coming out more and more. And the more he gets behind this, the more he owns it. And that's his problem.
[50:02.600 --> 50:17.600]  I'm going to move on from Trump, but you heard I just called for Tulsi Gabbers to run his VP with DeSantis. I'm just, I can't help it. DeSantis has come out against the shot. DeSantis has said it's hurting people. DeSantis is the Surgeon General has said it's bad.
[50:17.600 --> 50:34.600]  And that's all that matters to me because the number one issue is these children. And I have a five-year-old. I have a 14-year-old. I have an 18-year-old and a 19-year-old. Hell, my son just turned 20, excuse me.
[50:34.600 --> 50:49.600]  So we're dealing with all of this. And I know you're dealing with it too. And it fundamentally doesn't make me angry now. It makes me upset with myself that we're letting this happen because this is outrageous.
[50:49.600 --> 51:01.600]  I mean, imagine you work for the Justice Department that's being told anybody that questions these shots as a terrorist. And Peter Shrocks, it's one of the five things they list in the FBI Declaration of War last June against America.
[51:01.600 --> 51:13.600]  Borders, you question that being open? You question election fraud? You question lockdowns? You question forced injections? You are a terrorist.
[51:13.600 --> 51:31.600]  While they terrorize us with the mask and the lockdowns and the collapse and the whole society disintegrating, do you really as an FBI agent or anybody else or a school teacher or anybody, why would you want to be part of this? It's bizarre.
[51:31.600 --> 51:43.600]  And we do see hundreds of prominent FBI whistleblowers going to Congress, but they all get bottlenecked there, and then they get persecuted while Congress claims they're helping them.
[51:43.600 --> 51:56.600]  So we have a bureaucracy at war with us. It's not America. It's not even the government. I'm not anti-government. I'm anti-captured U.S. government, occupied U.S. government.
[51:56.600 --> 52:05.600]  And it really is a line in the sand for me. The children, when these damn shots are experimental, and we now know we're killing people in mass.
[52:05.600 --> 52:11.600]  In fact, I have a stack of articles right here in the U.S. and around the world of children and young people, and the numbers show it.
[52:11.600 --> 52:29.600]  We have a dying of heart attacks among Carditis at 40, 50, 60,000 times the previous number, because it's used to children having heart attacks, unless it was congenital, born with heart problems, was absolutely ultra rare.
[52:29.600 --> 52:37.600]  But it's not rare now. It's as common as the sun coming up in the morning, and it gets worse.
[52:37.600 --> 52:51.600]  We know pediatric cancer until the 70s was non-existent. If a kid had cancer previous to the 70s, doctors would get on airplanes to fly across the country to see a child with cancer, because it was so rare.
[52:51.600 --> 53:04.600]  Now, you can't swing a stick at the shopping mall and not hit a kid that's got cancer. They are murdering us, and I'm not just going to sit here while they normalize on the sides of buses and TV ads, not just here, but all over the world,
[53:04.600 --> 53:11.600]  and say, heart attacks are normal in kids. No, they are not.
[53:11.600 --> 53:28.600]  And I can't imagine why anybody would want to work for the system and get a measly paycheck to be part of this when you're being targeted with it as well.
[53:28.600 --> 53:38.600]  The government exempted all the key people, Congress and the FBI and everybody else from their own shots. I mean, this is really a psychotic group of people that are out to get us.
[53:38.600 --> 53:49.600]  And just like Trump is becoming a politically perishable item, it's not a threat physically, I'm saying, like, you know, milk going bad on the shelf.
[53:49.600 --> 53:54.600]  He has an expiration date, and it's almost over. He did it to himself. That's the way it is. He's had a chance to turn it around.
[53:54.600 --> 53:59.600]  But the bureaucrats that are trying to make people take it, Trump's not trying to make anybody take it.
[53:59.600 --> 54:05.600]  So if Trump's done something bad, it's a two on a ten. And his good stuff kind of outweighs it.
[54:05.600 --> 54:13.600]  So, you know, he's like a.5 bad guy right now. People pushing this, like Fauci and Gates and the media and the big censors.
[54:13.600 --> 54:21.600]  Anybody else that's on board is a ten. I mean, you are a mass murderer now. You are a horrible, evil person.
[54:21.600 --> 54:27.600]  Can't you see which way the wind's blowing and be like Tulsi Gabbard's coming out against the shots a long time ago?
[54:27.600 --> 54:40.600]  Or DeSantis? Or is Surgeon General? Or everybody else? I mean, can't you just be good people?
[54:40.600 --> 54:48.600]  Now, I'm remembering what's in this stack here. And we got Gavin McGinnis coming up. I'm going to actually bring up the shots with him.
[54:48.600 --> 54:53.600]  But you're talking about gaining a function.
[54:53.600 --> 55:15.600]  Did you know a U.S. university admits, is currently bragging, that they just created a COVID variant that kills 80% of the animals it comes in contact with?
[55:15.600 --> 55:22.600]  That's coming up next hour. We've introduced, we're promoting, and our guest is introduced in Congress. It's about to be introduced.
[55:22.600 --> 55:29.600]  Impeachment legislation against Biden for trying to start World War III and launching a war without congressional approval.

[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:19.600]  Visit a mistake in so many states and so many localities to see schools closed as long as they were.
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:42.600]  I don't want to use the word mistake, John, because if I do it gets taken out of the context that you're asking me the question on. I would say that what we should realize and have realized that there will be deleterious collateral consequences when you do something like that.
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:50.600]  This idea that this virus doesn't afflict children is not so. It does. We've lost close to 1,500 kids so far.
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:53.600]  But much less than the older population, obviously.
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:54.600]  Oh, of course.
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:01:09.600]  But you shouldn't discount that it does afflict children. So it isn't without consequences. If you go back and I ask anybody to go back over the number of times that I've said we've got to do everything we can to keep the schools open.
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:17.600]  No one plays that clip. They always come back and say Fauci was responsible for closing schools. I had nothing to do.
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:21.600]  I mean, let's get down to the fact.
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship. Well, the one and only Gavin McGinnis joins us for the rest of the hour. I really appreciate him taking time out to come on. Censored.tv and cover the waterfront on the election, the tyranny, the Russia war, the forced injections, the billion-dollar ruling against me by Kangaroo Court after the jury was told I was already guilty.
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  He joins us right now. Gavin McGinnis needs no introduction. Gavin, great to have you back on with us, brother.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.600]  Happy to be here, Alex.
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:02:01.600]  Some stations don't care this little first five, but I'm still going to give us a prelude on what you're going to be covering.
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:20.600]  I'm going to be focusing on this war on kids. These people pretend they care about kids, but they totally ignore these groomers who are not just doing drag queen story hour but coming to church, infiltrating schools, and it just keeps getting more prevalent. I don't understand it.
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:30.600]  You're absolutely right. Now they're trying to pass laws to take kids away from parents who don't want their kids being brainwashed. I mean, this is literally them not just forming a sexual relationship, but a total control over their lives.
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:40.600]  Yeah, there was this guy in Canada named Panda Dulce, and he was doing drag queen story hour. Proud boys showed up and said this isn't happening.
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:56.600]  They were investigated for committing a hate crime until they checked Panda Dulce's social media and saw him bragging about how he's going to get kids to suck his D, among other things.
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:06.600]  Carrying a knife and all kinds of violent threats, and all of a sudden they dropped the hate crimes charges against Proud Boys, but this is going on all over the western world.
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:16.600]  Scotland, England, we just had a guy in Australia who was caught with terabytes of child porn, yet they keep going back to the well. That's the part I don't understand.
[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:30.600]  Big corporate systems are literally flooding from Disney to BlackRock, are flooding the sexualization of children and weird fat men dressed in clown outfits, knowing and having children sit in their laps.
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:39.600]  It's just, it's so bizarre. Who would have thought the fall of civilization would be hallmarked or bellwethered by these people?
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:46.600]  I would understand if it happened twice, and you went, oh that's, there's actually quite a predilection for child abuse with these people.
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:52.600]  And then they go, oh my god, I had no idea, and they stepped away. Like with Ukraine, you know a lot of them are Nazis, right?
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:56.600]  Oh my god, I had no idea, step away, but they just keep coming back to well. Check out this list.
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:09.600]  Jada Dean in Australia, child porn, Tatiana Malinani in Houston, child sex offender with an eight-year-old boy, you got William Travis Dees also in Houston, he was the greeter at Drag Queen Story Hour, he was having sex with...
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:21.600]  Hold on, hold on, this is too important, I want you to start over, we're going to give you the floor on the attack and grooming and annihilation of our children in California passing a law that underage kids can go get their balls and breasts chopped off.
[1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:29.600]  And then when girls that have had their breasts chopped off or boys' genitals cut off, they complain later and say it was a mistake, they get censored by Big Tech.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:32.600]  Where's the best place for people to find your powerful broadcast?
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:45.600]  Censored.tv, also if you go to my Getter account, you can see we have a comedy show on Thursday in Chicago, I'm also doing a talk at Penn State this Monday, please check it out.
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:54.600]  All right, the great Gavin McGinnis, founder of Vice and More, with us in 60 seconds, so everybody you know tune in now, because this is two Titans of Free Speech together.
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:05.600]  It's our best seller. We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:15.600]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:17.600]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:24.600]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:31.600]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:37.600]  That's what it means without these things you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:41.600]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:48.600]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare.
[1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:56.600]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at InfoWareStore.com for a 50% off.
[1:05:56.600 --> 1:06:02.600]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:08.600]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:34.600]  There must be some kind of way out of here. Said a joker to the thief. There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
[1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:55.600]  Gad McKenna is our guest for the hour. We're going to cover the waterfront with him, but first off, the war on our children's innocence.
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:04.600]  We all know it's wrong to rape a child, or at least most of us do unless you're a Democratic party or Disney and big corporations promoting sexualization to children.
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:16.600]  But if they can tell them to cut their breast off or their testicles off and have the school form a relationship with your child at age five and put them in a database and then introduce laws that parents will be arrested, like in Virginia,
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:27.600]  if they don't let their children be sterilized, it's about a destruction of parental rights and really the destruction of the family which the globalists admit is their main mission.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:40.600]  So Gad McKenna has really been researching this in depth. He's about to lay it all out for us right now. Hey, how big is it? Why are they doing it? Where do you see it going and go over some of these incredible examples you've got?
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:53.600]  So the parents are going because they're virtue signaling and they think that we are mad that their kids are near gays. They think it's a gay thing and they're doing it out of spite to make us angry.
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:08:05.600]  It's not the gay thing. Drag queens have always been around. We never cared. Our problem is these sexual creatures, they're dressed up in a sexual way, are reading the kids. If it was strippers, we'd be just as mad.
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:16.600]  They're spreading their legs exactly. If I was a topless bar and I saw suddenly five-year-old kids putting money in G-strings, I'd call the police. But oh, but it's gay, it's liberal, it's okay.
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:30.600]  Right. Now, you create an environment wherein pedophiles and child predators can get in there. You open up this portal where they can sneak in and there's tons of them that have already snuck in.
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:39.600]  And I was listening to them earlier. In Australia, we just had Jada Dean arrested with child porn. In Canada, we had Panda Dolce talking about how he's going to get kids to filate him.
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:48.600]  In Houston, we got a bunch, including Tatiana Malanina, who molested an eight-year-old boy. The greeter at the Drag Queen Story Hour, Tatiana's at. He was guilty.
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:09:02.600]  William Travis Dees of Sex Crimes with Children. We got Brett Blonde, the CEO of the Cream City Foundation, which sponsored the Milwaukee Chapter of Drag Queen Story Hour. We got a drag queen in Scotland who was just arrested.
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:17.600]  His nickname is Nathan Flowjob Mullen for media posts with violence against children. Then just south of that, in England, the British Airways Pride celebrations included a guy named Darren Sewell who was looking to meet an eight-year-old and 11-year-old girl.
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:33.600]  And in Pennsylvania, just the other day, we had Anastasia Diamond, who was found guilty of 25 counts of child sexual abuse. Why are you risking it? Why are you willing to put your children's safety in jeopardy just to virtue signal and to make Republicans mad?
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:52.600]  And that's only the tip of the iceberg. I've seen the latest gay parades in the last few months in Seattle and New York, and it's literally boy scouts and girl scouts being paraded in front of naked men humping each other and defecating in the streets. It's just a giant exercise in dominance.
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:10:06.600]  Drag queens are the most extreme of the gay culture. If you're to compare it to our world, like politics, they are like a patriot front. Like they are way, way, way out there on the far, far, far outskirts of the movement.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:16.600]  It's not like a normal long cabin Republican. You want a gay kid to read to kids? Get an effeminate homosexual to go in there in a suit and read to kids. They can learn that it's okay to be gay.
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:26.600]  That's not what this is about. This is about sex. And call me old fashioned, but I don't want little kids on sex. And the reason I bring this up, Alex, is because these are the kind of things you've been screaming about for years.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:36.600]  They're grooming our kids. They're coming to church. And you were right, which is why you're being fined one gazillion, bazillion dollars because your prophecies turn out to be correct.
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  So they get you on a technicality when you're wrong about something and just empty the bank account.
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  Well, it's funny because there's no real money in the bank account. Anyways, it's all a pyrrhic victory. They want our listeners think we're being shut down. We're not as long as they support.
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:11:00.600]  But yeah, since you raised that, let's segue into that and back into the sexualization of children. I don't care if it's homosexual, heterosexual, hand sexual, Easter Bunny sexual, leave kids alone.
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:08.600]  But absolutely, what do you make of the billion plus dollar? Because they've got other damages coming in Connecticut. I mean, talk about overkill.
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  Well, they played their hand. They show that this isn't about the truth. This is about wrong think and you being too influential and everyone should take heed because we've seen the media make a million mistakes.
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:31.600]  They told us there are no weapons of mass destruction. They said that the steel dossier, they said Hillary 99% chance of winning. They said that there's no Nazis in Ukraine.
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:39.600]  They said Ivermectin is dangerous. They said the vaccine will save you. Remember Juicy Smolay? They follow that story. Remember the Covington Catholic School boys?
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:47.600]  They said written house is a racist murder. Like their mistakes go on and on and on. And I'm not even including their lies by omission where they called anti-fascist.
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:57.600]  They totally turned a blind eye to the Muslim influence in the pulse shooting. They totally ignored Hunter Biden's laptop. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. That's all fine.
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:09.600]  But if you're wrong about a shooting, you have to pay a bazillion dollars. And so this isn't about truth. This isn't about being wrong. This is about Alex Jones committing thought crimes and having to be punished for that.
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  And the fact that the left is never punished for crimes that are far worse shows you that this has nothing to do with the truth and everything to do with criticizing the left and the deep swamp.
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:29.600]  What do you think the backlash is going to be against this? I mean, it's already there. So many Democrats, I know there are former Democrats like Tulsi Gabbard, you name it, are turning against us now because it's so obviously poison.
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  Whether it's the racial division, the pedophilic giant streak down their back. I mean, the Democratic Party and this whole globalist party literally is like the legion of Satan.
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:52.600]  Why did this trial even exist? We have laws about free speech. If you're the head of the bloods and you say, go kill this man, it's very plausible someone will go and kill that man because you hold authority with that.
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:58.600]  So you should be punished. That's a plausible threat. So that doesn't include free speech. We already have laws for this.
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:06.600]  So the fact that now the civil courts are the new courts and people just get sued when they commit wrong things shows that our normal courts are obsolete.
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:16.600]  They don't exist anymore. We just go out and we get grudges, personal grudges. The Drag Queen story I was about is about spite and this ruling is about a grudge.
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:24.600]  And that seems to be the dominant forces in our justice system now, spite and grudges. What should we do about it?
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  We got to keep fighting. We need to get into civil suits. We need to start suing people. We need to start getting involved in lawfare.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:37.600]  And it's not really a conservative or a libertarian or a right-leaning thing. It's a petty thing, but that's the way it's going.
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:43.600]  Did you hear what's going on with Project Veritas? They lost in their case where they misrepresented themselves.
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:54.600]  So now if they're doing a sting like Rudyard Kipling's thing in the Meatpacking District or any kind of undercover journalist work, you have to say, hi, I'm investigating you because I think you're corrupt.
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:14:05.600]  I'm a reporter from Project Veritas. Any statement about the money you've been embezzling? It's the end of Project Veritas. They're appealing it, but there really is this massive left.
[1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  And it's also likely enforced. The left can do investigative reporting. The left has got free speech, just we don't.
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:19.600]  We really need to see a landslide in the midterms or this isn't going to change because it's one thing for the left to be biased.
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:29.600]  It's one thing for garbage sites like BuzzFeed and Daily Beast to be biased. But when it's getting into the courts and people are being persecuted for wrong things, it's no longer just left versus right.
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:37.600]  Now it's the establishment versus the people. And this has got to change or we don't have a country anymore where Venezuela, if this keeps happening.
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:45.600]  I agree with you. I want to get into Russia. I want to get into the midterms. I want to get into Biden. But you've always had so many great points.
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:49.600]  What do you want to get into next when we come back, Gavin McGinnis?
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:55.600]  I want to get into this war on free speech. I mean, my talk, they just shut down one of the comedy clubs. This is a comedy club.
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  We're doing a comedy show. It got shut down. You can't joke anymore. And this Penn State thing, you would not believe the backlash from the students and the radical left against my talk.
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  There's a Q&A. You can come there to Penn State and ask me questions. You know, come up with allegations. That's fine.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  But no, they don't want the talk coming. And the lie they tell is, oh, it's because you're giving them money. We don't want our money going to that.
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:24.600]  The show will be profitable. They're selling tickets. So the money thing is a lie. It's a war on free speech. And there's nothing more American than free speech.
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:26.600]  Other countries don't even quite get it.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:41.600]  Well, as negative as this all is, Gavin, really, this is the death row. People are turning against the corporate left. They're turning against them in rows and they're just doubling down, trying to suppress us like a beaten wife to stay in this bad relationship.
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:50.600]  But it's not happening. But I asked you like five years ago, six years ago, what's the peak of liberal insanity? You said, I think it's a long way away. What is the peak? I'll ask you that question.
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:56.600]  Well, I already asked the question. We'll get that answer. We come back with Gavin McKenna. Stay with us.
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:31.600]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.

In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.

[1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:28.600]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:38.600]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.

[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:33.600]  You're an anti-Jew, just like if you don't believe in Jesus Christ, you're not a Christian. If you don't believe in Allah or Muhammad, you're not a Muslim. You're an anti-Muslim or you're an anti-Christian.
[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:47.600]  If you don't believe in the Constitution, you're not an American, you're an anti-American. If you don't believe in the fundamental rules of the game of basketball, five men versus five men shooting on two hoops at ten feet with one little round basketball, you're not a basketball player.
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:53.600]  You're an anti-basketball player. It's very simple.
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:37:21.600]  You're carrying water for the Jewish Buzwarzi. Why? Why? You got $400 million. What more do you need? What more do you radical materialists need to acquire in this anti-God society to be able to have the permission to speak the truth?
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:33.600]  This is what we're talking about here. You people won't speak the truth. And that's what Kanye West has said. That's what Minister Louis Farrakhan said. That's what Alex Jones has said. That's what Steve Bannon has said. That's what Donald Trump has said.
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:54.600]  That's what Pick One. Pick a person at the mainstream media that is overseen by the Jewish elite. Pick a person. Those people were cast aside, were ostracized, were persecuted, and in some cases prosecuted for speaking the truth.
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:38:09.600]  And when you're anti-God, the truth has no value. You get to make the truth up as you go. What an anti-Jewish motif? What an anti-human motif? What an anti-worldly motif? What an anti-God motif?
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:27.600]  I'm just making up as I go. I don't have to say that Eric Holder was held in contempt of court by not appearing before Congress, and he never ended up appearing before Congress, nor did he serve one day in jail.
[3:38:27.600 --> 3:38:40.600]  And this Friday this kangaroo tyrannical court plans to send Steve Bannon to jail on the manufactured consent and complacency with corruption that has become the American people and American citizenship.
[3:38:40.600 --> 3:38:53.600]  But why does it matter? We don't have to adhere to the truth. And the reason why they don't have to adhere to the truth, the reason why Kanye West has to step way outside the box to try and grab people's attention
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:39:08.600]  in the midst of this chaotic info war is because you people, and in some cases I'm talking to this audience, but in some cases I'm talking to the people out there that can hear the sound of my voice,
[3:39:08.600 --> 3:39:29.600]  you people have accepted that lying is a means to an end, that lying is a course worth exploring, that dishonesty and disinformation, and whatever it is that helps me sleep better at night, whatever is convenient for me is fine.
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:42.600]  It's fine. That's who Sean Combs is. Take a look at Sean Combs interview. Just take a look at him. You know, you're way off. I don't know if you're hopped up on drugs or what.
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:53.600]  I don't know. I don't know you personally, so I can't say. But when I look at you, you look like somebody who is under severe psychological turmoil, or you're probably just on drugs, maybe a bit of both.
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:40:05.600]  But you're not somebody who can be the moral authority. Who made you the moral authority on anything? You're not philosophical. You're not an intellectual. You don't have no grasp of history.
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:22.600]  You come to the podium that the Jewish bourgeoisie set up for you to talk about the same run of the mill, low rent issues, low information voter issues that have made black people vote Democrat at a 90% clip since after the Civil Rights Act was passed.
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:37.600]  You don't have no moral authority. And what black person in their mind would come to a screen, whether it be their phone or their laptop or their computer or their television and listen to what you have to say about culture and politics versus a minister
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:51.600]  Lewis Farrakhan, black men, black leaders, black intellectuals, black faith leaders who actually put their lives on the line to speak about issues that you now grift off of at a time when they were really killing black people for talking about it.
[3:40:51.600 --> 3:41:02.600]  Sean Puffy Combs ain't in danger for saying racism still exists here in America. Black Lives Matter is a phrase you can't play with.
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:14.600]  There's no danger in him saying that. The entire narrative is protected. The judiciary is siphoned and protected for him to say just that very thing.
[3:41:14.600 --> 3:41:24.600]  And all you people have to do is look and say, where are the winds blowing? Where are the winds? People have lost all sense of the winds.
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:31.600]  The winds are at people's back to say that very narrative, which is why you should look for the people who they've banned.
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:39.600]  If you accept that the system is guilty, if you accept that the system is corrupt, why are you willing to drink the Kool-Aid from the same system?
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:47.600]  I'll tell you why, because you want to be on top in the system. When these people call out the system for being corrupt, they're not doing it because they want the system to change.
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:58.600]  And I'm not talking about Sean Puffy Combs. I'm talking about the everyday American citizen in a black community that has been brainwashed that radical materialism is the way to happiness and peace.
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:05.600]  No, God is the way to happiness and peace. Truth is the way to happiness and peace. Sacred Honor is the way to happiness and peace.
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:14.600]  National Honor is the way to happiness and peace. What you're doing is saying, as much money as I can get, as many things as I can get for myself, that's going to make me happy.
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:21.600]  That's going to bring me peace. No, that's going to bring you distraction. And that's what I see when I hear Sean Puffy Combs talk and I see his mannerisms.
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:37.600]  I see a distracted individual, a person who was intentionally distracted by a culture that sits over them, above them, and has laid the foundation of a radical materialist mentality and spirit.
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:48.600]  The rejection of God, the gain the whole world but lose my soul is an adoption of Satanism. You people have been brainwashed with Satanism.
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:55.600]  You don't even see it. And Kanye West is the bad guy. You've got to be kidding me. Stay over to the other side of the break.

[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:37.600]  We are now at the bottom of the hour and we've been discussing a great number of things, but mainly predicated around this entire narrative of Kanye West, the characterization or the demonization or the castigation of antisemitism that has been waged upon him and many other conservative voices.
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:50.600]  And you know, a lot of you conservatives out, let's just be frank. A lot of you conservative commentators out there don't want to broach this issue. Why? Because you're in on it.
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:48:03.600]  You're in on the scam. You're in on the shielding and the shilling and the fucking, the excuse my language, the BS narrative that has been erected around the political sphere.
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:13.600]  Two sides of the same coin liberalism and conservatism is conservatism really a genuine movement in some places in America. Absolutely.
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:21.600]  But within our political elites, conservatism serves as the controlled opposition for liberalism, which makes it two sides of the same coin.
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:33.600]  And that is the case and the Jewish elite and the black bourgeoisie carry water for the uniparty. And let's just let's just look at the let's just look at the facts.
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:53.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, is the is the real issue in America have anything to do with these cultural bickering, bickering matches? My contention is no. My contention is that most.
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:49:04.600]  Let's look at let's look at what's being done right now. It's all a look away. It's all the way to say, look over here. Look over here. You know, look behind you.
[3:49:04.600 --> 3:49:17.600]  You know, look underneath the chair. Look back underneath this this this lampshade. Go on this treasure hunt. Go on this treasure hunt for information that is is by and large, meaningless.
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:27.600]  Don't look at the real issues. Don't look at inflation. Don't look at the monetary policies of the Fed. Don't look at the International Monetary Fund.
[3:49:27.600 --> 3:49:38.600]  Don't look at the fact, the fact that liberalism, globalism and communism as it stands today operate in a very similar way and seem to have the exact same aim.
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:49.600]  What was the common thread between liberalism, globalism and communism? Because, you know, this clip surfaced and I made this comment about LeBron James taking a similar payoff that Kanye West is talking about.
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:58.600]  Who, oh, by the way, also didn't air Kanye West's interview on HBO platform, the shop. Why? Because there was hate speech in it.
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:11.600]  OK, and then I said that LeBron James took this this this payoff from Nike, the establishment, the anti-human neoliberal Marxist globalist establishment, and people go, how can you say neoliberal and Marxism?
[3:50:11.600 --> 3:50:23.600]  And I said they're they're they're antithetical. No, they're not. Of course they're not. Liberalism, communism and globalism all have one common thread.
[3:50:23.600 --> 3:50:30.600]  The the the ambition to remove God from the organization of man.
[3:50:30.600 --> 3:50:45.600]  Very easy to see. It's anti God. Now, though, the info war is to try and delegitimize God on the most general basis so that you can never string together the common thread between liberalism, communism and globalism.
[3:50:45.600 --> 3:50:55.600]  But that is the common thread. The common thread is that it's anti God. And by default, because it's anti God, it's anti human. And most importantly, it's anti freedom.
[3:50:55.600 --> 3:51:07.600]  And that is the modus operandi of the three headed Cerberus. You know, that's what we'll call it. The three headed Cerberus, liberalism, communism, globalism, all working in the same direction.
[3:51:07.600 --> 3:51:21.600]  All want an authoritarian state, all want to take your rights, all want you to believe that radical materialism is the thing you should focus on, or these pediculture wars, while the real information is kept out of your purview.
[3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:34.600]  Now, these are the things that that maybe a Kanye West can't really, really articulate. And there's a reason why people like me have been kept far away from the spotlight or a platform such as his, or even other conservative voices like a can of
[3:51:34.600 --> 3:51:47.600]  solans, you know, whoever else. Why? Because part of becoming a real messenger is that you have to give up your own addiction to sin, right. And some of us, even in the movement, having totally given up our own addiction to sin.
[3:51:47.600 --> 3:52:03.600]  So it inhibits our ability to speak that that transcendent truth. Right. And, and I think the liberalism, communism and globalism ideas one we need to become familiar with one that we need to become, you know, comfortable with speaking
[3:52:03.600 --> 3:52:13.600]  the truth about because look at where we are. You know, we're on the brink of a nuclear war with Russia.
[3:52:13.600 --> 3:52:27.600]  Our conservative voices are being silenced at an all time alarming rate. The currency collapse, still got China to the east. That's that's as big a threat as ever.
[3:52:27.600 --> 3:52:36.600]  But, but all of it were quite, you know, if you think that it's all by coincidence, and this is another useful strategy in removing God from the organization of man.
[3:52:36.600 --> 3:52:49.600]  If you, if you don't believe sometimes when the smoking gun of conspiracy can't be found, a person has to look to the metaphysical to connect the dots.
[3:52:49.600 --> 3:53:00.600]  But if we delegitimize the metaphysical completely, we take away an entire realm of possibility and where the conspiracy really could be.
[3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:11.600]  And what is the conspiracy right now? Let's go back to the earliest days of Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we grew to love him, the reason why we came to know him.
[3:53:11.600 --> 3:53:29.600]  What, what, what was Alex, despite what the Washington Post and the New York Times and the corrupt tyrannical kangaroo court and their sick, sick, a phantic Democrat liberal judge and that crazy show trial that that I can barely watch without vomiting.
[3:53:29.600 --> 3:53:47.600]  Let's not that version of Alex Jones that they want you to know. Let's go back to the original Alex Jones. Who was he speaking out against? George Bush, the neocons, the neoliberal political elite that has partnered and co-conspired with the
[3:53:47.600 --> 3:54:00.600]  controlled opposition, Marxist, to keep the social and the economic separate and disconnected in the purview and the vision and the focus of the average American citizen.
[3:54:00.600 --> 3:54:08.600]  That is the scam. That is the scam. When we say equity, we're not talking financial equity. When we're talking with the Marxist, we're talking social equity.
[3:54:08.600 --> 3:54:19.600]  But when we talk with the neoliberal establishment, the rhinos in the establishment dims and even the AOCs of the world behind closed doors, we're talking about financial equity.
[3:54:19.600 --> 3:54:28.600]  And what is the financial scam going on here? Well, let's just go right to the heart of the matter because the Jewish bourgeoisie, they didn't erect it.
[3:54:28.600 --> 3:54:35.600]  They just got it right. They just got it right alongside it. They just hitched their wagon. They said, you know what, we'll carry water.
[3:54:35.600 --> 3:54:56.600]  And who are they carrying water for? The throne. And that's what many of these conservatives will not say. They will not come out and say, frankly, that the throne is the sine qua non of globalism.
[3:54:56.600 --> 3:55:03.600]  It's the sine qua non of the emergence of where we are today in the Western world and all around the world.
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:10.600]  These wars that are taking place between us and China is an opium war between the throne and China.
[3:55:10.600 --> 3:55:23.600]  These wars that are waging between the European monarchies and Russia are wars that have been waging since before there was countries and borders and languages that were bound within those borders
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:31.600]  or cultures or practices that were bound within those borders. These wars go back to ancient times.
[3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:37.600]  They won't talk about the throne. You know, they don't even want you to know what the Bretton Woods Conference was.
[3:55:37.600 --> 3:55:47.600]  The Bretton Woods Conference that came about after World War II, realigned the monetary policy and direction for the entire world.
[3:55:47.600 --> 3:55:57.600]  And it put America's military, not America's foreign policy or constitutional beliefs because that's not what the Bretton Woods Conference did.
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:06.600]  It put our military at the forefront of a foreign policy for Britain and in some ways Japan, okay?
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:14.600]  The Bretton Woods Conference became what? The International Monetary Fund. It became the World Bank.
[3:56:14.600 --> 3:56:23.600]  It became all of this social equity, all of this diversity, equity and inclusion, the Bilderberg Group, the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Conference, the International Monetary Fund,
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:36.600]  the World Bank was all the way for the throne to rebrand and reconstruct their business model, their business model with an entirely new cultural narrative.
[3:56:36.600 --> 3:56:41.600]  And the business model is the same that it's always been. I said it before and I'll say it again.
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:47.600]  The globalist business model is slavery, drugs and piracy.
[3:56:47.600 --> 3:56:56.600]  The only difference today is that they're using social justice, environmentalism and democracy to go and take people's resources.
[3:56:56.600 --> 3:57:05.600]  Just like here at home domestically, they're using public figures and puppet profits to wage a narrative that says a Kanye West should be your focus.
[3:57:05.600 --> 3:57:08.600]  He's your enemy. Alex Jones is your enemy.
[3:57:08.600 --> 3:57:12.600]  But the Federal Reserve, oh, they're just trying to manage inflation.
[3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:24.600]  They're just doing an honest day's work over there at the Fed. Ladies and gentlemen, matter of fact, you shouldn't even know what the Fed is or concern yourself with what the Fed is doing because Kanye West is a schizophrenic maniac.
[3:57:24.600 --> 3:57:27.600]  And he's an anti-Semite and he's working for white supremacists.
[3:57:27.600 --> 3:57:30.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Info War.
[3:57:30.600 --> 3:57:36.600]  I've been your guest host Royce White for the hour and thank you, Alex Jones. Godspeed to you. I love you, brother.
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:45.600]  Thank you to the Info War team. Tune in. Go visit my sub-stack. Read the open letter to Valerie Pooley when the dust never settles.
[3:57:45.600 --> 3:57:54.600]  Look around you. Everything I predicted from the globalist documents from their own admissions is now happening. Info War's credibility.
[3:57:54.600 --> 3:58:05.600]  My credibility has never been higher. And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[3:58:05.600 --> 3:58:11.600]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:58:11.600 --> 3:58:18.600]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air. In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[3:58:18.600 --> 3:58:26.600]  But I've been forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable.
[3:58:26.600 --> 3:58:38.600]  So please visit saveinfowars.com. Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[3:58:38.600 --> 3:58:45.600]  I'll never give up. I'll never give in. But I could give out. Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you. Saveinfowars.com.
[3:58:45.600 --> 3:58:52.600]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny. But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[3:58:52.600 --> 3:58:58.600]  Now I knew that and for 28 years I've been on air, exposed these people and together we've had a great effect.
[3:58:58.600 --> 3:59:05.600]  But listen, they're coming after us right now. They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.
