[00:00.000 --> 00:01.600]  We've got it, son.
[00:01.600 --> 00:03.600]  The biggest fan is coming now.
[00:07.200 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.600]  Oh, hey, you aren't golden.
[00:11.600 --> 00:18.000]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  Now we see the iron.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  You've got it, son.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  We got Obama folk.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama folk.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Keep Obama in president, you know?
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  He gave us a phone.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  He gave you a phone.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  How do you give you a phone?
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  You sign up.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  If you're on full stamps, you're on social security.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  You got low income, you get disability.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  Hey, I have a question.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  Okay, what's wrong with Rami again?
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Rami, he sucks.
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.000]  Hey!
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live here.
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  It is Sunday, and it is the 30th day of September 2012,
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  and Lord Willem will be here for the next two hours.
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  We are simulcasting the radio transmission at prisonplanet.tv,
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  and I don't know, we've had prisonplanet.tv for nine and a half years.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  For about six years, I've been simulcasting video during the radio show,
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  but we're putting in more soundproofing and new cameras and some other equipment
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  and some soundproof doors that they started last weekend.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  That's why I didn't do last Sunday's show live,
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  and they've just got a few things to finish up today, maybe tomorrow,
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  but there will be video.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  There will be video today when Dr. Glitten's on with us.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  There are documents and articles we'll be showing.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  It's just that a bunch of the studio's torn up,
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  so we are not going to be showing you my ugly pumpkin head today.
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  So I think everybody will survive,
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  but there are a lot of reasons to be logged in over at infowarsnews.com right now
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  or prisonplanet.tv because you can again see the video,
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  see the documents, see the articles,
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  and see our guest that is going to be coming up joining us via video.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  Skype adds a whole other dimension to it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  I just want to say the crew, on top of training in the ways of info wars,
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  six new reporters, and doing the nightly news and everything else they do
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  have done a great job working with the construction crew last weekend
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  and now some this weekend to try to get the studio up to speed,
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  because when I built this into this little office place
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  we have five and a half years ago when I moved over here,
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  I never really properly designed it.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  I designed it.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  That was the problem.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  We now had professionals in to soundproof it a little bit better.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  It's a side issue. I've now belabored that point.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  I always give too much information on things that don't matter.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  Look, I intro things with the Obama phone lady here today
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  because, well, the Washington Post is saying it's racist.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  It's racist to show someone who's been victimized and domesticated by big government.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  You're not supposed to show the, well, the ugly face of dependency.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  So I thought, well, wait a minute, since the media,
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  the corporate media that has almost no viewers or readers now,
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  but still is so self-important.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  They lecture us all on how things really work.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  I thought since they're saying this is out of context
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  and not indicative of many Obama domesticated supporters,
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  when this only validates, I'm not defending him overall,
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  but validates what Mitt Romney said about 47% are totally dependent
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  and would vote for the government to basically feed the rest of us into a meat grinder.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  For the government bureaucrats and for the big banks that feed off of us
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  and for the welfare hordes, those of us that produce are the food.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  We're the food. We're the milk cows.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  And they get tired of just milking us.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  They actually use us up.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  And the empire uses up our young men in all these wars.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  So I've put together with the crew a compilation.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  There's even more tomorrow. There's so many of these that we haven't even had time
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  to download them all and get them all ready for air.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  I don't know. There's seven, eight clips coming up after the break
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  that we're going to show you here.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  And these are domesticated people, some black, some white, some Hispanic.
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  But this is what the system has turned us into.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  And this is the plan. It's not my opinion.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  It's in the big social engineer handbooks and things that are out there.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  It's in the 21. So we're going to get into that.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  We're going to get into a bunch of economic news and incredible police state news.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  You know, we reported over a year ago the federal government funding street lights
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  that watch and listen to you while they've come to the town where I live.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  So this country is deep down the rat hole of tyranny.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  That's coming up as well. Strap yourselves in.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  Back in 60 seconds, the news websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  You found the tip of the spear.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Silver Lungs Generator is the only all encompassing professional class product
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.000]  for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements,
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[05:21.000 --> 05:29.000]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere for any application.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver
[05:45.000 --> 05:53.000]  and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing, please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever.
[06:24.000 --> 06:39.000]  Well, I am extremely thankful and glad and humbled by the fact that millions of people
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  don't just join me every weekday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern, on over 120 AM and FM affiliates,
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  including in big cities like Chicago and Dallas, Texas, Chicago, Illinois and Dallas, Texas, also XM Channel 166.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  I am very honored and blessed that millions of people, over a million and a half a day,
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  visit infowars.com and prisonplanet.com respectfully.
[07:03.000 --> 07:12.000]  And we are here again on the Sunday transmission, the 30th day of September 2012.
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  We are here every Sunday, so I am live on the radio, 6 days a week.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.000]  We are also streaming a channel casting video at prisonplanet.tv right now of myself,
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  the documents, the articles and the guests that is coming up in the next hour.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  Speaking of the next hour, GMO victory within reach, Proposition 37 is likely to pass,
[07:35.000 --> 07:43.000]  it declares LA Times, that will simply ask that all the food be labeled if it has genetically modified organisms in it.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  And that means basically cross species chimeras.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  It's one thing to breed plants and to even hybridize them with other similar species,
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  but to put, say, insect genes into them or to add pesticide into it where the plant grows a pesticide so bugs can't eat it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  If they do, they die, but then you eat it. I mean, no wonder in all the lab studies,
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  the rats are dying of being poisoned and getting cancer and dying young and becoming sterile.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  And there's literally hundreds of big studies.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  And this is all coming to a head right now.
[08:16.000 --> 08:25.000]  We'll be talking, coming up for part of the next hour with Dr. Peter Glidden, always informative.
[08:25.000 --> 08:34.000]  We'll be looking at that in depth. So a big victory that all the major polls show, 2 to 1, out in California, of course.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  Stalin said, I don't care how you vote because I count the things.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  So don't hold your breath too long.
[08:44.000 --> 08:53.000]  Because even if you love GMO, I mean, even if you love salmon mixed with insects that's extincting the regular salmon in the Pacific Ocean,
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  even if you think that's a great thing, can we just have it labeled?
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  I mean, can I just know if milk has bovine growth hormone in it that's got girls going into puberty when they're about seven years old?
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  Can I just know if the plastic has bisphenol that's an estrogen member?
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  Because, you know, a male sperm count in Europe in the U.S. is down by 87%.
[09:14.000 --> 09:24.000]  Can I just know, can I just find out why even the glands in men's brains are flipping during adolescence and becoming basically female?
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  That can happen in fish and reptiles too.
[09:26.000 --> 09:35.000]  If you're exposed to certain chemicals and hormones, the glands in your body will flip to putting out hormones for a female.
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  You know, that's why you hear about the streams and rivers, the fish are becoming bisexual, the amphibians, the froggies are.
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  We're being chemically manipulated and I have the government documents where they're doing it by design, Dr. Glidden coming up.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  Okay, that said, we're also going to get into, well, all over the country.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Austin is now getting theirs.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  In fact, it's in the federal announcements.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  I'm going to be doing print articles on it later in the week and I'm sure it'll make national news.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  If you can't hint to other media, if you'd like, you know, wonder why you have no readers or viewers, you could scoop me, you could go look this up and find out it's true.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  I probably won't get around to it until Tuesday or Wednesday.
[10:16.000 --> 10:28.000]  But I have confirmed Austin, where I live, is putting in the IntelliStreets type systems with the new street lights with microphones and cameras hidden in them.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  Hooked into the cable boxes back to the Threat Fusion Center.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  So, big brother, eat your heart out.
[10:38.000 --> 10:50.000]  So, we're going to be going over that and tying it into some announcements here where, well, you're not going to get insurance soon unless you put satellite tracker boxes that, by the way, tax you by the mile in your car.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  And they're mandated to get car insurance, so now they just mandate that the car insurance to get it, you've got to be tracked.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  And, of course, they'll control and tax you.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  And that's the official plan. It's been the global plan for about 15 years.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  And now, well, here it comes. You might want to fight it or maybe not.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  It's so cool to just give in to tyranny and be domesticated and take your Prozac, even if you don't drink your shitty water.
[11:15.000 --> 11:29.000]  AP a few years ago did a study finding that every major municipal water supply, even water supplies that weren't out of reservoirs that didn't have sewage runoff in them, had high levels of generic serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  What does that mean? It wasn't runoff. It didn't accidentally get in there.
[11:33.000 --> 11:44.000]  And it wasn't a LuVox or Prozac. It wasn't a particularly tweaked designer serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It's being added.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  Oh, you're not upset right now, are you?
[11:48.000 --> 12:07.000]  Just like Harvard study last month admitted one part per million of sodium fluoride, and they even took an electron out to make it even more deadly and more psychoactive, just a little bit of that in your drinking water and you get a massively lowered IQ and you're more mentally and physically flaccid.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  You're more passive. That's why the Soviets used it in their water supplies in the 30s.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  And then Hitler picked it up from them. That's even in Pulitzer Prize winning book. It came out in the Nuremberg trials, but so what if the Nazis put it in the water?
[12:20.000 --> 12:30.000]  I mean, our government does it because they're good people. Our government shot up the black people with the syphilis because they're good people, too, and atomic soldiers and radiated thousands of foster children to death.
[12:30.000 --> 12:42.000]  And you've heard about all the tests that are still ongoing that they declassify, including U.S. Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, paragraph B. You remember that?
[12:42.000 --> 12:53.000]  Or they say, we can't do any secret testing on you unless it's experimental. And then we can do lethal test on you. And see, they say they're studying you.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  They're the scientific controllers.
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  So that's coming up in the next hour. But as we get ready to go to break here in a few minutes, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  Everybody has heard the Elmo lady.
[13:11.000 --> 13:26.000]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone. He got Obama in president, you know. He gave us a phone. He gave you a phone. How do you give you a phone? You sign up.
[13:26.000 --> 13:35.000]  This woman is now an international sensation. No one has discovered her name. I'm putting out a $5,000 bony.
[13:35.000 --> 13:58.000]  The quicker picker upper to the first person that gets me her name and phone number and gets her on the show. In fact, I've told the crew that that I believe this woman have given standup lines would probably be bigger than Bill Hicks and Richard Pryor combined.
[13:58.000 --> 14:07.000]  This woman's comedic genius is, well, bordering on Godlike. In fact, I'm telling her right now, I'd like to be her manager.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  And I mean, everybody I know cannot quit talking about her.
[14:11.000 --> 14:21.000]  And I want to say this, Obama and the government says that if you see a rainbow, you didn't build that. God didn't build that. They built that. If you build a log cabin, you didn't build that. Government built that.
[14:21.000 --> 14:33.000]  If you even think something's beautiful, even your own thoughts aren't yours. Government built that. But I do have to give government and the great society and the domestication process.
[14:33.000 --> 14:48.000]  I do have to give you the credit. You did build the Obama lady as she is now known. Now, here's the deal. The Washington Post and others are saying it's racist to make fun of this lady.
[14:48.000 --> 14:59.000]  You know, I've played some goofy white people on air and I played goofy Hispanics on air. People are funny. But I admit it is sad. It's painful but also funny at the same time.
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  But we should talk about government domestication and what it does to people. And the fact that I've got other news articles here saying, well, this is just a bad example.
[15:07.000 --> 15:18.000]  This is cherry picking. Really, I have unlimited clips. I'm going to play like eight of them when we come back. Of people just as sad and pitiful and ridiculous as this woman.
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  Obama gave us all the phone. He's going to do more. And again, I'm not sure who she is. I mean, it's like a cross between Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster and Elmo.
[15:28.000 --> 15:40.000]  Fast forward 50 years, a lot of wear and tear. And then worship of big government reflected glory. Look, you can't criticize Mitt Romney when he said, hey, 47% don't care.
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.000]  They'll do whatever they're told. They love big government because they are on the dole. And that's always been the plan. And it's working like a charm.
[15:49.000 --> 15:59.000]  Public schools are meant to dumb you down. I've got the Department of Education documents on that. Get ready. We'll be back with more.
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eat foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[16:33.000 --> 16:40.000]  I recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we've all known this was coming. You know about their delicious long term storeable foods.
[16:40.000 --> 16:53.000]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today. And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs. Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[16:53.000 --> 17:11.000]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.

[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  Oh, you bet I do.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  I love it.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[20:34.000 --> 20:46.000]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, blasting out across my beloved America and beyond.
[20:46.000 --> 20:52.000]  We thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide Sunday transmission.
[20:52.000 --> 21:01.000]  How do you take the freest, wealthiest nation in the world founded and built on rugged individualism and enslave it? Well, you domesticate its people.
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  What's happened in our country is not new. It happened in Rome going back about 2000 years ago.
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  Took about 300 years, but Rome became, well, the most decadent system the world's ever seen and I've studied a lot of history.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  And the same things now happened here.
[21:16.000 --> 21:24.000]  And there is a $1.6 billion program to hand out. Well, some people have gotten over 200 phones.
[21:24.000 --> 21:32.000]  And sure, the program was there if you were poor in a rural area and had a medical problem for a landline.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  But now it's been expanded and Obama has advertised it.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  They're now advertising an Obama e-card for women saying you can borrow $18,000 to help pay for birth control.
[21:46.000 --> 21:53.000]  I mean, Obama is emailing out e-cards to people saying you're going to get free goodies. You hear the ads everywhere going,
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  it doesn't matter if you've got jobs in a house in a car, you can get an electronic food stamps.
[21:58.000 --> 22:04.000]  And then you can get up to $50 cash a day with that. People walk up, they swipe it.
[22:04.000 --> 22:12.000]  Folks don't even know this, even though it's in the ads. It's online. When you follow the ad to the online area for the federal websites,
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.000]  it tells you you can't buy cigarettes and liquor with this, but you can get cash. You get cash back.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  So you're buying your different welfare goodies, your food and stuff.
[22:23.000 --> 22:31.000]  And then you just get some cash and go back through line and buy your carton of cigarettes and your whiskey or whatever it is you're buying.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  So my point is that the globalist, they want you dependent on government because you've got mega banks,
[22:38.000 --> 22:47.000]  crony capitalists who get on average about three to one corporate welfare to themselves for every dollar of welfare,
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  every euro of welfare that goes to the welfare class.
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  Then the welfare class will riot if the government ever gets cut back or if they don't get their goodies and if they don't get their welfare check.
[22:57.000 --> 23:05.000]  It's not even a welfare check now. It's if the credits aren't put on their little welfare card.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  And then people that have worked their whole lives, their money is taken and put in a government account and spent immediately.
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.000]  It's called Social Security. And then that's a Ponzi scheme and then you're held hostage for your money.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  So see, they make you dependent even if you don't want to be dependent.
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  And now they've got one way or another more than half this country is getting a government check.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  It's not just 47%. It's worse than that.
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  And I've got the Washington Post here today with the headline, racism could sway the election.
[23:35.000 --> 23:42.000]  And it basically says that the implication that people don't like the welfare state.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  Well, that's just racist. And that's what I'm hearing now.
[23:45.000 --> 23:52.000]  I've seen all sorts of articles flat out saying, if you play the Obama lady, you're racist. Really?
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  So if I play anybody saying funny stuff or embarrassing stuff here on air, I'm bad.
[23:58.000 --> 24:04.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just if it's a quote minority, which if you put them all together are the majority in this country basically now.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  So here are a bunch of these clips. It'll take more than just the segment to get to them.
[24:09.000 --> 24:16.000]  Here's the famous Obama phone lady, tens of millions of views online, every talk show in the country playing it.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  Drudge Report launched this Thursday.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip one more time. Here it is.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  You got Obama phone.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority got Obama phone.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  He put Obama in president, you know, he gave us a phone.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  He gave you a phone. How do you give you a phone?
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  You sign up if you're on full stamps, you on social security, you got low income, you disability.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  Hey, I have a question. Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  Romney, he sucks. Okay.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  All right, now that's real. You know, at first people said it wasn't real.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  And then now it's racist to show that. No, no, what's racist is the Democratic Party.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  And I'm not even partisan. People know that. I just, I just hate the facts though.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  I mean, that's the party of slavery, Robert Byrd, the Klansman, but that's okay because he hands out goodies.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  You know, the now late Robert Byrd.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  And if you read Margaret Sanger, who Hitler came from, he gave her awards.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  He gave him awards. She said, we're going to pose as liberals.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  We're going to get blacks dependent.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  And in the fifties, blacks had less illegitimacy than whites.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  There were less out of wedlock black children.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  And the quote, great society was not to empower blacks.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  It was we're going to give you money. A man can't be in the house.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  And we're going to promote and pump in gangster culture to get your men to become gang bangers.
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.000]  And now I exported that into the entire culture. That's why they force feed the gangbanger garbage that you see in the rap videos and the rest of it.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  I'm going to cover that a little bit later.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  But first off, let's go ahead and go to the next clip here because I'll never get to these if I keep talking.
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.000]  Let's go to the next little clip here. There's so many of them.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  This is Obama is going to pay my mortgage. This is from four years ago.
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.000]  There's literally dozens of these at the celebration that night in Chicago when he won.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  There was just countless people saying it's all over.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  I don't worry about my car, my mortgage, you name it. Of course you do, lady. You do. Here it is.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  Peggy Joseph took her daughter out of school early Wednesday for this.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Her emotions ran high following Obama's speech.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  It was the most memorable time of my life.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  It was a touching moment because I've never thought to say whatever happened.
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car. I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  If I help him, he's going to help me.
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  Yeah, Obama's going to help you. $22 billion to ship General Motors to Brazil, China and Eastern Europe.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  The vault and Cadillac plants.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  I'll say that again. The bailout money was to build new factories overseas.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Believe me, just type it into a search engine.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  Okay, he's really going to help you with NAFTA and GATT. Folks, they want you domesticated.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this next clip.
[27:11.000 --> 27:20.000]  This is a town hall. This is a fellow begging him and thanking him for all the free goodies he's going to get.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  Oh, it's such a blessing to see you, Mr. President. Thank you for taking time out of your day.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  Oh, gracious God. Thank you so much.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  Oh, gracious God. He is their God.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  Now, the second thing is that you will actually benefit from the tax breaks that we're talking about,
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  so you'll be able to keep a little bit extra money because we're going to offset your payroll tax.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  That's going to help.
[27:42.000 --> 27:51.000]  We want to make it easier for you to afford going to college by giving you this refundable tax credit for your tuition.
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  We've got to make sure that we are giving them a pathway so that they can educate themselves and go as far as their dreams take them.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  Thank you very much, Fort Myers. I appreciate you.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  Unbelievable. Let's go to one more before we go to break and come back with more.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  Here's the lady begging him pitifully for a small car in a kitchen, and he says,
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  oh, we're going to help you. We're going to get for it. Here it is. We'll go out to break with this.
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  A very small vehicle for my family and I delivered it.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  We need urgent and not having authority. We have two years waiting to listen.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  We need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to. We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help.
[28:32.000 --> 28:41.000]  Well, listen. Hold on. We're going to go to break and come back with this again. This is so sick.
[28:41.000 --> 28:49.000]  This woman thinks only government can give her stuff. Where do you think the money comes from, lady, from somebody else?
[28:49.000 --> 28:59.000]  Well, they're right back. Infowars.com is the news website. It's numero no.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.

[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[30:19.000 --> 30:35.000]  You can get your supply from e-foods direct.
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  But here's some good news.
[30:36.000 --> 30:50.000]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[30:50.000 --> 31:00.000]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:11.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[31:11.000 --> 31:22.000]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.

[32:12.000 --> 32:22.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[32:22.000 --> 32:32.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[32:32.000 --> 32:42.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[32:42.000 --> 32:52.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[32:52.000 --> 33:02.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[33:02.000 --> 33:12.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[33:12.000 --> 33:22.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[33:22.000 --> 33:32.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[33:32.000 --> 33:42.000]  People on welfare, it's basically like a killer whale locked up at SeaWorld or something thinking that's the whole ocean.
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  The few feet it has to swim and begging for fish instead of living out in the open ocean itself.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  That's what the giant welfare state has turned into.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  And it's disgusting and we are now a bankrupt destroyed country.
[33:57.000 --> 34:02.000]  And the illegitimacy, the dumbing down, there's no doubt what's happening.
[34:02.000 --> 34:13.000]  And you've got these people begging for houses, begging for cars, begging for free phones, and the money is being taken from the people that actually work.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  The middle class, the working poor, the nouveau rich, they're the people that actually build an economy.
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  NAFTA GATT has shut us down, tax incentives to move overseas, the mega rich.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  I'm talking to people that control hundreds of billions, that have billions themselves.
[34:29.000 --> 34:37.000]  They write countless books talking to each other, bragging about how they use welfare to control and dumb people down.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  And to use the giant hordes of poor as political weapons against the middle class.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  The middle class has shrunk by about half since 1967.
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  Economist Dr. Paul Greg Roberts was breaking that down just last week in a big article.
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  Mainstream media says it shrunk not by half, but close to it.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  I mean, we know what is happening. We know.
[35:00.000 --> 35:07.000]  We know the end game of this, of this nanny state, public schools where you can't run at recess.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  Now, first they banned dodgeball.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  Now they want to ban football saying it's hurting people.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  I mean, there are resting mothers in rural areas of South Texas because their children are playing in their own cul-de-sac on bicycles.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  Saying that's abusive. It's a joke.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  What we put up with in this country.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  Now let's go back to this pitiful woman at a town hall with Obama.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  Because there's just countless clips. I'm gonna have an air more tomorrow.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  Saying, you know, I need a car, I need a kitchen, the parks aren't enough.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  I need all this stuff.
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  And Obama is sitting there saying, don't worry, I'll get it for you. Here it is.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  The apartment and homelessness, a very small vehicle for my family and I delivered.
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.000]  We need urgent and not housing authorities have two years waiting to listen.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  We need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to.
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  Well, listen, what's your name? What's your name?
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  It's Henry at a Hughes.
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  Okay, it's Hughes. Well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  But for a lot of people like you, I look around and feel like they were kids.
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.000]  It's like a cross between a Benny Hinn TV revival where they ask you at the back what your helmet is.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  You write it down and then Benny Hinn announces it out.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  Hey woman, she has just had surgery on her gallbladder.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  Oh, that's me. How did you know? She is 67. How did you know that?
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  By the way, in most of the cases where these women, remember there were dozens of them four years ago on the campaign trail?
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  Most of the cases, they didn't give them anything. That woman, they did actually give a house.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  I mean, this is so amazing. It reminds me of John Gotti, the famous gangster.
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  He would actually like hand out free pizzas, hand out turkeys on Thanksgiving.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  He'd put on a fireworks display for the neighborhood.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  But then he'd also burn down your cleaners or your grocery store if you didn't pay him 30% of your profit.
[37:07.000 --> 37:13.000]  But it's all right because, you know, he gives me a pizza or he gave me a turkey on Thanksgiving.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  I mean, it's all just mafia tactics, totally disgusting.
[37:18.000 --> 37:26.000]  Let's go to this lady. This is just from last week on Fox News bragging how she was given just unlimited phones.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  And then the people go out and then they sell them to other people.
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  And remember, the illegal aliens get in state tuition when American citizens can't even get that.
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's all about bankrupting this country and bringing in groups of people that will vote to take our guns,
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  take our private property, and then it's game over.
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.000]  And they've almost won, ladies and gentlemen. They got paramilitary police who are dependent on government.
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  It's all coming together, isn't it? Everybody works for the man.
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  And the man, well, he is a son of a bitch, isn't he?
[37:55.000 --> 38:03.000]  The guy that runs the whole deal is a eugenicist, corporate, crony capitalist, monopoly man who hates you and your family.
[38:03.000 --> 38:11.000]  Excuse my polyvue Francais. Let's go ahead now and go to the bucket of phones. Just a little clip of this report.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  I have another one in my pocket, too.
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  Baltimore City resident Monique Crawford has plenty of cell phones.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  I have about, like, six of my personnel.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  And a few more at home.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  Each and every one of these phones work at home. I know I have about 30 and all I'm on.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  But how did she manage to amass such a cellular jackpot?
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  How long did it take you to get all these phones?
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  About 10 minutes to get this one. Just a minute. I walked out with this one. Just a minute.
[38:35.000 --> 38:43.000]  Well, partly thanks to you. That's because anyone who pays a cell phone bill also subsidizes the phones filling up Monique's purse.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  Courtesy of a charge buried in your monthly bill called a universal access fee.
[38:49.000 --> 38:57.000]  Private prepaid cell phone companies are now giving away phones to people in Baltimore and dozens of other students who receive government aid.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  They gave out over a million in Ohio.
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.000]  Here's the daily, a date and daily news, dating newspaper.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  Fees on a phone bill pays out 1.5 billion per year.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  The number I saw was 1.6 billion, but whatever. This is 1.5, whatever.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  Again, these people, ladies and gentlemen, do not know how to tie their shoelaces.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  They know how to get their welfare card that's got money on it that they go get liquor with.
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.000]  And it's unbelievable. And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.000]  And then those of us that actually have jobs and work, notice how government's all about lecturing us and bossing us.
[39:42.000 --> 39:50.000]  And the TSA says freeze once you're through the checkpoint and checks the Starbucks coffee you buy or the barbecue sandwich you buy in the line.
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  When you buy it, they come and stick probes in it to test it just to dominate you to get in your space.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  And their internal memos have come out where they've been told be imperious, break them.
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  They've been told break us. This is government breaking us.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  Those of us that aren't totally dumbed down drinking fluoride water since we were three years old,
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  shut in front of the television and our crap filled diapers.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  Those of us that had parents that could fight all this and stay away from it.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  I'm sorry, but I've had enough. Let's go ahead and go to this next one.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  This is Obama free money clip.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  Let's go ahead and play that. And then we've got a collectivism clip.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  But here's a woman on the big Detroit talk station.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  I'll give you the call at her tournament when we play the video.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  And here she is going. It's free money. It came from Obama. Here it is.
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  Do you know today how much money you're getting? No, I won't. But I'm waiting for a phone call. Where's the money coming from?
[40:46.000 --> 40:52.000]  I believe it's coming from the city of Detroit or the state. Where do they get it from?
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  Some funds that was forgiven by Obama. And where did Obama get the funds?
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  Obama got the funds from... I have no idea.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  You know where he got them letting?
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  Why are you here? To get some money. What kind of money?
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  Obama money. Where did Obama get it?
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  I don't know. It's there. I don't know. I don't know. Where he got it from?
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  What he gave it to us to help us? We love them. That's why we put it forward.
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  Obama! Obama!
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  And then you've got the kids like literal sheeple going...
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  Obama! Obama! Obama! Obama!
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  These children are like...
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  Well, they're like totally domesticated and they're learning how to go beg.
[41:43.000 --> 41:50.000]  They're learning how to beg and stand in government lines and get filled with all the vaccines and eat GMO food all day.
[41:50.000 --> 41:58.000]  And now Michelle Obama has written the guidelines that under federal funds all the states are ordered to now eat what they say.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  The federal government has no jurisdiction and it gets worse.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  She's not worried about GMO, aspartame. No, no. Oh, that's fine.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  She's telling you you need more this or that and not protein.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  And the kids are complaining and saying this is enough food, but it's worse.
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  Remember two years ago, Illinois, under the federal program was a pilot.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  Wouldn't let parents pack lunches because, quote, they couldn't be trusted.
[42:20.000 --> 42:27.000]  I've now confirmed all over the U.S. in public training camps, government and doctoration centers.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  They're saying you can't pack lunches for your children.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  And again, your kid can't play in the backyard or the front yard or in the cul-de-sac.
[42:35.000 --> 42:42.000]  We're going to arrest your butt because we're the government and we want to throw you in jail to give you a record because then that makes you a slave.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  That's what this is. If they can't get you dependent on welfare, they're going to get you in the criminal injustice system.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  Or they're going to get you so sick from all the cancer viruses and the vaccines and the GMO, you're in their medical tyranny.
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  We'll be back with more clips and Obama saying he loves collectivism straight ahead.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  There's still evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi,
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  But here's some good news.

[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  I've had a lot of fun doing this.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  The art department we've hired, the editors, all the people.
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  The second edition is out.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  The first one was the economic collapse.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  The banksters declared they've conquered our economy.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  And it breaks down all the globalist stone statements.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  Print 2.0.
[48:15.000 --> 48:23.000]  We saved a few thousand of those back because 30 plus thousand, I don't know, 37,000 of them sold out in a day and a half.
[48:23.000 --> 48:30.800]  And we are probably going to be sold out in a few days of the October issue, which is
[48:30.800 --> 48:35.560]  the transhumanism, globalist-owned admissions of how they plan to replace us with robots
[48:35.560 --> 48:42.920]  and drones, so the military can't say no to exterminating the population, nanotech, October

[49:48.560 --> 49:54.040]  beautiful because I designed it, Hunter Orange stamped infowars.com, don't tread on me, bulk
[49:54.040 --> 49:59.360]  app, the one there on the tables when I actually wore into work today on the top of my big
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.800]  pumpkin head, so it's there and again I didn't build or design that cap, Obama did, government
[50:05.800 --> 50:06.800]  did.
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.480]  I saw a rainbow yesterday and whether it was storming here in Austin, a huge horizon to
[50:10.480 --> 50:15.560]  horizon double rainbow and I thought, God didn't build that, government did, or some
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.000]  things are casting, not being blasphemous there, but I mean according to government,
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  they built it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.440]  There is no God according to government, saw some flowers today, you know creation, whatever
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.440]  didn't build that, government did, so again my new magazine is out, government built
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.920]  it, so you might want to read what government built, I guess in a way government did build
[50:31.920 --> 50:32.920]  it with all their tyranny.
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.280]  What I do know they built is these poor people, let's start at the beginning and play these
[50:36.280 --> 50:41.520]  clips end to end in the last four years of Obama minions begging for goodies, we've
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.200]  got more tomorrow, because the media is only playing a couple of these clips, so we ferried
[50:45.200 --> 50:51.120]  it out a whole bunch of them, here they are, here's the rock star known as Obama lady,
[50:51.120 --> 51:18.120]  but the media bemoans may actually lose Obama the election, here it is, you know what's
[51:18.120 --> 51:23.840]  sad about this, this woman is proud, she just would pleasure, like she's announcing she
[51:23.840 --> 51:27.800]  won an Oscar, or she's announcing she won the 100 yard dash, or she's announcing she's
[51:27.800 --> 51:32.080]  sold a painting for $20,000, or she's announcing that she got the big business deal, or that
[51:32.080 --> 51:36.560]  her daughter got married, or that you know she just beat cancer, I mean the satisfaction
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.560]  is just, you know if you're on disability, you're on food stamps, you get it, he gave
[51:40.560 --> 51:45.520]  us a phone, he's going to do more, she's like yeah, yeah, here let's go to more of these
[51:45.520 --> 51:49.840]  poor victims, here's another one where Obama's going to pay her mortgage, and her car and
[51:49.840 --> 51:53.560]  everything else, everything's handled, Obama's going to take care of it as the country shuts
[51:53.560 --> 51:58.720]  down and the cities collapse, and the jobs move overseas, and the IQs are dropping in
[51:58.720 --> 52:05.200]  this country, that's not education, we're getting physically stupider, here it is, Peggy
[52:05.200 --> 52:10.600]  Joseph took her daughter out of school early Wednesday for this, her emotions ran high following
[52:10.600 --> 52:19.040]  Obama's speech, it was the most memorable time of my life, pit pause, back it up, government
[52:19.040 --> 52:23.360]  is the most memorable thing in her life, I mean these are actors that couldn't get jobs,
[52:23.360 --> 52:29.720]  these are PR front men for mega corporations, I had that CNN reporter, that three time Emmy
[52:29.720 --> 52:35.240]  award winner, who basically quit even when they threatened her to come after because
[52:35.240 --> 52:39.160]  they were telling her to cover up massacres by Al Qaeda, the government was running basically,
[52:39.160 --> 52:48.280]  I had Amber Lyon on, I mean just think about how corrupt this whole media system is, and
[52:48.280 --> 52:52.480]  she was talking about how foreign governments are funding what CNN puts on the news, and
[52:52.480 --> 52:56.320]  of course that's actually been in the news for a while but it's back of the paper, folks
[52:56.320 --> 53:00.240]  when you see sitcoms, dramas and movies and it promotes socialism and Obamacare, your
[53:00.240 --> 53:06.040]  tax money pays for that, that's admitted tens of billions a year of your money, you wonder
[53:06.040 --> 53:11.400]  why there's anti-family messages on TV, you wonder why there's anti-heterosexual stuff,
[53:11.400 --> 53:14.840]  I'm not against quote gay people, but I'm tired of them being against me, at least the
[53:14.840 --> 53:20.520]  ones in the government, because they're anti-family, they're anti-population, when you watch television
[53:20.520 --> 53:26.440]  folks it hates you, it wants to destroy you, the messages, look at how, look at how I was
[53:26.440 --> 53:33.320]  talking to a former top MTV exec, I'll just leave it at that, just a few days ago about
[53:33.320 --> 53:37.840]  how in the mid-90s they ordered them, even though it wasn't popular to force-feed gangster
[53:37.840 --> 53:44.000]  rap, what was that photo I saw on the drugs report of that big fat rapper, rapper's young,
[53:44.000 --> 53:51.320]  Jeezy and Rick Ross in angry fight at BOT, B-O-T-B-E-T awards, with shots fired and it
[53:51.320 --> 53:55.920]  shows the guy with his pants hanging down, which means you're a punk in prison, it means
[53:55.920 --> 54:00.360]  you're raped in prison, means you're a male prostitute, and he's got a fur coat on with
[54:00.360 --> 54:05.280]  a giant belly, I mean it's like Jabba the Hutt and everyone's screaming because Sumner
[54:05.280 --> 54:11.160]  Redstone force-fed this to destroy our youth and our culture, just like they've done the
[54:11.160 --> 54:16.520]  black community, I mean this is death folks, the black community had less than 10% in legitimacy
[54:16.520 --> 54:22.040]  60 years ago, now it's over 92%, I mean and then you're talking to somebody at the top
[54:22.040 --> 54:28.280]  of MTV, a household name, and they're in these meetings and have arguments with people where
[54:28.280 --> 54:37.280]  they know they force-fed gangster rap garbage to destroy the community, it is a psychological
[54:37.280 --> 54:45.280]  warfare weapon showing kids that a fat man in his underwear like a joke, show the photo
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.920]  above that with him in the stupid fur coat, I mean what a disgusting joke, but again they've
[54:50.920 --> 54:55.640]  learned that they can tell us something school, if they told Yuppies jumping off a cliff for
[54:55.640 --> 55:00.400]  school they do it, they tell them, Laura Steinem said it's cool to get an abortion, just came
[55:00.400 --> 55:06.320]  out and did a poster campaign and women went out to get pregnant to have one, gay men are
[55:06.320 --> 55:12.880]  called bug chasers, even Rolling Stone reported on this, they want to get HIV, you want HIV,
[55:12.880 --> 55:17.800]  you want to get gunned down, you're cool when you've been to prison, it's a death culture
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.600]  so the corporations can destroy this country and take it over, the corporations that aren't
[55:21.600 --> 55:28.160]  free market, go ahead and show the Obamatown hall with the woman begging, let's go out
[55:28.160 --> 55:35.040]  with this second hour coming up, here it is, here's the Obamatown hall lady, a very small
[55:35.040 --> 55:40.840]  vehicle for my family and I delivered, we need urgent, and the housing authorities have
[55:40.840 --> 55:47.480]  two years waiting to listen, we need something more than the vehicle and the parks go to,
[55:47.480 --> 55:54.960]  we need our own kitchen and our own bathroom, please help, please help us, listen, I need
[55:54.960 --> 55:59.960]  you, I need government, it's Henrietta Hughes, oh goodness Hughes, well we're going to do
[55:59.960 --> 56:06.160]  everything we can to help you, but for a lot of people like you, I don't want to do everything
[56:06.160 --> 56:11.360]  we can, all right, but the, all right, let's stop right there, you know who helped Henrietta
[56:11.360 --> 56:17.880]  Hughes, a state representative, Cheyenne Thompson, wife of state representative Nick Thompson,
[56:17.880 --> 56:23.400]  who heard a private citizen went and helped her, so there you go lady, and that poor woman
[56:23.400 --> 56:28.920]  shouldn't have to get the globalist they destroyed her and now she's reduced to begging, begging
[56:28.920 --> 56:34.080]  to that Chicago mafia teleprompter reading front man, Barack Obama, let's go out with
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.560]  clip seven, we haven't played yet, collectivism, we're going to go out with collectivism, I
[56:38.560 --> 56:46.000]  want to loop this, this is Obama saying he believes in collectivism, he believes in redistribution
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.360]  and for every 10 pieces of gold the bankers keep, they give their slaves one piece, here
[56:50.360 --> 56:52.480]  it is, we'll go out to break with this, here it is.
[56:52.480 --> 56:58.960]  I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pull resources
[56:58.960 --> 57:05.960]  and hence facilitate some redistribution because I actually believe in redistribution, at least
[57:05.960 --> 57:12.160]  at a certain level, to make sure that everybody's got a shot.
[57:12.160 --> 57:15.580]  Yeah, everybody's got a thrust, you want to make sure we don't have a shot.
[57:15.580 --> 57:18.200]  You want to make sure we don't have a shot.
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.420]  You want to make sure we don't have a shot?
[57:23.420 --> 57:25.960]  You want to make sure we don't have a shot Obama?
[57:25.960 --> 57:30.080]  You want to make sure we're dependent on you and the mafia scumbag government?
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.760]  Yeah, some redistribution, more than half the wealth in this country is redistributed
[57:34.760 --> 57:38.200]  and the mega-rich are exempt paying zero tax offshore
[57:38.200 --> 57:40.440]  and if people would try to stay here in this country
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.840]  we're taxing over 75% one way or another!
[57:43.840 --> 57:45.880]  Hour number two coming up!
[57:45.880 --> 57:46.720]  Yeah!
[57:50.080 --> 57:52.360]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks
[57:52.360 --> 57:54.960]  adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick
[57:54.960 --> 57:55.560]  and die?
[57:55.560 --> 57:58.000]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.880]  My friends, I've done a lot of research
[57:59.880 --> 58:03.720]  and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure.
[58:03.720 --> 58:07.080]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[58:07.080 --> 58:09.000]  Its filters are silver and pregnated
[58:09.000 --> 58:10.600]  to prevent bacterial growth.
[58:10.600 --> 58:12.200]  There's no priming required.
[58:12.200 --> 58:14.480]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[58:14.480 --> 58:18.080]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[58:18.080 --> 58:19.640]  Easy to set up and use.
[58:19.640 --> 58:21.080]  Doesn't require electricity.
[58:21.080 --> 58:24.240]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[58:24.240 --> 58:26.800]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,
[58:26.800 --> 58:27.560]  which is key.
[58:27.560 --> 58:29.520]  Save money by not buying bottled water
[58:29.520 --> 58:31.760]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[58:31.760 --> 58:34.480]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[58:34.480 --> 58:36.040]  It's what my family uses.
[58:36.040 --> 58:39.360]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[58:39.360 --> 58:42.080]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,

[58:49.880 --> 58:50.880]  Aaron Fullen here.
[58:50.880 --> 58:52.920]  As the food police shut down food co-ops,
[58:52.920 --> 58:56.040]  the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access,
[58:56.040 --> 58:58.040]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[58:58.040 --> 58:59.680]  but to healthy, home-crafted sources
[58:59.680 --> 59:02.480]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.440]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods
[59:04.440 --> 59:06.520]  with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[59:06.520 --> 59:08.360]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police
[59:08.360 --> 59:09.280]  are so afraid of.
[59:09.280 --> 59:10.760]  These remarkable foods have been around
[59:10.760 --> 59:13.240]  since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence
[59:13.240 --> 59:15.880]  for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe
[59:15.880 --> 59:17.120]  in almost every culture.
[59:17.120 --> 59:20.720]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges,
[59:20.720 --> 59:23.400]  Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk
[59:23.400 --> 59:25.000]  is a staple for healthy living.
[59:25.000 --> 59:26.080]  But here's some good news.
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.440]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets
[59:28.440 --> 59:30.600]  to making these amazing fermented foods legally
[59:30.600 --> 59:32.280]  and privately in their own homes,
[59:32.280 --> 59:33.880]  since it's still legal to make these foods
[59:33.880 --> 59:35.640]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[59:35.640 --> 59:38.480]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[59:38.480 --> 59:40.480]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[59:40.480 --> 59:42.920]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods,
[59:42.920 --> 59:46.640]  and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[59:46.640 --> 59:49.600]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.560 --> 59:59.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center,
[1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:06.000]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:11.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:16.240]  I've got an interesting statistic here for you.
[1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:25.640]  On executive orders, FDR had 11 and 16 years in office.
[1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:27.760]  That's longer than Hugo Chavez.
[1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:29.720]  Truman had five and seven years.
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:31.520]  ICAD two and eight years.
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:33.440]  JFK had four and three years.
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.680]  LBJ had four and five years.
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:38.520]  Nixon had one in six years.
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.200]  Ford had three and two years.
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:42.120]  Carter had three and four years.
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:43.640]  Reagan had five and eight years.
[1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:48.760]  Bush, the first, Bush 41, had three and four years.
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:50.560]  Clinton had 15 and eight years.
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:53.360]  Bush had 62 and eight years.
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:58.040]  Obama had 923 and three and a half years.
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:00.600]  And let's understand something here,
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:04.480]  the implications of this, what this means.
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:08.600]  Obama told Congress, hey, I will launch wars,
[1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:10.360]  but not on my prerogative.
[1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:11.280]  That'd be bad enough.
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:15.280]  No, no, the UN and NATO, I mean, it is just amazing.
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.000]  And you've got a dumbed down population.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.080]  You ask, why are they able to do this?
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:23.040]  The people that do have jobs and do not tie their shoelaces,
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:27.160]  well, they're too smart to care about politics
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:28.000]  or what's going on.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.840]  They just watch sports center and act cool all day.
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:33.720]  Meanwhile, have you noticed that there
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:36.040]  was a magical cyber attack over the weekend?
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:39.000]  Right as Obama's set to sign an executive order.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.360]  That's right, Eric Blair at infowars.com reports.
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:46.240]  Cyber attack on US banks is an obvious false flag.
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.520]  Over a month ago, we featured an article titled
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:51.600]  the new order to agenda would move forward
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:54.880]  with this one simple act, which stated the one event
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.840]  that could accomplish all of the agenda's goals
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:01.440]  in one shot would be a false flag cyber attack
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:06.080]  on Western banking institutions that they could pin on Iran.
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:07.920]  Well, guess what they did at this weekend?
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:09.520]  That was a quote from us.
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:13.160]  Please watch this exact scenario unfold
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:16.200]  in the short ABC news clip from a few days ago.
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:19.080]  In fact, guys, I meant to tell you to get that clip,
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:20.760]  try to grab that clip if you can.
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:21.960]  If not, I'll cover it tomorrow,
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:24.160]  but this is just unbelievable.
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:26.840]  And then our original article that broke it all down.
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:29.160]  When we come back from break,
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:33.320]  I'm gonna hit important stack on surveillance society.
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:37.400]  Creepy Nestle, we will find you contest uses chip
[1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:38.320]  to track winner.
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:40.600]  Remember Pennsylvania had a TV ad about
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:42.680]  don't try to not pay your state taxes
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:44.240]  because we're watching you with satellites.
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:46.360]  Remember it zoomed in on them?
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:47.920]  You know, down over, I'm pretty amazing.
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:49.560]  We're gonna cover that.
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:51.480]  But I mean, you know, the globalists talk to us
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:52.640]  like we're five year olds.
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:54.440]  It's like Benjamin yet in Yahoo.
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:56.400]  What a Yahoo.
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:01.400]  He is running around over at the UN.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.680]  And when I first, a few days ago,
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:05.440]  because I didn't really pay attention to it,
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:09.960]  saw news footage of him up there with a car to cut out
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:12.440]  with an ACME, Wiley Coat, bomb, you know,
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:14.600]  the black bomb with the fuse lit.
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:17.280]  I thought someone was like joking about his fear mongering
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:19.440]  because I heard clips of the speech on the radio,
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:20.440]  on news radio.
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:22.040]  I thought it must be a joke.
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:24.280]  And then later I went and looked
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:26.080]  and he actually went up there with a bomb and said,
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:30.320]  look bomb, bomb will boom, boom you.
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:31.760]  Bomb will get you.
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:33.680]  No, there's gonna be bombs
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:36.000]  if they are able to start this fight.
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:42.200]  If we're able to be manipulated into going along with this
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:43.040]  because they wanna do it.
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:44.440]  And I'm not saying Iran's good either.
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.040]  I don't like government period.
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:47.800]  They're all a bunch of freaks.
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:50.840]  But BB thinks if he gets into a big enough war,
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:52.440]  he'll be like the savior forever.
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:57.200]  So when we come back,
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:59.080]  we'll get into this huge surveillance grid
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.720]  the globalists are building all around us.
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.360]  The name of our safety, of course,
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:06.880]  but we're gonna break down microphones
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:08.120]  in your neighborhood, your area.
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:10.040]  And then we've got Dr. Glidden joining us
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:11.840]  to get into some really positive news.
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:13.440]  But it doesn't mean,
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:15.480]  it doesn't mean, well, you know what the wolf says
[1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:18.080]  in Pulp Fiction, you know,
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:19.320]  it's not done till it's done.
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:23.640]  Let's not start completely patting each other on the back.
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:25.440]  Not quite what the wolf says.
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.480]  And I'm out of control today.
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:29.160]  But we're gonna be getting to LA Times says,
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:32.040]  Proposition 37, likely to pass.
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:34.120]  Hey, I'm a throwback.
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.320]  I'm kind of a caveman.
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:37.600]  I like freedom.
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:38.960]  And I guess it's in my blood.
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:41.240]  I'm not bragging, but I am proud of my background.
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:43.560]  I mean, you name it, every revolution for freedom.
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:45.920]  Even before my family got here on the Mayflower
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:48.960]  or at the heart of the Texas Revolution,
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:51.920]  raising Colonel Travis's son, the list goes on and on.
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:54.640]  My family has always been stomping tyrants
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.600]  into the ground and I'm doing it now.
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:01.600]  If you want an American company with American products

[1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:10.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:26.240]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:27.240]  Bomber!
[1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:28.240]  You got Obama phone?
[1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:31.240]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low-bomber!
[1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:32.240]  You got Obama phone?
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.240]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low-minority,
[1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:36.240]  got Obama phone.
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:38.240]  Keep Obama in president, you know?
[1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:40.240]  He gave us a phone?
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:41.240]  He gave you a phone.
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:42.240]  How do you give you a phone?
[1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:44.240]  You sign up if you're on full stamps,
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:47.240]  you're on social security, you got low income,
[1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:48.240]  you just don't get in.
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:50.240]  All right, welcome back.
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.240]  We are into hour number two here in the next segment.
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:54.240]  We've got Dr. Peter Glitton joining us
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:56.240]  to talk about some good news.
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:06:58.240]  LA Times and others report that the polls show,
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:00.240]  scientific polls, two to one,
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:03.240]  for Prop 37 to just allow labeling
[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.240]  of the stinking GMO so we can make a decision.
[1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:09.240]  It's got the fat, it's got the trans fats,
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  it's got the vitamins, the minerals.
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:13.240]  Can I find out if that's got a grasshopper
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:14.240]  or cockroach genes in it,
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  or if it's growing its own pesticides
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:17.240]  so bugs can't eat it,
[1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.240]  or if it's been sprayed with sodium fluoride,
[1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:20.240]  which is a pesticide.
[1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:22.240]  I mean, can I find out?
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:25.240]  Can I find out if there's a growth hormone in that milk?
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:27.240]  I don't want my daughter to be eight feet tall
[1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:29.240]  going to puberty at age three.
[1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:31.240]  Some girls at age three are going into it now
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:33.240]  or get breast cancer at 12.
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.240]  So that's coming up with Dr. Peter Glitton in a moment.
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:38.240]  Let me get into this, though,
[1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:40.240]  because you know about the Nanny State.
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:43.240]  In my film, Police State 2000,
[1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:46.240]  that I released in early 1999,
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:49.240]  my first big hit film, one of the first hits online,
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:52.240]  it was seen millions of times back in 2000
[1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:54.240]  when hardly anybody was really streaming video
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:55.240]  or watching video online,
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:58.240]  just letting you know it's one of our first underground hits.
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:00.240]  It's free online today, Police State 2000,
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:02.240]  full two-hour film.
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:04.240]  But the point is, you know,
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:06.240]  it shows troops all over the country
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  training to confiscate your guns on video
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:10.240]  and admitting it, you know, stuff like that.
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:13.240]  And we show the Austin America statesman
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:16.240]  talking about an $800,000, $844,000
[1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:19.240]  grand to put gunshot detectors in.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:21.240]  So I went and looked up the name of the company,
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:23.240]  went and found their online site,
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  covered it on the radio at the time,
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:27.240]  in 1999,
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:31.240]  and I show that in the film.
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:32.240]  I'm telling you about that
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:34.240]  because you can go watch the film and see
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:37.240]  the film scan of the newspaper,
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:40.240]  front page, metro and state.
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:42.240]  And they just admitted, oh, by the way,
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  it's got microphones,
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:46.240]  and we are listening to you with them.
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.240]  Now, did you ever, in your town,
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:50.240]  as they put them in every major city since then,
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  Austin wasn't the first.
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.240]  We're a small town compared to Chicago, New York, L.A.,
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:55.240]  they had them even before that.
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:58.240]  Now, some big cities have billions of dollars,
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  not millions, billions of dollars.
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  New York has $2 billion.
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:05.240]  Last time I checked in microphones,
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:07.240]  in one microphone rollout,
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:11.240]  what, seven years ago, was $2 billion.
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:13.240]  $2 billion.
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.240]  You ever hear about anybody getting arrested?
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.240]  Does the microphone herd the gunshot?
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.240]  They call them a gunshot detector.
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.240]  Well, it turns out, my parents,
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  I was over at their house last night,
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:24.240]  and my dad said, yeah,
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:26.240]  they're pulling the street lights down around here.
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  They don't work as good, and they put in smart ones.
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:30.240]  So I went out there, this was nighttime last time,
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  back over there today.
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:32.240]  I went over and looked down.
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:33.240]  I'm going to do a piece on this.
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:34.240]  And you know what?
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:36.240]  It's one of the companies that's got the smart system
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:37.240]  that listens to you.
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:40.240]  And I noticed it's wired into the cable.
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:43.240]  Time Warner cable, just like your Tivo is,
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:45.240]  can contract you and watch you and listen to your
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:46.240]  Scientific Atlantic cable box.
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:48.240]  They admit they're watching and listening to you.
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:50.240]  They go, it's all right, computers are doing it.
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:54.240]  And if you read about the IntelliStreet system,
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:57.240]  they say, well, it's to keep you safe.
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:59.240]  It's to keep you safe.
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:03.240]  The computer, it knows sounds of distress and things.
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:05.240]  And then it dials through to the Threat Fusion Center
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  and then calls the police on you.
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:09.240]  But you notice no one's ever really told
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:10.240]  about this being out there.
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:12.240]  Sure, the company's bragged.
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:14.240]  There's government funds.
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:16.240]  If you're watching at PrismPlanet.tv,
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:19.240]  I'm showing you just one company, IntelliStreets,
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:22.240]  showing how they have cameras, microphones.
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:26.240]  It tells them when to come replace the bulb.
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:29.240]  And turns out my dad talked to them while they were installing it
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:31.240]  and they were quite proud of all this.
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:33.240]  But remember when I air this report,
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:36.240]  I will be the bad man for telling you
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:39.240]  that your Streetlight's watching and listening to you.
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:46.240]  Listen to this.
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:47.240]  I'm sitting there reading.
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:51.240]  It says, Streetlight, auto cell control,
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:54.240]  100% dimming on demand light,
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:56.240]  wireless dual band mesh transceiver.
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:58.240]  This is hooked into the cable box.
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:04.240]  App-based wireless control, microphones, speakers.
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:07.240]  Let me just go over their press release for you here.
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  Federally funded Streetlight's capable of recording conversations.
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:13.240]  Now that's from their own site.
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  Talking surveillance cameras coming to the U.S.
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:17.240]  Yeah, they also shout orders.
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.240]  They already have them in England.
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:22.240]  So there are the articles you can go link through.
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:24.240]  And since we talked about it,
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:26.240]  they pulled down a lot of the stuff about recording and cameras.
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.240]  But it's all admitted.
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.240]  Now, with that said, let me play this though,
[1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:32.240]  because they're conditioning everybody.
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:39.240]  The CIA, along with the former L.A. police chief,
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:42.240]  I saw this on History Channel one time,
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:44.240]  admitted that they ran the show SWAT,
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:47.240]  showing SWAT guys to militarize police
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.240]  so all cops would then want to be SWAT
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:51.240]  and then treat us like we're the enemy.
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:53.240]  All the officials, their authorities,
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:55.240]  we're civilians and they're fighting us, the enemy.
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  At least that's the conversion they're trying to have.
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  And I think that police chiefs admit
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:01.240]  that they wear the black uniforms to intimidate us.
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:06.240]  Creepy, nasty, We'll Find You contest uses CHIP to track winner.
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:10.240]  And it shows SWAT teams coming and snatching and grabbing a man
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  out of the store, another man off of the street,
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  and see it's fun to be snatched and grabbed.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.240]  And we've noticed that G20 events in Canada, in the U.S.,
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.240]  and in England, and in Italy,
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:27.240]  that they have men in U.S. military uniforms
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:29.240]  or the host country uniforms being on the nation,
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:31.240]  there's footage of this, that jump out of cars
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:35.240]  and grab role players in front of people just to scare people,
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:38.240]  but also they later admitted to see if the media
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:40.240]  picks up on citizens disappearing.
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:41.240]  And the media doesn't.
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:44.240]  I mean, there were a few articles about men in uniforms
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:46.240]  disappear protesters, but the media was like,
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:47.240]  well, it's probably good.
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:49.240]  And it was all just a show.
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:53.240]  See, it's all psychological warfare to test and probe you,
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:54.240]  the enemy.
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:56.240]  Because foreign banks brag in every major publication,
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.240]  they captured the United States.
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:00.240]  And let's go ahead and play the creepy,
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:03.240]  nasty, We Will Find You contest.
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:27.240]  Here is that clip.
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  We Will Find You with 10,000 Pounds.
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.240]  Pennsylvania TV ad saying,
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  you better pay your state taxes.
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.240]  We're watching you with satellites,
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:12.240]  and it zooms in over them with a satellite
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:14.240]  showing a guy in his backyard.
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:15.240]  They want you to know.
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.240]  And again, this is the nanny state.
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  Wants to make sure you take the vaccines
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:20.240]  filled with cancer viruses.
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:21.240]  Here it is.
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:22.240]  Your name is Tom.
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:24.240]  You live just off of Fifth Street.
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:25.240]  Nice car, Tom.
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:26.240]  Nice house.
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.240]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:32.240]  $4,212 in back taxes.
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:35.240]  Listen, Tom, we can make this easy.
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:37.240]  Pay online by June 18th,
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:39.240]  and we'll skip your penalty
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:41.240]  and take half off your interest.
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:46.240]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:48.240]  Okay, find us before we find you.
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  Pay up.
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:50.240]  You notice that the ads now are,
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:51.240]  it's a roundup.
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:53.240]  It's a roundup for those that have warrants.
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  You know, 11% of Texans have a warrant out right now.
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:58.240]  Saw that number a few weeks ago.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:01.240]  But then when a real roundup starts,
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:02.240]  it's a roundup.
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:03.240]  It's a roundup.
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:04.240]  Military drills everywhere
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  of attacking local state houses,
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:07.240]  taking them over.
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:09.240]  That's in declassified documents.
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  The preparations of the foreign banks
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:12.240]  that have occupied the U.S.,
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:15.240]  now they're phasing out all the final liberties.
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:17.240]  You know, the ads is,
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:19.240]  it's not nice, Tom, that you owe $4,000.
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:22.240]  How about, Tom, we know your mother's dying of cancer
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:23.240]  and you gave her the money, Tom.
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.240]  Tom, we need to ship that money overseas
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:27.240]  of the foreign banks and banker bailouts, Tom.
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:28.240]  What's not nice, Tom,
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:31.240]  is that the U.S. government's been caught kidnapping kids
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  worldwide and shipping them to Saudi Arabia.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:34.240]  In congressional testimony,
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:35.240]  what's not nice, Tom,
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  is that we're full of parasites and criminals, Tom.
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  And we're going to squeeze you, Tom,
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:40.240]  before we kill you
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:42.240]  with all the poison we put in the water, Tom.
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.240]  We're the murdering criminal government mafia
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:45.240]  openly trying to intimidate you
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.240]  with our Welling and TV ads
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:50.240]  to scare you with satellites watching you
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:52.240]  that you paid for with your tax money, Tom.
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:54.240]  You understand we're going to kill you, Tom.
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:56.240]  We're going to kill you, Tom.
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:59.240]  The worst drought in 50 years continues,
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:01.240]  and the first six months of 2012
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:03.240]  marks the hottest half-year on record.
[1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:06.240]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:09.240]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables,
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:12.240]  and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:13.240]  The cost to feed livestock
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:15.240]  is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business,
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:17.240]  blowing up your food prices.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:18.240]  The only strategy to counter this
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:21.240]  is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:23.240]  by getting your own supply of foods
[1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:24.240]  or meat foods direct now.
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:26.240]  As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:28.240]  e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:30.240]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:32.240]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.240]  because we have all known this was coming.
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:37.240]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:40.240]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today,
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:42.240]  and because it's storage for 25 years,
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:43.240]  you're locking in today's prices
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:44.240]  and avoiding the rising food cost.
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:47.240]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:50.240]  or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:57.240]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:16:59.240]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:00.240]  adding poison to your water
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:02.240]  and laughing as you get sick and die?
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:05.240]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:07.240]  My friends, I've done a lot of research,
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:11.240]  and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure.
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:14.240]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:16.240]  Its filters are silver and pregnant
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:17.240]  to prevent bacterial growth.
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:19.240]  There's no priming required.
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:23.240]  It's NSF-42 certified. Optional fluoride filters
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.240]  can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.240]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.240]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:34.240]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:36.240]  which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:39.240]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.240]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:43.240]  It's what my family uses.
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:46.240]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:03.240]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:05.240]  runs from bad to worse.
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:08.240]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:11.240]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:12.240]  to the global takeover.
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:14.240]  That's why we've assembled the most vital
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:18.240]  and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:20.240]  These are items that I did research on,
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:22.240]  that I personally use.
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:24.240]  You've got the LifeStraw so you can turn
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:27.240]  fetted water into safe water anywhere you go.

[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:32.240]  or out in the field.

[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:43.240]  to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:46.240]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:47.240]  Everything that we've researched
[1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:49.240]  and found to be the best is available

[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:11.240]  these pure soap products for years.
[1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:13.240]  These all-natural soaps are made

[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:32.240]  as what you're using now.

[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:37.240]  of soaps for all your cleaning needs.

[1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:09.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:42.240]  You think your private lives think nothing of the kind.
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:45.240]  Foreign megabanks run the spy satellites.
[1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:48.240]  We're watching our slaves all the time.
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:50.240]  They're elemental.
[1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:52.240]  Their site is clean.
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:54.240]  They are perpetual.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:00.240]  They keep the country enslaved.
[1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:02.240]  We are back live.
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:04.240]  I want freedom and more of it.
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:07.240]  I'm aware of the cage being built around me.
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:10.240]  I'm here to get people fired up
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.240]  to defeat this technocracy.
[1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:14.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:18.240]  Here Monday through Friday at 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.240]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 central.
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:25.240]  It is 521 in 26 seconds
[1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:26.240]  and that's what you're listening to.
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:30.240]  Central time, 321 Pacific.
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:33.240]  421 Mountain.
[1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:35.240]  Or I should say Montana.
[1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:37.240]  Montana time.
[1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:39.240]  We are here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:42.240]  Joining us is Peter Glidden, B.S.N.D.,
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:45.240]  naturopathic doctor and host of the Fire Year M.D. now,
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:47.240]  right here on the GCN radio network.
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:50.240]  Dr. Glidden received his B.S. degree from the University
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:52.240]  of Massachusetts at Amherst.
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.240]  He earned an N.D. from Baster University in Seattle,
[1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:56.240]  Washington.
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.240]  He is a member of the American Association of
[1:21:57.240 --> 1:21:58.240]  naturopathic physicians
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:00.240]  and the Illinois Association of
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:01.240]  naturopathic physicians.
[1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:03.240]  And he's syndicated radio husband all over
[1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:04.240]  national TV.
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.240]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:08.240]  He joins us here today, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:11.240]  to get into GLAAD tidings.
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:13.240]  GLAAD tidings for rebel forces.
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:15.240]  The Death Star was destroyed.
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:17.240]  Unfortunately, Darth Vader escaped.
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:18.240]  No.
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:19.240]  L.A. Times says,
[1:22:19.240 --> 1:22:22.240]  Proposition 37, likely to pass.
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:25.240]  Polls, scientific polls and index of them are running
[1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.240]  two to one saying, hey, yeah, can we just know
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:30.240]  if something's got growth hormone in it?
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:32.240]  Hey, can we know it's got pesticide in it?
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  That it grows its own pesticide?
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:37.240]  Hey, that corn that's got other insect genes in it.
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:38.240]  Can I know about that?
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:40.240]  I know it sterilizes the guinea pigs,
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:43.240]  and that's the whole plan, but can I please?
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:45.240]  No, you can't know.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:46.240]  You're evil.
[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:48.240]  The American people, folks, are the only people
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:50.240]  that put up with this, and that's one reason
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:52.240]  we've got the lowest IQs now,
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.240]  or the dumbest, highest cancer rates.
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:56.240]  I mean, they're killing us, coming and going,
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:22:57.240]  but this is good news.
[1:22:57.240 --> 1:22:59.240]  I want to talk to them about this, and again,
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:01.240]  the history of the modern medical system
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:03.240]  condensed that we're under,
[1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:05.240]  and then ways not only to avoid this garbage,
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:08.240]  but ways that the establishment knows full well.
[1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:10.240]  You know, it came out in, what, even,
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.240]  Reuters and the Daily Telegraph a decade ago,
[1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:15.240]  and since then more, that Monsanto
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:17.240]  and any of their laboratories,
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:19.240]  their scientists refuse to have GMOs.
[1:23:19.240 --> 1:23:22.240]  Type in GMO, cafeterias,
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:24.240]  Monsanto, cafeterias don't allow GMO.
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:26.240]  Just don't believe me, look at it now.
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:29.240]  Type it in now, check it.
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.240]  Now this is getting a lot of attention,
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:33.240]  so the worm is starting to turn,
[1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:35.240]  but the empire, hence the Star Wars analogies,
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:36.240]  are striking back.
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:38.240]  They don't want you to be able to know.
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:41.240]  They've even sued milk, natural milk dairy companies
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:43.240]  that label non-GMO.
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:45.240]  They're like, you're not allowed privately
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:47.240]  to say there's no GMO, you scum.
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:50.240]  You don't tell the scum Americans.
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:52.240]  It doesn't have hormones or poison in it,
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:53.240]  or the cows are taken care of.
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:54.240]  You filth?
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:55.240]  Who do you think you are?
[1:23:55.240 --> 1:23:56.240]  You filthy American.
[1:23:56.240 --> 1:23:58.240]  We're watching you.
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:23:59.240]  You want an Obama phone?
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:00.240]  How about that?
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:03.240]  How about I have your soul for an Obama phone?
[1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:04.240]  How about your eyes?
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:05.240]  How about your freedom?
[1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:06.240]  How about your future?
[1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:07.240]  Because we love you.
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:09.240]  Doc, I'm a little bit wound up this Sunday.
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:11.240]  You extremist.
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:13.240]  There's a lot of extremists too,
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:14.240]  all over the country and the world.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:17.240]  People want to know if the corn they're buying
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:20.240]  grows its own pesticide that kills bugs.
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  They think maybe that might not be good for their kids.
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:26.240]  Dr. Glidden, and I'm sure you agree with these extremists.
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:28.240]  People have a good work, brother.
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:30.240]  You know, we're all in the same boat here.
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.240]  All you have to do with this proposition in California
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:34.240]  is follow the money.
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:35.240]  Who's against it?
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:41.240]  Monsanto donated $7,100,000 at Dupont, Dow, Bayer,
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:45.240]  BASF, Plant Science, PepsiCo, and Nestle.
[1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:47.240]  Just follow the money.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:48.240]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:54.240]  It's unbelievable the extent that corporations will go
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:56.240]  to pull the wool over our eyes.
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:58.240]  And we sit back and do nothing about it.
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  Thank God for this proposition.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:02.240]  Thank God for California.
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:07.240]  And thank God for the Alex Jones radio show.
[1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  Thank God for someone evil like you
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:11.240]  that thinks we should be able to label something
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:12.240]  and know what's in it.
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:17.240]  What excuses do you have for yourself, Dr. Glidden?
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:19.240]  It's unbelievable, man.
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:21.240]  All we want to do, right?
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:24.240]  All we want to do is get the companies to tell us
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:27.240]  that they're messing with the genetic material of the plants
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:30.240]  and, oh, no, no, no, we can't do that.
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:33.240]  Oh, no, no, no, that's going to create billions of dollars
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.240]  of frivolous lawsuits, billions of dollars.
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:37.240]  And it's going to create choice.
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:39.240]  And it's going to create freedom.
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:40.240]  And we don't need that.
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.240]  It is unbelievable.
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.240]  You know, you couldn't make this stuff up.
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:46.240]  I mean, Orwell, right?
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:50.240]  If Orwell was alive and saw this stuff going on today,
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.240]  he'd be jumping for joy because you can't make deception
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:57.240]  of this amount of this degree up.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:58.240]  You just can't make it up.
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.240]  It's unbelievable.
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:03.240]  Let's break down the fight in California right now.
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:06.240]  And I saw it's like $25 million now.
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:08.240]  By Monsanto and others, their average contribution
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:12.240]  by the richies is $600,000 against all the little donations,
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:14.240]  a few million to try to beat this.
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:18.240]  Yeah, the opposition against it, $32,500,000.
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:19.240]  Oh, now it's $32 million.
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:21.240]  It was 20 something a few days ago.
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:24.240]  The $32,500,000 and the support, $4 million.
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.240]  $4,4,325,000 against.
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:29.240]  And all of the against money is coming from
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:31.240]  Big Agra Business Corporation.
[1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:32.240]  It's unbelievable.
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:33.240]  Follow the money, baby.
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:36.240]  That's where the truth lies.
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:40.240]  It always lies in the bank.
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:42.240]  Obviously, you, like no one I know,
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:44.240]  is so informed on the history of medicine.
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:45.240]  We're going to break here in a few minutes,
[1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:47.240]  but give us a three-minute break down to the history
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:50.240]  of MD medicine and the big secret there.
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:52.240]  Well, here's the deal.
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:55.240]  The reason that, and this is what nobody looks at,
[1:26:55.240 --> 1:27:01.240]  the reason that these scientists play God with our plants,
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:04.240]  the reason that they do it is because they think
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:06.240]  that they're smarter than nature.
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:08.240]  They think that they're smarter than God.
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:10.240]  Quite frankly, most of them don't even believe in God,
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  or if they do, they don't bring it into the workplace.
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:14.240]  And it's the same with MDs.
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  For the last 300 years, the medical theater in this country
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:22.240]  has been dominated by Newtonian physics,
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:24.240]  reductionistic physics.
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:29.240]  Your MD and the people making these genetically modified foods
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:33.240]  actually believe that they are smarter than God.
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:36.240]  And the MD's view of medicine is,
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:38.240]  well, when you're sick, you're screwed,
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:40.240]  your body can't fix itself.
[1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:42.240]  Your body doesn't have the ability to fix itself.
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:45.240]  Your body doesn't have the necessary stuff.
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:47.240]  The hoodspot affects itself.
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:51.240]  So all that you can do is march in with man-made,
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:53.240]  synthetic pharmaceuticals,
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:57.240]  the intention of which is to override and control
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:00.240]  the current natural metabolism of the body.
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:03.240]  These people are all in the same Newtonian boat.
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:07.240]  It's outdated, old-fashioned, 18th-century physics,
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:09.240]  and it's got to go.
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:11.240]  But nobody calls them on this.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:13.240]  Nobody calls them on it.
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.240]  And the only reason that the MDs are in the number one position
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:18.240]  in this country, and they are,
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:20.240]  the only reason that they're there
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:23.240]  is because they have legislated themselves there.
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:26.240]  Most people think that the MD is in the driver's seat
[1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:28.240]  and their therapeutics must be better.
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:30.240]  Their therapeutics must be safer.
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:32.240]  Their therapeutics must be more scientific.
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:34.240]  Well, they're not.
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:36.240]  The only reason the MDs are in the driver's seat
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:38.240]  is because of drug money.
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:40.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, fire your MD to the death.
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:41.240]  Stay there, stay there.
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:43.240]  Let's talk about the history of this.
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:44.240]  It's on record when we get back,
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:46.240]  and some of the incredible secrets they don't want you to know.
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:48.240]  Now, the average MDs are useful, idiot.
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:50.240]  You know, probably a pretty smart guy.
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:51.240]  Heroic medicine's fine,
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:53.240]  but they don't understand the bigger picture.
[1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:57.240]  They want to treat symptoms, not the cause.
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:28:59.240]  Aaron Fullen here.
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:01.240]  As the food police shut down food co-ops,
[1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:04.240]  the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access,
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:06.240]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:08.240]  but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods,
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.240]  like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:12.240]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:14.240]  with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:17.240]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:20.240]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:23.240]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages
[1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:25.240]  being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.240]  Even today, Japanese eat miso,
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:29.240]  Africans eat fermented porges,
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:30.240]  Koreans eat kamichi,
[1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:33.240]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:34.240]  But here's some good news.
[1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:36.240]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:38.240]  to making these amazing fermented foods
[1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:40.240]  legally and privately in their own homes.
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:42.240]  Since it's still legal to make these foods
[1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:44.240]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:46.240]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.

[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:18.240]  in the heart of the Resistance.

[1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:45.240]  Alright, Dr. Peter Glendon is our guest, and...
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:49.240]  Here's the deal. The Rockefellers funded Hitler.
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:52.240]  They funded the Kaiser Velhelm Institute
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:55.240]  when Hitler literally was a teenager,
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:57.240]  long before he was on the scenes.
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:33:59.240]  It's called eugenics.
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:02.240]  They set up in Europe, England, the U.S.
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:04.240]  also Mexico set these up. It was all the rage.
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  They would promote it at the World's Fair.
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:08.240]  Eugenics.
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:10.240]  And they set up the health departments
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:13.240]  to take poor people's kids and sterilize them
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:15.240]  and all the rest of it.
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:17.240]  And when they couldn't do that, they said,
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:19.240]  we'll just dumb society down.
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:21.240]  We'll go in and get people dependent on welfare
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:23.240]  and then dumb them down, collapse society,
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:25.240]  and then we can engineer it however we want.
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:27.240]  So, Dr. Glendon, you've gone over the history of this.
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:29.240]  You're being nice to say they're following
[1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:31.240]  300-year-old ideas.
[1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:33.240]  I mean, it's far worse than that.
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:36.240]  I mean, you know that. Break down the sinister side of this.
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:39.240]  Every major GMO, whether it's wheat or BT corn,
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:41.240]  that they do studies on.
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:43.240]  There's new ones out just this week.
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:45.240]  Again, all the mainstream news had to report on it.
[1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:47.240]  Sterilizing the rodents, killing them.
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:49.240]  In these lab tests,
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:53.240]  this isn't by accident that every time they make GMO,
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:55.240]  cross species chimera,
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:57.240]  it sterilizes and is poisonous.
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:00.240]  I mean, they know that if a BT corn kills bugs that eat it,
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:02.240]  it isn't good for humans that eat it.
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:04.240]  And then these idiots email me and go,
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.240]  they don't have crops that are pharmacological
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:08.240]  that grow their own pesticide. There's no such thing.
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:11.240]  I mean, the public literally wants their Obama phone.
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:14.240]  Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, the amount of, you know,
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:17.240]  we rattle our chains to celebrate our freedom, right?
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:20.240]  I'll give you just a little example of this.
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:23.240]  In World War II, there was a coalition
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  of German pharmaceutical companies,
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.240]  and they all put their money together.
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:29.240]  The coalition, the acronym was IGF.
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:32.240]  And these German pharmaceutical companies put their money together
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:37.240]  and they built a pharmaceutical plant right next to one of the death camps.
[1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:39.240]  I think it was Dachau.
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:42.240]  And they used the inmates in the death camps to work
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:46.240]  to make the Zyklon B gas that the Nazis used
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:48.240]  to kill the people in the concentration camp.
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:52.240]  And IBM supplied the machines, those little tattoos on people's arms.
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:55.240]  Thomas Watson, he supplied those.
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:58.240]  And they did, they used the inmates to do medical experiments on.
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:00.240]  And you know who one of those companies was?
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:02.240]  One of the companies that was in that coalition?
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.240]  Bayer.
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:04.240]  Bayer.
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.240]  The same company that sales tries to sell your children aspirin.
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.240]  Now you need to ask yourself a question.
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:14.240]  How could a company involved in war crimes in World War II
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:18.240]  be working at a profit now in the United States of America?
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:19.240]  It's worse than that.
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:21.240]  Five years ago, they had to admit in France,
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:24.240]  worldwide for 11 years, they shipped out factor 8,
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.240]  every ampule to small children,
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:30.240]  hemophiliacs filled with HIV and hepatitis,
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:32.240]  knowing it was a death sentence.
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:35.240]  And in the executive documents, it was funny to them.
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:38.240]  And nobody goes to jail and the American public,
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:41.240]  the world public at large, doesn't bat a freaking eyelash.
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:45.240]  And to make it worse, we give our hard-earned money every month
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:50.240]  to the insurance companies to gain access to this type of nonsense.
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:52.240]  And now the insurance companies, oh, my big banks,
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:55.240]  wrote the law to make us buy the healthcare,
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:57.240]  which they admit has already increased the price
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:36:59.240]  over 25% in just a year.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.240]  When it goes into effect, it's like 40%.
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:04.240]  And then now government and literal death panels
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:06.240]  control what healthcare you get.
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:09.240]  So you pay a ton for nothing but crud.
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:10.240]  It's nothing but crud.
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:12.240]  And unless you pay it, they find you, right?
[1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:17.240]  So this is just another intention of the powers that be
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:20.240]  to drive home this subliminal message
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:24.240]  that MD-directed pharmaceutical centrist surgical medicine
[1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:26.240]  is the best thing in the world.
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:29.240]  It's the only thing that you need to use for your health
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:31.240]  and everybody else is a substandard.
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:33.240]  And they're covering up the number one cause of death now
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:36.240]  is a composite of infections, drug interactions,
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:37.240]  and other things.
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:40.240]  The number one cause of death, they say it's number three,
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  the number one cause of death is now hospitals.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:46.240]  Everyone I know that goes to have minor surgeries.
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:47.240]  They go to have liposuction.
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:48.240]  They go to have a knee surgery.
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:50.240]  They're dead, young people.
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:53.240]  People take their kids in to have a circumcision redone.
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:56.240]  Dead, dead, dead, dead.
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:37:58.240]  But we're supposed to worship it.
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:37:59.240]  Yeah, and we do.
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:00.240]  And we do.
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:03.240]  We genuflect at that altar all the time.
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:05.240]  By the way, on the front page of my website,
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:08.240]  you can get that 45-page document for free.
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:10.240]  It's called Death by Medicine.
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:13.240]  It draws statistics from the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:14.240]  Plug it. Plug it.
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:15.240]  The Journal of Medicine.
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:17.240]  People on your website want FireMD.
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:19.240]  Yeah, fireyourmdnow.com.
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:21.240]  Fireyourmdnow.com.
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:23.240]  If you want to download the document, it's free.
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:26.240]  It shows you right there, Death by the Numbers.
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:29.240]  Literally, every day, every day last week.
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:32.240]  Everywhere I went, everyone I knew had friends and family
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:34.240]  dying of infections in hospitals.
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:38.240]  Yeah, 780,000 people a year are killed by MD treatment.
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:39.240]  780,000.
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:42.240]  550,000 are killed by cancer.
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:45.240]  That means you're MD, for goodness' sake,
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:47.240]  is more dangerous than cancer.
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:49.240]  That's a very conservative number you just gave.
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:50.240]  The number I've got is over 2 million.
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:52.240]  Because if you add drug interactions and all that,
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:53.240]  it's well above that.
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:57.240]  Then if you add automobile accidents caused by drivers
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:00.240]  under the influence of Prozac and statin drugs,
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:01.240]  it gets even worse.
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:04.240]  Which they admit statin literally eats your brain.
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:05.240]  Now they want to put it in the water supply.
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:08.240]  Listen, let's stop right there for just a moment.
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:12.240]  Now again, breast cancer is the highest in the world here.
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.240]  It's up several thousand percent in just the last 40 years.
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:16.240]  People can look that up.
[1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:17.240]  It's not debated.
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:19.240]  We lead the world in neurological disorders, cancer, obesity.
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:21.240]  They know what they're doing, feeding us.
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:22.240]  Empty calories.
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.240]  They don't have minerals and vitamins in it.
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:25.240]  It's all about find the cure.
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:27.240]  How about find the cause?
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:31.240]  If the emergency room had a thousand Dalasites,
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:34.240]  or Chicagoites, or New Yorkites, or whatever they are,
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:37.240]  Austinites coming in with gunshot wounds, you wouldn't be.
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:40.240]  Let's learn how to fix gunshot wounds to the head.
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:42.240]  It'd be, why are a thousand people not getting shot
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:44.240]  with a double-lock buck or a 50 caliber?
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:48.240]  Instead, it's like, yeah, let's find the cure to gunshot wounds.
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:50.240]  Why is the cancer exploding?
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:51.240]  Why is all this happening?
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.240]  Well, because the medical profession that's in charge
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:57.240]  of your disease management, it's not healthcare,
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:40:00.240]  does not care about the cause of disease.
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.240]  Their training has nothing to do with causes of disease.
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:06.240]  And this is, you have to understand this.
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:08.240]  The MDs bless their hearts.
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:09.240]  This is the big kahuna.
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:10.240]  This is the big kahuna.
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:11.240]  This is the big kahuna.
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:12.240]  This is the answer.
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.240]  This is the keymaster right now.
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:19.240]  They are trained not to look for the cause of the disease.
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:22.240]  They are trained to manage the symptoms with drugs.
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:26.240]  That's their training, to manage the symptoms with drugs.
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:27.240]  So the dam's about to break.
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:29.240]  They would come and try to hand people life rafts
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:31.240]  instead of fixing the dam.
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:34.240]  You know, they can't even cure a heartburn for goodness' sake.
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:39.240]  And we've given them $600 billion to come up with a cure for cancer.
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:41.240]  And they can't even cure a heartburn.
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:42.240]  Milk.
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:43.240]  You've got to be kidding me.
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:46.240]  What do you do for heartburn?
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:48.240]  Well, heartburn, the main cause of heartburn
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:51.240]  is not enough salt in the body and not enough calcium.
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:53.240]  If you start salting your food regularly
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:56.240]  and take a good calcium supplement that's in the Alex pack,
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:59.240]  heartburn will go away in about seven days.
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.240]  And for those that don't know, we have put together
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:04.240]  the widest spectrums of vitamins, minerals, trace elements,
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.240]  the best products at infoorsehealth.com that he's mentioning there.
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:09.240]  infoorsehealth.com.
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:11.240]  And when you purchase these great products there,
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:14.240]  it also supports the broadcast and what we're doing.
[1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:15.240]  And it's just revolutionary.
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:18.240]  Take Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymers Plus
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:21.240]  and the essential fatty acids that you guys have put together,
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:24.240]  you and Doc Wallach and others, and Corey Gold, Dr. Corey Gold.
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:29.240]  What's amazing about this is that, now that we're segueing off into that,
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.240]  is that when they do take these, Aaron Dykes,
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:35.240]  who had gotten about 100 pounds overweight,
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:38.240]  he lost 92 pounds in a year.
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:41.240]  He's now eight months later, he's kept it off.
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:43.240]  The guy looks like a movie star or something,
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:45.240]  literally compared to the way he looked.
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:49.240]  And all the products he used that I discovered basically
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:52.240]  listening to you guys, he tried a bunch of other stuff,
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:55.240]  actually kind of got into this, trying to help Aaron and some family.
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.240]  None of it was advertised as weight loss.
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.240]  That's what's insane.
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:00.240]  The stuff that made him lose weight,
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  the full mineral spectrum, vitamin spectrum stuff,
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:06.240]  like Beyond Tangy Tangerine at infoorsehealth.com,
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:09.240]  that's what's incredible is it wasn't advertised as that.
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:12.240]  Well, when you practice holistic medicine, you know,
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:15.240]  you get results because the therapeutics that were trained in,
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:18.240]  that nature paths trained in, are designed to support,
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:20.240]  promote the body's ability to fix itself.
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:22.240]  Now, I've been doing this for over 20 years.
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:24.240]  And in the last four years,
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:26.240]  I've been mentoring exclusively with Dr. Wallach.
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:28.240]  And as God as my witness, Alex,
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.240]  since I've been following Dr. Wallach's methodology
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:33.240]  and using Dr. Wallach's nutritional supplements,
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:36.240]  I don't even know what planet I'm on anymore,
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:41.240]  because the things that I've seen people recover from, eclips anything in my free time.
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:44.240]  But it turns out the low calorie, high nutrient dense diet
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:46.240]  is what the elites are into,
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:50.240]  and it's making rats and worms live two to three times longer.
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:43:04.240]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:23.240]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:26.240]  that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria,
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:28.240]  making it ideal for daily use.
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:30.240]  It can be used internally as well as topically
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:34.240]  and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:38.240]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation,

[1:44:57.240 --> 1:44:59.240]  The worst drought in 50 years continues
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:03.240]  and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:06.240]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:11.240]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:16.240]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:20.240]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's prices
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:24.240]  by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:28.240]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:30.240]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:32.240]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:34.240]  because we've all known this was coming.
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:37.240]  You know about their delicious long term storeable foods.
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:39.240]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:44.240]  and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:50.240]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to EatFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[1:45:54.240 --> 1:46:20.240]  You can bet your life on Eat Foods Direct.
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:29.240]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi,
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:32.240]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:33.240]  But here's some good news.
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:39.240]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:42.240]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:45.240]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:47.240]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:50.240]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:53.240]  and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:58.240]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.240]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:07.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:15.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:19.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:24.240]  I want to say this very slowly. You can write this down and look it up.
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:27.240]  It's mainstream. It's not debated.
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:32.240]  The Rockefellers were Nazis before the Nazis even had that name.
[1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:37.240]  They wanted sciences to control the United States and other countries they'd taken over.
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:40.240]  Because people were uppity. They wanted freedom. They knew what was going on.
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.240]  They knew what crony capitalists were anti-free market monopoly men.
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:51.240]  About 100 years ago, it was around 1910, 1912, that whole area, 1913.
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:57.240]  Right about 100 years ago, they took over and banned and restricted the other three types of medicine.
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:01.240]  They discovered by the 30s that cancer was viral, sort of putting that in vaccines.
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.240]  Now cancer is up several thousand percent on average just the last few decades.
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:09.240]  Cancer was like super rare 100 years ago.
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:11.240]  They just kill us. They murder us.
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:16.240]  And they funded Hitler, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Before that, they funded Margaret Sanger.
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:20.240]  They created welfare to make us dependent.
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:23.240]  And they know what they're doing.
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:26.240]  Going back to Dr. Peter Glidden.
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:31.240]  Doc, it's not just avoiding GMO. It's not just drinking pure water.
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:34.240]  It really is getting wide spectrum vitamins and minerals.
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:36.240]  But even the vitamins they've got are synthetic.
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:41.240]  What is the difference between the wide spectrum of vitamins, minerals and products for everything
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:45.240]  you can imagine that we have at InfoWarsHealth.com or InfoWarsTeam.com
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  if you want to be a distributor on all the products and get discounts and get free shipping.
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:50.240]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:54.240]  What is the difference between the products that Dr. Wallach and Dr. Corey Gold and yourself
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:56.240]  and others have worked on?
[1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:03.240]  One of the biggest companies down in the country when it comes to alternative medicine and healthcare, vitamins, minerals, you name it.
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:07.240]  What is the difference between what you guys have developed that has such incredible results
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:12.240]  versus what even establishment vitamin and mineral pushers have?
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:14.240]  Well, it's the recipe. The recipe is everything.
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:17.240]  You know, vitamins are no different than chicken soup.
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:24.240]  It's the recipe. The ingredients, how they're put together, the amount of stuff, how it's made, how it's stored.
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:25.240]  It's the recipe.
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:33.240]  Yongevity's recipe of nutritional supplements is formulated from $25 million of research,
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.240]  26,000 autopsies, 10 million blood chemistries and histopathologies,
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:44.240]  and 30 years of clinical work by licensed naturopathic physicians applying all of this research.
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:51.240]  This is a no-brainer when it comes to vitamins and minerals and medical nutrition.
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.240]  You should rely on the profession that's trained in medical nutrition, right?
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:49:58.240]  I mean, that just makes sense.
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:02.240]  There's no other vitamin company in the world that has Dr. Wallach.
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:06.240]  There's no other vitamin company in the world that has access to Dr. Wallach's knowledge base
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.240]  and the research that Dr. Wallach was in charge of from 1970 to 1982.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:12.240]  It's that simple.
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:16.240]  It all comes down to the recipe, right?
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  Andy Boone Springs' Green Apple Wine is quite a bit different from a nice California Cabernet,
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240]  and they're all made from grapes.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:25.240]  Well, it's exactly the same with vitamins.
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:27.240]  It's the recipe is everything.
[1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:29.240]  You have to have a superior recipe.
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:32.240]  And as God as my witness, Yongevity's is.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:36.240]  It's the best stuff I've ever seen, and I've been doing this for over 20 years.
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:40.240]  It is something that I certainly am proud to promote because I've seen the effects,
[1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:45.240]  but what's sick is that when he worked for the federal government over those decades,
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:46.240]  he's a pretty famous guy.
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.240]  He's the guy that's won all these court cases.
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:51.240]  They even allow us to have vitamins and minerals with Codex Alimentarius.
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:58.240]  People don't know in South Korea you got to go get a prescription to get essential fatty acids or fish oil or aspirin for that matter.
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:03.240]  Now, they don't know that it's openly being pushed that you have to buy everything from the establishment,
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:07.240]  from them adulterated at 10, 20, 30 times the price.
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:11.240]  I mean, they do not want people to know that GMOs and the food,
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:19.240]  they don't want you to know that there's all these things that so many diseases are actually caused by deficiencies.
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:22.240]  And I mentioned as we went to break, anybody can pull this up.
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.240]  Everybody's heard it on the news where rats and mice live two, three times longer
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:31.240]  with super high nutrient dense diets, insects even longer.
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:33.240]  Well, yeah, because it's got the trace elements.
[1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:34.240]  It's got the full spectrum.
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:40.240]  Even mainline doctors say, well, well, that's true, but they tell you to take a smaller spectrum of it.
[1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:43.240]  Why doesn't the power structure let people know about this?
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:49.240]  I mean, my dad is an oral surgeon and a dentist and he volunteers two weeks every year.
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:55.240]  Usually you go to Mexico or Belize or Honduras to do free medical care on street children.
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  But he went to Paraguay, landlocked down in South America this year.
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:04.240]  He went to a soccer game the last day and somebody threw a hand grenade out on the field and blew people up pretty wild.
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:10.240]  But the Amish are the only people keeping the country going and they have the North area of the country that they developed that was desert
[1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:12.240]  and they produce most of the food.
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:17.240]  Well, the head Amish guy has a program where he gives candies that have full spectrum minerals in them
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:23.240]  and it's ended like this street children that are blind and mentally retarded
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:30.240]  and just with the minerals and now the UN's down there trying to stop the Amish from saving the kids, Doc.
[1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:34.240]  Yeah, it's unbelievable. Dr. Wallach discovered the cause in the cure for cystic fibrosis.
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:39.240]  It was a selenium deficiency in the blood of the pregnant mother and they fired him.
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:45.240]  They squashed the research and then they blackballed them at every major teaching hospital in the United States.
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:52.240]  Wallach's research clued us into the fact that the majority of chronic diseases are caused by nutrient deficiencies
[1:52:52.240 --> 1:52:54.240]  and this is the biggest thing that we need to know.
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:58.240]  Why are the powers that be? Why don't they want us to know this?
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:00.240]  Why they don't want us to know this?
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:05.240]  Because if by some genie in the bottle magic, tomorrow morning everybody woke up
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:11.240]  and there was equal access for naturopathic medicine, equal funding for naturopathic medicine,
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:15.240]  equal insurance coverage and hospital privileges for holistic medicine,
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:19.240]  within two, three years the MDs would be out of business and they know it.
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:22.240]  It is all about big pharma all of the time.
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:29.240]  The medicine in this country in all industrialized nations in this world is a for-profit machine.
[1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:31.240]  It profits them to keep you sick.
[1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:34.240]  It does not profit them to keep you healthy.
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:37.240]  And this is one of the biggest myths that we're suffering from here.
[1:53:37.240 --> 1:53:43.240]  The false notion that healing is some complicated, sophisticated process
[1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:46.240]  that can only happen in a multi-million dollar high-tech facility.
[1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:48.240]  It's nonsense.
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:50.240]  Healing is easy.
[1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:52.240]  Surgery is complicated.
[1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:54.240]  Healing is easy.
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:53:58.240]  And the MDs, you can be sincerely incorrect.
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:00.240]  I mean, they just don't know this.
[1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:02.240]  Your dad doesn't know this.
[1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:06.240]  The MDs that are really trying to do good by their patients, they don't know this.
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:08.240]  They're not taught it in medical school.
[1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:10.240]  It's not reinforced in their continuing education.
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:12.240]  Well, let me throw this out.
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:14.240]  Let me throw this out at people.
[1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:21.240]  On screen, if you're watching at PrismPlanet.tv for radio listeners, this type of Harvard study fluoride will come up in the search engine.
[1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:27.240]  Harvard study finds fluoride levels lower IQ and children up to 20 points if they have it when they're a child.
[1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:29.240]  Massive seven-fold increase in cancer.
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  There's thousands of studies.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:33.240]  They've known this forever.
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:38.240]  Again, what's going on with the fluoride that they put in our water lovingly?
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:42.240]  Money, money, money, money, money, money, and dumb down, dumb down, dumb down, dumb down.
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:44.240]  It's all about money.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:46.240]  It profits them to keep you sick.
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:48.240]  It profits them to keep you stupid.
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:53.240]  It profits them to keep you eating all the wrong food all the time that makes you sick.
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:55:00.240]  I mean, it is a conspiracy and it is so huge that most people think, oh, no, that can't be.
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:02.240]  Well, guess what it is?
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:07.240]  Most of the food that we eat, even if it's not GMO, is bad for you.
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:11.240]  Wheat, barley, rye, and oats, oil in a bottle, fried food, well done, ready to eat.
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:16.240]  People have explained to people, Doc, they have to keep eating, eating, eating, eating, eating
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.240]  because it's empty calories because the soil's been depleted.
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:23.240]  But you're still hungry because you're looking for the vitamins and minerals
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:26.240]  when you could get it from Polymbers or beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:28.240]  Obesity is a deficiency disease.
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:30.240]  It is not a disease of excess.
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:32.240]  It is a deficiency disease.
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.240]  The only thing that causes people to gain weight is we eat too many calories.
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.240]  The only thing that makes us eat too many calories is our body is starved for nutrition.
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:42.240]  So your body makes you eat.
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:45.240]  But the food that you're eating doesn't have the nutrients that you need.
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:51.240]  So you eat 3,000 calories at Olive Garden and two hours later, you're hungry again.
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:52.240]  Why is this?
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  Because the food doesn't have the nutrition that you need and your body is starving to death.
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:55:59.240]  It's starving to death.
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:07.240]  And ironically, healing is so easy that most of the time the only thing necessary is to give your body
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:10.240]  the raw materials that it needs.
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:14.240]  Fill up its nutritional tank, stop eating food that's hurting you,
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:16.240]  get the heck out of the way, and guess what?
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:19.240]  Your body recovers its health.
[1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:22.240]  But the powers that be do not want you to know this.
[1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:24.240]  They want you to think that, oh, your blood pressure's been there.
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:27.240]  They want you dependent just like the Obama phone lady.
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:30.240]  Have you seen that begging for a phone, begging for a house?
[1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:32.240]  Yeah, it's crazy, man.
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:33.240]  I mean, it is crazy.
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:41.240]  And it is just, you know, sometimes I wake up and I feel like I'm down the rabbit hole in the matrix,
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:47.240]  Alice in Wonderland world where constant surveillance is liberty and constant war is freedom.
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:50.240]  And its constant medication is health.
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:51.240]  It is unbelievable to me.
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:54.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, healing is easy.
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:59.240]  The medical profession does not want you to know that if you have high blood pressure,
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:01.240]  it's because you have nutrient deficiencies.
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:03.240]  If you have fibromyalgia or Alzheimer's...
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:05.240]  Well, it's obviously, these numbers are all exploding.
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:07.240]  Thank you so much, Dr. Glidden.
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:08.240]  We'll talk to you again soon.
