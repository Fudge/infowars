[08:16.400 --> 08:21.640]  we are live on this December 3rd Thursday edition thank you so much for
[08:21.640 --> 08:29.800]  joining us let me just go ahead and start going through some of the news
[08:29.800 --> 08:36.400]  arming Goldman with pistols against the public that's the headline out of
[08:36.400 --> 08:43.320]  Bloomberg financial and they report that Goldman Sachs is arming themselves and
[08:43.320 --> 08:49.200]  they even gave an interview to Bloomberg saying they're preparing basically for a
[08:49.200 --> 08:56.440]  full-scale collapse and for people to try to storm like the French storm the
[08:56.440 --> 09:01.120]  Bastille to kick off the French Revolution to storm Goldman Sachs I
[09:01.120 --> 09:06.120]  mean what an insane article that's what Homeland Security is for that's what
[09:06.120 --> 09:10.960]  the militarized police are for that's why at the G 20 the private banking heads
[09:10.960 --> 09:15.720]  of the planet order the police to allow no one on the streets no one in the
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.280]  city of over a million people and they would sound cannon old women and release
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.120]  police dogs on old women and attack young girls on bicycles and drive
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.280]  through neighborhoods blasting people on their front porches just saying no one's
[09:30.280 --> 09:34.200]  allowed on the streets martial law has been declared they're setting the
[09:34.200 --> 09:39.000]  precedent that you're gonna sit down and take it while they rob you and they
[09:39.000 --> 09:49.440]  expect you to revolt against them because these people are criminals they
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.840]  know they're robbing you they know they're destroying the country they know
[09:52.840 --> 09:57.800]  we're in the middle of a depression but they call a double-dip recession they
[09:57.800 --> 10:02.520]  know unemployment's over 20% and they can't believe that we're peacefully
[10:02.520 --> 10:07.720]  sitting here and taking it they want it to get violent so they could play the
[10:07.720 --> 10:13.800]  part of victims that's why there's provocateurs everywhere pushing for
[10:13.800 --> 10:20.040]  violence which is the last thing we want just let the criminals continue to
[10:20.040 --> 10:25.760]  show themselves to the planet let the abuse continue and rot and rot and rot
[10:25.760 --> 10:34.080]  we are watching the enemy burn down you know over a hundred years ago oil field
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.040]  technicians engineers discovered a way to put out an oil fire they could burn
[10:38.040 --> 10:44.000]  for days even weeks geysers of flames shooting hundreds and even thousands of
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.680]  feet into the air and how would they fight fire they would fight it with fire
[10:48.680 --> 10:56.920]  they would run a wheelbarrow full of dynamite up to the edge of the fire and
[10:56.920 --> 11:05.360]  run back and detonate it and the explosion would extinguish the fire and
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.640]  that's why they want violence because if they can have a big flash of violence
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.600]  and riots and police being shot in the streets and the military having to be
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.680]  deployed they can clamp down on the public but every day we're peaceful and
[11:20.680 --> 11:26.840]  every day that we sit here in the info war exposing these people they are
[11:26.840 --> 11:34.560]  burning to the ground in front of our eyes they are collapsing their criminal
[11:34.560 --> 11:40.680]  rape is so obvious and is really waking the military the police all of their
[11:40.680 --> 11:46.640]  enforcers up as well we're dealing with a bunch of Ken lay made-off types as I
[11:46.640 --> 11:50.560]  say every day they're just completely illegitimate fraudsters engaged in
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.720]  criminality Ben Bernanke routed yell debt today in the Senate we're gonna pull
[11:55.720 --> 11:58.520]  these clips up later
[12:01.040 --> 12:06.760]  his confirmation is on hold for his second term at the private Federal
[12:06.760 --> 12:13.800]  Reserve the climate-gate situation is spiraling out of control blew up bigger
[12:13.800 --> 12:20.280]  than I even thought it would I thought it would take months or years with this
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.360]  internal data to bring these people to justice and it is exploding even faster
[12:24.360 --> 12:30.000]  than I thought it would they are in full retreat right now but they have
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.520]  incredible power they have incredible finance they have their operatives
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.240]  everywhere and so don't think we're winning the war but right now we are
[12:40.240 --> 12:48.920]  definitely in the fight and their agenda is being exposed and they got a lot of
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.320]  tricks up their sleeves staged terror further financial collapses provocateur
[12:53.320 --> 12:59.400]  actions new wars and they're gonna undoubtedly throw all of their tricks
[12:59.400 --> 13:08.080]  at us and it's not gonna work the tiger woods distractions aren't gonna work the
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.080]  gatecrashers at the White House party not gonna work the latest Adam Nicole
[13:13.080 --> 13:16.880]  Smith revelations not gonna work because people are losing their jobs
[13:16.880 --> 13:20.480]  they're losing their apartments they're losing their houses they know the media
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.320]  is lying telling them the economy's gotten better the people know the banks
[13:24.320 --> 13:29.160]  robbed them and the beginning of the end for the new world order has begun it's
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.440]  gonna be a long hard road and it's gonna look like we're losing but in the
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.200]  final equation history common sense all the evidence shows that this tyranny
[13:40.200 --> 13:46.800]  will not stand and will not pass okay arming Goldman with pistols against the
[13:46.800 --> 13:54.760]  public Bloomberg that's the type of news we have on that front on the carbon tax
[13:54.760 --> 13:59.440]  front one of the biggest newspapers over in Australia has the headline
[13:59.440 --> 14:10.240]  climategate ABC filters working beautifully now this is ABC Australia
[14:10.240 --> 14:16.880]  Australian broadcasting system company three years ago the Parliament passed a
[14:16.880 --> 14:22.200]  law over there stating that the government would take control of the
[14:22.200 --> 14:25.960]  internet through the hubs and would filter what sites and what news you
[14:25.960 --> 14:33.520]  could visit and that is indeed happening in Australia just like China can filter
[14:33.520 --> 14:44.480]  what you can get or Libya or Iran climategate ABC filters working beautifully
[14:44.480 --> 14:53.480]  number of results return when searching the term climategate on ABC online one
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.720]  one got through but relax it was just a reader's response yet another article by
[14:57.720 --> 15:05.440]  a warmest scientist number of results return when searching climategate on
[15:05.440 --> 15:15.760]  Google 21 million 400,000 number of results return when searching climategate
[15:15.760 --> 15:28.240]  on ABC search engine one I mean this is what Homeland Security and Cyber
[15:28.240 --> 15:31.800]  Security have openly said they won here in the US a month ago Obama gave
[15:31.800 --> 15:36.000]  multiple speeches saying we need to be able to filter the internet so you only
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.720]  get government news during emergencies and crises and we're building NSA bases
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.600]  to snoop on everything you do and filter the web they're building the system
[15:45.600 --> 15:54.920]  here to do what they do in China and in Libya and in good old the land of
[15:54.920 --> 16:01.800]  freedom the land down under and that shows you who these people are they can't
[16:01.800 --> 16:07.440]  have a real fair honest open debate in the free market of ideas can't do it
[16:07.440 --> 16:18.560]  they can only put blinders on you plug your ears nail your mouth shut burn the
[16:18.560 --> 16:26.680]  nerve endings off the end of your fingers so you are as deaf dumb and blind as
[16:26.680 --> 16:33.960]  Helen Keller that is their plan and they want you totally bankrupt under their
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.880]  control on government health care in their lines begging for them to pull a
[16:39.880 --> 16:48.400]  tooth or to give your child some antibiotics and they're bankrupting the
[16:48.400 --> 16:52.120]  society so you're fully under their control and if globalization hasn't
[16:52.120 --> 16:55.440]  destroyed our economy fast enough don't worry they've got global carbon taxes
[16:55.440 --> 17:01.960]  it'll sure do the job here's another story out of Australia Australia carbon
[17:01.960 --> 17:09.680]  laws failed to pass Senate they were set to pass but now they failed and a whole
[17:09.680 --> 17:15.960]  bunch of different members of several parties have resigned and the second
[17:15.960 --> 17:22.640]  most powerful party in Australia is now imploding we'll be going over that more
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.960]  as you know this is two days old now climate scientists at center of email
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.160]  controversy has stepped down
[17:31.160 --> 17:46.080]  continuing with what's happening with climate gate major universities in
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.920]  Australia New Zealand England the United States Canada are investigating their
[17:50.920 --> 17:56.360]  professors all the chief climate scientist in the UN program involved in
[17:56.360 --> 18:01.040]  climate gate are now investigating all of them and the Washington Times is
[18:01.040 --> 18:10.280]  reporting NASA hiding climate data so they've been caught at Goddard but we
[18:10.280 --> 18:18.720]  now see their new spin we now see what their counter is playing the part of
[18:18.720 --> 18:26.280]  victims the police in England have been investigating for the last couple
[18:26.280 --> 18:31.440]  weeks at the University of East Anglia the head UN Climatology Center
[18:31.440 --> 18:37.400]  investigating the crime of the stolen emails the stolen data and apologizing
[18:37.400 --> 18:42.520]  everyone and talking about how horrible it is and Barbara Boxer says hey we'll
[18:42.520 --> 18:46.280]  have a committee hearing about the people gate crashing the White House and
[18:46.280 --> 18:52.560]  we're gonna have a committee hearing over who stole the emails we're not
[18:52.560 --> 18:58.440]  gonna have any hearings about climate gate we're gonna have we're gonna have
[18:58.440 --> 19:03.760]  hearings and investigations about the horrible theft of this data which had
[19:03.760 --> 19:07.880]  been ordered to be released through for your request and which have been blocked
[19:07.880 --> 19:14.400]  and we have the internal emails of the head climate fraudster with the
[19:14.400 --> 19:18.120]  government officials bragging about how they talked to the government
[19:18.120 --> 19:21.840]  officials and they agreed to not release the data to the public because it
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.040]  would damage the man-made global warming hypothesis I mean we have them
[19:26.040 --> 19:32.160]  red-handed but don't worry Barbara Boxer hackers could face criminal probe over
[19:32.160 --> 19:37.040]  climate gate leaked emails allegedly undermine climate change science should

[24:04.960 --> 24:14.320]  com in 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty
[24:14.320 --> 24:18.280]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and they called
[24:18.280 --> 24:22.160]  the bloody British and a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the
[24:22.160 --> 24:26.480]  British kept becoming there wasn't nice many as there was a while ago we fired
[24:26.480 --> 24:31.560]  once more and they'd begin to run down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[24:31.560 --> 24:36.720]  Paul Watson's got an article up on prisonplanet.com right now that's
[24:36.720 --> 24:44.120]  excellent the title is climategate crux recast themselves as
[24:44.120 --> 24:51.480]  victims and that is certainly the unified front in Europe in the Pacific in
[24:51.480 --> 24:56.000]  the United States in North America that's what all the headlines are saying
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.040]  they're saying it's horrible and day one that was their plan and we did bite on
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.960]  that a bit because they called it hacked emails but now the evidence is clear
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.920]  that months before this was circulated around all over the British media no
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.760]  one would run with it investigators and government were given it and that it
[25:17.760 --> 25:21.720]  was researchers inside but they're still calling it a theft because
[25:21.720 --> 25:26.920]  researchers weren't allowed without the the the university's authorization to
[25:26.920 --> 25:34.160]  take evidence of this crime and this is taking that university alone over 50
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.280]  million dollars in the last 20 years and spending it on this and then
[25:38.280 --> 25:44.640]  producing fraudulent returns of a warming earth and all these fantastic
[25:44.640 --> 25:49.640]  into the world Armageddon type scenarios of rising sea levels all the
[25:49.640 --> 25:55.560]  major coastal cities flooded to push a political agenda and we have the
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.040]  internal UN directives now that broke earlier in the week where they were
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.800]  organizing all these scientists and so they go to the government block the
[26:03.800 --> 26:09.440]  four-year request for the documents there's a huge internal debate that goes
[26:09.440 --> 26:18.920]  on concerning this and the people that valiantly released evidence of a crime
[26:18.920 --> 26:25.040]  they're the people that are in trouble this would be like if you saw your
[26:25.040 --> 26:33.560]  neighbor in their backyard running a methamphetamine lab and you took photos
[26:33.560 --> 26:37.720]  of them cooking the methamphetamine from your back window and gave it to the
[26:37.720 --> 26:45.920]  police and the police came and charged you with being a peeping Tom I mean
[26:45.920 --> 26:53.520]  that's basically that's basically what they're doing here look at this in
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.600]  Hoff asked Boxer to investigate possible scientific conspiracy in climate
[26:58.600 --> 27:05.200]  gade and how does she respond in a speech you call it this is a quote you
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.640]  call it climate gade I call it email theft gate she said during a committee
[27:10.640 --> 27:15.200]  hearing whatever it is the main issue is are we facing global warming or are we
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.560]  not I'm looking at these emails that even though they were stolen are now
[27:19.560 --> 27:25.360]  out in the public but I mean the two days after it broke the media the
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.720]  Associated Press called up professor Jones and he said yeah those are my emails
[27:28.720 --> 27:33.400]  yeah no I wrote that those are ours and then in the documents it wasn't just the
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.720]  emails it was the computer program with the notes by the programmers they put
[27:37.720 --> 27:42.600]  notes in programs for for for other texts that are looking at it later and
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.600]  trying to use it and they say well here's how we carry out the fraud I mean
[27:45.600 --> 27:49.320]  go read the quotes here's how we do the trick here's how you show it's getting
[27:49.320 --> 27:53.000]  hotter when the data really shows it's getting colder here's how you flip the
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.400]  numbers just like three different major electronic voting machine companies in
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.200]  the last five years they made HBO documentaries about it inside their
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.960]  programs they have programmer notes about how to manipulate it and how to
[28:05.960 --> 28:09.840]  flip it and how to cheat I mean that's how programs work I don't know much
[28:09.840 --> 28:12.640]  about computer programming but we have a lot of computer programs around here
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.360]  and I've sat over my IT guy's shoulders and sat there and looked at them reading
[28:17.360 --> 28:22.880]  notes from programmers in the programs we bought or that we're using and so I
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.280]  mean that that's how this works there are there are functions and there's
[28:27.280 --> 28:31.600]  always bugs in programs and there'll be notes in the program about how to get
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.160]  around bugs but this isn't just a bug this is telling them in the programs
[28:36.160 --> 28:43.120]  how to engage in fraud and then you have email after email how do we hide this
[28:43.120 --> 28:46.360]  from the public don't worry I'm working with the government in the US England
[28:46.360 --> 28:50.080]  in Europe and we're blocking it I talked to the Library of Congress people and
[28:50.080 --> 28:53.680]  they're going to help us and I I talked to you know this federal person and I
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.360]  talked to that federal person in fact I'll just pull these up and read them on
[28:56.360 --> 29:00.720]  air and once I discussed how damaging this information would be they totally
[29:00.720 --> 29:04.240]  agreed it shouldn't be released excellent oh they're definitely on our side oh
[29:04.240 --> 29:09.440]  yes oh yes and then we have the UN documents that came out four days ago
[29:09.440 --> 29:13.960]  which is in mainstream news associated press and Fox News are the only major
[29:13.960 --> 29:18.720]  US publications I've seen so far that have reported on it where the UN is
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.040]  having these internal reports going out to all the major university heads to
[29:23.040 --> 29:26.520]  don't tell the public it's about global government don't tell them it's about
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.880]  socialism and how we're taking over and you've got to help us get this done and
[29:30.880 --> 29:34.320]  you can't allow anyone to criticize man-made global warming and oh we're
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.480]  not gonna say it's warming now we're gonna say any change you know the
[29:37.480 --> 29:42.640]  seasons are unnatural teach them that the seasons aren't normal yes teach the
[29:42.640 --> 29:48.120]  children yes winter is abnormal summer is abnormal I mean this is just giant
[29:48.120 --> 29:55.920]  total fraud we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:29.640 --> 33:34.080]  Canada US Germany doesn't matter to go home and tell their parents their
[33:34.080 --> 33:39.240]  climate crooks don't take a hot bath don't leave the water running while you
[33:39.240 --> 33:46.040]  shave or brush your teeth how to write their parents mock tickets that they
[33:46.040 --> 33:50.080]  then bring back to their teachers in the public schools to watch Al Gore
[33:50.080 --> 33:55.720]  arrogantly up there saying the science is settled no one can question him any
[33:55.720 --> 33:59.560]  change in the climate if it's hotter one year or colder the next that that's
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.400]  evidence that man is evil and that we have to erect a global taxing system
[34:05.400 --> 34:11.080]  paid directly to him and others it's just a fraud so magnificent so huge so
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.400]  ridiculous that that's why it's hard for me to sit up here every day and talk
[34:15.400 --> 34:19.160]  about it and I'm getting hundreds of emails every day and calls by the media
[34:19.160 --> 34:23.600]  saying you and others were right it is a fraud how did you know how did I know
[34:23.600 --> 34:29.680]  the ice caps on Mars we're getting smaller now they're getting bigger your
[34:29.680 --> 34:37.400]  SUV has nothing to do with that it's the Sun the Sun it's what drives almost all
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.080]  temperature on this rock if we weren't orbiting that Sun at close range ladies
[34:43.080 --> 34:51.200]  and gentlemen we'd be a frozen rock it's the Sun and I know as listeners you
[34:51.200 --> 34:57.240]  understand that but we've got to get the word out to people okay I can go pull up
[34:57.240 --> 35:03.040]  the data I'm no scientist carbon dioxide has been 14 times higher in the last
[35:03.040 --> 35:09.160]  200,000 years Lord Mockden's written a detailed report linking to other official
[35:09.160 --> 35:15.840]  ice core and silt samples that it was 20 times higher excuse me the numbers I
[35:15.840 --> 35:25.280]  saw were 14 carbon dioxide is good I mean they talk about some point four
[35:25.280 --> 35:33.680]  increase point four and if I see one more television show or one more
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.720]  newspaper cover saying man made climate change is real we must save the earth
[35:37.720 --> 35:45.720]  we're all dead with a photo of a power plant with steam rising out of it see
[35:45.720 --> 35:52.040]  smoke doesn't dissipate smoke they have it in over 60 years had smoke stacks with
[35:52.040 --> 36:00.040]  real smoke coming out of them under law it's steam my office is near a
[36:00.040 --> 36:07.160]  semiconductor microchip plant one of the few factories still running in Austin
[36:07.160 --> 36:16.120]  and they've got giant cooling systems and heating systems and in the summer you
[36:16.120 --> 36:21.560]  see nothing coming out of them you know why the plants go in full speed because
[36:21.560 --> 36:28.080]  it's not cold you walk outside my office right now it looks like 500 redwood
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.400]  trees are burning that mean there is there is white smoke according to the
[36:33.400 --> 36:40.320]  dumb down public shooting out no it's water vapor across the street there is
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.800]  a government building and it's got a big air conditioning heating system it's
[36:44.800 --> 36:50.000]  got smoke shooting out about 150 feet and then it disappears and why does it
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.360]  disappear because it's not smoke it's not wood smoke it's not cold smoke it's
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.920]  not Easter Bunny smoke it's not puff the magic dragon smoke it's not Santa Claus
[37:00.920 --> 37:08.840]  smoke okay it's not it's not fruit loop smoke it's not toucan Sam it's water and
[37:08.840 --> 37:14.720]  that's why 150 feet after it comes out of that giant system it disappears because
[37:14.720 --> 37:18.400]  the water becomes the temperature of the rest of the atmosphere and it becomes
[37:18.400 --> 37:25.560]  invisible invisible it's smoke that's not smoke coming out of your mouth when it's
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.560]  cold outside it's water vapor and a foot outside your mouth it disappears because
[37:30.560 --> 37:35.240]  it cools off in the atmosphere it's not in your fat little pink warm lungs
[37:35.240 --> 37:44.840]  anymore it's not coming out of your body at 98 degrees it is not smoke coming out
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.880]  of your mouth when you visit Colorado to go skiing you don't have a wood stove in
[37:49.880 --> 37:57.720]  your lungs unless you're smoking pale males you don't have a wood smoke in
[37:57.720 --> 38:04.320]  your lungs there is no fire in your lungs there is no wood burning stove cold
[38:04.320 --> 38:10.440]  burning stove I promise you it's not a conspiracy theory and they show images
[38:10.440 --> 38:19.520]  of a polar bear sitting up on a tiny iceberg perched hunting just like
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.520]  Kodiaks go to this freshwater streams and grab big fat juicy salmon out of the
[38:24.520 --> 38:31.280]  water that famous photo they use and they show school kids I mean I was in a
[38:31.280 --> 38:34.240]  pizza place a few months ago in Port Aransas Texas I was down there fishing
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.720]  with my children and I walk in to the Port Aransas Pizzeria I shot an iPhone
[38:39.720 --> 38:44.080]  video of this we never posted on the web we got to post this and as I'm walking
[38:44.080 --> 38:48.160]  out they have all the school children locally have have posted their their
[38:48.160 --> 38:53.880]  global warming pictures and it's all I'm a penguin I'm going to die the ice is
[38:53.880 --> 38:59.640]  melting I can't swim it actually says that and oh the polar bears are drowning
[38:59.640 --> 39:03.960]  no no no no they're hunting there's more of them now I mean I just I just can't
[39:03.960 --> 39:09.440]  believe it anymore and I know I'm ranting I just just to have Al Gore up
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.080]  there lecturing me when he is a public criminal a public lying fraud and and
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.280]  now to see the media trying to spin climategate and say oh the poor victims
[39:19.280 --> 39:24.120]  of the stolen emails and the stuff that proves all their fraud oh the poor things
[39:24.120 --> 39:27.760]  Barbara Boxer says there won't be any climategate investigation there'll be
[39:27.760 --> 39:31.680]  an investigation of the emails and who got them oh and that wicked criminals
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.800]  that would steal them who obviously worked at the university that's now
[39:35.800 --> 39:40.360]  coming out and who didn't want to be part of the fraud
[39:43.080 --> 39:48.440]  and look I know it's asinine to sit here and lecture people that when it's a
[39:48.440 --> 39:52.880]  cold day and you exhale that's not fire that's not smoke you're not a dragon
[39:52.880 --> 40:01.200]  it's water vapor water vapor your lungs are moist it's coming out at 90 plus
[40:01.200 --> 40:07.480]  percent humidity it's cold outside so you see it and that's what's coming out
[40:07.480 --> 40:13.240]  of the stacks they're not smoke stacks they're not smoke stacks there are real
[40:13.240 --> 40:17.200]  smoke stacks in the country not many of them they're mainly on government
[40:17.200 --> 40:25.440]  installations like the anison alabama army base where they burn sarin and vx
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.080]  nerve gas to dispose of it and they have a government waivers and under
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.760]  homeland security laws you don't get to get the details but local scientific
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.760]  groups have metered it and are finding toxins in the environment so yes there
[40:39.760 --> 40:45.360]  are over 2,000 dump sites off the Atlantic off the Pacific and in the gulf
[40:45.360 --> 40:51.840]  of Mexico where the US Army Air Force and other branches have dumped chemical
[40:51.840 --> 40:56.920]  weapons and radiation containing barrels but you're not gonna hear Al Gore
[40:56.920 --> 41:02.640]  talking about that you're not gonna hear about the hundreds of thousands of
[41:02.640 --> 41:10.480]  cross species created new new creatures that are part insect part goat part human
[41:10.480 --> 41:16.080]  part pig part cow chimeras not gonna hear about that being dangerous even
[41:16.080 --> 41:19.800]  though it's extremely devastatingly dangerous you're not gonna hear about
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.280]  anything real environmental you're going to hear how carbon dioxide is evil and
[41:24.280 --> 41:32.000]  how water vapor coming out of factories is evil okay I'm gonna shut up now
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.880]  because I know we have loaded phone lines and I want to talk about the
[41:35.880 --> 41:41.000]  attempted takeover of health care by government I want to talk about the
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.440]  economy I want to talk about climate gate with Bob John Jeff Lisa Thomas and
[41:46.440 --> 41:51.720]  others and I'm gonna detail more of climate gate and how big a victory this
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.120]  is we need to really savor this and appreciate it and use it we've only
[41:55.120 --> 41:58.920]  begun to expose these people as more and more of their program unravels and I
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.600]  salute everyone out there we need to give thanksgiving to God to that he used
[42:02.600 --> 42:06.080]  great people out there to get the truth out
[42:12.320 --> 42:27.120]  but I wanted to spend five six minutes I wanted to go ahead and go to Steve
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.960]  shank of eFoodsDirect.com because I only promote what I believe in and who I
[42:33.960 --> 42:37.240]  support and most the time who I've already bought products from that's how I
[42:37.240 --> 42:40.860]  find most of sponsors we seek out sponsors we turn down most of sponsors
[42:40.860 --> 42:45.640]  that come to us because I just don't have time to verify it's good or think it
[42:45.640 --> 42:49.240]  looks weird I don't promote it but if I find out that something really works for
[42:49.240 --> 42:56.160]  me and his quality I promoted here and they've got a holiday special and people
[42:56.160 --> 43:02.440]  are just going wild right now the holiday special supply has been shipping
[43:02.440 --> 43:08.480]  like crazy it's a five-month food supply of the newest fast and easy meals this
[43:08.480 --> 43:13.120]  is all recently produced it's brand new food the five-month holiday special
[43:13.120 --> 43:19.080]  originally had a price of $765 with the 10% off it now runs to December 15th
[43:19.080 --> 43:23.200]  the price is only $688 you cannot find a better deal this is high quality food
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.480]  not some you know made 10 years ago like a lot of people sell if you do the math
[43:27.480 --> 43:32.800]  that's $34 a week for food about 61 cents of serving breakfast lunch and
[43:32.800 --> 43:37.920]  dinner along with bakery goods fruit snacks are all double servings every
[43:37.920 --> 43:42.200]  one of these recipes tastes good and is easy to prepare the families are eating
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.760]  more of this food than they are storing and I wanted to bring up Steve shank of
[43:47.760 --> 43:51.840]  eFoodsDirect Steve good to have you here with us hey it's great to be a board
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.800]  Alex I just had a couple points on what you were just commenting on very simply
[43:55.800 --> 44:00.560]  co2 is what plants breathe to create oxygen so that we can breathe and the
[44:00.560 --> 44:05.640]  other thing is I used to work for Armco steel and steel mills have great big
[44:05.640 --> 44:11.400]  smokestacks because they're putting a lot of heat and I was responsible for
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.040]  out of the engineering department that kept the scrubbers going a scrubber is
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.200]  what is at the base of one of those smokestacks and scrubs all in the
[44:19.200 --> 44:24.480]  particular matter out of the smoke and turns it into a water vapor just exactly
[44:24.480 --> 44:28.640]  like what you're talking about but this global warming thing has really got me
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.240]  aggravated because as you and I've talked before even though it's now being
[44:34.240 --> 44:40.520]  proven a fraud the implementations that they've already got in place causing
[44:40.520 --> 44:45.080]  high electrical bill for farmers trying to dry the crops that they're now hard
[44:45.080 --> 44:49.760]  that they're finishing up the harvest on this year putting regulations in and
[44:49.760 --> 44:53.080]  the cost and the taxes and things like that so farmers are gonna have a hard
[44:53.080 --> 44:58.000]  time planting this next year it's all coming down to food over and over and
[44:58.000 --> 45:04.600]  over again and right now Alex US news came out with a report that one in six
[45:04.600 --> 45:09.000]  people in this country have food anxiety in other words they don't know what
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.440]  they're going to be eating the next day and so that's why we came up with this
[45:13.440 --> 45:19.520]  holiday special this holiday supply that literally puts food in a family's home
[45:19.520 --> 45:25.080]  for $34 a week now you try and do that the grocery store in fact if you double
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.080]  it you can put one of these in for a storage supply and eat the other one and
[45:30.080 --> 45:33.440]  you'd come out still cheaper than what you do with groceries and this food is
[45:33.440 --> 45:39.440]  better than you get in the grocery store so we're really trying to get things
[45:39.440 --> 45:43.720]  happening and thanks to your help we've got a lot of families that are getting
[45:43.720 --> 45:49.960]  in food and as things mature with this insanity of the global warming thing and
[45:49.960 --> 45:54.560]  all of the economic circumstances that are knocking people out of work I'm
[45:54.560 --> 45:58.400]  reading articles every single day we have people contacting us that are
[45:58.400 --> 46:02.440]  working with that with the food that that you and I are trying to get into
[46:02.440 --> 46:07.000]  their into their homes and are being relieved that now they can buy some
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.120]  groceries which they couldn't afford at the grocery store even if they're off
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.560]  work so that's what we're trying to do with this food and this new this is a
[46:15.560 --> 46:18.560]  new innovation of the quick and easy foods that are more nutritious than
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.160]  anything you can cook yourself it's just absolutely phenomenal and the message
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.680]  needs to get out and people need to get themselves in a situation where they're
[46:26.680 --> 46:33.480]  prepared for this insanity that's being cooked up against us I heartily agree
[46:33.480 --> 46:38.360]  Steve and I said earlier I only promote what I believe in just like I told
[46:38.360 --> 46:42.000]  people by gold when it was two hundred and sixty two hundred eighty dollars an
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.600]  ounce it's now one thousand two hundred and twenty six dollars and rising I don't
[46:49.600 --> 46:56.120]  know if people everyone will need this food but I know that statistically we
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.080]  are only going into more and more insane times and I as you know Steve
[47:00.080 --> 47:04.280]  ordering it from you I tried other places and didn't like the quality have
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.960]  gotten a lot of food and I bought food for family I mean I really believe in
[47:08.960 --> 47:12.600]  this and and this new line of food you have is just amazing that the other
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.280]  stuff was great as well and when you look at how the globalists openly state
[47:18.280 --> 47:22.080]  that they want to shut off our resources and have us totally dependent on them
[47:22.080 --> 47:27.920]  this is food that lasts more than a decade it's high quality food is the
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.320]  bottom line and going into this whole depressionary system whether you end up
[47:32.320 --> 47:36.640]  using it or not it's insurance that you've got to have and unfortunately it
[47:36.640 --> 47:40.840]  looks more and more like people are going to need it and as you said many
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.760]  people years ago that bought food from you are now living off of it we have over
[47:44.760 --> 47:48.680]  twenty percent unemployment the government says ten point two CNBC
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.400]  analysts say it's at least seventeen point five this isn't a game or a joke
[47:53.400 --> 47:58.880]  and because you're producing the food you're making it's non-gmo non-hybrid
[47:58.880 --> 48:02.560]  because you don't have all the advertising and all the distribution all
[48:02.560 --> 48:06.960]  the big stores people are getting this at wholesale prices they're getting this
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.520]  food at lower prices than what most grocery stores are buying it from their
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.360]  distributors so people are going factory direct as what's happening and
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.520]  that's why the savings are so great correct Steve that's absolutely true and
[48:19.520 --> 48:23.360]  oddly enough with this holiday special with the 10% thing that's going to
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.440]  December 15th they literally can buy two of these for less than what they pay
[48:28.440 --> 48:32.840]  for groceries store one and eat the other one and keep on doing it that way
[48:32.840 --> 48:35.920]  and they can actually build a supply while they're eating food this
[48:35.920 --> 48:39.800]  significantly significantly cheaper than what they're spending and at the
[48:39.800 --> 48:44.800]  same time these foods don't have any hydrogenated oil all the junk that they
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.720]  get stuck with when they buy groceries and cooking themselves at the grocery
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.880]  store it's just amazing stuff I'm excited about it but we've got to get the
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.600]  message out to more people and people be living on this stuff and and and coming
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.200]  out of this depression alive for crying out loud Steve I really don't even want
[49:00.200 --> 49:03.760]  to tell listeners why things going to happen but everybody I talked to can
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.960]  see it they can feel it in their gut we are really descending into an abyss
[49:07.960 --> 49:12.360]  right now but there is some good things that are happening like the climate
[49:12.360 --> 49:18.240]  gate being exposed that is just devastating their agenda as all these
[49:18.240 --> 49:21.560]  professors get in trouble as governments that were set to pass the carbon
[49:21.560 --> 49:26.840]  tax systems like Australia that just imploded and failed but the problem is
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.320]  the states in the US are implementing it by fiat Swartz and Eger couldn't get
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.280]  the legislature to ban TVs above 40 inches and attacks the rest so he just
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.840]  ordered the bureaucracy to put the tax on it it's complete lawlessness by these
[49:41.840 --> 49:46.280]  people many states are putting travel taxes in for carbon tax we need to let
[49:46.280 --> 49:49.840]  the public know the carbon taxes are already here this is just the beginning
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.880]  and we need to address it these taxes are based on fraud and stop it but Steve
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.120]  and the time we have left I want to give people the email the website it's

[57:07.520 --> 57:13.440]  it's already 22 and every real index I look for it to go all the way up to 28
[57:13.440 --> 57:21.960]  29% before it's all said and done before we get before we get this back on our
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.320]  side and constitutional rights we got a swing back a lot of this carbon tax
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.960]  taxes that are already enforced like you said you were right on the mark you
[57:30.960 --> 57:35.600]  were right on the mark about the dumping of the seron gas and and the
[57:35.600 --> 57:41.200]  nuclear waste well that's admitted I mean that that that's all on record that
[57:41.200 --> 57:45.880]  when the Pentagon under national security they're authorized to do it just
[57:45.880 --> 57:51.680]  every week they I mean you can Google Pentagon dumps 11 million gallons of
[57:51.680 --> 57:55.760]  nerve gas and Delaware River it'll come up I remember that headline from like
[57:55.760 --> 58:00.320]  five years ago you can Google nuclear waste dumped the Atlantic Ocean by
[58:00.320 --> 58:04.960]  Pentagon I mean it just thousands of cases I mean it's that's a real
[58:04.960 --> 58:11.320]  environmental problem not carbon dioxide that's right you're exactly right
[58:11.320 --> 58:16.120]  and corrupt legislative branches both state and federal have allowed that to
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.800]  happen and corrupt government entities have allowed that to happen they look

[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:35.160]  Alex Jones there is no way to overstate how big climate gate is because it
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:41.400]  reaches into all the warrens of corruption in the United Nations and the
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:46.760]  private corporations that control it and their world taxation micro management
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:51.600]  control freight system we're gonna be breaking that down more in this hour so
[1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:54.280]  much news coming out on that front but let's continue with phone calls right
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:01:01.160]  now let's talk to John and Kansas John you're on the air hello Alex hey John
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:08.680]  yeah good I have a suggestion for your new for your new movie about eugenics yes
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:19.120]  should I think you should interview lawyer John Schlittman with the movie a
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:26.200]  civil action was based on this was about the incident when Anderson versus
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:32.280]  cryovac in Waburn Massachusetts where they've been caught poisoning
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:38.560]  poisoning the water system and I want to say that because that movie was like
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:44.320]  mainstream and it had John Travolta and Robert Duvall as active in it well I
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:47.640]  should go I should go interview some of the surviving black men who were given
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:51.920]  civilists and allowed to spread civilists from Tuskegee I mean that it's a good
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:56.240]  idea to interview victims or interview some of the surviving hemophiliacs that
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:03.280]  have HIV from their pharmaceutical knowingly putting HIV in it knowing
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:07.280]  they were shipping it out but yeah it's just that it's a whole budgetary issue
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:11.360]  of the money to fly out and interview all these people and do it and and to
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:16.880]  have the staff to be able to do it but that's certainly a good idea yeah and I
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:21.560]  say that because it's a mainstream movie and people who've seen it in 1998 when
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:25.440]  it came out can recognize oh yeah I remember that John Travolta was in
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:27.920]  that are they accidentally put the poison in the water because I don't know
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:33.240]  about the case I'm vaguely remember you know they have trial it was Beatrice
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:39.920]  food it was also Beatrice foods through their subculture but wasn't it an
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:45.880]  accident well I guess they call it an accident because here's the deal there
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:50.200]  are thousands of cases of wink-wink accidents where they just let it happen
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:56.560]  to save money we have cases sir where they knowingly give pregnant wives of
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:01.200]  GIs uranium pills telling them it's vitamins to see what it'll do to them we
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:05.720]  have cases where they radiate children to death on purpose we have cases where
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:09.680]  they give people diseases where they spray the troops with nerve gas where
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:14.840]  they kill them like project shad I mean we have cases where they knowingly so
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:17.800]  many I don't know if you've seen my film in-game blueprint for global
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:22.440]  enslavement it's a two-hour 40-minute film we spend 20 minutes just case
[1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:26.360]  after case with mainstream articles and videos just showing where they
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:31.000]  knowingly kill people I mean they don't just accidentally let some stuff leak
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:36.400]  out in the water they knowingly do this and wanting to hurt people but that's
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:39.320]  an interesting case I appreciate your call and I mean I appreciate the
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:43.440]  suggestion I'm not poopooing it and I'm just saying we got stuff a lot worse
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:48.640]  than that man I mean bear pharmaceutical alone Baxter mixing the weaponized
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:52.640]  bird flu with vaccines all those homeless people dying in other cases I mean
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:57.280]  this is all admitted being given it I mean this is real the magnitude of this
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:02.360]  I keep saying the magnitude I mean I can't believe I'm just here calmly on
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:06.480]  air even talking about it I can't believe it's gone this far I can't believe
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:13.840]  that that our country is this insane that our world is run by these murderous
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:19.920]  criminals bear pharmaceutical for more than a decade knew that all of their
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:24.960]  factor 8 blood drug had HIV and hepatitis in it this came out in French
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:31.680]  court this came out in US court I mean I could play the MSNBC news pieces on
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:37.280]  this I don't get up here and just say bear is doing this without having it
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:42.760]  absolutely nailed down I'd be sued off the face the earth in 15 seconds that's
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:48.480]  a multi-billion dollar a month company it's true I don't just get up here and
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:52.320]  say they nerve gas our troops to death or in places like New York State they
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:57.400]  grab foster kids and test pesticides on them till they die by design that's New
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:02.880]  York Daily News this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:07.120]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:11.440]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:15.240]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:18.880]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:23.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:28.080]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:31.840]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:35.320]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:39.240]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:18.840]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:24.120]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:28.640]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:33.320]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:10.560]  gonna be going over that also tea party co-founder says concept has been hijacked
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:15.520]  by false left-right paradigm as we pointed out months ago criticizing the
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:19.480]  fact that Glenn Beck and others have completely taken it over that way once
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:22.640]  the Republicans get back in power the globalist can continue their operations
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:27.720]  both parties are controlled their job is to contain real peaceful revolution
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:32.480]  through the political system in this nation that's why the Pentagon and the
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.520]  FBI and mainstream news articles have quoted that all protesting is a form of
[1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:44.640]  terrorism anything pro-america anything freedom-oriented anything good is now
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:49.840]  bad anything that deals with the Bill of Rights and Constitution is bad they
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:54.880]  call us in their manuals constitutional terrorist this is out of the
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:59.400]  electronic frontier foundation surveillance shocker sprint received
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:04.160]  eight million law enforcement request and that's just their automatic for GPS
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:10.320]  location data in the past year that's just sprint tracking where you are and
[1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:15.960]  what you're doing right now let's go back to the phone calls who's up next
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:25.120]  here John Jeff and Delaware you're on the air welcome Jeff how you doing today first
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:29.800]  and foremost I'd like to say that you're the best at what you do mr. Jones you
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:35.080]  taught me so much I've been listening to you since March and within this time
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:39.800]  frame you did talk me so much you then my eye was already starting to open but
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:44.680]  you didn't force it all the way open and I don't really understand how people
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:51.720]  can see this conspiracy that's going on maybe it's because Lucifer well with
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:56.640]  these people I guess worship has the whole world blind and they can't
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:01.440]  understand it can't conceive this these thoughts in a mind but these people are
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:06.200]  actually out here doing this and what made me call is because I was watching
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:11.240]  Bloomberg watching the burn the Bernanke hearing or his confirmation hearing and
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:17.440]  one guy only one person I didn't see the Sanders um I didn't see the Sanders
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.600]  part but I've seen the one guy he's a Republican he dug up in Bernanke and he
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:28.520]  was telling the truth but then you had Senator Dodd and Schumer and then he
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:33.080]  even had the guy ever and by like they know what's going on you can see it in
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:36.720]  a face like you can see it they know what's going on and they're sitting
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:41.560]  and smirking and laughing and like Dodd in the beginning of the confirmation
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:44.760]  hearing he said he already knew that Bernanke was going to get the thing or
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:49.200]  get the confirmation like what we're gonna do like is the American people
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:54.440]  gonna stand up and do something and say something I mean if we can't do violence
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:58.840]  because we're not gonna win but it's gonna turn out that way it's like what
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:05.200]  we're gonna do what are we gonna do well I mean there's a time to be born a time
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:12.480]  to die a time to kill I mean but you know the point is that would just muddy
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:17.200]  all of the waters if people started getting violent who do you get violent
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:22.440]  against it's a corrupt system throughout you have to expose the system and try to
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:28.080]  have a level discussion in a level forum to educate the public that's why the
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:31.600]  establishment tried to consolidate the media that's why they tried to shut down
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:34.920]  any alternatives to free speech that's why they've got free speech zones and
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:39.600]  tried to attack peaceful people at demonstrations or higher provocateurs
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:43.080]  so the police have a pretext to attack the peaceful demonstrations they've been
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:47.880]  caught red-handed everywhere so that they can chill free speech because we do
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:51.720]  have power and they are afraid of us and they are afraid of what we're doing
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:56.400]  and it's just a process the New World Order wasn't built in a day they didn't
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:00.560]  take over in a day they don't have complete control yet and we're not gonna
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:05.600]  defeat them in a day just the act of resisting them speaking out against them
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:14.040]  challenging them aggressively in the end will bring these globalist down and so
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:19.160]  that's the bottom line and it is really good to hear from you my friend let's go
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:25.640]  ahead and talk to Lisa in Minnesota Lisa you're on the air hi Alex me and my
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:29.680]  husband are living here in Minnesota and we're involved in uncovering a lot that
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:35.560]  has to do with the whole mortgage fraud and we're having our rights trampled on
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:40.920]  by public officials not recording documents that the statutes their
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:46.880]  statutes say we can record I want to get back to the guy that was on before the
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:51.600]  big thing is we need to stop giving these people jurisdiction over us and
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.440]  that's what they're doing they're running the show because we let them when we
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:00.480]  don't stop and say no this is enough you know we have a family we have kids and
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:05.040]  you know me and my husband are out there on the line trying to do something for
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:09.840]  the for everybody but so many people are out there so afraid you know the fear
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:16.280]  the false evidence appearing real of the boogeyman coming out to get them and
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:22.360]  that's kind of where we're at with things are you there yeah I'm just
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:27.280]  listening to you caller after caller says what do we do because you're not
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:32.880]  seeing instant success you just have to continue to tell the truth and continue
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:35.680]  to expose these criminals and they will fall but it's not going to happen
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.120]  instantly right an affidavit of truth is a good way to start getting it out use
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:44.600]  their same forms against them you know state your case you know because if you
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:48.280]  put it on record and you file it in the counties you know you're going to put
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:52.240]  evidence there so if it's needed later you can go grab it you know if you make
[1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:56.000]  letters out to these you know an affidavit out to these corrupt
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.280]  individuals eventually you know if we keep doing it together it's all going
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:04.960]  to come out and if it does go into a court situation we can all stand on the
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:09.960]  record you know again I appreciate everything that you're doing and giving
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:14.080]  us a resource that you know to call to but me and my husband actually want to
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:17.960]  know if there's a possibility of meeting you off the record because we've got so
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:22.720]  much evidence and and if you have any information on how to get a hold of
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:27.800]  Jesse Ventura which was our governor here in Minnesota because what we have
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:33.840]  could help stop a big crisis that's going on in all state and that's the
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.400]  four okay well listen Lisa I appreciate your call Lisa I don't even have time
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.840]  to do a third of the radio interviews I'm offered it's just I can only do so
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:53.080]  much and so I really never have time to meet with people you know I mean I wish
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:57.840]  I could and I'm sure you found a lot of corruption in your area you know I think
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:01.240]  it's fine to send letters and to file letters and to have it on record to put
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:06.280]  people on notice that they're engaged in criminal or corrupt activity that's an
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:08.920]  act of standing up to them but it's also important just to go to County
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:14.800]  Commissioner City Council and speak out on the record about what you know and
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:18.640]  and to make it as simple and straightforward as you can a lot of
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:23.800]  patriots are so awake to more subtle nuances of the corporate fraud that they
[1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:30.160]  kind of bring people into the debate at a PhD level and and and so you're almost
[1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:39.120]  talking a different a different language a different language to folks but you
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:42.880]  know that's why a lot of people contact me and they think if they could just talk
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:47.320]  to me or talk to somebody else off air that there was a silver bullet or of
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:51.360]  or of or if we just carried out this one plan or this one operation or this one
[1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:55.560]  it's more than that it's it's millions of people doing millions of different
[1:16:55.560 --> 1:17:00.080]  things discrediting the system exposing the system pointing out the shadow
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:03.920]  government but pointing out both major parties are controlled pointing out that
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:07.440]  it's a military industrial complex dictatorship we're already under and
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:12.320]  that it's intensifying and and pointing out that open borders will bankrupt our
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:15.760]  country further and as part of the public plan by the Council on Foreign
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:18.920]  Relations to bring in the North American Union that's their own admissions to
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:22.560]  beat that and to beat their anti-gun bills and to beat their takeover of
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:28.880]  healthcare and to try to stop these wars they've launched I mean there's so
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:39.080]  many issues we have to get involved in as well okay let's go ahead and go to Joe
[1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:43.680]  in Arizona Joe you're on the air hey Alex what's going on worldwide broadcast
[1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:47.040]  what's going on with you I'm not too much I just want to see if you got a
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:51.320]  chance to see the Jesse Ventura show last night I didn't I was up interviewing
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:54.960]  Dave Mustaine in Dallas but everybody in the office that was here said they saw
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:58.640]  it and thought it was pretty impressive yeah let me tell you I knew about that
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:02.160]  harp thing about a few months ago and I was trying to tell my parents and they're
[1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:06.120]  like no no no way and actually recorded it and watched it with them and they
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:09.360]  their eyes are open and like a lot of people are calling you asking what to
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:13.560]  do just plant a seed and then it starts to grow it's just well I mean I can't
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:16.800]  believe they let this on air because you know I've seen large clips of the
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:22.840]  episodes and some of the full episodes and they it all seemed to be towards our
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:26.680]  side you know because it's mainstream television they have to you know have
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:32.040]  some quote objectivity you know towards the delusional official story that
[1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:35.960]  there's no government corruption but this is a first that they're allowing this
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:41.280]  on television and it's because the system is imploding and it's because they've
[1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:45.880]  lost all credibility that they're now being forced to allow a little bit of
[1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:49.560]  this out there because it's already common knowledge with more and more
[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:55.040]  people but overall what grade would you give the piece you saw on harp oh I
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:59.200]  would definitely say like a 10 just it was it was it fully just like even I
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:03.040]  think Jesse Ventura was just like wow totally he didn't know about it and he
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:06.520]  was just his eyes were open to and I've done reading about it and actually sat
[1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:09.760]  down and talked to my dad and he was just like no way that could happen and I
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:14.320]  recorded it and then showed it him to him and it just he was blown away just
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:20.080]  like wow yeah I've had the director of harp on from harp and he starts talking
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:25.360]  about how they can ignite the upper atmosphere with these antennas and then
[1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:31.760]  suddenly someone on the line cuts in and tells him he can't talk about that I
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:35.920]  mean when I got him on they had Air Force officers she was a private
[1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:40.480]  scientist the head of harp that they had Air Force officers telling me what I
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:45.360]  couldn't couldn't say that they were gonna cut the interview short if I went
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:51.160]  any place that was bad but they wouldn't say what that was and only the
[1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:55.640]  board ops could hear that going on but John Harmon heard that maybe I should get
[1:19:55.640 --> 1:19:59.960]  John on because he heard that during the breaks and then John could tell you as
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:04.720]  a witness hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters thinking of

[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:45.400]  everywhere Bernanke goes he's being criticized that's why they've created
[1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:49.400]  groups the Federal Reserve is on record at high schools public schools colleges
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:54.640]  professional guilds dental associations medical associations nursing
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:59.640]  associations business associations sending out Federal Reserve representatives

[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:09.000]  doing this for years they for decades they've had brainwashing programs in the
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.360]  public schools but now we're there countering them with the truth and
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:18.400]  everywhere they go they're being confronted in five years ago people were
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:23.280]  reverent groveling to Fed chairman they were reverent to the bankers they you
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:26.520]  know that they they treated them like they were an imperial emperor with more
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:32.080]  reverence than the president now they're treated with contempt because those
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:36.120]  congressmen know they're gonna be voted out they're gonna be shouted down and
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:41.760]  they at least don't confront them publicly some of it is grandstanding so
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:46.720]  the beginning of the end for these people is here you want a solution it's

[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:10.280]  want to play this quick clip of senator sanders talking about the potential to
[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:14.280]  block Bernanke's confirmation hearing this is from Bloomberg's YouTube channel
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:18.200]  here it is standards the independent of Vermont is leading the opposition of
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:21.440]  Ben Bernanke up here on Capitol Hill thank you sir for the time and we got
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:24.520]  word overnight not only gonna vote against Ben Bernanke for his confirmation
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:28.800]  you're gonna put a hold on his nomination on the floor tell me why this
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:33.400]  country is facing the worst economic disaster since the 1930s we have 17
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:37.200]  percent of our people unemployed or underemployed the immediate cause of
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:40.720]  this crisis is the greed the recklessness the illegal behavior on
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.400]  Wall Street and the American people are asking where was the fit their
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:48.280]  responsibility is to oversee the safety and soundness of our financial
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:52.680]  institutions where were these guys when Wall Street engaged in a huge gambling
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:56.480]  spree that led to the collapse so that's number one they really did not do their
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:00.400]  job in terms of protecting the American people and keeping a close eye on a
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:04.200]  financial institutions the second issue is what has happened since the collapse
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:08.560]  have they reached out and try to protect the needs of working people in the
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:12.720]  middle class for has been their main concede main interest popping up Wall
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:16.600]  Street the needs of these big CEOs I think most American people think they
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:21.120]  are not where we need them sir is it fair to pin this all on Ben Bernanke you
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:25.640]  some say Alan Greenspan maybe bears a responsibility for this it's not it's
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:31.600]  not fair to blame everything on but the fact of the matter is Bernanke was part
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:36.280]  of the Bush administration chairman of the council any kind of advises for
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:40.720]  George Bush when President Obama came in people are saying you know it's time for
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:46.560]  a change it's time for a new look at the relationship of Wall Street to the
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.880]  productive economy that's the idea of having continuing somebody on board was
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:56.880]  the part of the so so that's the basic partisanship he's throwing and even
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:00.440]  though he's posing independent making it about Bush and Obama and all these
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:05.440]  puppets the same Wall Street crew ran Clinton ran Bush ran Obama that's what
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:10.560]  my film fall the Republic exposes and it's like saying it's not fair to blame
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:15.660]  Ben Bernanke it's saying don't blame Stalin he only worked for Lenin or don't
[1:29:15.660 --> 1:29:21.160]  blame Heinrich Himmler he only worked for Hitler I mean he he's at the very
[1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:27.680]  top of this fraud and and and the Federal Reserve is not there to safeguard us
[1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:30.880]  Senator Sanders it's there to rob us and rape us and vertically integrate the
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.820]  economy it's the holding company for the private offshore banks that
[1:29:34.820 --> 1:29:39.400]  engineered the crisis through their controllers at Goldman Sachs and that's
[1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:43.920]  now mainstream news they are the progenitors of the collapse they wanted
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:48.160]  to collapse the economy so they could consolidate wealth and bring in total
[1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:53.640]  government control socialist Sanders we're on the march the empires on the

[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:34.760]  seller I decided to make them limited edition now the famous poster that we

[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:51.560]  posted them so then they started saying okay it's okay so people would back off
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:56.240]  but the point is we made it into a shirt and there's four different variants of
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:03.960]  the shirt in black and white so eight different variants total and four of

[1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:50.560]  I get into climate gate all the financial news which I will cover and we are
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:55.440]  change is joining us next hour with their incredible routing of Al Gore got
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:00.280]  five different groups coming on who are truly on the cutting edge of 1776 and
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:06.160]  the 21st century version of that in the info war so I salute you all hail the
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:11.760]  fighters for freedom the sons and daughters of liberty you make the
[1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:15.640]  founders proud I will tell you but you certainly know that in your spirit
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:22.160]  though don't you that you're on the right side of history Dave Mustaine is
[1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:26.960]  conservatively the founder of mega death conservatively the second biggest and
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:31.320]  most successful heavy metal band which is one of the major genres of music in
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:35.040]  history Metallica is obviously number one but as he's told me an interview last
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:43.200]  night he's part Metallica because he was there at their very start but we've had
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:46.160]  Dave Mustaine on a few times and last time he was on whether he said that he's
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:52.840]  become a Christian and that he really is welcome to the new world order and that
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:55.440]  my films have really welcome him up thanks to people giving them to them and
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:40:59.280]  he named his new album in game after my film in game blueprint for global
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:02.760]  enslavement and he said when I come to Texas I'd like to hang out get some
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:06.800]  barbecue with you and so be sure give me a call in November and I did I forgotten
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:11.000]  did it did it just a few days before they were in town but he invited me up and
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:18.360]  I ended up spending I don't know four hours with him and the band and you know
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:21.040]  in the interview he explained I always liked mega death because it was
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:24.840]  political it was anti-new world order even when I was a teenager and we're
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:33.240]  talking 20 years ago more than 20 years ago well that's hard to believe but
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:42.680]  listen to him so I was about 12 and you know he said I was never a Satanist but
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:49.000]  and I never knew that you know to a certain extent you know I was part of
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  something overall that was bad but you know now his his message is a very good
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.600]  one and totally anti-new world order and you know to have one of the monsters
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:08.320]  one of the kings of heavy metal that's so much of it is just just just filled
[1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:16.880]  with the occult to have him come out for truth and again when I tell you these
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:21.800]  stories it's not oh look I'm hanging out with Dave Mustaine when we go get these
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:25.800]  interviews then the tens of millions and that's conservative of mega death fans
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:31.000]  become listeners of ours and vice versa a lot of our listeners then become
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:34.800]  listeners of mega death and Dave talked about that as well but then I went out
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:39.640]  into the crowd of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:49.360]  people and I literally couldn't couldn't go anywhere backstage or in the
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:54.480]  crowd there were Obama Joker info wars.com shirts there were info wars.com
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:43:00.520]  shirts there were info wars.com hats there were people who are 50 years old
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.960]  people who were 20 years old I mean I got mobbed ladies and gentlemen and again
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:11.080]  that is another indicator of just how many people this radio show is reaching
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:13.880]  and you know I knew we were reaching a lot of people five years ago I knew a
[1:43:13.880 --> 1:43:19.320]  reason a lot of people a year ago but it is just getting insane I mean we really
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:22.560]  have a responsibility here to do a good job and go to the next level because we
[1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:28.560]  have a lot of people listening and it's across the board old young black white
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:34.800]  Hispanic I mean I can go to a country music event fans everywhere I can go
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:41.120]  to a ballet listeners everywhere stopping me I can go to a hardcore heavy
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:47.840]  metal concert in Dallas Texas literally can't go two feet two feet without
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.760]  running into listeners I mean this show I've underestimated the power and the
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:58.800]  reach of the films and the websites and the radio show and all of it and I just
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:03.080]  want to thank the listeners out there because you have done something really
[1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:08.520]  special because I'm only a small part of this and I'm only one vein you know me
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:12.520]  in the arm that wields the fist at the face of the New World Order all of us
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:17.160]  together just make up tiny parts of it but just from where I am sitting believe
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:21.000]  me I'm sitting on higher ground that a lot of people out there because I'm on
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:25.080]  the radio I'm in the media I interact with the public the public recognized me
[1:44:25.080 --> 1:44:31.960]  so I get more pings more sonar pings back and it is now reach crescendo level
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:37.680]  and it's only rising right now the amount of people that are awakening to the
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:42.840]  truth it is explosive this country is in a revolution of awakening and
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:48.880]  Renaissance and enlightenment and understanding and I just want to be
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:53.440]  thankful to God I really am thankful to God for protecting me all these years for
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:57.800]  forgiving me all these years I'm certainly not perfect I and I want to
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:02.240]  thank my family and all of everybody out there who's prayed for us because we
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:06.680]  have gone through a lot of persecution but I guess God chose me and many others
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:10.360]  for this job because I've got a pretty thick skin and quite frankly people
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:17.000]  attacking me only makes me work harder and so on so many fronts I did fit the
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:26.440]  bill for the for the for the position I I feel but you are going to see more
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:33.560]  attacks against us and I don't mind personally being attacked by mainstream
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:42.200]  media alternative media disinformation operatives but I do lament I do grieve I
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:51.160]  do have sorrow it's actually a painful spot in my heart for all of the great
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:57.000]  minds that have been awakened but only only a little bit and who are opening
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:04.480]  up to a wider world who then gets sucked in to the disinformation and then never
[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:08.440]  fully go out and wake other people up or grow to their potential because they
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:15.240]  then fall into the kind of conspiratoid world of speculation and disinfo and
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:20.000]  infighting which is right out of the FBI training manuals and the defeatist
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:27.880]  attitude and all of it and just the flotillas of whole cloth lies that are
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:35.680]  told about us you name it it's it's said and done that are stated as if they're
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:45.280]  total fact but don't even have a shred of truth to them and I just from time to
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:53.000]  time when I asked the listeners to not spend your time defending Alex Jones
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:58.840]  warn people about sodium fluoride in the water warn people about mercury in the
[1:46:58.840 --> 1:47:02.720]  vaccines warn people about the North American Union warn people about the
[1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:06.280]  carbon tax takeover and how the states nationwide are already passing the
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:12.520]  carbon tax laws to run our lives to control our lives warn people about
[1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:17.160]  serious issues where you can actually help someone and where you can actually
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:21.280]  inform someone and where you can potentially make their life a lot better
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:27.800]  and even potentially save their lives okay because the New World Order wants
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:34.000]  to attack Alex Jones and and and make the movement that's exploding about Alex
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:41.800]  Jones at a selfish level I could give you the PT Barnum quote about I don't
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:44.880]  care what you say about me in the newspaper as long as you spell my name
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:54.240]  right because at a very worldly level it is good for this radio show and good
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:48:00.160]  for my websites and good for my films that so many people attack me and so
[1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:03.480]  many of the attacks against us for mainstream alternative media you name
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:15.360]  it really is is is one of the pillars of what has actually made us so
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:19.760]  successful so I guess you know the Bible says God takes a tax against his
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:26.120]  people and turns it into something good and so I guess it all works out and
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:35.280]  God's plan in the end and that's why it's so mind-boggling because I know it's
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:41.920]  bad at levels but it's also good at a certain level but in my gut and in my
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:45.640]  intellect overall I think it's in the final equation bad that's why the system
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:49.840]  does it and promotes it and pushes it to kind of create a fog so that instead of
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:57.040]  you becoming active and involved you get into sewing circles gossip circles just
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:03.720]  spending all your time spinning your wheels when if you actually stand up
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:10.920]  get involved go out and reach out to other people there is a bumper crop of
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:15.920]  awakened minds out there right now but we have to bring the crop in people are
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:19.000]  ready to be awakened they're already awake to a certain extent but we need to
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.520]  be out there speaking to them out there informing them out there waking them up
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:33.040]  further and this whole thing does not need to just be about Alex Jones it
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:36.280]  needs to be about the issues and that's why we always try to stick to the
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:41.120]  issues that's why we're nonpartisan it's why we try to stay out of the race
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:47.280]  issues while we try to stay out of the religious infighting issues I am an
[1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:55.000]  example to others whether it's good or bad I try to live that way and not not
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:58.280]  preach it people about what I think how they should live or what they should do
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:02.360]  I tell you what I'm doing and what I intend to do and what successes I've
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:07.160]  had and what defeats I've had and so hopefully you can not have to experience
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:10.640]  some of the bad things I've experienced that you can take the lessons learned
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:16.920]  from my 14 years of frontline engagement with the New World Order and and and so
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:20.040]  you won't have to live through the mistakes I live through it's like your
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:22.800]  parents you know everybody's parents told them look I know you don't want to

[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:42.040]  government now coming out of the shadows and openly announcing its domination of

[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:02.160]  the incredible victories we're having against this system as well let's
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:05.200]  continue with your phone calls we are changed coming up I will get more into
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:08.080]  climate gate and other issues I mentioned but continuing with your phone
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:14.280]  calls right now Annie in New York you're on the air hi Alex how are you I'm great
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:19.080]  Alex I want to let you know I bought a five pack a full the Republic is gifts
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:23.520]  and a full of the Republican can't be more for me and everyone has to re-gift
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:27.960]  it after they watch it absolutely our make copies of it and give it to people
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:33.480]  and you not only wake people up you fund our operation well and I order our
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:37.360]  coins through my distance I just finished an e-foods direct order so I'm
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:40.920]  doing my shopping through info wars that's why we're able that's why we're
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.840]  able to operate without you we couldn't do it well everybody I have to pitch in
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:50.480]  about climate gate now say this quickly I don't know if you saw the media
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:55.400]  research center released a 12 of network climate gate cover-up and it says that
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:56:00.360]  ABC CBS and NBC's collective silence on climate gate has reached ridiculous
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:04.480]  levels as the broadcast network continue to ignore the great and growing
[1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:08.320]  scandal the bias bio mission has now become scandalous and the second thing
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:13.160]  I'm wondering how vigorous Penn State's investigation of professor man's going
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:17.560]  to be when they have nearly half a billion in contracts with the department
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:21.480]  of energy and I'll take your answer over here Alex thank you well we know
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:25.000]  these aren't going to be very in-depth investigations but professor Jones the
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  kingpin of all this these are the head scientists for the UN this is where they
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.880]  get the data that they then put in the fake peer-reviewed journals and the
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:37.480]  spin by the control media has been well this has been proven to be a fraud but
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:41.400]  we need to focus instead on who stole the emails because that's a crime and very
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:46.680]  horrible and terrible and we also you know need to understand that the peer
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:51.440]  reviewed journals backup man-made climate change and global warming they've
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:55.720]  gone from a freezing earth to a warming earth now to any climate change is bad
[1:56:55.720 --> 1:57:00.600]  and unnatural which is another fraud just as big a fraud is saying polar bears
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:04.920]  can't swim and are all dying which is a total lie I mean it's ridiculous but
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:09.480]  yes these universities get over 90% of their funding from the federal
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:13.320]  government that's what Dwight D. Eisenhower talked about in 1961 in his
[1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:17.840]  farewell address president Eisenhower talked about the dangerous influence and
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:22.720]  takeover of research by the military industrial complex and you know this
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:26.800]  isn't little tree hugger idiots that are just wrong about co2 and really thought
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:30.640]  the earth was warming and wanted to save us and they're wrong this is a group
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:34.200]  of collectivists that want to hijack control over society they're a bunch of
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:37.600]  control freaks that want to micro manage every facet of our lives and we have
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:41.440]  all their own internal documents and textbooks and public UN statements I
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:47.080]  mean this is not our opinion and so of course all the major universities were
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:52.120]  going along with this lie and parroting the East Anglia climate research centers
[1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:57.160]  fraudulent data and NASA Goddard Space Centers fake climate data being they're
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:02.280]  caught red-handed so yes don't expect that arrogant professor man there's a
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:06.760]  video up on prisonplanet.com of him in this article climate gate crooks
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:13.120]  recast themselves as the victims where he just drips with elitism and power and
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:23.280]  and and and and and and and and arrogance and a plum and sits there just
[1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:27.240]  laughing at everyone saying oh I think people in government understand this is
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:31.400]  no big deal and they know the truth and just sat against this little look of
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:36.720]  satisfaction on his face look they're going down okay and they know it they're
[1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:41.400]  a bunch of control-free cockroaches they're not liberals

[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:52.400]  coming up after the break we are going to talk to five different groups of we
[2:00:52.400 --> 2:00:57.440]  are change around the country now what is we are change two and a half three
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:05.720]  years ago Luke Radowski 20 years old woke up watching my police state films
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:10.160]  another example of how you don't know who you're waking up you don't know who's
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:14.240]  watching your films or reading your blog or who you're awakening and what they
[2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:19.000]  will go on to do and Luke started a group called we are change that decided
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  to go out in country front David Rockefeller and Bill Clinton and George
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.200]  Bush and count is the big the Brazinski and countless others and they got
[2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:32.000]  arrested they got attacked they got beat up they got vindicated they got
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.680]  international attention other groups other organizations have picked up on it
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:44.040]  to the point of now you see the people going to Republican and Democrat meet
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:48.600]  and greets speeches public events and shouting down both parties saying we
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:52.160]  want the Federal Reserve abolished we don't want world government we don't
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:59.120]  want a new world order and it's been nonpartisan and the tea parties grew out
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:05.560]  of 9 11 truth out of we are change out of other groups that pioneered the system
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:11.000]  that I originally pioneered unknowingly of going out and going to press
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:14.840]  conferences and asking real questions and then they freak out and grab you and
[2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:18.160]  drag you out and then that is what's all over the newspapers because it was a
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:25.040]  big event I mean I didn't know 14 years ago 10 years ago I started figuring it
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:32.040]  out after that that when I would go to an event ask Janet Reno about the House
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:35.600]  investigation concluding Delta Force was there shooting American citizens at
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:40.400]  Waco that would be the headline in the Associated Press because I would
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:44.440]  simply go ask real questions or I'd ask Governor George Bush a question and be
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:48.680]  arrested and it would be all over Texas newspapers and TV and people would say
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:54.120]  what did Mr. Jones say why was he arrested Governor you say you want to
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.440]  help Texas but you're part of the Council on Foreign Relations that openly
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:01.200]  wants to end America and set up a you know New World Order and isn't it the
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:06.360]  Federal Reserve that's destroying America and deindustrializing us and then
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:10.560]  suddenly I get arrested not intending to and the media says why did he get
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:14.360]  arrested for free speech he asked the question politely and what did he have
[2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:21.200]  to say and then there I was on TV and radio and in newsprint I mean you know
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:26.240]  the big left-controlled fake Ford Foundation demonstrations don't do
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:31.720]  much but thousands of little groups go into press conferences and going to
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:37.720]  events where governors and politicians and city council people you name it big
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:43.080]  and small you go you ask real questions and you take over the whole event
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:46.760]  because they're so criminal they're so aware of what they're doing they're
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:51.160]  gonna flip out I mean 12 years ago you went to a public event and talked about
[2:03:51.160 --> 2:03:54.440]  a New World Order I used to go down to the county commissioners this ended up
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:59.680]  on TV locally many of you saw it on Austin TV and SWAT teams would come in
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:04.560]  and start grabbing me and people would say why are you grabbing him he gets his
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:07.720]  three minutes of communication and they'd say you're not allowed to get up
[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:13.480]  there and talk about a New World Order the Travis County commissioners courts
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:17.640]  trying to ban t-shirts with political messages on them they're gonna get sued
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:23.400]  they're gonna lose that they're showing us how their tyrants and that's what we
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:26.040]  are change has been doing and now everybody's mimicking what they're
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:30.680]  doing see I wake people up they go out and wake up even more people than those
[2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:38.840]  people wake up even more you understand how these dominoes fall and this is one
[2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:45.480]  of the major Achilles heels of the New World Order everywhere Al Gore goes now
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:50.920]  Tea Party groups we are changing others are going in and taking over the media
[2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:56.000]  event and exposing Al Gore for what he is so he just can't be there spewing
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:01.680]  his fraud people are there calling him on it have you ever wanted to generate

[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:18.720]  why because they don't want to give Lord Moncton who'll be outside media

[2:09:54.560 --> 2:10:00.640]  unnatural seasons are unnatural polar bears can't swim all these lies his lie
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:03.840]  about carbon dioxide going up with temperature when it actually follows
[2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:10.000]  hundreds of years after these are all base frauds but here it is up on
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:15.240]  prisonplanet.com right now huge news Gore cancels on Copenhagen lecture leaves
[2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:20.280]  ticket holders in a lurch it seems the uncertainty about Copenhagen is growing
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:26.600]  when Al Gore pulls the plug you know it's over here's another one Holdren
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:31.520]  grilled over email controversy from the National Journal up on prisonplanet.com
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:37.080]  in a hearing that was part sparring match in part high school science lesson
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:41.480]  two of Obama administration's climate change experts John Holdren testified
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:44.200]  today before the House Select Committee on Energy independence and global
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:48.120]  warming about the validity of man-made climate change from the start
[2:10:48.120 --> 2:10:53.160]  Republicans focused on the conversation of the controversial hacked emails from
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:56.320]  East Anglia University's climate research unit in England in which a
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:01.000]  number of scientists made remarks about limiting the dissemination of work by
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:04.840]  climate change skeptics yeah blocking them and persecuting them and how to fix
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:09.520]  the data the research center provides data for much of the intergovernmental
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:13.000]  panel on climate changes conclusions this is the head group the media is like
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:16.720]  oh it's just some backwater university no big deal this is the head group see
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:20.320]  they even lie about that and people are catching them in this Holdren director
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:25.960]  of the White House Office on Science and Technology who wrote Ecoscience this
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:30.040]  book right here calling for drugging the water to sterilize you into how to
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:35.200]  exterminate the population you can't make this stuff up got grilled I'm gonna
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:39.680]  play some of that next hour I mean this is getting just to be incredible also
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:43.840]  Bernanke may have his confirmation held up as he's being grilled that's coming up
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:49.480]  next hour when we cover the economy but I got to move quick now we are
[2:11:49.480 --> 2:11:53.760]  simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv right now I want to move quick because we got

[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:02.600]  after the other and I want to have time to play some of the video clips and
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:09.040]  audio clips here for you that they've shot and we're gonna save the best for
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:13.240]  last Chicago we are change this is how it's done now standing up is how it's
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:17.800]  done I'm no armchair quarterback people on the front lines just standing up and
[2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:20.760]  speaking out against him in front of hundreds of people and in front of TV
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:23.960]  cameras takes incredible courage I'm just saying you want to see a textbook for
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:29.720]  how it's done you watch the Chicago video but we're gonna start with Nathan
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:34.680]  from we are change Rhode Island Club of Rome member Al Gore is asked by Nathan
[2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:39.480]  Florence of Rhode Island and Mark O'Connor of Boston about the New World Order the
[2:12:39.480 --> 2:12:45.680]  C.O.R.'s plan to eliminate 95% of humanity and more he chuckles because
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.000]  genocide is apparently funny to these people and of course this
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.320]  conversation happened before climategate now it's all about climategate then we've
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:56.440]  gotten Matt from we are change Nashville that took over the TV and news
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:00.320]  headlines when they went out and just questioning see he were taking over all
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:04.320]  his media so it's backfiring now every time he speaks it's all about climategay
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:09.880]  but if no one was there he could have it one way oh man this is beautiful I mean
[2:13:09.880 --> 2:13:14.400]  this is victory this is fighting in the trenches ground pounders ladies and
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:22.280]  gentlemen Dan from we are change Toronto confronted Gore we are change Florida
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:26.080]  confronted him we are change Chicago's that's who we've got coming on first off
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:30.080]  is Nathan from we are change do we have Nathan and Mark O'Connor we just going
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:35.560]  to Nathan okay Nathan good to have you here before we get into what you've been
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:38.480]  doing with Gore and how exciting it is from the inside to be witnessing this
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:41.440]  won't your take on that what do you think about in cancelling his much
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:48.200]  vaunted speaking tour in in Copenhagen I love it it shows that we're making it
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:52.040]  you know the impact that we always knew we would be it's just great to see these
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:55.240]  people cowering and like just like he does on the film and you see that time and
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:58.800]  time again through these we are change confrontation just like you always knew it
[2:13:58.800 --> 2:14:04.440]  would have an impact that's right you knew resistance was victory yes absolutely
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:08.880]  and you see it like I said time and time again he is a coward he knows that he's
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:12.440]  wrong he knows he's part of something wicked and when you stand up against him
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:16.560]  you see him shiver away like a little beast well they have their goons grab
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:21.200]  people every time yeah even if you politely asking questions they do yes
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:26.880]  oh yeah absolutely well I think it's important that you be focused if you're
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:29.640]  up close you know just speaking a regular voice but if they start dragging you
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:33.800]  away screaming out climate a climate gate which is happening this is just
[2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:36.920]  beautiful tell us tell us about this little short clip we're going to play
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:41.600]  from Rhode Island okay it was actually in Boston outside the Wang theater on

[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:56.680]  colleague managed to call him a coward to his face he doesn't respond he hides
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:02.200]  his security pushes us away and he's escorted you know by a police escort away
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:08.080]  we're gonna go ahead and play the meat of this clip and then be sure and plug
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:13.680]  your website Nathan we are change working with we are change Boston
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:20.400]  confronting gore on the population reduction agenda here's that clip

[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:19.000]  back that up I want to read that quote from Al Gore from one of his disgusting
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:24.040]  books of propaganda that polar bears can't swim humanity is a sitting on a
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:28.720]  time bomb in the vast majority of the world science are right we have just
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:33.840]  ten years to avert a major catastrophe that could send the entire planet's
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:38.160]  climate system into a tailspin of epic destruction involving extreme weather
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:43.000]  floods droughts epidemics and killer heat waves beyond anything we have ever
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:47.680]  experienced a catastrophe of our own making Al Gore an inconvenient truth and
[2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:50.800]  then when there's an earthquake or a flood or a fire they say look it's
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:55.240]  happening but it's always happening just the media points cameras at it and says
[2:17:55.240 --> 2:18:02.480]  it's the end of the world yes yeah and I would like to say I did a lot of
[2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:05.680]  reading before I made the decision to go get him I mean check him into the
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:09.640]  international crisis group Brookings institution the IPCC documents going back
[2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:15.040]  to I think it was founded by the UN in 1988 we really mark and I you know we've
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:18.240]  looked up a lot of stuff and I encourage everyone listening right now take to
[2:18:18.240 --> 2:18:22.800]  read reading will will open your eyes to all of this their real plans right now
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:28.400]  I'm reading a book by Peter Singer who is friends with Paul Ehrlich John Holdren
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:33.000]  you know they're there are quotes in this book from them praise and on the
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:38.680]  back cover from Holdren and Ehrlich and this is called one world this is a man
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:44.080]  that openly openly supports euthanasia abortion infanticide global government
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:50.240]  this stuff is real this is we own over a hundred books by these people where they
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:56.920]  brag they're drugging our water supply I mean these are hardcore people yes yes
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:01.520]  they are not kidding around and we are changes here to stand up to them and
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:05.720]  we're not gonna stop well sir I really appreciate what you've done we have

[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:06.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:11.080]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:15.400]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned
[2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:20.240]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:25.360]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:21:25.360 --> 2:21:29.360]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:34.560]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:38.240]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:41.760]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:47.000]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:52.680]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:24:10.320 --> 2:24:18.000]  Al Gore, we know about you. We know this global warming thing is a host. You want
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:26.840]  a carbon credit? Carbon taxes? That's a tax on life, sir. Respond, you coward.
[2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, none of this would be happening now if just a few people
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:38.920]  hadn't started standing up. And I can tell you, we are responsible. Myself,
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:43.280]  Luke Radowski, and all these other men and women. You can start your own group.
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:47.080]  Whether it's we are change, I think more the better. Create a we are change, create
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:50.840]  another group. I push my audience, my listeners to join to get involved. There's
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:55.040]  no forms, no organization. It's just a name. People that want truth that want to
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:25:00.040]  defeat the New World Order. And it's impossible for the globalist to infiltrate
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:04.360]  groups like we are change because there's nothing to infiltrate. There's Luke's
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:09.880]  website that has links to all the other groups. It's impossible to stop. They've
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:14.320]  tried to infiltrate chapters and we've confirmed that and tried to get people to
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:18.080]  do illegal stuff. It hasn't worked. They've tried to falsely charge. We are
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:22.760]  change women and men running out of dark doorways at events with a person in a
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:26.520]  wheelchair ramming it into someone and then putting it in the newspaper that we
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:29.880]  are change assaulted a girl in a wheelchair. And later it came out. The
[2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:33.800]  New York Post had a printer attraction and say it was all a hoax because they
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:39.920]  went to court and proved it was a fraud. I mean, do you see what we're going
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:43.160]  through? What these great people are going through and they've gone in through
[2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:47.720]  and beyond the tyranny and Al Gore has now canceled his major events. I was
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:50.480]  telling you last hour, he's going to start canceling events. He's now
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:55.000]  canceling. He'll only be able to do TV now because it's the only place it'll be
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:02.480]  one sided. He's under siege with his fraud. Let's go to Matt from we are change
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:06.320]  Nashville. We've got some video of their confronting Gore and when they did it,
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:10.640]  it was all over the newspapers, all over radio, all over TV, their quotes about
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:15.360]  his fraud about his lies about how he's making money off of it. Again, taking
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:20.680]  over the media coverage as our right as Americans going to these events and
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:21.880]  telling the truth.
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:28.600]  And we've got Savannah, who's with we are change as well with with Matt. Great
[2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:32.960]  job, guys. Good to have you here with us. Yes, sir. Thank you for having us. Thank
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:36.960]  you. What is it like for you to be involved in this and see it bearing such
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:37.880]  incredible fruit?
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:42.960]  It's really inspiring. I mean, we set up that day. We didn't know what was going
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:47.360]  to happen, but we knew that we had to be there. We had to do something. So it
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:51.600]  worked out pretty good. We had we before it started before Al Gore came out, we
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:55.920]  were passing out articles to people in line just trying to talk to people. You
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:26:58.080]  know, most of them didn't want to hear it. Most of them didn't want the
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:02.000]  articles, but it doesn't matter. You know, we got to stand up.
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:07.160]  Well, it ended up getting a lot of media coverage and I want to play just a
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:12.120]  short clip, which is just a just a little bird's eye view audio for radio
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:15.720]  listeners video for prison planet on TV viewers. Of course, we post all these
[2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:18.280]  videos up at info wars.com. Here it is.
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.960]  I'll go your trader. Your carbon tax is meant to enslave America. We know it.
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:27.320]  We don't want your global government. You don't want your carbon tax.
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:29.480]  You're a trader.
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:36.960]  Yeah, so Alex, I also, um, I also went up to Gore. Um, I bought a book myself
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:41.840]  and asked him, um, what his, what, when he talked about global governance in the
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:46.600]  speech on July 7th, I asked him what he meant by that term. And, um, one of his
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:49.440]  PR ladies just grabbed me and pushed me out of the way.
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:52.320]  They're not allowed to ask or allowed to talk to him as long as it's
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:55.840]  worshiping him, but you can't ask about an internationally televised speech he
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:01.480]  gave because global government doesn't exist. Yes. I mean, even if I bought, I
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:06.520]  paid $30 for a book, so I could ask him this question and, um, I can't even, um,
[2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:14.360]  it's ridiculous. Well, I want to point out that the protest outside made it in
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:18.600]  the paper and on TV and the clips we're showing are just a tiny snapshot of,
[2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:21.400]  of, of all the things that are happening at these events.
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:29.320]  Well, luckily, there's a reporter there. And when I was in the back talking to a,
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:33.160]  a small group of people, I mean, I guess they made enough noise where she came
[2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:36.520]  over and was kind of listening to what we were saying. Uh, she identified herself
[2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:40.480]  as a reporter and I gave her a copy of all republics that, you know, if she
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:44.200]  could watch that'd be great. And that's actually how we got in the paper was
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:48.240]  that the reporter that was listening to us talk, you know, before Al Gore was
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:53.160]  even there. Um, and then obviously she covered the point when I called him a
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:56.520]  trader and that was one of the main things she put in the paper about it.
[2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:03.400]  So we are change Nashville.com and it's not just Al Gore go after any globalist,
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:08.480]  gun grabbers, child grabbers, forced inoculators, people that are promoting
[2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:13.160]  the end of our sovereignty, uh, you know, expand the group, continue to go out,
[2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:17.880]  continue to get involved, continue to have your voice be heard, showing that we
[2:29:17.880 --> 2:29:20.800]  are the majority. We are the American people and we're not backing down.
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:23.320]  Savannah and, uh, Matt, anything else?
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:27.560]  Oh, yeah, sir, we got a process this weekend, Saturday at two 30, um,
[2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:30.720]  Belchor Theater, Nashville. We're going to do, we're doing that process in
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:32.000]  March for a comic tape.
[2:29:33.960 --> 2:29:37.480]  Good. Definitely encourage, encourage all those other we are change groups to
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:40.440]  definitely get out there and do something, especially with Copenhagen
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:42.200]  coming up this week, just go out there and
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:43.840]  drive it.
[2:29:43.840 --> 2:29:48.320]  And he's got another film coming out. We'll all demonstrate outside those
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:49.440]  theaters. We'll be right back.
[2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:57.720]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[2:29:57.720 --> 2:29:58.240]  network.
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:03.920]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola blue atmospheric
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:07.160]  water generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in

[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:03.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:07.920]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[2:31:07.920 --> 2:31:12.120]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[2:31:12.120 --> 2:31:16.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total
[2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:20.000]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:24.280]  coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:28.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:32.720]  problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every
[2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:36.440]  year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number
[2:31:36.440 --> 2:31:40.640]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:31:40.640 --> 2:31:43.600]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:46.880]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:12.560]  I'm going to break down the economy, the fellow reserve in deep trouble being
[2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:17.400]  exposed and routed. I'm going to blitz through the latest next hour on
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:20.440]  Climate Gate. So many new developments on that front. This is blowing up even
[2:33:20.440 --> 2:33:24.680]  bigger than I thought it would. This is just such good news. I've been walking
[2:33:24.680 --> 2:33:28.800]  on air the last few days because this shows these people are not invincible.
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:33.440]  I have always known that, but other people are now discovering this and
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:37.440]  finding it out for themselves. And now that Climate Gate is out, so many people
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:39.960]  that trusted the government and the scientists in the media that didn't know
[2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:43.520]  the scientists were on the U.N. payroll are now ready to hear the truth. And
[2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:48.920]  that's why my film, Fall of the Republic, is so important because a whole hour of
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:53.840]  this two-hour 24-minute film is about how the banks engineered the crisis, how
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:33:58.280]  they created the climate scam, how you will pay your taxes directly to them,
[2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:04.320]  how it's a eugenics system. Fall of the Republic. People are ready to see this
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:11.120]  film. Get it at infowars.com. And while supplies last, if you order, you get it.
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:13.360]  Just that we're going to have to pull it down soon because we're running out of
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:20.160]  them. You get a free Obama Joker t-shirt, or you can choose a free Don't Tread on
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:25.080]  Me shirt in a different varieties and designs for a limited time at infowars.com
[2:34:25.080 --> 2:34:28.080]  or when you call the toll free numbers, say you want the Fall of the Republic free
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:33.000]  t-shirt deal and tell them whether you want an Obama shirt or a Don't Tread on

[2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:46.600]  the film and the free t-shirt makes what we're doing here possible. So I want to
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:49.440]  thank all of you out there that have been supporting us so we can then support
[2:34:49.440 --> 2:34:53.200]  all these other activist groups and give them a platform to fight the globalist.
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:56.840]  I mean, this is really happening, ladies and gentlemen. We're part of something
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:00.880]  very big. The momentum is beginning to shift in our direction, in the side of
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:05.200]  liberty and freedom and honor and duty and everything that is valuable and good.
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:09.800]  We are exposing these criminals for what they are. Illegitimate criminals,
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:15.760]  murderous control freaks, a strong language, but that's not strong enough.
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:21.520]  Truth is stranger than fiction and we're facing some very wicked people. Now we've
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:25.600]  got We Are Changed Toronto, We Are Changed Florida and saving the most
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:32.880]  powerful for last. I mean, they made the big sudden death overtime score at the
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:37.280]  Super Bowl here, a political action. Saeed and Steve from We Are Changed
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:41.920]  Chicago coming up with the powerhouse video clip we played earlier in the
[2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:49.480]  week that hundreds of thousands of views online just devastating to the
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:53.720]  globalist. Absolutely devastating and we salute, we salute them in their work.
[2:35:53.720 --> 2:35:58.480]  And again, Al Gore is not just being confronted about lying about the hockey
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:02.040]  stick graph that they've now proven as a fraud. They've had to withdraw or lying
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:04.680]  and saying polar bears can't swim and they're all basically dead when their
[2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:08.240]  numbers have exploded or saying the Arctic's gonna totally melt and then it
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:12.680]  doesn't, showing a time lapse of the summer when the Arctic and Antarctic
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:17.240]  get smaller, but not showing you in the winter how they get bigger again. The
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:25.680]  ice caps go like this. The ice caps go like this. And of course, well, I mean,
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:30.720]  the point is, is that now we have their internal emails and Al Gore is
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:34.280]  canceling his Copenhagen propaganda because he can't go speak now. He knows
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:37.200]  there's gonna be Lord Monkton is gonna be reporting here live for us and
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:41.160]  others and thousands of activists exposing him. He can't allow it. If he
[2:36:41.160 --> 2:36:44.760]  goes, it will make it a spectacle and then the truth will come out. But
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:52.160]  instead, he won't be there now, will be there, exposing them. You see? So it's
[2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:55.560]  just so incredible to see this happening and now we're not just talking
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:58.640]  about all the climate fraud. People are going, well, what did Al Gore write?
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:03.960]  Well, what did John P. Holdren write in Ecoscience? What are they saying in all
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:09.240]  these textbooks? They're saying we need an in fake environmental crises to get
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:13.080]  people to give up their rights for a scientific dictatorship so we can set
[2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:18.400]  up world government to forcibly reduce population numbers. I mean, this is in
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:22.720]  hundreds of government documents that we quote that we link that we cover up on
[2:37:22.720 --> 2:37:25.600]  the websites that we cover every day. We give you their quotes. We give you
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:29.560]  their books. We give you where they said it, how they did it. I know it's hard
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:34.920]  to believe they brag in this book, how they're drugging your water supply, but
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:39.520]  they're doing it. I mean, you cannot make this up. There's a reason people are
[2:37:39.520 --> 2:37:46.480]  so docile and servile. Okay, Dan from We Are Changed Toronto. Now this ended up
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:50.520]  getting in the news as well, even when they didn't get in to see Al Gore. That
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:53.880]  doesn't matter. They took over the media attention and inserted real issues. But
[2:37:53.880 --> 2:37:58.000]  first they tell them you can't be in front of the event. Then you got to be
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:01.160]  down the street. Then you got to be across the street. Then they rough them up.
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:07.160]  This is the type of oppression we're seeing all over the Western world. So
[2:38:07.160 --> 2:38:12.120]  let's go ahead. I mean, take Copenhagen. They're not allowing any media in who
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:15.640]  have ever been critical of manmade climate change. Only people that agree
[2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:18.480]  are allowed into all these events coming up this weekend and next week.
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:25.240]  Okay, let's go to Dan from We Are Changed Toronto. Dan, good to have you on
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:25.720]  with us.
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:32.720]  Thanks for having me on. Tell us briefly what happened to you. Great, great,
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:39.440]  beautiful website for torontochanged.com. Absolutely awesome. Tell us what
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:45.360]  happened to you. Sure, yeah. I'm actually also a member of an organization called
[2:38:45.360 --> 2:38:50.680]  Press for Truth. And it is a journalism company. I actually registered it with the
[2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:55.160]  Ontario government as a legitimate alternative media outlet. Yeah, I've
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:56.760]  seen your work. Excellent.
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:02.680]  Thank you. So we were there literally just, you know, as press to cover the
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:08.480]  latest information on the climate change. We were there for no more than 45
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:13.760]  minutes doing our reporting when the security guards came up and told us to
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:17.840]  leave the grounds. And I said, you know, that's fine. If this is your private
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:22.000]  property, I understand that I will leave. So I went to the other side of the
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  gate and, uh, you know, I just started rolling and the two security guards came
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:30.560]  up to me and said, uh, you're going to have to leave. They actually tried to
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:34.880]  make me walk into the road. Uh, there was traffic in the road. So they tried to
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:38.120]  push you into the road. And of course the news would have just said a terrorist
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:42.800]  was run over or a terrorist jumped into traffic today and was killed. That's
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:46.920]  right. And as I was trying to get clarification for where indeed is this
[2:39:46.920 --> 2:39:52.240]  property line, uh, my, my cameraman turned around to take a look and that's
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:56.440]  when the security guard just lunged for the camera. Uh, he grabbed it and he
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:40:00.720]  physically turned over the camera and started pressing buttons until he
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:06.400]  figured out how to shut it off. Just not totally nuts. It can completely
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:11.400]  uncalled for. So at that point, I turned it back on because I just witnessed an
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:15.760]  assault on my cameraman. So I turned it back on for my protection and for, you
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:20.320]  know, Mark's protection. And we continued to document everything that was going
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:24.800]  on. Uh, and then he actually told us that no, we still own this. You're still on
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:30.000]  our property. You have to move further away. Um, but the good thing is I, I
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.800]  managed to remain calm. I didn't think to his level. I kept my cool and because
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:41.800]  of that, we were actually able to get a retribution for the incident. Um, the
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:46.880]  head of security actually called me and apologized to me. And he said that the
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:51.320]  CEO of the Canadian national exhibition is going to be writing me an apology
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:55.240]  letter and they assured me that the security guarding question is going to
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:41:00.200]  be disciplined, the proper manner. And they also said they want to thank me for
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:04.040]  bringing this to their attention because now they are going to talk to the rest
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:07.640]  of their staff and make sure that that kind of, you know, that's a smart,
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:11.760]  that's a smart company because you could clearly file criminal charges on them
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:15.960]  and clearly sue them because trying to push you into traffic is well,
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:21.440]  obviously dangerous. That's right. And with, with the letter of apology, you
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:27.280]  know, that is an omission of guilt. They know they were in the wrong. Um, but it
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:31.120]  just goes to show it. If you remain calm and you handle it and follow up in a
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:35.880]  professional way, uh, then, you know, the good guys can and will win in the end.
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:40.360]  And by the way, I found security guards are even worse than police everywhere
[2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:43.560]  in the country. They'll, I mean, I'll be at a park or on a sidewalk and they'll
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:46.360]  just march over and say, turn your cameras off. You have to have a permit to
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:50.000]  even be in the city. And I'm like, no. And, you know, there's a famous video,
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:55.400]  Kansas city this year of Aaron and Rob at a city park and the federal reserve
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:41:59.600]  security comes a half mile, puts their hands on their guns and says, we're
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.680]  going to arrest you if you don't leave. And of course, totally off their
[2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:07.680]  jurisdiction, totally out of control. These are lunatics on a power trip. And
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:11.760]  it turned out they were ordered by the federal reserve to go out and do this.
[2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:15.920]  These people think they're gods and we're living in Nazi Germany. We're not.
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:19.080]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of part of the incident. Here it is.
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:24.280]  What's the scoop? Guess what's going on? Client doesn't want you guys hanging
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:29.160]  around here. Okay. Right now. And this is a private event. Okay. Um, cameras
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:31.800]  aren't even allowed on the grounds. It's a bylaw against execution place
[2:42:31.800 --> 2:42:36.400]  property. Oh, you've been with handing out flyers to people. It's a part of
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.080]  our bylaw by law offenses. So right now, all this is owned by the senior. I'm
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:45.760]  guessing the whole grounds from the Francis Gates, Dufford, okay, down to
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:48.640]  make sure. So we ask you guys, if you want to do it, pause,
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:53.320]  what's happening more and more is they have huge city centers for people
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:56.840]  that aren't watching the video, but are listening on the radio. You can go to
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:02.000]  toronto change.org and dot com and watch the whole video. They do this in
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:05.320]  Austin. Now they do this in Dallas. They do this everywhere. They just block
[2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:11.320]  off whole areas and now say whole areas of cities are expedition centers and
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:14.800]  say, you can't be on sidewalks. There's a major road with 18 wheelers driving
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:19.160]  by and they just say, you can't be here now. You've got to get out of here
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:22.960]  and because of their bylaws, what have they said their bylaws were that they
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:26.760]  could chop your head off and drink your blood? What have they said their bylaws
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:31.640]  were that they could rob you? You know, I mean, no, they're not your God. Let's
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:37.720]  finish the video on the other side of the ground. So okay, no flaring, no
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:42.880]  posturing and no filming anywhere on the ground. Yes. Okay. Thanks.
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:49.520]  He submitted to their power trip right there by the highway. You just saw. So
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:53.960]  now the power tripping intensifies because to a petty thug, someone
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:57.760]  submitting to their tyranny is a sign that it's okay. Let's keep playing.
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:01.240]  Guys, if you don't mind just completely getting off the property.
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:07.680]  They told us that the property that you guys own, right here. Okay. And it's the public property.
[2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:12.640]  That's not true. You have to get right onto the road. So where is... Just right on the road in the
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:15.760]  bike lane there. Well, we obviously can't stand on the road. Okay, across the street.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:20.760]  So that's public property, property on the sidewalk. Or in the middle there, that would be the best bet if you want to sit on it.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:24.760]  In the middle. But this is silver. This is a notebook. You can just turn that on. Okay.
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:30.760]  I was putting it away. I was putting it away.
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:34.760]  Would you like to get the police down here? Listen, you just told us to come to this side of the gate.
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:39.760]  I told you, sir. Straight out. This is not straight out. I thought you said this side of the gate.
[2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:47.760]  We have him on video saying, go outside the gates. But now, again, you can hear him.
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:53.760]  I told you, I'm powerful. I'm nobody. I live in a cruddy apartment. You know, I'm nobody.
[2:44:53.760 --> 2:44:57.760]  But at least I can dominate you. At least I've got power over you. God, I love big government.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:03.760]  I wish I could take everything you've got. Pretty soon we will. Let's go back. I'm assaulting you right now.
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:08.760]  I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I own you. You're my property. Let's play the rest of it.
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:13.760]  Look at my finger. See, all the way up there. Okay, now I know. Turn your camera off.
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:22.760]  Turn your camera off. Let me see. All the way out over there.
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.760]  You're not allowed here. All the way down over the bathroom. Bathroom. Bathroom.
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  No, no, no. This is public property. We can be here on the sidewalk.
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:32.760]  You want to go up there by the light? You're more than welcome to.
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:36.760]  By the light. Right there is public private property, isn't it? Excuse me.
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:39.760]  I have a question. Is that public property? We're going to turn it off here.
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:41.760]  This is still Exhibition Place property.
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:45.760]  We're going to turn it off here because there is some little bit of profanity that comes up.
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:49.760]  Gentlemen, great job, though, exposing these people. Because if we're not out there doing this,
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:52.760]  they're going to completely train everybody that we have no rights.
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:55.760]  I commend you. We'll talk to you again soon, Dan. Thank you.
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:00.760]  Thank you very much. It definitely feels great to be fighting the good fight.
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:03.760]  And people can check that out at Press4Truth.ca as well.
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:05.760]  All right, buddy. Thank you so much. Great job.
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:06.760]  Thank you.
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:09.760]  Okay, we got a hurry here because we got We Are Change Florida.
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:12.760]  There's so many other people confronting, but I want to get to the big granddaddy of them all.
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:17.760]  A little bit into the next hour now. We're running behind here with Seed and Steve
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:20.760]  from What We Are Change Chicago, also working with We Are Change Ohio.
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:26.760]  And there's so many other groups. We Are Change LA. We Are Change Colorado confronted Gore.
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:29.760]  We just salute them. This is only one thing they're doing.
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:34.760]  Let's go to Eam from Florida.
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:37.760]  And this is the first, let's play the clips now.
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:42.760]  First clip is a huge crowd booing Al Gore in one of the speaking engagements in Boca Raton.
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:44.760]  This made national news.
[2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:50.760]  This made national news everywhere. This was in the newspapers, national TV, local TV,
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:54.760]  and their posters, their signs, their statements about how he's making money,
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:46:57.760]  how he's been proven to be a fraud, how they're more polar bears.
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:02.760]  Ended up on TV, radio, and print hundreds of thousands of dollars of news coverage for free
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:06.760]  because these people came out and outnumbered the people inside.
[2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:09.760]  Here's the first clip.
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:18.760]  We're going to start that over. Let's hit pause.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:20.760]  Let's hit pause. We're going to back that up and start that over.
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:22.760]  I want people to be able to see the video.
[2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:26.760]  So when we're ready with that, just tell me.
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:30.760]  Pardon me?
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:35.760]  Sure. All right, let's go to Eam while we mess with the computers here.
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:41.760]  Eam, really, really exciting. What ended up happening?
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:45.760]  Eam from We Are Change, Florida. Are you there?
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:46.760]  I'm here, Alex.
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:48.760]  Okay, good to have you here. Glad we got you up.
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:53.760]  So in a nutshell, what do you think of Gore getting in all this trouble?
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:56.760]  What do you think of the fact he's cancelling his speaking tour in Copenhagen
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  for the Copenhagen event?
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:01.760]  I mean, this fraud is really in trouble.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:05.760]  I think he's beyond flustered, and the timing of us putting on that event,
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:09.760]  that event in an outdoor venue in Florida, was very exciting for me
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:13.760]  the following two weeks after it had just seemed very meant to be
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:16.760]  the timing of creating that kind of opposition momentum
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:21.760]  that's really been stirring throughout the country before, during, and since that event.
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:26.760]  And it's just been a highly exciting past couple weeks to watch all of this unfold
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:30.760]  and him be exposed the way he's been.
[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:33.760]  Well, I agree with you. And again, this got massive coverage.
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:36.760]  We're going to play, that other clip won't load for some reason, the booing, the mass booing.
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:40.760]  We're going to play a clip of Hannity covering this.
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:43.760]  He's denied global government, denied this is a conspiracy all these years.
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:46.760]  Now the elites themselves announced it's world government.
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:48.760]  It is the funding mechanism for world government.
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:52.760]  We have the internal UN documents, but here he is finally talking about it
[2:48:52.760 --> 2:49:05.760]  and playing your video. Here it is.
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:08.760]  And tonight's meltdown comes to us from the Gateway Pundam blog.
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:11.760]  And according to their website, former vice president Al Gore
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:14.760]  wasn't exactly greeted with open arms in Florida last week.
[2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:20.760]  Now the Learjet Liberal was the keynote speaker at a going green event in Boca Raton.
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:25.760]  It turns out that those attending the lecture may have been outnumbered by the protesters outside.
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:30.760]  Now take a look at this video captured by NBC affiliate WPTV.
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:59.760]  Great point. Now you think by now that Al Gore would want to avoid the state of Florida altogether?
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:04.760]  It doesn't exactly have a good track record down there.
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:10.760]  So there you go. We're going to go to break in a moment, but going back to IEM in Florida.
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:16.760]  I mean this got massive coverage on TV, radio and print in Florida.
[2:50:16.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  Oh yeah, it was incredible. And you know, that being Hannity, you know,
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:24.760]  obviously we don't agree with everything that he spews,
[2:50:24.760 --> 2:50:31.760]  but it was great to get on national coverage and then wake up more people to go and discover and study this on their own.
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:37.760]  And the word is in the newspaper that you're chanting outside was drowning out his speech
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:42.760]  to the minions that had paid thousands of dollars to go see him.
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:46.760]  Well I really want to thank all the meetup groups and all the We Are Change and Libertarians
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:51.760]  and conservative party who came out and drowned out his voice like you just said Alex.
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:58.760]  We booed for an hour and 45 minutes straight so loud that I know he's not coming back to South Florida any time soon.
[2:50:58.760 --> 2:51:00.760]  Stay there, stay there.
[2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:05.760]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Cola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[2:51:05.760 --> 2:51:08.760]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:09.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:14.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:20.760]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:25.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:28.760]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:28.760 --> 2:52:35.760]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:35.760 --> 2:52:40.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[2:52:40.760 --> 2:52:42.760]  who do we make the check out to?
[2:52:42.760 --> 2:52:44.760]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:49.760]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:48.760]  When the levee breaks Al Gore will have no place to stay.
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:54.760]  Yeah the oceans aren't rising but the awakening is rising.
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:55:00.760]  The people standing up against his tyranny is rising right now.
[2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:05.760]  And the new world order feels that rising tide of freedom.
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  When the levee breaks Al Gore and his fraud will have no place to stay.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:15.760]  He's going down. He's going down now. He's going down. He's going down now.
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:23.760]  He's going down. Going down. Going down. Down to Chicago.
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:30.760]  Oh how exciting. Okay finishing up with We Are Changed Florida.
[2:55:30.760 --> 2:55:32.760]  We're going to go to the big finale here in a moment.
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:38.760]  Saeed and Steve from We Are Changed Chicago. That song's just for you.
[2:55:38.760 --> 2:55:44.760]  Where the levee breaks in Chicago. Good to be talking to We Are Changed Florida.
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:52.760]  Anything else from the folks in Florida? Any other points that you guys want to add?
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:56.760]  Yeah a couple real quick points and then I'll let you get to Steve in Chicago.
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:01.760]  One of the main points that I really want to point out is for those people out there who
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:05.760]  really want to do the kind of things We Are Changed and other groups are doing
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:08.760]  in these confrontational type of style.
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:14.760]  Don't worry about having an organization ready to go when you find out there's an event.
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:20.760]  I organized this in a matter of six days and we had hundreds of people show up from a number
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:24.760]  of different groups who don't see eye to eye on most issues but we did unite.
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:29.760]  It's really helping to wake up a lot of people who are kind of controlled by the...
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:33.760]  I remember other listeners calling in. I don't know if that was you days before
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:36.760]  and we put a video out telling folks to go out to the event. Does that help?
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:41.760]  Yeah that was me and it helped tremendously and that caught the ball rolling
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:44.760]  and then really it's all about getting online and getting on the message boards
[2:56:44.760 --> 2:56:50.760]  and really using meetups and just getting those emails out to people that are total strangers
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:53.760]  but are aligned on the same vision.
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:59.760]  One other thing, the cops were pretty hardcore at that event so we didn't get to do the kind of
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:04.760]  up in your face confrontation when he was getting in his car at the end.
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  But if people want to search all the videos of the Boca Raton Al Gore protest,
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:14.760]  you're going to see everything that we're discussing here and how big it really was.
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:20.760]  You did an unbelievably good job my friend and take care Ian. We love what you're doing.
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:29.760]  You know what I want to do? I want to cue it right up to Al Gore being chased once he came out.
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  I want to start the video at the end and then before we are changed Chicago and Ohio leave us
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:41.760]  in about 20 minutes, we're coming back to them right now, we're going to play the whole clip
[2:57:41.760 --> 2:57:45.760]  unedited of how they did it. They were inside, they were outside, they were everywhere
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:51.760]  and it made all over the news, all over the newspapers, front page of some of the papers.
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:58.760]  I mean this was devastating to this scam artist and in front of hundreds of his mindless drones
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  paying money to go be indoctrinated by him with his airbrushed fake book cover
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.760]  showing all these hurricanes turning the wrong direction.
[2:58:07.760 --> 2:58:18.760]  I mean this fraud is imploding and I just want to remind listeners here in my stack Al Gore has now cancelled.
[2:58:18.760 --> 2:58:22.760]  I had it here in my stack. Here it is up on prisonplanet.com.
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:28.760]  Gore cancels on Copenhagen Lecture, leaves ticket holders in a lurch,
[2:58:28.760 --> 2:58:32.760]  Holdren grilled over email controversy how he's involved in Climategate,
[2:58:32.760 --> 2:58:36.760]  the White House science are that wants to poison your water supply to sterilize you.
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:39.760]  We're going to talk about it all coming up. Stay with us.
[2:58:42.760 --> 2:58:48.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:48.760 --> 2:58:55.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:58:58.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:58:58.760 --> 2:59:03.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[2:59:03.760 --> 2:59:09.760]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:59:09.760 --> 2:59:14.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:59:14.760 --> 2:59:18.760]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:59:18.760 --> 2:59:25.760]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:59:25.760 --> 2:59:29.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[2:59:29.760 --> 2:59:31.760]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:33.760]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:59:33.760 --> 2:59:38.760]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[2:59:38.760 --> 2:59:44.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[2:59:44.760 --> 3:00:10.760]  Watch it online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[3:00:14.760 --> 3:00:37.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:44.760]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:51.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:55.760]  I've been telling you for months he's going to start cancelling all his public appearances.
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:00:57.760]  It's like all the Congressmen are doing.
[3:00:57.760 --> 3:01:03.760]  We're now publicly isolating them, showing everyone they're criminals, saying these are Madoffs.
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:07.760]  These are Ken Lays. These are criminals.
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:12.760]  And their collapse is beginning. We're going to play the start of that confrontation from inside.
[3:01:12.760 --> 3:01:20.760]  And again, that took over newspaper headlines, front of one of the major Chicago papers, top story, TV, national news.
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:22.760]  And that was a nice crowd of great activists.
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:26.760]  Those are the equivalent of our founding fathers.
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:27.760]  That's how it begins.
[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:32.760]  You know what the Sons of Liberty did for 15 years before the war started?
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:38.760]  They did exactly what you just saw, exactly when the Red Codes were stealing people's property
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:40.760]  and raping people's women and beating people up.
[3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:44.760]  And there was police brutality and the corrupt lords were out of control.
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:47.760]  The founders did that and a lot more for 15 years.
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:51.760]  And they woke the country up and got it ready to defeat the New World Order.
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:53.760]  And that's what we're doing right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:57.760]  We're hoping for a peaceful outcome in this by arresting these crooks.
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:02.760]  I want to go to Steve and Said from We Are Changed Chicago.
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:04.760]  They also work with We Are Changed Ohio.
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:07.760]  I salute you.
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:09.760]  Do we have Anthony from Ohio too?
[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:11.760]  He's coming on later.
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:15.760]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to these guys and we're going to come back after the break and talk more.
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:16.760]  Just incredible job.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:21.760]  I mean, it can't be done better than what you did in Chicago.
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:22.760]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  I really appreciate you covering it.
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:28.760]  We had an organized effort to confront Gore.
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:30.760]  We were all ready and organized.
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:36.760]  We went there early in the morning and got our wristbands and really did a great job.
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:40.760]  I think we really got them on Climate Gate and thank you for covering it.
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:42.760]  I mean, the timing was perfect.
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:48.760]  You really covered it over the weekend and that Tuesday is when we were going to confront them
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:52.760]  because originally we were going to get them on 30,000 scientists and global governance.
[3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:54.760]  But as soon as Climate Gate came out,
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:57.760]  we were like, we have to get them on Climate Gate.
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:03:02.760]  So we all sat down and got a plan together and just did it.
[3:03:02.760 --> 3:03:06.760]  And it was great that the media covered it.
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:08.760]  I mean, I'll explain it to you from the beginning.
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:11.760]  We just marched down to the borders in the morning.
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:14.760]  We got our wristbands and got in okay.
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:16.760]  And then a couple hours later they had the book signing.
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:20.760]  I'm in line with, we went in groups.
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:24.760]  There was me and Sati and a word, he was a member of Weird Change Chicago.
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:28.760]  Steve was, he was a little bit behind and Anthony was in the middle.
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:34.760]  We had Lee filming on the side as you see that angle from the side angle.
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:39.760]  So we, I'm in line now that reporter that you see in the beginning, he's a Fox News reporter.
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:44.760]  And he actually interviewed me before I confronted him about,
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:46.760]  hey, what are you guys doing out here?
[3:03:46.760 --> 3:03:50.760]  If you could say anything to Al Gore, what would you say to him?
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:53.760]  And I said it straight up that I want to ask him about Climate Gate,
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:58.760]  about these letters and documents that have been hacked that represent and show
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:02.760]  that he's been manipulating bad data and manipulating the people.
[3:04:02.760 --> 3:04:04.760]  What's going on about this?
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:08.760]  There's so much coming out to prove that this is a hoax.
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:13.760]  And he kind of like, the reporter kind of like stuttered and kind of just walked off like,
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:17.760]  hey, he was expecting something.
[3:04:17.760 --> 3:04:19.760]  And then he also interviewed Anthony.
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:21.760]  I'll let Anthony explain that.
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:22.760]  We went up to confront him.
[3:04:22.760 --> 3:04:28.760]  I asked him on, if you could talk about Climate Gate, he's seen a clip.
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:33.760]  He responded by saying, I haven't read the emails.
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:37.760]  And I mean, this coward, this globalist, I mean, that's what he really is.
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:39.760]  Well, stay there, stay there.
[3:04:39.760 --> 3:04:44.760]  We got Saed, we've got Steve from Chicago, Anthony coming up,
[3:04:44.760 --> 3:04:46.760]  and we're going to play the video from the start.
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:48.760]  It is dynamic stuff.
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:50.760]  This is how it's done.
[3:04:50.760 --> 3:04:55.760]  And I can only salute everyone who's involved and it's only intensifying.
[3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:59.760]  And now he's canceling his events, which we don't want him to do.
[3:04:59.760 --> 3:05:01.760]  We want to go out and confront him more.
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:04.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:07.760]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[3:05:07.760 --> 3:05:09.760]  how much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:12.760]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[3:05:12.760 --> 3:05:14.760]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:14.760 --> 3:05:16.760]  Food is your only ammunition.
[3:05:16.760 --> 3:05:17.760]  How much do you want?
[3:05:17.760 --> 3:05:18.760]  When do you want it?
[3:05:18.760 --> 3:05:20.760]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:05:20.760 --> 3:05:21.760]  When will you need it?
[3:05:21.760 --> 3:05:23.760]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:25.760]  Will there be any food?
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:26.760]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:26.760 --> 3:05:29.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:05:29.760 --> 3:05:31.760]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:31.760 --> 3:05:35.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:39.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:05:39.760 --> 3:05:40.760]  How much will you need?
[3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:41.760]  We don't know.
[3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:42.760]  How much do you want?
[3:05:42.760 --> 3:05:43.760]  All you can get.
[3:05:43.760 --> 3:05:44.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:47.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:55.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:05:55.760 --> 3:05:59.760]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:05:59.760 --> 3:06:02.760]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[3:06:02.760 --> 3:06:05.760]  Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water
[3:06:05.760 --> 3:06:07.760]  right from the humidity in the air.
[3:06:07.760 --> 3:06:08.760]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:09.760]  It's very real.
[3:06:09.760 --> 3:06:11.760]  I know because I use one every day in my own home
[3:06:11.760 --> 3:06:13.760]  and it's available right now to you.

[3:07:54.760 --> 3:07:59.760]  That's tpr20info.com.
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:29.760]  I like the way they did it.
[3:08:29.760 --> 3:08:34.760]  They tried to be nice at first, talked to the media, got that coverage,
[3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:36.760]  then tried to talk to them and they got thrown out.
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:39.760]  Then they started yelling key simple facts.
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:44.760]  People criticized me like when I have gone and taken over Chris Matthews' TV coverage
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:48.760]  at say the DNC because I kept saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[3:08:48.760 --> 3:08:50.760]  9-11 is an inside job.
[3:08:50.760 --> 3:08:55.760]  If I started quoting the Declaration of Independence,
[3:08:55.760 --> 3:08:59.760]  it wouldn't make it across TV over Chris Matthews' talking.
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:07.760]  But if you say simple slogans, then they start ignoring what the teleprompter readers are saying
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:13.760]  and they hear you rhythmically repeating 9-11 is an inside job, 9-11 is an inside job.
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:23.760]  infowars.com, we are change.org, infowars.com, infowars.com, infowars.com.
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:27.760]  Now people everywhere they go are confronting them.
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:32.760]  Then they physically attack me and cut up my megaphone and it's the extra on the Obama deception.
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:33.760]  People haven't seen it.
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:35.760]  But then other people are going out and doing it.
[3:09:35.760 --> 3:09:41.760]  I remember they were having a fake bio weapon release with the state police to scare the locals in Austin.
[3:09:41.760 --> 3:09:44.760]  I just went down, jumped in front of the live newscast, said it's all fake.
[3:09:44.760 --> 3:09:47.760]  I called the TV station and said we're going to announce it's fake.
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:50.760]  We have proof because I did have the proof from an internal source.
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:55.760]  But that bluffed them as I couldn't give the source up to going on announcing it was fake.
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:09:59.760]  They had a fake nuclear spill we knew was fake in a drill for the army taking over.
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:01.760]  We bluffed them into doing that.
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:06.760]  You prove the fraud they're running by exposing them.
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:08.760]  Now I want to just play the clip from the start.
[3:10:08.760 --> 3:10:11.760]  And it starts with the newscast and gets into the clip.
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:18.760]  We're going to go back to sod and Steve and others and give you their websites to tell you how you can get involved or start your own group.
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:19.760]  I think the more the merrier.
[3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:20.760]  Join this group.
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:21.760]  Start another group.
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:26.760]  We're lone wolf in that we love the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution.
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:28.760]  But we're thousands of groups.
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:31.760]  That's why people asked me to form my own groups or lead groups.
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:32.760]  Uh-uh.
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:33.760]  New.
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:36.760]  See, that's a centralized system.
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:40.760]  Our idea is centralized of freedom and truth and justice.
[3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:42.760]  And it cuts across party lines.
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:43.760]  We expose phony wars.
[3:10:43.760 --> 3:10:44.760]  We expose 9-11.
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:46.760]  We expose the global warming fraud.
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:48.760]  We expose the heart of it, the eugenics system.
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:50.760]  But let's play this clip.
[3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:53.760]  This is how it's done.
[3:10:53.760 --> 3:10:54.760]  And it took courage.
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:10:57.760]  But once you've done it once, you're not afraid to do it anymore.
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:10:58.760]  So take the plunge.
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:00.760]  Join the rebellion peacefully.
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:01.760]  Take over their events.
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:02.760]  Here it is.
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:06.760]  You've got your data-signed copies of his new book, Our Choice.
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:09.760]  There was a long line of supporters at the boarders' books store on State Street.
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:14.760]  Our Choice is a follow-up to Gore's Academy Award-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:18.760]  Gore has championed environmental issues for many years.
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:23.760]  His book is described as a call to action and answers many of the questions posed by the film.
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:28.760]  Gore was a co-recipient for the Belpiece Prize in 2007 for his work in climate change.
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:32.760]  They're in the book store.
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:34.760]  Sliver walks by.
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:44.760]  Sir, can you comment on the emails and documents that were revealed in our hack time?
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:45.760]  Climate change?
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:46.760]  Climate change?
[3:11:46.760 --> 3:11:47.760]  Respect that.
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:49.760]  The research is a fraud and it's a fraud.
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:50.760]  Can you give a comment?
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:51.760]  Can you give me a comment, sir?
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:52.760]  It's a fraud.
[3:11:52.760 --> 3:11:53.760]  No, come on.
[3:11:53.760 --> 3:11:54.760]  Say no, Gore.
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:55.760]  Genics operation.
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:11:57.760]  No touch, Mrs. Eugenics operation.
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:11:58.760]  Don't touch that.
[3:11:58.760 --> 3:11:59.760]  Another rap.
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:00.760]  One more time.
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:01.760]  I'm trying to zoo out the door.
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:02.760]  Look it up.
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:03.760]  This is a eugenics program.
[3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:04.760]  This is New World Order.
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:05.760]  It has lying to all of us.
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:06.760]  It has lying to us before.
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:07.760]  Wake up, people.
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:08.760]  Wake up.
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:09.760]  Wake up.
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:10.760]  Wake up.
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:11.760]  This is the New World Order.
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:12.760]  Can I give you that mister?
[3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:17.760]  The science that shows the 31 thousand scientists are speaking out against your deugenics probe
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:18.760]  agenda, sir?
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:19.760]  Thank you.
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:23.760]  The New World Order will fail and we realize that this is again star suffrage.
[3:12:23.760 --> 3:12:24.760]  I have a first amendment right.
[3:12:24.760 --> 3:12:26.760]  You do not need to assault the circa.
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:27.760]  I am leaving.
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:28.760]  I am leaving.
[3:12:28.760 --> 3:12:29.760]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:30.760]  I have a First Amendment right.
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:34.760]  This man wants to create a centralized global government.
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:36.760]  31,000 scientists.
[3:12:36.760 --> 3:12:39.760]  That man is, this is Nazi fascism.
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:41.760]  Who are you?
[3:12:41.760 --> 3:12:43.760]  Any comments on Climate Gate?
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:45.760]  The emails that prove it's a scam?
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:46.760]  It's a farce?
[3:12:46.760 --> 3:12:47.760]  Global warming?
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:48.760]  It's a joke?
[3:12:48.760 --> 3:12:49.760]  Any comment?
[3:12:49.760 --> 3:12:50.760]  Comment on Climate Gate?
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:51.760]  Climate Gate?
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:52.760]  First Amendment right here.
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:53.760]  Climate Gate!
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:54.760]  Climate Gate!
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:12:55.760]  Research!
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:12:56.760]  First Climate Gate.
[3:12:56.760 --> 3:12:57.760]  This guy is a fraud.
[3:12:57.760 --> 3:12:58.760]  It's a scam.
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:03.760]  They are trying to institute a global government through a carbon tax.
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:05.760]  This guy is working on a carbon tax.
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:07.760]  That's all it is.
[3:13:07.760 --> 3:13:08.760]  It's global government.
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:11.760]  There are 30,000 scientists trying to sue this guy.
[3:13:11.760 --> 3:13:14.760]  John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel.
[3:13:14.760 --> 3:13:16.760]  It sues his bum.
[3:13:16.760 --> 3:13:18.760]  You are in line for this bum.
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:20.760]  It's a global government.
[3:13:20.760 --> 3:13:21.760]  Get your hands off me.
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:22.760]  First Amendment rights.
[3:13:22.760 --> 3:13:24.760]  Get your hands off me.
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:28.760]  They're talking about carbon polluters.
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:29.760]  You talked about them.
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:35.760]  It's my understanding that back in 1997 when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:40.760]  Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about developing this type
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:43.760]  of policy, this trading scheme.
[3:13:43.760 --> 3:13:44.760]  Is that accurate?
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:45.760]  Is it inaccurate?
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:46.760]  It's been reported.
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:48.760]  I don't know.
[3:13:48.760 --> 3:13:53.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:57.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, and it goes on from there with them confronting him outside
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:13:59.280]  But the point is they split up
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:06.440]  So that as each one got thrown out another one then activates and it panics them one they can handle two
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:13.440]  They don't like three. They go crazy for they start freaking five. They go nuts six Al Gore cancels everything
[3:14:14.640 --> 3:14:20.400]  Which really is what they have to do because if he keeps going out all the headlines are about how he's a fraud
[3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:22.640]  How he's making money how its eugenics?
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:27.920]  And so he's cancelling these events and at first he took them off his website now
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:33.500]  He's cancelling them because he knows if he goes out we take his media attention away from him. He'll now watch
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:40.360]  Start phasing out his events as he's doing. I told you he would do this because I understand this warfare system that they've been using against it
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:43.560]  Against us. We're now countering them with our own system
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:49.260]  Which I literally just stumbled on myself through trial and error trying to go to press conferences and ask real questions
[3:14:49.260 --> 3:14:53.300]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is the true activism
[3:14:53.300 --> 3:14:58.740]  This is a million times more effective than mass protests where the cops come and have a provocateur throw a bottle at them
[3:14:58.740 --> 3:15:02.020]  So the cops then attack everybody and I'm not saying don't have protests
[3:15:02.020 --> 3:15:07.220]  But this is the way that they can't stop you, but it's not just Al Gore going back to
[3:15:07.980 --> 3:15:09.980]  Sod going back to Steve
[3:15:10.500 --> 3:15:17.340]  You guys again, everybody there give us the we are change Chicago website. Who else are you going to be out confronting?
[3:15:17.340 --> 3:15:21.420]  What other street actions are you doing finish up talking about the incredible job you did?
[3:15:22.020 --> 3:15:26.300]  Well, everybody out there just please join us by going to we are change Chicago calm
[3:15:26.300 --> 3:15:28.700]  And you will see a section where you can join us
[3:15:28.740 --> 3:15:34.700]  We have a weekly street action that we do every Sunday usually at the Art Institute or the Balmont Clark neighborhood
[3:15:34.740 --> 3:15:41.420]  Because we're trying to extend all around the city and I have a weekly thing where everybody can come out and be active once a week and
[3:15:41.740 --> 3:15:44.020]  As for confrontations we're planning
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:50.180]  It's not what we have come up for confrontation. Yeah, you want a ambassador that you want the United Nations coming up
[3:15:50.180 --> 3:15:54.140]  So anybody in Chicago, please get a hold of a we are change Chicago
[3:15:54.140 --> 3:15:59.020]  Go to the website join up and join us in these conversations because it's strength and numbers if we take
[3:15:59.580 --> 3:16:06.100]  50 people out to these books book signings and we'll look you can totally just ask him as many questions as we want and until he
[3:16:06.100 --> 3:16:08.100]  He can't even take it over to walk away
[3:16:08.100 --> 3:16:12.540]  Now we know we know I mean just real quick because I'm gonna we're gonna just keep going
[3:16:12.540 --> 3:16:15.180]  We got Luke Radowski on as well and Anthony and others coming up
[3:16:15.780 --> 3:16:22.020]  We know that he's canceling most his events. Have we been able to find out where this criminals gonna be next?
[3:16:22.500 --> 3:16:25.580]  Well, we know that he's gonna be in Chicago again
[3:16:25.580 --> 3:16:29.340]  I believe it is it's March Anthony knows a little bit better about that, but he might be here
[3:16:29.340 --> 3:16:32.220]  I think it's March or May he's gonna be here again in Chicago
[3:16:32.500 --> 3:16:37.100]  But if you just you just got to really go dig in do some research you'll find where he's gonna be
[3:16:37.100 --> 3:16:40.940]  I'll I'll be looking myself if I see anything. I'll shoot it any we are changed
[3:16:41.860 --> 3:16:48.020]  Chapter because they're only doing local coverage to keep us from learning on purpose before they were promoted everywhere
[3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:52.940]  We need listeners who are everywhere in the country. You've heard it announced where he's coming in your area
[3:16:53.580 --> 3:17:01.060]  Tell everybody on your email list get it out so we could start tracking this criminal now again a sod and Steve
[3:17:02.620 --> 3:17:04.620]  Who hasn't had a chance to talk yet?
[3:17:04.620 --> 3:17:06.380]  I'd see
[3:17:06.380 --> 3:17:07.980]  Go ahead Steve
[3:17:07.980 --> 3:17:13.420]  Well, I just want to say it's great that you're covering this you're waking people up and it's infectious just yesterday
[3:17:13.420 --> 3:17:16.860]  We had the Afghan impromptu war process at Federal Plaza
[3:17:17.300 --> 3:17:21.540]  People saw we are change Chicago banner and they were like we thought I didn't for words
[3:17:21.540 --> 3:17:27.420]  We saw it. We didn't know we had a chapter and now we know so everybody out there to stop waiting for
[3:17:27.740 --> 3:17:31.280]  Orders to get active just go find it find a group start your own
[3:17:31.280 --> 3:17:36.840]  Because me and solder just you guys that met because we had the same belief system. We knew we could do this
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:42.480]  We knew we could take it over. We got the press covers. We got the attention Fox News called us
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:44.800]  They wanted to have us on to cover this thing
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:51.200]  So we understand that we can take this over and I think the media there are people out there waking up in the media because
[3:17:51.200 --> 3:17:53.880]  When WBBM reported on the Al Gore event
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:18:00.880]  They said in their own broadcast that everybody in line with the book was allowed time with Al Gore except the media
[3:18:01.240 --> 3:18:05.600]  So I think one of the big reasons we were able to get them on our side and actually cover us
[3:18:05.600 --> 3:18:09.520]  Well, I think they were just as angry as well for being shunned from Al Gore
[3:18:09.520 --> 3:18:16.000]  And that's why everyone should be really upset is there's a no exactly look look look the average media person the average cop
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:20.560]  The average bureaucrat they're just like us. They were told we were all kooks a decade ago
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:25.680]  Now everything we talked about came true. They're all joining us now. This is how
[3:18:26.280 --> 3:18:29.000]  revolutions are won without firing a shot
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:33.400]  I want to make one last point real quick
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:38.640]  Um, as we were like shouting and leaving the media left gore and followed us outside
[3:18:38.960 --> 3:18:41.720]  So like all the media like when we were outside
[3:18:41.720 --> 3:18:44.400]  We were actually taught that we didn't put this in the video
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:48.640]  But we're actually like giving a speech to all the media we there's like cameras
[3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:53.600]  And all the people with the program gore and who are walking out of that that bookstore
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:56.720]  We're sitting there listening to us and asking us. Wow, we didn't know this
[3:18:56.720 --> 3:18:59.960]  We're gonna get more information on how where it's coming. What is it?
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:04.560]  So we're sitting there explaining to like over 50 people how everything and including well
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:09.520]  You need to post that video now as part two so millions can see it but but what's happening is
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:16.240]  Again, they're having to not come out and have their events because they know it's a catalyst for the truth tellers to go out and
[3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:19.560]  Counter their lies. They're hoping we just dissipate and go away
[3:19:19.560 --> 3:19:22.680]  But climate gate isn't going away two weeks ago when this came out
[3:19:22.880 --> 3:19:28.240]  We got the equivalent of the Death Star plans in the last couple days the Death Star blew up
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:29.920]  But the Empire is still there
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:37.640]  but literally ladies and gentlemen with the audit the Fed bill going forward talk of blocking the reconformation of Bernanke with
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:44.800]  Climate gate in trouble with all these professors getting in trouble the cap and trade bill failing that was going to pass in
[3:19:44.800 --> 3:19:46.800]  Australia
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:53.920]  The Death Star blew up. I mean, yeah, we just blew up one of their biggest operations. It is in tatters
[3:19:53.920 --> 3:20:00.360]  They're still gonna operate covertly locally. I want to bring you guys up with Luke Radowski and others straight ahead

[3:21:07.360 --> 3:21:12.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:15.880]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:22.080]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots
[3:21:22.080 --> 3:21:27.040]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:32.640]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[3:21:32.640 --> 3:21:38.960]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke
[3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:44.320]  They're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today?
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:47.840]  Seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, DC
[3:21:48.040 --> 3:21:55.960]  We have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars calm
[3:21:55.960 --> 3:22:05.360]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV. Hi, this is Ted Anderson

[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:27.000]  This is this is ladies and gentlemen bottom line
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:29.720]  This is bottom line
[3:24:30.560 --> 3:24:35.840]  Ladies and gentlemen the equivalent of the Death Star. This is their grid their world government
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:42.680]  To train everybody to have our resources cut off to kill the third world and turn us into an absolute third world slum
[3:24:42.680 --> 3:24:45.240]  Ourselves. This is the plan to use economic
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:51.000]  Terony to to make us be so poor. We can't stand up against them governments have always used
[3:24:51.720 --> 3:24:54.120]  Poverty as a tool of control
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  now going back to
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:02.200]  My guest because well, we've got we are change founder Luke Radowski on the line
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:05.800]  I meant to get Luke on somehow that fell through the cracks. I'm glad we're able to get a hold of him
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:09.880]  Luke I want to get Anthony on from Ohio who was involved with Chicago
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:13.400]  Who may have discovered the location of the snakes next event?
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:15.240]  hair gore
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:18.760]  But expanding on this Luke. What is it like to see?
[3:25:19.640 --> 3:25:24.600]  Just the people rising and taking over the media attention and literally running
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:26.920]  Al Gore to ground
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:31.800]  I mean it's incredible seeing the true authority and power we all have in ourselves
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:37.560]  And it's us realizing that power that is really going to take back this country and take back our lives
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:41.880]  Our lives has meanings. We are something in this world and we're going to make something happen
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:46.120]  And I just published an article on russia today just talking about this the new dawn
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:50.360]  Of a new age of muckraking is upon us and we are taking advantage
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:56.680]  We are taking the airways away from these corporations and we are speaking truth to power to everybody
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:00.520]  And the more we keep doing this the more everybody's going to see
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:05.560]  That's the real truth behind everything global warming not 11. Colleague shake mohammed
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:11.640]  We are doing the job of the mainstream media and people are seeing that and we are going to be successful
[3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:15.000]  I'll tell you didn't didn't chicago do a splendid
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:17.880]  Precision job the way they worked gore over
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:22.680]  I loved i love chicago shot out to also colorado who confronted al gore
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  Ripped up his book in the book signing
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:31.400]  But also here in new york city. I have to shout out the dany panzela matt lapasic and hevella maestro here in new york
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:37.160]  They confronted al gore too. I'm going to be working on that video today and just like you know matt lapasic
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:40.840]  Just came up to him and said aren't the ice glaciers melting on other planets as well
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:43.240]  They literally grabbed them
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:46.520]  threw him away and then the same thing that chicago did screamed i mean
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:54.120]  The technique that we have is impetual what we're doing with chicago and colorado and all these wonderful beautiful people are doing
[3:26:54.120 --> 3:27:01.160]  It cannot be stopped. We're doing this non violently peacefully taking over the airways and it's beautiful and it's amazing
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:06.520]  And i'm so proud of seeing so many other people just standing up for themselves and doing the right thing
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:13.560]  Do you agree with my analogy that two weeks ago? We got the death star plans and the last two or three days the death star blew up
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:14.760]  I mean
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:21.000]  Literally their man-made global warming fraud is is is imploding in flames right now
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:26.920]  Yes, we have the information. We have the knowledge, but that knowledge is nothing unless we use it
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:32.520]  That knowledge is power and authority. We now have to use that power and authority to tell the people
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:37.240]  What's really happening to save this country from the cap and trade bill from the kopenhagen treaty?
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:40.200]  We have to understand we have to act and activate right now
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:43.880]  Information and knowledge is nothing unless we act on it
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:49.400]  Absolutely now is the time i had lord mongton on last week will be reporting for us next week
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:54.600]  From kopenhagen and he said we're two minutes to midnight. He said no we're two seconds to midnight
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:27:58.120]  But again, it's the due sex right at that moment
[3:27:59.160 --> 3:28:02.680]  All these good people we don't even know about are coming out of the woodwork to aid us
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:07.000]  And and that's how it works you take the step of faith you stand up for truth
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:09.560]  And you're not going to have victory overnight
[3:28:09.640 --> 3:28:16.760]  But then empires just collapse in front of you and i am seeing the new world order right as it announces itself
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:19.480]  Being blown into pieces and it doesn't mean
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:25.080]  Just because we've blown up the death star ladies and gentlemen the fight continues the empire is still in control
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:29.800]  But this is a major coup against them a major moral booster
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:36.920]  And if we continue to get climate gate out that has tentacles into all the other eugenics frauds point out what monsters these are
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:39.640]  We can defeat them
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:42.520]  I mean it's in our hands. I mean
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:47.960]  We can defeat them we can win as long as we want to win and we could realize we could win
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:28:51.720]  Just by all standing up and you don't have to be a part of we are change or any other
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:57.640]  Even a group out there be an individual. I'm not no leader people always come up to me and say i'm the organist
[3:28:57.640 --> 3:29:00.760]  I'm not i'm just one human being I can inspire people
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:06.120]  But it's really up to an individual to be their own leaders and to stand up in their cities and towns
[3:29:06.360 --> 3:29:12.200]  And that's how we're going to be successful and we slowly are becoming successful because people like sod are coming up in
[3:29:12.200 --> 3:29:14.920]  Chicago people like anthony are coming up in ohio
[3:29:15.240 --> 3:29:20.440]  You know people like jonathan in colorado are coming up people like mad here in new york city are coming up
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:27.080]  And they're doing the job of mainstream media and they're standing up for themselves for their lives for humanity and it's us standing up
[3:29:27.720 --> 3:29:35.160]  That's gonna just deny this copenhagen treaty this climate gate. Yeah, we're standing up saying you're crooks. You're frauds

[3:32:04.600 --> 3:32:09.640]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:14.920]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[3:32:15.240 --> 3:32:20.920]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[3:32:21.160 --> 3:32:24.280]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:32:24.440 --> 3:32:29.720]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[3:32:29.720 --> 3:32:35.720]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[3:32:36.120 --> 3:32:41.720]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know
[3:32:42.040 --> 3:32:45.000]  How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones

[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:03.560]  The big mothership the founding chapter uh in

[3:34:06.280 --> 3:34:12.280]  Is going to have a big demonstration against the Copenhagen fraud. Give us the coordinates of that resistance point

[3:34:19.160 --> 3:34:22.760]  The Copenhagen treaty what can we do to stop it information about it?
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:25.720]  And we're going to be teaching people how to be activist journalists
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:30.680]  How to lobby against the Copenhagen treaty and how to be effective members of this community
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:35.960]  We're also going to have on we are change the organ use tip section if you know where these guys are where they're doing events

[3:34:41.160 --> 3:34:45.800]  We will be there confronting these guys, but we need you to let us know where these guys are
[3:34:45.880 --> 3:34:48.360]  So please let us know it's we are change.org
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:52.280]  And I want to thank everybody so much from the bottom of my heart from taking action
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:55.800]  Every single where and you don't have to be a part of we are changed to do it
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:34:58.920]  It's about being an individual. It's about being a leader and god bless you all
[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:01.480]  All right. Thank you so much. Look great job
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:08.280]  Um going back is briefly and I'm going to say bye to Anthony here introduce him and quickly get a few comments from him
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:12.760]  With Ohio also doing yeoman's work confronting military checkpoints. You name it
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:18.520]  I mean the list just goes on and on the tyranny. We're facing sod and steve from chicago closing comments
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:25.320]  Uh, we just want to say thanks for covering us and thanks for firing people up because if it wasn't for your show
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:29.880]  And your listeners and creating this movement, there'd be nothing for us to keep moving forward
[3:35:30.040 --> 3:35:35.080]  So we're going to keep the ball rolling in chicago and anyone that wants to join up. We are change chicago dot com
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:39.480]  On that for me. Thank you Alex for everything. Thanks for all the info info wars dot com
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:42.840]  We are change chicago dot com. We are change on or those are the websites
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:49.480]  Everybody get active. Let us know if you want to hear in chicago. Come and join us. So we'll we'll fight the fight together
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:55.720]  Absolutely. God bless you. Wow. So exciting and and it's just so wonderful
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:01.400]  To see america standing up and the people of the planet standing up
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:05.800]  Just like lord mocton said a freedom party globally, but it's not a global government
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:11.400]  It's individual sovereign groups in nations standing together against the organized global tyranny
[3:36:11.800 --> 3:36:17.320]  And that's the vacuum that we are change and other organizations tea parties worldwide are forming
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:22.760]  That's why this article from info wars dot net is so important tea party co-founder
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:27.160]  Concept has been hijacked by false left-right paradigm chad peace
[3:36:27.160 --> 3:36:34.840]  Who I want to get on he was the founder of the main tea party movements out of a bunch of different organizations
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:37.640]  And out of ron paul groups and others
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:41.320]  And it's been totally hijacked and he went on fox news and talked about it
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:45.320]  And it's been hijacked by sarah pale and the republican party and glenn beck
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:49.240]  Now again, I don't just sit here and attack people. I know glenn beck's an operative
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:54.200]  I know they're meant to control a real revolution and to stop us from ever getting things back
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:36:59.960]  So we just reinfiltrate their grips go in and say hey, you want the real truth? Here's fall the republic
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:03.560]  You want the real truth? Here's we are change chicago confronting al gore
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:07.880]  You want the real truth go out and protest al gore this weekend with lucradowski?
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:11.480]  This is what we're doing. I salute you gentlemen. Take care
[3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:18.360]  Okay, let's now go to anthony of we are change ohio in closing
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:26.600]  Who have just been doing a sterling job as well not just with gore, but the illegal military checkpoints all the bizarre marshal law stuff going on
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:29.160]  They've been doing so much
[3:37:29.160 --> 3:37:31.800]  Al gore canceling his copenhagen trip and speeches
[3:37:32.520 --> 3:37:34.520]  Now hiding wherever he's going to speak
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:36.840]  They are certainly afraid aren't they?
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:43.400]  I think they're definitely afraid. I mean, um, he's been doing these book signings for a while and every time he goes out
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:49.960]  And does these speeches or these book signings people are confronting him everywhere? And I mean this guy is just on the run
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:52.840]  It's it's amazing to just see all these amazing patriots
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:59.640]  From chapters all over all over the country confronting this guy and getting out real issues and taking over media
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:02.120]  and confronting these guys
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:08.520]  Beautifully said tell us about some of the things we are change ohio has been doing
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:13.880]  I know a lot of groups don't have any video because the police have also confiscated their al gore confrontation video
[3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:20.840]  Yes, uh back in april 1st of this year, uh, all of our great members of
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:28.040]  Sam uh sam rachel josh brad we went and confronted this guy and what happened was uh
[3:38:28.520 --> 3:38:34.440]  Sam was in there filming and after we confronted him we have all the audio sam actually has to go back to court
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:40.440]  This weekend this has been now about eight to seven months. He has to go back and try and get his footage
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:45.720]  So he's in the midst of this court battle. That's sam logo if we are change ohio and he also has
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:49.560]  A court issue going on because he got arrested at the g20
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:53.400]  But um, we confronted al gore and uh his goons basically
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:58.040]  Grabbed sam because he was filming they did not want this confrontation on film
[3:38:58.520 --> 3:39:00.600]  And they tried to make him delete his footage
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:05.080]  He wouldn't and because he wouldn't they arrested him and he was in jail overnight
[3:39:05.880 --> 3:39:10.280]  This was back in on but they didn't stop him because now everybody's confronting him
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:16.200]  But gore understood the power of this. That's why they tried to suppress free speech, but it's not working
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:18.920]  Uh, give us the we are change ohio site, sir
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:25.640]  Yes, we just launched our new we are change ohio.org site. Uh, actually last night
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:32.280]  So it's we are change ohio.org. Uh, we have an email that you can contact us at that's we're change ohio at live
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:34.840]  Dot com and we're doing a lot of amazing stuff
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:39.160]  We're doing showings of your movies the obama deception fall of the republic
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:46.200]  We've confronted so many different people for ezekaria obama joe biden john mccain the clinton's richard and haas colin powell
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:51.240]  madeline albright and so many more and the great thing about ohio is it's a battleground state
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:53.640]  so during the primaries when these
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:56.520]  Criminals come here and try and spew out their propaganda
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:40:02.360]  We take over the media with real issues and we have fox and cnn over the summer
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:07.400]  Uh, about two years ago when i confronted john mccain about his connection with uh, peanut
[3:40:07.560 --> 3:40:12.120]  You know, he freaked out but cnn covered it and millions and millions of people saw that
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:13.880]  and
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:20.360]  They realized that you know, they realized his connection with 9 11 and i had people and this is the key on the back
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:28.200]  And this is the key. We're now teaching everybody else how to go out and confront. We're now showing everyone else
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:32.680]  How vulnerable these enemies are to the truth you shine a light on them
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:38.360]  It's like a vampire being thrown out in sunlight. They turn to ash and blow away great job anthony. We salute you
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:41.560]  Thank you so much. Alex. Thanks for having me on buddy. You bet
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:46.280]  We just had an hour and 40 minutes with different. We are change groups and that only touches the tip of the iceberg
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:51.320]  We are change california la colorada just minnesota
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:54.280]  ireland england
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  The netherlands tokyo
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:02.680]  And remember what i did a few months ago where i asked listeners to post signs with obama as the joker
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:04.280]  When the media said it should be illegal
[3:41:04.280 --> 3:41:09.240]  We said well, we'll just tell everybody to go do it and it was hundreds of tv reports hundreds of newspaper articles
[3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:14.760]  And then finally the media backed off and stopped saying oh arrest everybody because people rebelled against that tyranny
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:20.520]  You have to exercise your will over these people. That's what they've done to us. They've trained us how to be slaves
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:23.080]  We have to teach them that we're not their property
[3:41:23.880 --> 3:41:25.880]  And that's what's starting to happen
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:28.680]  so
[3:41:28.680 --> 3:41:31.400]  Make your own. We are change group or make an info wars group
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:35.800]  Or make a tea party group or whatever call it whatever you want
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:39.000]  Start two three groups just get involved
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:45.480]  It's so simple we can beat these people they're in full retreat
[3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:50.200]  I wanted to briefly bring ted anerson up on some economic news and try to jam in some final phone calls, but ted
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:52.040]  uh
[3:41:52.040 --> 3:41:54.040]  I mean this revolution's in full swing
[3:41:54.760 --> 3:42:01.320]  Professors are standing stepping down members of parliament are stepping down over this the australian government is collapsing over it
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:06.440]  Their whole cap and trade tax system just imploded and failed. That's the financial times of london
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:10.600]  uh algores cancelling speaking engagements and trips in kopenhagen
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:12.440]  uh
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:16.600]  In congressional testimony the white house science r's being grilled over this
[3:42:17.400 --> 3:42:19.720]  I mean this is really blowing up in their face
[3:42:20.360 --> 3:42:26.120]  And it is literally our great activist listeners that are at the vanguard absolute tip of the spear
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:28.680]  Ramming into the heart of this dragon
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:32.040]  Alex there are no better listeners than our listeners
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:38.440]  These are the people that are actually changing the face of the united states of america and the entire world
[3:42:39.080 --> 3:42:42.040]  And I can't tell you I've salute them all. I am so
[3:42:42.680 --> 3:42:50.360]  In depth in deeply, uh, grateful and and i'm just i'm just so proud. I just can't even say enough to
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:58.840]  How wonderful the listeners of your show the genesis communications network this entire movement. I mean it is just
[3:42:58.840 --> 3:43:00.840]  mind
[3:43:01.400 --> 3:43:07.880]  Boggling mind boggling to be sitting at the center of something this big is just
[3:43:09.160 --> 3:43:11.160]  unbelievable
[3:43:11.320 --> 3:43:14.840]  Well, Ted, I mean it just is a sonar ping of our success
[3:43:15.320 --> 3:43:21.000]  I went to a megadeth concert because I was invited to go interview david mustain behind the scenes and do an interview about the new world order
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:22.200]  With him
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:24.360]  And he said no hang around. You know you'll stay
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:28.760]  Because I got up at 5 a.m. That day and drove up there, but I was pretty tired
[3:43:28.760 --> 3:43:34.280]  But I stayed for the concert and walking around out there in the crowd literally every three people I walked past were
[3:43:34.280 --> 3:43:38.200]  Hey, alex jones. They were old. They were young. They were black. They were white
[3:43:38.760 --> 3:43:42.280]  Uh, they were wearing info wars t-shirts, which is again. It's just an indicator
[3:43:42.920 --> 3:43:46.120]  The most of them were homemade and stuff. We certainly don't sell that many
[3:43:46.840 --> 3:43:48.840]  I mean this is
[3:43:48.840 --> 3:43:55.240]  Again just an indicator of just the work we've done and there's so many other people out there taking action
[3:43:55.560 --> 3:43:59.720]  I mean ted the new world order knows that actually a large percentage
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:05.320]  Maybe even a majority of americans are finally waking up or have woken up and the battle is now joined ted
[3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:10.280]  It sure has it sure has and it's been a it it's been an interesting
[3:44:11.160 --> 3:44:15.400]  A feat coming right along with all this whole thing, but I do believe alex
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:21.960]  We're gonna kick their rear ends right out of there the united states of america will return back to its original form
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:30.200]  It's just like that renegades song that you had coming in and uh, thank god for the renegade and and and for their
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:34.920]  Descendants and that's us and now we got to think about our descendants
[3:44:34.920 --> 3:44:41.320]  So we got to be the people standing up and fighting for this nation because if we don't fight by god, they'll take it from us
[3:44:41.320 --> 3:44:43.800]  Well ted I got you up here briefly because
[3:44:44.920 --> 3:44:57.800]  You said two weeks ago. You thought it would go above $1,200 by christmas. It's it's it's already gone to 1,226 today and uh
[3:44:58.920 --> 3:45:02.280]  I mean, it's insane. I wanted to briefly have you up to tell the listeners
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:06.280]  You buy the gold when it's lower you sell it at the low price even when it goes up
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:11.160]  I know that you've basically run out of all the stuff at the 1,050 level. What do you have now?
[3:45:11.160 --> 3:45:14.440]  Is I know it's I mean that that was a deal that's never been topped before
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:18.200]  Well, I haven't asked you. What's the gold and silver offering you have the day?
[3:45:18.440 --> 3:45:25.240]  Well, sadly as it is foreigners are trying to get away from the u.s. Dollar and that's driving it down and that's driving gold up
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:29.880]  Um, right now. I am still carrying british sovereigns at 325
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:35.720]  Pricing wise you're asking me where that comes in. I picked up those at about 1125 an ounce
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:38.360]  The francs are currently at 263
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:40.040]  uh
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:43.800]  Lakota silvers right now are 2451, but I haven't had to move up
[3:45:44.280 --> 3:45:51.800]  The montana silver rounds because I picked up 5 000 of them before gold jumped over 19 or 19 dollars an ounce for silver
[3:45:52.280 --> 3:45:55.000]  Um before silver jumped up over 19 dollars
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:46:02.120]  So they're going to be jumping up as well. The walking liberties took a big jump up to 10 dollars and 69 cents
[3:46:02.520 --> 3:46:07.960]  Um, there are you know, I have other things here. We carry the junk silver. We carry the gold
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:14.680]  Eagles we also, you know, did you know that gold eagles the mint announced that they're not even going to be minting these things anymore?
[3:46:15.080 --> 3:46:21.560]  And at least through the end of this year and they will not give us a date when they're going to start minting them again next year
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:24.920]  And that's true for not only gold eagles, but silver eagles
[3:46:24.920 --> 3:46:28.360]  So what I have in stock maybe all I'll ever get for now
[3:46:28.840 --> 3:46:36.040]  And then you know, we have the maple leaves and just a whole long line of different things that I try to buy when the market's down
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:37.720]  I had just a
[3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:43.400]  About two hours of opportunity to buy while gold and silver was down today and it comes jumping back up again
[3:46:43.640 --> 3:46:47.400]  When we went to bed last night while we were sleeping gold ran over
[3:46:47.400 --> 3:46:53.560]  1220 dollars an ounce and like you said hit 1226
[3:46:54.040 --> 3:46:57.560]  I mean obviously here in new york, they try to push it back down again
[3:46:57.880 --> 3:47:04.440]  But it in the world market. They're just they don't they're ignoring that fact. I mean china's buying gold india
[3:47:04.760 --> 3:47:12.280]  I mean you name it. I mean it's out that they're buying it and and and quite frankly the people of the united states of america should be too
[3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:19.240]  I mean we used to be able to produce our currency by mining it out of the ground and there was no debt associated to it
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:27.240]  I don't know how in the world we allowed a our government to join forces and collude with a private
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:33.800]  Banking system that doesn't even account. You know, it's not accountable to our own politicians that we elect
[3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:41.240]  You know, they're driving the currency down. It's worth less than 10 cents from where once once was when it was first introduced
[3:47:41.240 --> 3:47:47.160]  You know, it just makes absolutely no sense to stay on fiat stay in a fiat paper currency
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:48.600]  And yes, indeed
[3:47:48.600 --> 3:47:52.920]  I am buying when there's depths and I'll try to get you the best price I can on gold
[3:47:53.240 --> 3:47:58.760]  But by now you should have woken up and and and taken a serious look at your portfolio
[3:47:59.240 --> 3:48:03.960]  And in addition to this if you do buy from mitis resources, you're helping this cause
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:06.040]  I don't know how important you think it is
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:13.080]  But you know, I mean, I know Alex you and I and myself too are committed 150 200 percent
[3:48:13.480 --> 3:48:18.280]  We're not stopping and we're not going to quit not even when the chips get tough
[3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:20.520]  We're going to be moving on forward with this
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:26.680]  Absolutely, Ted. Uh, the the brokers are there. I mean, so explain people your gold at what point in the market?
[3:48:26.680 --> 3:48:28.520]  Did you buy this gold?
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:30.680]  What was the market when you bought this gold for that savings?
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:38.520]  This stuff was bought at about 1125 dollars an ounce and right now we're looking at gold over 1226
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:42.680]  I mean, I don't know how I can make this easier for you
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:49.160]  I really want to say you need to get out of paper currency and you need to look at gold
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:54.120]  So this is you bought roughly when the market was a hundred dollars lower than it is now and you're passing on those savings
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:49:01.160]  Yes, that's right. And you're saying it roughly and that's the way to say it because it's fluctuating between 1185
[3:49:02.120 --> 3:49:03.080]  I'm sorry
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:11.000]  1,200 and about 1,215 and 1,225 dollars and so yes indeed. This is a great buy
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:15.400]  Good time to be getting it. I mean just to explain it the gold you're selling now
[3:49:15.800 --> 3:49:17.800]  What was the market then when you bought it?
[3:49:17.800 --> 3:49:25.000]  1125 dollars an ounce now don't confuse it every single coin carries a premium over
[3:49:25.080 --> 3:49:27.960]  What's trading in new york city in the spot market?
[3:49:28.280 --> 3:49:32.600]  That means that i'm buying coins when it was priced when the spot price is at that time
[3:49:33.080 --> 3:49:38.200]  But now i'm still holding the price even though gold has run up over 1200 dollars an ounce
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:43.880]  I haven't changed my prices just go rewind and go back a few days and listen to the archives
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:48.680]  Gold has gone up a tremendous amount and i'm still selling the coins for the same price
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:51.320]  You can do the math i've been doing this for a while alex
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:54.680]  I don't know how many how much how many more opportunities i'm going to get to do this
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:49:58.760]  Because gold is not coming back down and giving me that opportunity to buy it low again
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:04.520]  Yeah, so you've already gone. You've already sold out of the gold that you bought at the 1050 level with it now
[3:50:05.400 --> 3:50:07.400]  1226 today
[3:50:08.600 --> 3:50:11.480]  That was the best deal ever that you were offering last week that sold out
[3:50:11.480 --> 3:50:16.200]  You still have an incredible deal of gold you bought at the 1120
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:20.120]  Uh range with gold now 100 dollars above that
[3:50:20.840 --> 3:50:24.360]  Believe me i shop around for gold and silver buy a coin here some coins there
[3:50:24.840 --> 3:50:28.120]  Believe me i buy from ted because i can't i'm getting the deal you're getting

[3:52:12.280 --> 3:52:14.840]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:21.160]  And have determined its influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:26.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:33.240]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying

[3:54:38.600 --> 3:54:41.000]  Al Gore has canceled his Copenhagen trip
[3:54:42.120 --> 3:54:49.000]  Uh and and leaving the minion ticket holders in the lurch because he doesn't want to be associated with climate gay
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:53.160]  I mean, this is a big deal folks. I don't ever get up on air and start popping champagne
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:58.040]  I mean, this is a big deal because we know it's fraud. We know they've been involved in fraud
[3:54:58.280 --> 3:55:00.600]  They're caught covering up the fraud. This is the head
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.240]  UN climate center that cooks the books
[3:55:03.720 --> 3:55:09.480]  This is a godsend and we need to remember this and keep beating the drum making the story beggar
[3:55:10.280 --> 3:55:12.280]  all the articles paul watson and kirk
[3:55:12.280 --> 3:55:19.240]  Uh nemo and and steve watch and others write and post at info wars.com get them all get them out to everybody continue
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:25.160]  Go to your city council. Go to your public schools. Go to your school board. They're brainwashing your kids three days ago
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:31.720]  We broke and and put out the UN internal documents how they've got local brainwashing in every western country. They are taken over
[3:55:31.720 --> 3:55:33.720]  This is diabolical
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:37.640]  Great job with the crew today by the way really appreciate the fabulous job. They've done
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:42.520]  We're going to go out to the end of the show here with this clip of the uh, eugenicist
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:47.000]  White house science are john p. Holdren exposed for the fraud. He is here it is
[3:55:47.880 --> 3:55:51.800]  Back to the emails that uh ended up being placed in the public record
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:54.760]  And I don't want to get to whether or not
[3:55:55.320 --> 3:56:00.280]  They were legally placed in the public record the question is whether or not they were accurate
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:04.760]  Because if they were accurate it's profoundly disturbing stop right there
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:09.560]  Because what I mean what type of research is sinson brunner doing day one
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:13.240]  Phil jones admitted that was their emails and they were taken and that's what they said
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:19.880]  We've got the computer program written for fraud. So even the republicans and democrats up there acting like they're not sure
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:23.960]  That's the spin. I told you that would be the spin. That is the spin go back to them
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:27.720]  Climate change now
[3:56:27.720 --> 3:56:35.880]  Uh the data from the climate research unit at the ua and england is one of only three major data sets
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:37.960]  But they considerably overlap
[3:56:38.520 --> 3:56:46.200]  And they've been used as a basis for the ipcc report as well as the us global change research program
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:50.280]  And that means that these two booklets that were passed out this morning
[3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:57.320]  You know at best need to have a thorough review in the light of this information that has been disclosed
[3:56:57.800 --> 3:57:04.200]  And at worst it's junk science and it is a part of a massive international scientific fraud
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:13.080]  Dr. Holden you've been in the middle of a lot of this and I've got a couple of questions based upon your statements before you join the
