[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:33.680]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones two buildings collapse after
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.400]  explosion in Harlem at least one dead what we saw people flying out the windows there's shocking
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.240]  video of it we're gonna be showing to TV viewers I'll describe it for radio listeners the videos
[00:45.240 --> 00:50.400]  up on info wars.com still trying to figure out what that is a gas main who knows but they're
[00:50.400 --> 00:59.760]  saying a drone was spotted flying over at CBS news is reporting so we will see what's happening
[00:59.760 --> 01:05.680]  there you know they've had cases in the news where a gas main goes off I think it's another 911 in
[01:05.680 --> 01:11.120]  New York or you've seen where a steam boiler exploded and shot a bunch of hot steam out of
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.880]  some manhole covers they thought that Al Qaeda had attacked I mean who could blame them after
[01:16.880 --> 01:22.360]  the huge mine control event that was the staged inside job that was the September 11th attacks
[01:22.360 --> 01:28.060]  that anyway you slice it has been used to take our liberties so two dead after explosion fire
[01:28.060 --> 01:33.280]  levels buildings in East Harlem at least 17 others injured as hundreds of firefighters battle
[01:33.280 --> 01:39.200]  blaze and then afterwards a drone CBS reports the scene flying over those drones that don't exist
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.040]  when I told you about them 15 years ago already operating domestically five years ago operating
[01:45.040 --> 01:51.520]  domestically the drones spying on farmers the drones spying on small business owners which they
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.880]  now all admit are operating along with the satellites and high altitude blimps flames and
[01:56.880 --> 02:03.000]  smoke were sent billowing into the air after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.880]  Wednesday and we could show those articles just by clicking on them and putting them on screen for
[02:08.880 --> 02:18.180]  folks that are watching killing two people and injuring more than a dozen people continuing
[02:18.180 --> 02:24.840]  here the cause of the blast is still unclear but con Edison said crews are responding in the area
[02:24.840 --> 02:33.520]  to report of gas odor just prior to the explosion and again probably a gas main explosion which
[02:33.520 --> 02:42.520]  last time I checked kill more than 400 people a year in the United States let's pull up that
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.120]  number if somebody can look that up I remember just seeing on the news years ago that it kills
[02:46.120 --> 02:52.400]  more than 400 a year on average great white sharks kill about five a year globally most of them in
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.280]  Australia or off the coast of California but people are afraid to swim in oceans worldwide even
[02:57.280 --> 03:03.720]  where the great whites do not live because of the movie Jaws just like terrorism kills only a few
[03:03.720 --> 03:10.000]  hundred people a year by its classical definition but our whole way of life is being ended because
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.640]  they want to keep us safe from it meanwhile honeybees kill more people than terrorism I just
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.360]  keep harping on that because it's all a hoax the call came in at 9 13 a.m. from a resident who
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.680]  reported smelling gas inside the apartment but the resident indicated the odor may have been
[03:25.680 --> 03:32.040]  coming from outside the building con Edison spokesman Sydney Alvarez said to con Edison crews
[03:32.040 --> 03:41.840]  were dispatched about 9 15 a.m. and arrived just after the explosion occurred so we will continue
[03:41.840 --> 03:48.080]  to track all of that and cover all of that but I'm I'm guessing it's a gas main you know they
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.280]  they diffused a pressure cooker that wasn't a bomb in Boston yesterday had lots of panicking and
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.640]  freaking out Paul Watson as an article about where Homeland Security does swat rates now and
[03:57.640 --> 04:02.640]  locks down whole neighborhoods and points guns at everyone like the police in LA randomly shooting
[04:02.640 --> 04:09.000]  up vehicles full of white women in in cars when they're looking for a black guy in a truck I mean
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.040]  it just shows that government itself is is living in this panic zone and really training
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.000]  everyone to lock everything down like a prisoner lock down in this country Paul Watson is going
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.600]  to be discussing that with us coming up as well in the next segment there's going to be an armed
[04:28.600 --> 04:35.360]  March at South by Southwest starting on Congress at noon today down at Congress in San Jacena

[04:39.040 --> 04:44.720]  there today and finally because we had to reschedule with her once that she had to reschedule target
[04:44.720 --> 04:52.040]  Kathleen Wiley really caught in the crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton somebody's been a victim
[04:52.040 --> 04:57.760]  of the Clintons will be joining us just we look we're looking at Hillary being El Presidente
[04:57.760 --> 05:03.480]  or running for president the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda

[08:12.480 --> 08:31.840]  the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network two buildings have
[08:31.840 --> 08:37.380]  collapsed after an explosion in New York City at least two people are dead we quote saw people
[08:37.380 --> 08:43.200]  flying out the windows witnesses say there is a video of it that if you're a TV viewer I will
[08:43.200 --> 08:51.800]  show you some raw footage of with the explosion and again Con Edison reports that hours before
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.880]  they were getting reports of a strong odor of gas in the area hands down it's going to be a gas
[08:56.880 --> 09:03.320]  explosion but it does bring up images of 9-11 to see what looks like dust it's really just smoke
[09:03.320 --> 09:11.080]  billowing through the apartment blocks in skyscrapers and they are now conjuring images
[09:11.080 --> 09:18.000]  of 9-11 wrangle the congressman says our communities 9-11 and of course a drone was spotted
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.240]  CBS News reports flying over right after it happened so all part of living in the new
[09:23.240 --> 09:33.400]  homeland speaking speaking of things like the Boston bombing where the police militarized come
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.520]  in and locked down literally half the city of Boston going into people's houses pointing guns
[09:38.520 --> 09:42.480]  at him pointing guns at people in their cars who didn't even look like the suspect grabbing
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.960]  women by the hair shoving them on the ground just any excuse to stomp around take control of a
[09:46.960 --> 09:52.520]  whole area and then of course he was outside the coordinate area in a boat then they tried to
[09:52.520 --> 09:56.520]  shoot him in the boat to kill him to get rid of the other witness he's pled not guilty his brother
[09:56.520 --> 10:02.440]  was on the CIA payroll on record and was a patsy set up but that's a side issue that anniversary
[10:02.440 --> 10:06.600]  is coming up here in April we're going to send reporters up there to cover police state to the
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.600]  Boston bombing to effect I might go I need to get out in the field more listeners I really
[10:12.600 --> 10:21.200]  appreciate that and we always get good intel when I do that but all of this is unfolding and we got
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.840]  Paul Watson joining us in a few minutes to talk about homeland snipers terrorized confused residents
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.000]  during raid and they did the same thing just came into an area locked down a large area of a
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.920]  neighborhood and then when people looked up their windows or were in their cars they would yell at
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.640]  them and point guns out this is Fallujah folks this is we're at insurgents the police train in
[10:41.640 --> 10:47.200]  major cities that's in mainstream news that the general public quote are insurgents we are an enemy
[10:47.200 --> 10:53.880]  they are the rise of the warrior police in their armored war wags from the Iraq war and from
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.360]  Afghanistan and they're playing soldier folks they're preparing for the gun confiscation it came out
[10:59.360 --> 11:03.320]  in Connecticut a police officer blew the whistle that other police officers are saying they can't
[11:03.320 --> 11:07.880]  wait for the order to come for the gun confiscation because all the semi-autos have basically been
[11:07.880 --> 11:11.800]  banned they wouldn't let you register and they passed a lot of register but then didn't even
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.040]  create the facilities or personnel to let people even register them so now they just say in
[11:17.040 --> 11:22.640]  letters you can't register turn your guns in and the police are bragging even on message boards in
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.640]  their Facebook I can't wait to kick down doors and you know go after these effing gun owners and
[11:27.640 --> 11:32.520]  so a police officer spoke out against that he's been put on leave the kill failing wrote two
[11:32.520 --> 11:37.080]  articles about that has been picked up by mainstream news in Connecticut now I want to get that police
[11:37.080 --> 11:46.760]  officer on leave not the guy not the guy that said that he was going to you know love kicking
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.840]  down doors no no he's not on leave the police officer that said I don't like this and then
[11:52.840 --> 11:57.120]  Michael failing and others are able to reach out to him and and and confirm who the police
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.600]  officer was and you know that they should have free speech to say man I think it's crazy that the
[12:02.600 --> 12:09.320]  police are ready for war with the American people by the way it is not going to go the way you
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.200]  think police or maybe police out there know it's not going to go the way some police think you
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.680]  think you're going to have some crusade or jihad against gun owners and veterans I mean this this
[12:19.680 --> 12:23.280]  is the globalist trying to get us all to kill each other and start a civil war just like they've
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.560]  done in Ukraine that's basically what's going on the pro Russia pro EU side squared off country
[12:28.560 --> 12:35.040]  destabilized bankers coming into loot the nation they went out of the chaos I don't want this but
[12:35.040 --> 12:39.480]  I understand it's about a supremacy of power for the state they have a monopoly of gun ownership
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.120]  and I understand a lot of police especially the young ones are on power trips and are very
[12:45.120 --> 12:52.800]  dictatorial and believe their word is his law judge dread judge jury executioner and our country
[12:52.800 --> 13:00.080]  is on a razor's edge that stories up on drudgereport.com on the left hand side under Rush Limbaugh hits
[13:00.080 --> 13:08.160]  one number one on Amazon book sales for his first Patriots for kids you know I intend I've said to
[13:08.160 --> 13:14.080]  write books for children about how exciting America is and how great the founders were
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.560]  and what a great legacy people have and I actually was at Barnes and Nobles and I did actually buy
[13:19.560 --> 13:25.880]  my son this book this weekend and it's still in the back of my truck I've been meaning to give it
[13:25.880 --> 13:32.680]  to him but I forget to bring it in when I get home or go over to see him at night but it's a good
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.160]  idea that's the type of strategy the globalist are targeting the youth with lies and fraud in the
[13:37.160 --> 13:43.760]  sea we need to target the youth with the truth but anyways the story is homeland snipers terrorized
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.440]  confused residents during raid another story that's from infowars.com on drugs that ties into what
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.960]  we're about to get to right now facial recognition glasses to stop crime before it happens pre-crime
[13:53.960 --> 14:01.320]  and and we were out on the street yesterday with our reporters at the big media conference and film
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.320]  conference and music conference South by Southwest one the biggest in the world and we ran into a
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.520]  woman remote controlling a ground drone from another part of the United States with the ground
[14:12.520 --> 14:19.120]  drone on the street so this is literally ground drones now hitting the street in Austin Texas it's
[14:19.120 --> 14:24.240]  going to be submarine drones ship drones ground drones Google cars this is the rise of the robots
[14:24.240 --> 14:31.360]  and Leanne ran to people that were just flaunting giving up your rights is a great thing flaunting
[14:31.360 --> 14:39.080]  it's good to be face scan to get a free sandwich with I guess the plastic additives to it from
[14:39.080 --> 14:47.480]  the folks over at Subway free tacos if you'll face scan or whatever from Taco Bell the whole
[14:47.480 --> 14:54.560]  thing is an NSA Microsoft Google police state rollout and then they have the tokens Snowden
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.520]  there and then we had interviews with most the programmers that were there for the Snowden deal
[14:58.520 --> 15:04.640]  not knowing even after he spoke who he was or about the NSA I mean these people do not know
[15:04.640 --> 15:10.120]  what planet they're on so we're gonna play Leanne McAdoo's latest report premiering in here on air
[15:10.120 --> 15:17.080]  and then we're gonna go to Paul Watson on the Boston Marshall Law situation where first they
[15:17.080 --> 15:21.600]  locked down a neighborhood well first you know two houses then then a neighborhood now a whole
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.320]  larger neighborhood than half a city where you're the enemy is all Fallujah lock down
[15:26.320 --> 15:31.560]  Corden City Marshall law that's against the law and the Constitution Bill writes let's go to Leanne
[15:31.560 --> 15:36.360]  McAdoo's report so here at South by Southwest at the convention center a lot of companies have
[15:36.360 --> 15:40.880]  these interactive booths set up where people can interact with their products and play these new
[15:40.880 --> 15:44.920]  games they've got a bunch of wearables with the Google Glass and all sorts of virtual reality
[15:44.920 --> 15:50.680]  technology Subway has a huge display back here where they've got clothes that are hooked up to
[15:50.680 --> 15:56.280]  computers maybe with some sort of sensor material that will let you know when it's time to eat more
[15:56.280 --> 16:02.680]  of their yoga foam Matt bread or you know putting that ham sandwich down because you're obese total
[16:02.680 --> 16:10.320]  nanny state new track suit but we asked if someone could just explain to us what these prototypes
[16:10.320 --> 16:14.560]  were for and she went to go get her people and they were all happy about it but then they noticed
[16:14.560 --> 16:20.200]  that we were from info wars and they refused to speak to the real press that's going to ask them
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.360]  you know hey what's going on with this push for transhumanism and is that why you're feeding
[16:24.360 --> 16:29.760]  us all these weird yoga foam materials because you're just preparing us for our new robo meals
[16:29.760 --> 16:33.360]  that we're going to have you know they didn't want to answer those kind of questions so they'll
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.440]  talk to the fake press that's going to kiss their butt and tell them how great their product is but
[16:38.440 --> 16:47.440]  she saw this and she's scurried away so this could be used for medicine say where a surgeon is
[16:47.440 --> 16:53.840]  working and people want to see exactly how they're doing their process so for example one of the
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.640]  first use cases that were developed was for the military where a battlefield medic could be triaging
[16:58.640 --> 17:03.880]  cases out on the field and the expert surgeon could be in a forward operating base and they
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.320]  could be you know helping and guiding and now this technology we're using it for the more
[17:07.320 --> 17:13.000]  commercial type use cases very minority report it is very minority report but you know what like
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.080]  so are the smartphones so is everything else so what in the world is this yeah so this is a
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.840]  remote presence device it's a beam by a company called suitable technologies and basically we
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.080]  created a device because we said you know why are people transporting their bodies places where
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.200]  they're not using their bodies for anything besides you know milling about a space wow this is just
[17:34.200 --> 17:40.880]  incredible this so you are you do you feel kind of duped that you're having to sit at a desk and
[17:40.880 --> 17:48.040]  do South by remotely like this no so we've actually got a crazy week here so I'm grateful that I can
[17:48.040 --> 17:52.680]  just go to South by Southwest remotely because I feel like if I had to deal with a flight and then
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.000]  right you're like I have to stay out late with everybody I just like I can save my energy and
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.560]  then I can also I'm on my computer right so I can be working simultaneously sending emails and getting
[18:02.560 --> 18:08.720]  work done well in here wow Alex Jones you need to get this technology then you can just send
[18:08.720 --> 18:16.160]  yourself where you need to go why why Google glasses why not we we spent so much energy
[18:16.160 --> 18:22.200]  trying to use these phones in every which way we can why don't you put it with them you try to hear
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.800]  things with them you try to you try to use them to make yourself better and if you could people are
[18:27.800 --> 18:34.800]  hopeless innocent and I even come straight into your eyes why that I I imagine that would be
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.200]  valuable why not just implant a chip in your head next oh because we're not at that point with

[18:57.680 --> 19:02.400]  conspicuous and they're all waiting for Google to make contact lenses that do the same thing yeah
[19:02.400 --> 19:10.120]  so we all think it's inevitable yeah and all the pushback is futile has anyone yelled at you or tried
[19:10.120 --> 19:15.440]  to trip you or anything or something for putting their face in a facial recognition software with
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.360]  yours or no Google doesn't allow that it understands that this is very creepy and intrusive at the
[19:20.360 --> 19:26.400]  moment really already have an app doing that kind of thing so you can't submit apps to the store
[19:26.400 --> 19:34.120]  that would do facial recognition yet right and aren't you worried about someone hacking in and

[24:19.920 --> 24:27.120]  com team the m4 saintly news and radio team are at the corner of San Jacinta and Congress right
[24:27.120 --> 24:34.000]  down by the Capitol where I kind of got the idea this weekend that we needed an armed march with
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.720]  the Texas open carry folks during South by Southwest when we called them they said no we're
[24:38.720 --> 24:43.320]  already doing one Saturday now to counter Bloomberg and others coming down here basically
[24:43.320 --> 24:50.280]  getting the World Bank to finance South by Southwest try to organize media groups for the
[24:50.280 --> 24:55.560]  registration and confiscation of guns which is the mayor's against the Constitution's goal the
[24:55.560 --> 25:03.120]  official name is a mayor's of course against illegal guns of course that's any gun that the
[25:03.120 --> 25:07.560]  state doesn't own or have to point at the American people as mouse a tongue said political power
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.280]  goes out of the barrel of a gun or all political power grows out of the barrel of gun but they're
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.800]  gonna be marching folks and I think it's to me as many as 30 40 50 people and prompt to we're not
[25:16.800 --> 25:22.040]  sure but I said hey let's have one earlier let's have one on Wednesday if you want to do it to
[25:22.040 --> 25:29.440]  try to supercharge national media attention for Saturday and the marks they have this Saturday
[25:29.440 --> 25:34.120]  it's all listed at info wars.com I'm gonna have Kit Daniels repost that but finishing the end of
[25:34.120 --> 25:38.800]  Leanne McAdoo's report that we're gonna post up on info wars.com if folks want to be able to link
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.040]  through to that we'll probably add it to Watson's article about the Google glasses because it it
[25:43.040 --> 25:49.000]  ties into that that's linked on Drudge right now but this guy they got what 3,000 people together
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.560]  at first brought them into the Google events got them to agree that they would push a party line
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.560]  about you will be assimilated you will submit it's inevitable you will take brain chips but
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.040]  you know first it will be contacts and then it will be in the brain this is good this is happy
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.160]  this is trendy this is fun this will empower you the problem is it's already hacked by the
[26:11.160 --> 26:16.760]  globalist it's controlled by the eugenicist technocrats sure I'm sure down the road brain
[26:16.760 --> 26:21.600]  chips are great for blind people brain ships could boost space travelers whatever the problem is
[26:21.600 --> 26:29.360]  the system is run by evil people inherently look at the NSA look at all of it look at how they lie
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.880]  constantly look at how they cheat constantly you're letting them hack into your life like the smart
[26:33.880 --> 26:41.560]  meters so let's let this idiot finish because I've heard what he's saying before and so Google
[26:41.560 --> 26:49.160]  literally is like an invading space armada here it is so we all think it's inevitable and all the
[26:49.160 --> 26:55.000]  pushback is futile has anyone yelled at you or tried to trip you or anything or something for
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.480]  putting their face in a facial recognition software with yours or Google doesn't allow that it
[27:01.480 --> 27:05.800]  understands that this is very creepy and intrusive at the moment people are really on the fence with
[27:05.800 --> 27:13.400]  this kind of thing so you can't submit apps to the store that would do facial recognition yet
[27:13.400 --> 27:20.240]  right and aren't you worried about someone hacking in and taking over especially if you get that
[27:20.240 --> 27:27.200]  implant chip implant see we'll cross the bridge when we get there right now the hardest challenge is
[27:27.200 --> 27:33.680]  to bringing hardware to that level it's like saying it's like saying that oh we've just discovered
[27:33.680 --> 27:39.560]  fire we could maybe melt stones and make iron out of it but wait somebody could make a knife with
[27:39.560 --> 27:46.080]  that and kill me so let's not let's not use fire that's ridiculous these are just tools you can
[27:46.080 --> 27:50.560]  either make the best steak in the world using the sharpest knife or you could become a homicidal
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.520]  maniac yeah really depends on you and it depends on us as a society exactly people that will use
[27:55.520 --> 28:00.840]  this for Google is making everything better and they've got all these nice people that work at
[28:00.840 --> 28:06.400]  Google like this guy and who really believe this stuff it's a cult it's the new religion and the
[28:06.400 --> 28:10.640]  globalists all the technocrats from Ray Kurzweil do you name it say you will take brain chips we
[28:10.640 --> 28:16.360]  will reduce population by at least 80% world government will be here by 2020 we will micromanage
[28:16.360 --> 28:22.120]  you in a technocracy I mean I've read hundreds of books and news articles and white papers where
[28:22.120 --> 28:26.200]  they all say this I mean we've read it on air you know it if you see it in the news and then we go
[28:26.200 --> 28:31.520]  hey we don't want that and they go hey don't be scared it's gonna be fun resistance is futile
[28:31.520 --> 28:55.600]  he actually said resistance is futile well I've heard that before resistance is futile
[28:55.600 --> 29:04.520]  no resistance is victory and that's why they always tell you resistance is futile because
[29:04.520 --> 29:10.280]  it's not freedom is sexy freedom is cool freedom is deep and free will is key and the
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.320]  technocracies being built to smash free will and look at the fruits of television and the
[29:15.320 --> 29:23.880]  smartphones the language is shrinking the biological brainwaves are lowering the IQ is dropping we
[29:23.880 --> 29:31.240]  are physically dying we are physically being wrecked right now so let me tell you Google and

[34:28.440 --> 34:33.840]  exercising our rights openly that we are not slaves of the establishment so you still got time if

[35:11.520 --> 35:19.800]  the first half hour until Kathleen Willie a rape victim assault victim of Lord Lord Clinton will
[35:19.800 --> 35:24.800]  will be joining us with her book out by WorldNet Daily we've rescheduled that several times that
[35:24.800 --> 35:30.840]  is happening today cross our fingers hope to die stick a needle in our eye but we're gonna go to
[35:30.840 --> 35:37.200]  Paul Watson here first about one of the double links we've got up on drudge report dot com be
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.480]  a prison planet dot com and info wars dot com homeland snipers terrorized confused residents
[35:42.480 --> 35:50.440]  during raid and this is the new thing used to have was a backfire by school the police would you
[35:50.440 --> 35:53.680]  know lock down all the streets around it and point guns at people all over the country including
[35:53.680 --> 35:59.120]  here in Austin now it's locked down the whole neighborhood or now if they're doing a SWAT
[35:59.120 --> 36:03.200]  raid it's take over the neighbor's house to have a quote tactical advantage in a rescue if you
[36:03.200 --> 36:07.840]  don't give your house to him about a warrant that's quartering troops in your house and then now
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.000]  it's locked down the whole neighborhood and now it's locked down the whole city and now everyone's
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.240]  a suspect everyone's a terrorist oh we're looking for a black guy who's shooting cops in LA here
[36:16.240 --> 36:23.000]  let's shoot up vehicles full of white women that don't even match the vehicle well that's okay
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.640]  because you know they might be terrorists too this is just just just part of the craziness or we're
[36:28.640 --> 36:34.480]  looking for a white male let's shoot up a vehicle full of black people remember that happened in a
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.040]  case too it's just just random oh we're looking for a white guy there's some black people open fire
[36:38.040 --> 36:45.880]  we're looking for a black guy big black guy cop doner let's just shoot some women when they
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.760]  shot three carloads of people just totally insane in broad daylight just just randomly
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.960]  opening fire running around scared to death statistically cops had a better chance of being
[36:54.960 --> 37:01.280]  killed by a bolt of lightning than Dorner during that whole thing look it up but they don't care
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.960]  just like hundreds die a year in gas man explosions that's clearly what happened in Harlem preliminary
[37:06.960 --> 37:12.640]  evidence is overwhelming they're trying to say it's 9-11 folks they're invoking every form of fear
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.480]  except for what's really dangerous great white sharks kill five people year on average records
[37:17.480 --> 37:26.160]  12 people everyone I know most people will not go into the ocean and are constantly scared because
[37:26.160 --> 37:29.240]  they think great whites are about to eat them and I know I beat that to death that didn't happen
[37:29.240 --> 37:35.320]  till Jaws came out in 1970 whatever it was and then the resorts had to put ads out saying
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.680]  there aren't sharks they won't eat you because people are so scared ladies and gentlemen I
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.640]  keep hammering this because it's mind control now joining us to show how we're going under
[37:46.640 --> 37:52.040]  martial law not just here but in England they do the same thing now is Paul Watson to break down
[37:52.040 --> 37:58.000]  this incredible story there's photos and videos up on info wars calm of this the story was up
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.280]  last night it's already scrolled off the front page it should be re-added to the front page the
[38:02.280 --> 38:09.080]  best place to find it is the left-hand side of drugs report calm but let's go to Paul Watson
[38:09.080 --> 38:16.040]  now from I'll be on from London Paul break down what's happening here well this is a combined
[38:16.040 --> 38:22.320]  federal NYPD drugs bust in East Williamsburg in the early hours of Sunday morning basically
[38:22.320 --> 38:28.400]  started with a low-flying helicopter they proceeded to block off some of the streets and then the
[38:28.400 --> 38:35.360]  DHS goons descended with their flashlight snipers and pointed them at people who were in different
[38:35.360 --> 38:40.320]  buildings not even involved not even in the same building as the where the drugs bus was
[38:40.320 --> 38:46.120]  taking place so some of the quotes from the residents who were there were utterly confused and
[38:46.120 --> 38:52.680]  frankly terrorized during the incident because they would have DHS goons with snipers point them
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.680]  up at them as they looked out of the window and train the gun on their faces even though they were
[38:57.680 --> 39:03.000]  in a completely different building so again it's it's another one of these concerns about the
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  militarization of domestic law enforcement you remember back in August we did the report out
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  of New Hampshire where they were trying to purchase this bear cat armored vehicle and a similar
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.880]  vehicle was used in the incident on Sunday and the police chief there John Duval actually said
[39:19.880 --> 39:25.080]  that they needed this armored vehicle to use against groups such as sovereign citizens free
[39:25.080 --> 39:31.760]  status and occupy New Hampshire so even the police chief admitted that it's not for it's
[39:31.760 --> 39:37.400]  not for criminals it's not for terrorists it's for political extremists basically anyone who
[39:37.400 --> 39:44.320]  protests against the government that's right and we have video compilations Paul of the
[39:44.320 --> 39:50.440]  thousands of armed police in camo in black uniforms and armored vehicles literally running
[39:50.440 --> 39:55.760]  around where a woman walks out and they grab her and shove her down the porch they're pointing
[39:55.760 --> 40:01.760]  guns everybody in their houses this is occupied America and the religion is quote police safety
[40:01.760 --> 40:08.160]  and so all of us basically are the enemy and this has been a conversion by design are to the quote
[40:08.160 --> 40:14.720]  North American ran corporation stabilization force the national stabilization force is the
[40:14.720 --> 40:22.720]  martial law rollout plan incrementally that's right and it started back really in 1997 which
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.000]  is around the same time your first police day documentary came out because that's when the
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.120]  defense department started paying out for this equipment this military equipment to be distributed
[40:33.120 --> 40:40.440]  to law enforcement agencies so they spent 4.2 billion dollars on that since 97 but then since
[40:40.440 --> 40:47.800]  the inception of homeland security a separate payment of 34 billion dollars in terrorism grants
[40:47.800 --> 40:54.840]  has gone to local police departments and that's why now they dress like military assets basically
[40:54.840 --> 41:00.120]  treat us as the terrorists because they're not fighting a war crime has gone down but they
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.640]  have to arm up because now they're being trained that where the threat where the extremists where
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.480]  the potential terrorists so that's why they're starting to look like military assets because
[41:09.480 --> 41:14.160]  they're being told that the war is now domestic that United States is the battlefield and just
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.920]  like them denying the NSA Spong and everybody for the last 20 years when it was already all
[41:17.920 --> 41:23.400]  public basically the big news was is just they were lying about it the whole time but they were
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.160]  lying about what was already public and they would just go nobody's doing that it's a conspiracy
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.840]  theory and they're like no one's trained to take your guns no one's training for martial law when
[41:32.840 --> 41:38.280]  the army manuals the police manuals there's literally hundreds of them the FBI came out in
[41:38.280 --> 41:45.320]  January of 2014 this year and said our new mission is no longer crime it is extremism it is
[41:45.320 --> 41:52.440]  political policing commissariat I mean this is it and there's no doubting and I'm not even trying
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.600]  to demonize the average FBI person or the average cop one reason they haven't been able to have total
[41:57.600 --> 42:02.760]  tyranny take over yet is because there's still some basic common sense there but they're getting
[42:02.760 --> 42:09.960]  rid of it I mean we see a bank robbery in California and they and they for 20 square miles randomly
[42:09.960 --> 42:15.080]  have cops standing out aiming guns at people in their cars walking up with M16s at people's heads
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.000]  that don't even match the description and then the next car comes up and they aim guns at their
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.120]  head I mean I'm gonna get mad when I pull up and the cops are aiming guns everybody's head now if
[42:24.120 --> 42:29.400]  I was driving on the road and they said red Chevy pickup truck white male driving just shot and
[42:29.400 --> 42:34.440]  killed you know two people in the front lawn armed and dangerous and I heard that on the radio and
[42:34.440 --> 42:38.280]  I drove to a checkpoint and they weren't aiming guns anybody but I was driving a red pickup and
[42:38.280 --> 42:42.680]  they aim guns at me I put my hands up and get out but I pull up to a check because that's
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.160]  probably cause that that's you've got some evidence there you know what you're looking for I pull
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.320]  up one of these checkpoints where they're aiming guns at people's heads I'm gonna get mad man
[42:51.960 --> 42:58.760]  every every car you put a gun to their head this is pure martial law Fallujah crap and I'm sorry
[42:58.760 --> 43:04.760]  Paul go ahead final comments well I mean that's exactly what the former colonel Peter Martino
[43:04.760 --> 43:10.280]  said in New Hampshire during his public testimony Marine Corps Iraq he was in Fallujah he was in
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.880]  10 tours of combat different tours yes exactly and he said you know he trained the Iraqi army he
[43:15.880 --> 43:20.840]  was in Fallujah he said this is exactly what's happening they're building a domestic army he was
[43:20.840 --> 43:27.640]  a colonel in Iraq this is not us saying it this is a decorated professional saying it so they're
[43:27.640 --> 43:32.520]  also building towns in in Virginia as we saw a few weeks ago with Christian churches you know
[43:32.520 --> 43:38.360]  American signs fully operational subways they're preparing for the occupation whether it actually
[43:38.360 --> 43:42.440]  happens or not remains to be seen but there's no doubt that there that's what they're gearing up for
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.800]  Paul what was the headline on your article there it is US Army builds fake city in Virginia
[43:47.800 --> 43:53.720]  to practice military occupation and the one a telegraph spun it saying oh uh or it was the
[43:53.720 --> 43:59.800]  Daily Mail oh it's it's it's a mosque it's a Baptist church folks and they literally train
[43:59.800 --> 44:05.960]  to gun confiscate and it's on record they're training for it well yeah there was actually
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.600]  there were both there was a mosque and a christian church so they basically want to occupy everyone
[44:10.600 --> 44:16.360]  but all the signs were in English you know they had subways with the washington decals on them so
[44:16.360 --> 44:22.040]  it was very much designed to be a domestic american city it wasn't set up as a as a middle eastern
[44:22.040 --> 44:27.560]  city sure sure i mean north com has all announced this brigade homeland army time stars and stripes
[44:27.560 --> 44:33.240]  it's all public but they keep telling the the the the general public and mainstream media
[44:33.240 --> 44:38.440]  it doesn't exist because they don't want to have a debate about the illegal federalization
[44:38.440 --> 44:43.880]  militarization via north com that's like they don't want people knowing drones or watching
[44:43.880 --> 44:47.640]  farmers even though it's public they don't want they don't want to have a debate about 2.6 billion
[44:47.640 --> 44:52.280]  bullets and and targets of the average american and training to confiscate guns from veterans and
[44:52.280 --> 44:57.080]  retired police even though that's all public they can't have a debate about it because if they allow
[44:57.080 --> 45:02.920]  us to have a debate if they admit it's all going on then we will morally win the day so they just
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.640]  want to deny all this is happening kind of like they want to deny obama cares written by offshore
[45:07.640 --> 45:11.480]  banks to double your premiums or there's death panels even though they're in the bill or that
[45:11.480 --> 45:17.240]  the irs hired 17 000 agents to take five thousand dollars out of your bank account i mean that's
[45:17.240 --> 45:23.720]  in the bill so of course it's beginning because that's what the bill says but they count on people
[45:23.720 --> 45:29.480]  not going and reading the stinking bill and then they have those traders on ms nbc go alex jones
[45:29.480 --> 45:34.920]  is a racist he lies and says the irs is going to take money out of your account listen you witch
[45:34.920 --> 45:41.000]  madal you know full well it's in that stinking bill i'm sorry paul go ahead final comment
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.760]  well it's interesting how the media controls it because individually they're dying you know cnn
[45:46.760 --> 45:52.200]  losing half their viewership over the past year but in concert which they always work in concert
[45:52.200 --> 45:58.040]  to create national talking points that's how they frame conversations that's how they prevent anything
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.760]  important from becoming a national conversation so they've still got that power when they work
[46:02.760 --> 46:08.680]  together which they fundamentally routinely do so the fact that we're growing so much allows us to
[46:08.680 --> 46:13.640]  create these national conversations to a greater and greater degree and this is one that needs to
[46:13.640 --> 46:18.760]  happen that is our greatest power and i thank god for it all of our friends and the real media for it
[46:18.760 --> 46:23.160]  yeah that's the great responsibility it's the opposite of a power trip it is a great responsibility
[46:23.160 --> 46:27.640]  that info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and our reporters and you paul watson and the great
[46:27.640 --> 46:35.080]  team are able every week now to spur huge national conversations and legislation which msnbc in the
[46:35.080 --> 46:41.960]  white house bemoan they track us as the source of so much resistance because we see who you are enemy
[46:42.520 --> 46:47.080]  i mean you're naked we're like a three-year-old saying the emperor is not wearing any clothes
[46:47.080 --> 46:52.840]  it's over scum and you can't take out info wars because if you did it would make us martyrs it's
[46:52.840 --> 46:58.520]  already spread people already know you're the enemy they already know you're outsider ouslander
[46:58.520 --> 47:05.400]  usurper globalist outlanders new world order traders in here to try to take over our country
[47:05.400 --> 47:12.520]  and it is not going to work you are going to fall you are being identified you are being
[47:12.520 --> 47:17.400]  you are you will fail and the old times we were fighting stallion or hitler open enemies you could
[47:17.400 --> 47:23.640]  see this is a corporate takeover we can now see it we can see it's an outside occupation a corporate
[47:23.640 --> 47:29.400]  global takeover in their own words and we're countering it great job paul joseph watson thanks
[47:29.400 --> 47:33.800]  alex all right now when we come back at you know seven eight after next hour we're going to start
[47:33.800 --> 47:38.840]  the official march that's going to start right at noon we're going to be covering it live as they
[47:38.840 --> 47:44.920]  march down into south by southwest uh from the corner of san jasino and congress and we go now
[47:44.920 --> 47:52.280]  to leon macadoo and jacari jackson and others we have multiple live feeds right now um and again
[47:52.280 --> 48:00.520]  these are the modern day paul reveres ladies and gentlemen the the modern day paul reveres are down
[48:00.520 --> 48:06.280]  there to march openly with their firearms to show everyone that citizens have a right to have guns
[48:06.280 --> 48:12.120]  not just the god state not just the centralized system are our reporters ready for us to go to them
[48:12.120 --> 48:19.320]  all right i can't i'm getting a in and out of the audio feed okay leon you're on the air i like
[48:19.320 --> 48:24.840]  your t-shirt molan labé hey i've been told it's actually quite blinding out here with this golden
[48:24.840 --> 48:32.360]  foil but you are a valkyrie of self-defense yes wonder woman's got her golden lassos of truth
[48:32.360 --> 48:40.120]  i have got my golden guns of liberty so come and take it freedom freedom is sexy you know what i mean
[48:40.120 --> 48:47.720]  it sure is leon so we've got a really nice size crowd already we said about what 20 minutes until
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.320]  noon we're out here standing right about in front of the capital at 12th in san jasinto there's plenty
[48:53.320 --> 48:59.720]  of parking in the capital parking garage so we've got probably about 50 people out here already
[48:59.720 --> 49:05.160]  and i'm standing here with justin delosh he is one of the organizers for come and take it austin
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.280]  so what are some of the safety precautions that you're going to be letting everyone know about
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.280]  before we get started before we get started we'll hold it how do everybody up we do like a
[49:12.280 --> 49:15.560]  buddy system chamber check where you basically the person to your left you and the person to the
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.040]  right of you we check our chamber to make sure none of us are carrying chamber magazines loaded
[49:20.040 --> 49:24.520]  or empty it's a preference but we do not carry chambered and we also make sure that everybody's
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.480]  carrying their muzzle and bus stock as close to six and twelve o'clock as possible so we've had a
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.120]  lot of press out here we've already got a visit from the capital police and they were very nice
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.720]  actually there's a set that they support what we're doing out here and they're just going to
[49:37.720 --> 49:44.280]  basically escort us through south by southwest since we do have a mixed crowd out there people are
[49:44.280 --> 49:48.360]  drinking during the daytime so you just never know how they're going to they're going to get wild
[49:48.360 --> 49:53.480]  but what is your what is your aim here with the public today our goals to educate people on the
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.040]  gun laws here in texas and to educate people to let them know that we're actually behind in gun
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.280]  laws whereas the rumors are texas is a gun friendly state and we're actually one of only six states in
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.080]  the us does not have any form of open carry for handguns so we'd like to see a constitutional
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.880]  carry or at least open carry past here in texas exactly and it seems like we've got a lot of
[50:11.880 --> 50:17.480]  support for that a lot of people going by honking and everything also too it's sort of a way to let
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.600]  people kind of reeducate people and wake them up from the massive brainwashing that's been going
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.480]  on with guns exactly we actively seek people to have this kind of dialogue about the firearm
[50:27.480 --> 50:31.480]  laws you know i'm saying because those people that may be on the fence we actively go out there to
[50:31.480 --> 50:36.200]  to address some of the issues they may have regarding firearms or maybe lack of knowledge we
[50:36.200 --> 50:41.000]  actually actively go out there and engage in this kind of dialogue with them to help educate leon
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.880]  get them to plug the different gun groups websites for folks that want to get involved can you plug
[50:45.880 --> 50:50.440]  a few of the different gun groups websites so anyone that wants to get involved um yeah we're
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.440]  with uh come and take it austin we have a we have a facebook page come and take it austin uh we have
[50:54.440 --> 50:58.760]  30 chapters across texas so we're actually part of a bigger group called come and take it texas
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.120]  so if anybody goes facebook come and take it texas they can find their chapter there
[51:02.120 --> 51:07.080]  and we're doing we're doing rallies and walks every month very good we're going to be talking
[51:07.080 --> 51:12.280]  to him more as we march leon i see the owner of central texas gunworks behind you and a reporter
[51:12.280 --> 51:16.840]  kit daniels for info wars let's talk to some of those guys and uh while you're talking to him we
[51:16.840 --> 51:22.600]  could pan around and show the crowd and some of the firearms that are there how are you doing
[51:22.600 --> 51:33.560]  wow so this is i know i'm blocking the sun here so right how you doing my cargill yeah get my
[51:33.560 --> 51:39.960]  cargill's take on this so what's your take on on this event here today it's about freedom about
[51:39.960 --> 51:46.520]  peace love and freedom and education reeducation for the public absolutely in the soviet camp
[51:46.520 --> 51:50.360]  yes in the public letting them know what the laws are here in the state of texas that it is legal
[51:50.360 --> 51:55.400]  for you to open carry a long gun here in the state of texas would you like to see that open carry
[51:55.400 --> 52:00.360]  log a little bit further absolutely i like to see i like to be able to open carry my handgun
[52:00.360 --> 52:04.120]  you know that's something that i'm most comfortable with you know right now i have to conceal my hand
[52:04.120 --> 52:08.280]  gun i have two handguns on me right now that are concealed and i would love to open carry those hand
[52:08.280 --> 52:13.880]  guns i think it's so frustrating because you with the concealed carry you can only let people know
[52:13.880 --> 52:20.680]  you've got it if you are gonna kill them i mean i think that's that's kind of a backwards cause
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.480]  there well concealed carry is about personal protection just like you know um carenet firearm
[52:25.480 --> 52:30.200]  it can be about personal protection but also it's also about you know hunting it's about other
[52:30.200 --> 52:36.840]  different things that out there also not just you know for protection we're getting ready to have
[52:36.840 --> 52:43.080]  this march ask him what he thinks of bloomberg trying to shut down free speech of gun groups on
[52:43.080 --> 52:48.920]  facebook uh and the fact that they tried to stop us from handing out our pro gun magazines
[52:48.920 --> 52:54.520]  south by southwest what do you think about bloomberg trying to shut down the uh free speech
[52:54.520 --> 52:58.760]  you know people supporting second amendment and gun rights on facebook they're shutting down
[52:58.760 --> 53:03.080]  those groups there they're very vocal about the second amendment they tried to stop us from
[53:03.080 --> 53:08.440]  passing out magazines here last year well there are a lot of things that i'm really
[53:08.440 --> 53:14.280]  disappointed with i'm really disappointed the fact that um our attorney general greg abed actually
[53:14.280 --> 53:22.200]  was on the one of the attorneys that was actually supporting um not allowing 18 year olds 19 20
[53:22.200 --> 53:28.200]  year olds to be able to um legally purchase a firearm from a gun from a dealer i'm disappointed
[53:28.200 --> 53:35.240]  in that um because you know we will allow these guys that are 18 19 20 to go overseas and you
[53:35.240 --> 53:39.400]  know to give their life for this country but when they come back you know from serving their country
[53:39.400 --> 53:42.600]  they're not they're not allowed to purchase a firearm so those are some of the things that
[53:42.600 --> 53:48.120]  i'm disappointed and very hurt over right just a massive brainwashing so that's kind of what
[53:48.120 --> 53:52.840]  we're out here to do today is just to educate there are there's an international crowd here
[53:52.840 --> 53:57.880]  today people have descended upon austin for south by southwest they're going to get a little taste
[53:57.880 --> 54:05.640]  of texas and our gun laws here um leon i see different reports 200 to 300 000 extra people
[54:05.640 --> 54:10.600]  in the city the things that we like most in texas we love our firearms we love our freedom and we're
[54:10.600 --> 54:14.920]  going to let the world know that to hear today absolutely and by the way i'm going to go take
[54:14.920 --> 54:19.880]  my conceal carry finally from cargill coming up here soon he's a great guy central texas done
[54:19.880 --> 54:24.360]  works great folks i still haven't gotten my conceal carry folks i just carry a rifle in the truck
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.400]  because uh i just have never had time to go do it uh but now i'm just i've got to do it i've
[54:29.400 --> 54:33.000]  got to do it i've got to start carrying at all times there's so many threats and things we're
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.480]  going through leon we're going to break here in a few minutes but uh jacari jackson and you are
[54:37.480 --> 54:42.440]  going to be out there with your feed your skype feed is crystal clear the other one's bad so we
[54:42.440 --> 54:47.400]  probably want to mainly go with your feed with you and jacari marching together uh getting
[54:47.400 --> 54:52.440]  commentary but uh who else should we talk to maybe kit daniels over there let's get kit daniels info
[54:52.440 --> 54:58.600]  wars dot com uh reporters take on this to to uh estimate the number how many people does he estimate
[54:58.600 --> 55:04.680]  in this uh only one day planned uh event are already out there let's say at least 75 maybe even 100
[55:05.240 --> 55:12.120]  way this is probably more way more than what the attendance at the bloomberg anti gun event on
[55:12.120 --> 55:18.200]  saturday morning which had maybe less than maybe five maybe well there about five people on the
[55:18.200 --> 55:23.320]  dais calling for an end of pro gun free speech literally they're now attacking the first amendment
[55:23.320 --> 55:28.600]  savagely and then they had about a dozen reporters out there sycophantically reporting uh all of it
[55:28.600 --> 55:32.600]  you know they bloomberg would vomit out the lies they would eat it and then vomit it back out on us
[55:33.160 --> 55:38.280]  and a kind of circular logic situation but this is an impromptu with one day planning two day
[55:38.280 --> 55:44.760]  planning uh saturday uh your articles up on info wars dot com kit for folks that want to find more
[55:44.760 --> 55:51.960]  what time is the event saturday uh the big march uh to i believe it's going to be at noon but same
[55:51.960 --> 55:57.240]  spot san jacinta in congress this is the event saturday at noon 1130 we need a meet up at 1130
[55:57.240 --> 56:02.600]  we'll probably march out about noon meet up at 1130 probably march about noon same time same time
[56:02.600 --> 56:07.480]  same place now listen i know the capital police get off their jurisdiction there at the capital
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.640]  uh because they have a wider jurisdiction in the state i know the austin police have not been
[56:11.640 --> 56:15.960]  as anti-open carry as some of the state police orders they've gotten i know the state police
[56:15.960 --> 56:19.800]  individually are meant for our pro second amendment but they've been following some of the illegal
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.800]  orders uh in the past now now who is going to quote be marching with you guys is it state police
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.200]  ask kid because i'm not clear on that uh or is it going to be austin police the uh we're wondering
[56:32.200 --> 56:36.520]  which of the police are actually going to be escorting us today through the crowd that that
[56:36.520 --> 56:41.960]  group right there those are the capital police those are awesome pd yeah that's what i thought i
[56:41.960 --> 56:46.280]  didn't think the state police were going to be doing that and again we have this right to open
[56:46.280 --> 56:51.880]  carry and if they want to have police there show that you know some trendy doesn't come up and punch
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.200]  from one of our people in the nose which has never happened uh you know that's fine the point is
[56:56.200 --> 56:59.560]  we're going to exercise these rights we're going to sit at the front of the bus if we want to we're
[56:59.560 --> 57:04.360]  going to eat the lunch counters we want to we're going to vote if we want to this is the real cutting
[57:04.360 --> 57:09.480]  edge of the civil rights movement leon exactly and that's what we just want to educate everyone out
[57:09.480 --> 57:14.600]  here that we are doing this for them so they whether they agree with it or not we are fighting for
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.680]  their freedom that's right their liberty the march is about to begin leon walk over to the police if
[57:18.680 --> 57:24.040]  you can right now uh and uh get us some shots that will come back from break maybe talk to them

[57:32.840 --> 57:39.000]  that'd be good because i want to see that where are they losing my feet i can't see them are they
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.200]  just waiting over there or what's going to go on here i can't tell them they're just waiting over

[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:48.280]  like about a hundred now more people are showing up have met saturday i had the idea to have an
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.440]  open carry march and turned out they were already doing one saturday this coming saturday i said
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.800]  well i'll do another one on wednesday we started promoting it monday night not a hundred people
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.040]  out there open carrying when bloomberg was down here basically saying band guns band free speech
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.480]  don't let folks promote the second amendment on facebook they already tried to censor people
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.080]  really these are authoritarian dirtbags who have their own bodyguards and so leon is out there and
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.240]  they've got a shot of the crowd of about a hundred people that are getting ready to march right into
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.440]  the heart of the trendies and jacarys internet connection with their phones not working too

[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.640]  beginning uh well right now justin is giving them all of the safety precautions there to just make
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.840]  sure everyone's on the same page everyone knows what's happening here what the what the aim here
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.880]  is with this march um to just kind of reeducate and let people know that there's no reason for them
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.720]  to fear these legal gun owners jacarys what's your take well i'm just glad people came out here and
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.360]  we have a crowd of about i guess about 50 people now now do want to be clear to the people who aren't
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.840]  aware i think it's more than regulations we're working with come and take it austin so their
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.840]  safety regulations they want everybody to come out here if you're armed to have your rifle
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.560]  pointed down or your long gun pointed down with a strap also if you're carrying a black powder
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.080]  pistol have your pistol holstered and we're near the capital texas dps does not like open carriers
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.960]  on capital grounds which is a bunch of bull but they will arrest you illegally come to this area
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.520]  do not step on capital grounds we're at 12th and san jacinto but just make sure that you do not walk
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.840]  on capital grounds absolutely great point let's march over talk to those cops briefly
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.360]  in this short segment we're going to come back and the march is going to kick off officially
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:35.640]  led by the great texians who are again there to counter the reeducation where they're trying
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.280]  to demonize guns and make people think they're all illegal they're not illegal and we will openly
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.760]  carry them used to people carried their guns in their rifle racks but the cops keep pulling you over
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.600]  so that extincted that legal behavior we have to take these god-given rights back
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.920]  well let's go back to the feed they're approaching uh the specialized citizens who are been hired by
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.880]  us to supposedly be our guardians the austin police which on average are pretty good cops
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.120]  so we'll see how they act when we try to talk to them go ahead jacari accidentfallwars.com

[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.480]  talk to you on average they're not arrogant and the people like the police a lot better in this
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:36.840]  town than a lot of other cities most areas of the country you'd be screamed at right there uh and
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.000]  because some cops think they live in north korea they really don't and that's what the feds want
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.880]  they want that imperious attitude that is not happening in austin texas very refreshing ha lianna
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.240]  jakari very very refreshing actually talking to us like we're human beings and most departments
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.440]  that cop would get fired for daring to talk to a slave but uh he wants his second amendment too

[01:08:52.760 --> 01:09:03.080]  congress all right kids was just explaining to me that there was there's quite a few news stations
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.920]  out here that are covering this but we had to drive one of them off because they were apparently
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.760]  trying to do a hit piece or something we have a man right here that saw the whole thing would you
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:16.760]  like what happened yeah journalists came up to me and and wanted to know he declared why do you
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.320]  have this rifle what does this represent and i said it represents human liberty and to him that
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.040]  wasn't good enough he wanted to have the title section code whatever whatever law allowed me and
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:32.520]  i wanted to make it very clear to him that our bill of rights enumerates our rights this this
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.840]  isn't an agreement with the government where they allow us rights this is no not only do we
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.480]  have these rights you're not going to take them uh but it was a hit piece i did call me
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.480]  old journalist eventually he tried to run behind the reporters and i told him to speak up stop
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.680]  speaking underneath his breath and sound so snarky these people are your friends he ran away
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.400]  so listen good job guys interview everybody at the end of the march get at the head of that
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.480]  march lian come on you and jacari i want to see this history we can't get we don't want to get
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.360]  out over jaywalking now walking against the uh you saw what happened here a couple weeks ago
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.840]  to that poor girl jacari jackson's up there you guys getting feet that's right they'll tackle
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.960]  you they didn't really tackle her they just the point is is that is that the march has begun to
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.440]  take our rights back right you don't exercise does not exist and this is so exciting i mean i
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.520]  would have been happy if 10 people showed up just have a little mini march to get the media
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.880]  coverage kicked off now guys when you talk to the media the key here is to explain this is texan
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.400]  saying no to bloomberg's plan to not just try to ban the second amendment but to try to go after
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.600]  the first amendment the mayors have quit and gone public over 50 of them from his group of mayors
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:47.080]  against freedom i mean mayors against illegal guns and they have uh said they're in the meetings the
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.200]  plan is to ban the guns well of course and they had selectmen uh go public who were in the group
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.720]  in new york and released the document that the plan is to register and then confiscate
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.240]  so it's all about exposing the plan is really to confiscate his mayor proteam
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.800]  mike martine has admitted last year and to plug the big march that's happening saturday
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:11.240]  if 100 people or 75 showed up today looks like about 100 to me if 75 to 100 people showed up
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:16.120]  today with really no promotion saturday 11 30 san jasen and congress this is happening all over
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:22.200]  the country there's all sorts of national marches regional marches going on we are never going to
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:27.720]  stop we are never going to back down we are going to continue to exercise these rights
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.840]  leon macadoo uh so so you know that's key when you guys talk to the establishment media to let
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:41.480]  them know that this is organic resistance to tyranny and that in the past if one guy was walking
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.880]  around with a gun over his shoulder they would arrest him we need to get people acclimated
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.160]  they've desensitized people to liberty they you know they've gotten more people don't want liberty
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:57.000]  we're here to show people and psychologically inoculate them that the second amendment is good
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.040]  not dirty not bad because that's what the attorney general said years ago to the media
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:07.160]  eric holder he said on c span you need to demonize guns need to brainwash the public against him
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.120]  in the hands of citizens well look everybody needs to be able to be armed if they want to be
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.160]  it's not feminist to teach women not to ever use a gun or not protect themselves or to vomit urinate
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.600]  or poop on people which is what the the democrats literally teach women to vomit or pee on people
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.480]  if they try to rape them no you you you pull out your handgun and you shoot them five times in the
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:33.960]  chest if somebody's assaulting you i mean you know that's what that's that's real feminism and and
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.600]  i'll tell you what real feminism is it's strong women with strong families with strong culture
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.120]  they're destroying our culture we want to arm women we want to arm minorities so they're so
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:49.560]  their inner cities aren't hell pits of disarmament like chicago and new york we want to arm everyone
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.320]  and what i love about this event is all the hispanics and black folks that are out there
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.840]  they hate the tea party that's why they say it's racist that's why they say gun groups
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.240]  are the new clan even though program was started to stop the clan the nr a was started to stop the
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.920]  clan and i just love the fact that everywhere real liberty groups the transcend party have everybody
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.920]  together who are unified by red blood and liberty thinking the same thoughts of freedom wanting their
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.560]  children to be free coming together with a true brotherhood true sisterhood true kinsmanship the
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:26.280]  things that people are really hungry for unifying ourselves into a tribe of freedom a 1776 culture
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:34.120]  of manhood and feminine power and strength and honor and true wild human potential that's what
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:39.720]  liberty is all about that is the animating contest jacari jackson leon macadoo any comments
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.280]  well talk about an organic march i think yesterday when we spoke with justin there was about 19
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:54.680]  people that rsd peed and now there are clearly about 100 plus out here in just less than 24 hours
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:02.200]  we've definitely mobilized the troops and this is on a whimsy we're not together and then saturday i
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:08.360]  predictably 500 to a thousand we had 1500 and san antonio and i guess i better come out there saturday
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.040]  and uh all of those groups together and you know quite frankly today i shot probably i don't know
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.240]  75 rounds of 50 cal yesterday and my problem is if i lay down prone and shoot it doesn't hurt my lower
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:27.160]  back but if i stand up and hand shoot it or stand up on a fence post shooting it from a from from
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.400]  physician it blows my lower back out they're gonna have to like wheel me around here in a
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:37.960]  wheelbarrow pretty soon but uh if i'm able to walk on saturday i'll i'll be out there literally folks
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.200]  at my lower back i've now learned i've got to only shoot 50 cal's prone uh and i can't hand
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.280]  shoot them anymore because it doesn't hurt my shoulder it blows my lower back out i mean i've
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:56.040]  got like swelling in my lower back but uh you you can rebuild me better stronger faster a better
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:01.880]  texas hillbilly oh my gosh i'm thank god i'm a hillbilly from texas uh let's thank god i'm not
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.040]  one of these android brainwash people glow in the dark folks that don't even know how to tie their
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:13.480]  shoelaces and are so soft anyways getting back to what i was saying uh it is the barbarian trail
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:21.080]  blazing spirit that brought leaf ericson to the new world 600 700 years before christopher columbus
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.080]  and it's going to be that same spirit of human potential that will lead us to the stars folks
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:29.640]  not the nanny state not the dehumanizing forces are they're kind of stopping in front of the
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.160]  capital now then i guess they're going to march the key i know they're going to do this is to
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.960]  march into south by southwest in and around the trendies so they're going to flip out lean and
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.360]  go talk to jacari because i want to find out i mean they can lead to march wherever they want but i
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:48.280]  i maybe talk to the media but strategy here we need to march down congress and down to sixth street
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:53.000]  down to second street what's happening where's the route today well the route will be going
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.880]  down congress we're going to be in the south by south by southwest area but we're going to start
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.960]  going straight down congress right after we finish this uh this group photo here maybe we'll get a
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:08.920]  shot of all these patriots out here exercising their second amendment leave them in 1776 worldwide

[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:46.440]  bear her guns trying to avoid getting that on camera for not supposed to have your headlights
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:55.320]  on during the day exactly that's wasting energy so frivolous frivolous exploit demonstration
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.080]  i'm joking hey that's that's legal here in austin you know i know i hear you better fight
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:03.560]  for those rights yeah because it's not about liberal conservative it's about freedom exactly
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.840]  that is quite barbarian actually a woman running around topples with a gun i mean that's and she's
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:17.400]  she's rolling with us her sign says more guns and more more boobies hard family show leon

[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:24.200]  agree with firearms for self-defense well i think that the only people who are very responsible
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:31.400]  should have guns my father had guns and he went hunting but he never used them for anything except
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:37.560]  hunting he didn't even think of them for self-defense bring up offense the point is is that

[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:14.440]  network all right i can see personally in live feeds upwards of eight different mainstream media
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:20.440]  tv cameras down there so the mission's already a success with the open carry to take over south
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:26.520]  by southwest politically and not let bloomberg come to our house texas and try to ban free speech
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.320]  as well as second amendment i mean they've gone to facebook and are gonna like not let under 18s
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.080]  even see gun sites gonna put in the same category as porn and start banning pro gun memes and stuff
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:43.960]  this is insane so we'll just intensify our info war 10 times that we're already winning culturally
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.240]  by the way there's an article on info wars dot com college group bans white people from diversity
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.160]  happy hour this space is not for white people and that's happening all over the country whites
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.520]  are being told they're not welcome and of course they really want to be there because they hate
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.360]  themselves and have been taught that they are the devil so now they're threatening you know
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:07.800]  discrimination suits and stuff like that this is what they've done saying anybody that's pro gun
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:14.920]  hates black people that has no place in reality but nsnbc says it on a weekly basis so that black
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.840]  folks won't become pro second amendment i mean why shouldn't they be that they need guns like anybody
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:24.120]  else good people need guns why are you bad and can't have a gun why is it all the black cities
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.320]  that have gun bans so then only the criminals have it i mean this has all been thought out folks because
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.160]  the democrats of the party of the clan they weren't going to let black people ever have guns folks
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.120]  that's what it comes down to and and i just love seeing a lot of black folks and hispanics and people
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.240]  out there wanting their second amendment because that's what this is all about and a lot of black
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.480]  folks i talked to i've done like rob redding's big syndicated show and others and they really don't
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.240]  believe that tea party would welcome them to come to an event they really think there's a bunch of
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.320]  people that hate them there and i'm sure there might be somebody in a tea party event and like
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.400]  black people or vice versa but there's black people don't like white people look at the knockout game
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.680]  i don't didn't see every black person out there and think they hate me and want to knock me out
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.880]  and if i'm in an alleyway and some white guy looks like a thug and starts coming up i'm gonna
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.480]  get ready but some black guy looks like a thug comes up i'm gonna get ready but i mean because
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:20.440]  they act like thugs not because they're black or white um continuing here with jacari jackson

[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.680]  um i think it's every woman's individual choice so she wants to carry it's her right to do so
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:23.400]  so i think it's very safe very safe i just love women with guns i mean i just i want to be empowered
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.200]  we want women to be empowered guys very much are tell us what you're carrying today i'm carrying
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:36.040]  air 15 um this is an ak-47 it's actually a friend of mine it's beautiful it's gorgeous this uh

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.800]  yeah but bloomberg says he has 15 bodyguards yeah you know so you guys see uh all these people out
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:51.400]  here but a lot of these politicians who want to take your gun right away they have bodyguards
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.800]  at their arm you know mayor bloomberg you know he has 15 bodyguards but he doesn't want you guys
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.560]  to be able to talk to the lady in the polka dot dress i mean that's that's the feminist don't like

[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.280]  defense because when moments counts police are only moment our only minutes away not believe the
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.840]  saying goes now of course we have our armed escort today but it's not like this all the time and if

[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.760]  malaysian flight and a lot of other breaking news looks like a gas main explosion there in
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:48.040]  harlem two dead hundreds wounded sarah prayers for those folks thank god it wasn't some type of terror
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.240]  attack i remember back when uh clinton was in office and the monoclonal whiskey thing was going
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.680]  on and drudge was breaking that there were all these other women that he was settling with who
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.680]  said that he had like bit them and slapped them around and raped them other women that said he
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.600]  had groped them done all these different things but most of them didn't have the courage you know
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:10.200]  to go public some people that had documented it got got beaten up got hurt got their legs broken
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:16.040]  that came out in different films like the clinton chronicles but target caught in the crosshairs of
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:24.440]  bill and hillary clinton cathleen willie she was a white house aide who in 1998 alleged on 60 minutes
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.080]  that bill clinton had sexually assaulted her in 93 during his first time as president she had been
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.920]  subpoenaed to verify and testify in the paul jones sexual harassment case where he perjured himself
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:41.240]  obviously according to willie during a meeting in the private study the oval offices clinton had
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.480]  basically jumped on her and of course she got away you know it was still traumatic but i mean
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:51.480]  clinton reportedly settled stuff that was vicious and the issue is we've seen bill mar and others
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.440]  come out and say oh don't touch that that makes hillary look like a victim no it doesn't hillary's
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:02.680]  a predator in a political marriage and that you know the whole issue is we're sick of the clintons
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:09.560]  and she joins us now to talk about her experience with her clinton and what it's like the deja vu of
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:15.800]  two clinton terms co-president hillary now obama's like a third and fourth clinton term if hillary
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:22.440]  runs and wins a a fifth sixth dynasty i mean why not have i mean jeb bush i mean they're talking
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.600]  about running i mean can we just get away from these two families but with the clintons it's really bad
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:32.440]  so plus she's been persecuted by them what does it like to know that they just never get out of power
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.960]  kathleen thanks for coming on oh you're welcome glad to be here why don't you recap for folks that
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:42.200]  don't remember the lore of the nineties all the things that happened what you went through other
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:49.000]  women and then what it's like for you well it's been an interesting journey a lot of it
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.160]  didn't didn't make a whole lot of sense to me but the um the reality of what happened to me is that
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:03.400]  during a family crisis um a financial crisis i went to see the president i was i was um working
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:08.840]  there at that time and i asked him for a job i was a volunteer at that point and i just went to
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.160]  him as a friend he was a friend of both of ours we raised a lot of money for him and i just said
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:20.920]  i've got a crisis and i need help and i i can't be a volunteer anymore and he has the reputation of
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.960]  of picking women who are vulnerable for it he's really good at it and i was i was that day i was
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:34.520]  upset i was crying you know i couldn't get answers from anybody and that's when he you know that's
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:40.920]  when he jumped on me and it got pretty it got well let's just say i was surprised and it was
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:46.680]  unwelcome and i really don't want to go into all the details of it it's in my book i've told it a
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:52.680]  lot but anyway um when i got home i found that my my husband had taken his own life that day
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:59.320]  because of this crisis so you know it's been a long long journey here but the thing that bothers
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:05.000]  me about all this and the reason that i came out here recently is because Hillary Clinton is going
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.520]  to run on women's issues that's it right there it's all going to be all about women and and
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:20.440]  these supposedly the bogus war on women charge of the republicans and all i can say is Hillary
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:27.240]  Clinton is the war on women because what she's done over all these years is enable his behavior
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:33.960]  it hasn't it's never stopped she never insisted that they get counseling or any of it she just put
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:41.640]  up with it and and basically the way she handled it was to go after the women who happened to cross
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:47.240]  paths with him mostly innocent women in the wrong place at the wrong time and it was serious and
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:54.360]  we're not all lying it's all the same thing we were terrified and um i just don't see how
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:00.440]  she can claim to be a woman's advocate when she everybody when she's doing what she's doing here
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:08.120]  and it continues she goes after the women and i just think a lot of there are a lot of young people
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:14.920]  now who really don't remember that if that's far you know 20 years ago 15 years ago who just think
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:20.520]  that it would really be cool to vote for the first woman president and they don't know the issues
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:27.160]  they want one another issues they just want to go into the voting booth and and push yes it's all
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.960]  about being trendy and and i remember because i was on radio and tv at the time back in the mid 90s
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.600]  right through your case in 98 when you went public backing up all these other women they were
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:40.920]  persecuting who he'd raped and you named it i mean he settled the cases biting them on the
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:46.280]  lip while he does it i mean that's real ted bundy you know type psycho uh type behavior is that all
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:52.680]  the feminists came out the diane feinstein's and others uh and the gloria steinams and others and
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.520]  and we're backing bill clinton up and saying what a great guy he is and then now senator ran paul
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.520]  has come out about your case and others and of course your book target caught in the crosshairs
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.160]  of uh bill and hillary clinton available at worldnet daily dot com excellent book to give to women
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:15.400]  to show them that the democratic party establishment so-called feminism uh is is uh under the clinton's
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:22.040]  is a certified uh fraud in my view and it's just so disgusting oh what do you make of ran paul saying
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.000]  hey you know bill clinton has no right to be out raising money for the democrats as their biggest
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.880]  earner and it's shameful that no one will call him on this from the republican party of the
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.680]  democratic party what do you have to say about senator ran paul i i i don't think it was out
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:42.520]  of bounds at all but the democrats and and some of the women's groups are trying to do is basically
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:52.600]  basically um there people like us are are being attacked um but all i'm saying is that ran paul
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:59.000]  i think he had the right to ask that question it's not about anymore it's not about these other
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.640]  issues about what just happened to these women it's about hillary setting in putting in place
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.840]  all of these terror campaigns about all these for these women to get rid of them that's what
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.440]  it's about i don't want to dredge up all of that storted stuff nobody does but we need to we need
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.880]  to because he settled cases where you know he gets the women starts choking them bites them
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.600]  like a pit bull to hold them down while he rapes them i mean you i guess you got away before he
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.680]  got to that's pardon me if he said she said but i can tell you right now we're all telling the truth
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:38.120]  especially why i need a project she's a friend of mine she's told me the story what he did to her
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:44.360]  and let me tell you something this woman is not lying and i have a lot of admiration for her
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.960]  for finally going on and telling her story and nobody blinks and the women's groups well the
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:55.480]  only good thing that came out of that is it would lead out of them they're about one thing and one
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:01.720]  thing only and that's abortion you know where are they now but look at it this way what was
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.840]  happening to me all the what was happening to me all that time and i should have been able to go to
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:12.760]  uh to women it now all the feminist groups and all the ask for help because what you know but what
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:18.520]  they were doing to me on that on that one issue but they were nowhere to be found they still aren't
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:25.640]  you can't find them anywhere and like i said it's about the feminism right now is about one
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:33.080]  single thing and that's abortion that's it period it's just not useful anymore it is not well that's
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:41.240]  it it's it's all population reduction and that's the democratic party i know it is but um i just i
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.640]  just don't see how that can not be an issue here and because they're all going to try to say think
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.960]  like i said before we don't need to drag all that stuff all that story i agree but you know what
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:58.920]  they're the ones who keep bringing up they need to go away because they're the ones
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:05.480]  who insist on being on the public stage here every day you're going to always hear something
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.920]  about all the stuff that's been going on with these women every single day while she if she's
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:17.240]  president it's always going to be in comma you know this is this what happened and the thing
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:24.200]  of it is that people just need to understand what this woman's about they need to read about her
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.640]  sure and listen to the story i would vote for a woman and have voted for women that are pro
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.560]  constitution pro bill of rights that are libertarian i don't care about political party if they're
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.320]  pro freedom and i think that they want justice and that there are people that aren't crooks i
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:41.800]  would support a woman a man a black person a white person i don't care it's about the content
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.600]  of their minds their deeds as martin with the king said but under obama you can't criticize
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:50.840]  any of his corruption any of the bad stuff he's done all the scams they've run obama care of the
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:56.120]  lying because he's black and they say well you know his approval ratings down because of racist
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:02.360]  and it's the same thing imagine if hillary gets in if you criticize anything she's doing
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:09.160]  you're against women it's this mindless gang mentality and i think if she runs again you know
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.320]  you're going to have a lot of women line up from her and you'll go from the gimmick of the black
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:18.440]  president the gimmick to the woman president and we really want the first female american president
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:24.680]  to be hillary clinton with cattle gate futures and all the murders and vince foster and all her
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:29.720]  girlfriends and i mean i mean maybe she'll divorce clinton show that we'll have a first lady with the
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:34.120]  lady president and i mean maybe that'll be the gimmick you know she can like have gulags for
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:38.520]  gun owners but she'll be kissing her wife on television so it'll be okay you know i don't
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:44.280]  want to get graphic here but you know we know all our girlfriends i mean it's not good point
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.920]  that's one of the reasons that you know there are plenty of women out there who are more qualified
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:55.080]  frankly can you tell me anything that hillary's done except having a really good way of writing the
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:00.760]  men's coattails to get to where she wants to get what has she done what has she done it makes
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:05.000]  well she got thrown off the watergate commission for producing fake documents i mean she's a criminal
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:11.960]  and let's go back to vangossi okay that doesn't make a difference here i mean all all of these
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:18.920]  things i mean she is not we do not we don't deserve her as a president i mean she's an
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:26.200]  absolute gangster and i'm sick of looking at her that's my point well she was the first one
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:32.440]  way back when you're two for the price of one and the and the co-president well you know what
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:39.320]  she kind of got you know the co-presidency down it's time for these people just to go away just
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:45.400]  for the country's sake just go out with a little bit of honor instead of dredging up all of these
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:51.000]  things that are going to be dredged up every single day when she runs and when she's in office
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.040]  give us a break just be honorable do the right thing retire you know book a couple of appointment
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:04.680]  um speeches you know a couple times a year so they get their egos all you know taken care of
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:11.240]  and just go be seen your statement for that move that matter and let's just put it to rest you had
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:16.200]  your turn you screwed up we're sick of the sorted stories because that's all we're gonna hear that's
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:22.600]  right i mean it's all we're gonna hear and they're the ones who just won't exit stage left that's it
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.760]  that's right and and with all this baggage it's time for the clinton's to go and look i don't
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:31.320]  romanticize the republican party but the real liberty tea party movement is real both political
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:36.440]  parties are scared of it they're winning races and primaries everywhere it begins g.o.p wins
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:41.960]  florida congressional seat first place obama care was implemented clinton's push doesn't save
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.800]  flashback race dims can't afford to lose axl rod explains that's all up on drudgereport.com
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:55.000]  it is all over the place the backlash against the democrats right now and they're and the
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.360]  democrats should be running from the clinton's and running from obama but i guess they think
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.800]  electronic voting machines and illegal aliens voting uh are going to save them as they hand out
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:09.800]  driver's license coast to coast so the people can vote illegally uh but i just don't see that
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.800]  happening we need to balance the power we don't need one political party running everything
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:21.720]  and i think 2014 is the year unless obama starts a war or some distraction that we could see
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.680]  the republicans sweep the house and the senate and a bunch of governorships and state houses and
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.360]  then if the tea party keeps the pressure on them we could cut taxes reverse a bunch of the tyranny
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.520]  cut the defense spending cut the welfare get out of some of the derivatives because if they don't
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:42.360]  right the ship wall street needs to even know this they're gonna wreck the golden goose clowered
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.560]  and piven run this country over an edge of a cliff which is what the kleptocratic hardcore
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:54.360]  collectivist uh want and i mean does the establishment really want to wreck the empire
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:00.760]  just so they can settle their scores with veterans and gun owners so a bunch of leftists
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:05.080]  that fill up the new world order can have their way with their political uh enemies i mean and
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:09.000]  that's really what's going on here and that's why there's a good chance we can beat them
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.120]  because even the establishment doesn't like what's going on large sections of it and if the
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:20.920]  establishment who's not purely kleptocratic i know will will ally itself with the grassroots
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:25.400]  and and populism we could fire this country up and reverse what's happening and it starts
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:33.400]  with destroying the clintons well and it starts now right now i agree with you 100 and it needs
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:40.360]  to be done right just don't cave to these threats of you know calling being called a right uh
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:47.960]  sexism i was called that last week i was called a misogynist sexist you're against women because
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:54.200]  you don't worship hillary exactly right you know look what she said about monica but she said oh
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:48:00.840]  she's a narcissistic loony to that one how would she like it if somebody called said that about
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.880]  chelsea okay if she got none just kind of the predicament that's going on now how would she
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.800]  like it if somebody out there called hillary those kinds of names i mean that's a that's a point
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:17.560]  they just they have no honor that's all it's just that simple did you see today's news
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:23.160]  who Clinton's going to be out campaigning for now well remember her saying in Benghazi what
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:27.960]  difference does it make what difference does it make i mean the arrogance of this person
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.360]  she's detestable i'll tell you what differences it makes we don't need them anymore we don't
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:38.920]  want them anymore they just need to go away that's all that's you know if they love this country and
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.320]  they want to make this country better the best they can do is just get out because we're sticking
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:49.080]  here in all the stories you know if he's still fooling around and you know each year isn't she
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:54.200]  all of it you know just go away because briefly i mean i know it's in the book that people should
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:59.160]  should get the book and read it but and we're going to play this hillary clinton uh video here
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:04.600]  in a moment but first off and again we're talking to the author of target caught in the crosshairs
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:11.960]  of bill and hillary clinton cathleen wiley uh willie i'm trying to understand here because
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:16.200]  i remember all these stories and him settling the cases i mean tell folks what some of these
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.240]  women told you bill clinton does to him i know you don't like to bring this stuff up because it
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.280]  sounds really horrible and there's kids listening to them all or she said you know women who um he
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:29.400]  knows he could take advantage of i mean he's a good he's a predator he's good at what he does
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:37.080]  he's good at sizing these women up that's that's his stick that's what he does and his idea is just
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:42.120]  get whatever he wants from them because nobody's going to believe them if they try to tell this
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:49.320]  story that's exactly what he does and it's the same thing you know it's just it's sexual harassment
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:55.800]  and and the same thing happened oh we're not all lying i mean our homes were broken into
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:01.480]  my animals went missing my car was vandalized i mean all these kinds of things that he was but
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:07.880]  he was orchestrating now let's give hillary some fair time uh FCC rules fairness doctrine
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.720]  let's hear from her for a moment this is how she counters and they they didn't know that with all
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:17.400]  due respect the fact is we had four dead americans was it because of a protest or was it because of
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.760]  guys out for a walk one night or decided they'd go kill some americans what difference at this point
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:28.280]  does it make it is our job to figure out what happened okay everything we she's been covering
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:33.400]  it up we know they sent those guys over there to do a fake kidnapping it was the Benghazi
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.880]  security by the state department al qaeda funded and navy seals fired back on them so they went
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:41.400]  ahead and threw a fit and killed everybody and then got all the missiles that were in the warehouse
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.440]  they wanted to act like that the missiles just got into their hands by accident but then when
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.920]  people fought back who didn't get the script they had to kill everybody that's what happened
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:55.080]  and that's why you ordered an eight-hour stand down which you killed those people you murdered
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.400]  them hillary definitely will he stay with us we'll be right back hillary clinton murdered it

[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:32.120]  amendment in the right to bear arms oh you know i'm i'm on the clock i'm probably gonna
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:36.280]  plead the fifth on any of that okay she's gonna plead the fifth at least she knows one of her
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:41.160]  rights which is very good well we'll continue on we're moving down to the robot briefly that that's
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:47.400]  interesting ask the robot if we will be assimilated okay if i could ask you one final question miss
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:55.080]  do you think uh the human population will be assimilated i hope not okay good good jacari i
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:59.000]  think she likes you now listen let's go back to her ask her her name that wouldn't that wouldn't be
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.440]  too bad exactly get her to tell us about the robot okay about your kiosk your kiosk that's
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:09.400]  rolling away right here i'll try to keep it steady uh what's the kiosk about so yeah it's called a
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:15.160]  beam and it's a remote presence device and it's designed to allow a person to be two places at
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:19.960]  once so like i said i'm in canva city but i'm completely controlling this device from my desk
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:25.560]  here i've got just a regular webcam and i'm controlling it using the arrow keys on my keyboard
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:30.360]  by the way i'm thinking about moving out of austin and broadcasting them somewhere
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:35.320]  i can have one of these roll around and gripe at people that actually i could have little
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.600]  dollocks in multiple offices call people into the conference room and fire them over the robot i'm
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:46.360]  joking i'm telling you i actually may want to buy one of those because uh jacari would you like it
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:51.240]  if i worked from home and the robot came in and i talked to you over that i don't think you would

[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:21.160]  all right listen look jacari let me tell you what i found out again i went out with the cast of uh
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.040]  silicon valley with mike judge yesterday and a lot of these people had never shot guns they were
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.880]  from california and they were literally getting excited and were being possessed by the spirit
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:39.480]  of redneck 1776 well you remember uh when you're you're uh vanquished uh foe pierce morgan wouldn't
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:43.400]  shot the machine guns he looked quite happy when he was shooting all his machine guns we were sent
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:49.320]  the raw high-def footage and audio but my lawyers looked at it and we decided not to go with it uh
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.000]  even though we probably could have gotten away with it it just it but it was pierce morgan saying i
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.280]  want some of these i want to move to texas i want guns after because you know they have full
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:04.200]  surveillance in that gun range publicly for everybody's security as they say uh and yeah we
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:09.080]  have high def of pierce morgan we have the whole thing we have when i walk out they go we admit
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:13.640]  you have the highest ratings ever when you were on but the higher ups don't want you on we only use
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.440]  what i was allowed to shoot on my iphone where he knew i was taping but no we have the high def of it
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:23.160]  it's all back there on rob jacobson's computer uh of pierce morgan showing the fact that he really
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:27.640]  wants guns and then he's nothing but a hired mercenary he has arm guards at his house guys
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.760]  he lives in a gated community went there and exposed that he had the firearms the arm security
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:37.400]  to respond to his home yeah yeah so he lives behind armored gates with arm security and has
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:41.560]  arm security and you know that's fine you know i've been at charlie sheen's house he's got arm
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:46.920]  security you know the whole point is is that don't take my guns away you know not everybody has the
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:51.480]  money to have arm security at their house charlie that's right i don't i definitely don't i sure don't
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:58.360]  yeah so we're we're actually uh at the convention center now alex it's a little light out here as
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  far as the crowd i'm a little surprised we came out here a couple days ago for the snowden deal

[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:26.440]  about mary bloomberg and his attacks on the not only the second amendment but the first amendment

[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:41.720]  when god only knows where all he got it but he's using that money to try to take away people's freedoms
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:46.840]  which to me is just outright bizarre yes well it's not bizarre it's pretty it's pretty standard
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:50.840]  for people to want you to be disarmed and not have your free speech while they themselves
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:54.440]  enjoyed those same things like we see made bloomberg he has multiple bodyguards and when he was
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:58.280]  approached by a journalist and the journalist asked him sir would you disarm your bodyguards he said
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:02.520]  uh i'll get back to you on that yeah i get back to you on that yeah i i would like to see him
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:06.680]  disarm his bodyguards and then come back and try to take everybody else's guns the chances are
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:12.440]  somebody with a gun would be protecting his sorry backside yeah all right thank you sir well said lord
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.960]  zeta yes so we got some uh some good patriots out here alex some great people we've talked to some
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:21.880]  nice people who are concerned about their rights sir what do you think about all these guys with
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:25.880]  the guns come on in both you guys come on what do you think about these guys with the guns out here
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:32.120]  um it's pretty dangerous it's pretty dangerous yeah uh why would you say that sir um why is it
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:38.120]  pretty dangerous yes and i'm just being sarcastic i do you feel how safe it is out here no i feel
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.480]  pretty safe you feel you need to walk around with the assault weapons yeah but you see we have
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:45.640]  a government of guys people like this uh like this police officer here he has a firearm and
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:51.160]  yeah what do you think about he's a police officer he's he's his job is to serve and protect where
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:55.080]  are you from sir if you don't mind me asking from austin you're from austin tech he's a warrior ant
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.400]  we are a servant ants would you like to see you know people not have firearms what are you what's
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:04.280]  your stance of the second amendment my stance of the second amendment is um i believe people
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.640]  should have firearms but they don't need to be walking around with assault weapons
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:14.600]  now go back to the ding dong ask that ding dong where he's really from where you originally
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:18.520]  from ding dong are you originally from austin texas no i'm originally from east coast east
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:23.160]  jersey new jersey okay oh no wonder we'll go hey listen listen you have the highest crime rates
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:26.920]  there because they restrict the guns dumbass all right sir let me let me compare contrast that
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:31.800]  alex okay so i'm here with this gentleman sir can we see your firearm okay is that scary that
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.080]  little twit before i go to you sir you see this man with this firearm what do you think about
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:41.080]  this man and his firearm what do i think about him yeah you know about him walking around with
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:45.080]  the firearm i like to live under the mafia on the jersey with a big fat governor i don't think
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:49.640]  that this is a unsafe place there's really no need to be walking around the streets with a firearm
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.760]  keep it in your house protect your home you know yeah you don't need to sit at the front of the
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.000]  bus in front everybody is the reason i'd like to clarify this is not an assault rifle it is an
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.080]  automatic rifle so that's one of the common misunderstandings that gets brought up in these
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:06.440]  conversations i tend to disagree with my friend here i think that even though the job of the police
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:11.080]  is to protect and serve they can't be with you all the time you should have the ability to protect
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.760]  yourself your family the courts have ruled the police have no responsibility to protect you
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:19.080]  yourself from a tyrannical government which is going to jail the face trials which only you know
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:23.640]  intended intended for yes sir do you have any comment to what he just said the tyrannical
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:27.160]  government what's what's tyrannical we're walking around here well you have uh the
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:30.840]  police department that has arrested people for jay walking when they fail to identify
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:36.760]  you have uh people being tased and bashed up every authoritarian regime takes the guns hitler took
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:43.480]  the guns it's not encouraging hitler took the guns they arrested a man excuse me they arrested a
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:47.400]  young lady because you failed to identify but you don't have to identify to a police officer if
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:51.640]  you're not under arrest hitler took the guns stolen took the guns tell them sorry government you
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:56.600]  make mistakes okay all right let me ask you this let's talk about some more things you say you know
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:21:00.760]  what's tyrannical about the government you see uh the surveillance measures we have more than 40
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:04.600]  cameras downtown that are filming you you know without your permission are you okay with that
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:08.600]  i'm totally cool with it okay so are you okay with uh the department of fallen men's security
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:12.520]  you're concerned about this gentleman and his guns but the department of fallen men's security has
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:17.400]  bought over one billion bullets but they can't use this gentleman and his gun i just don't think
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:21.880]  that there's a need to bring up history to him chicory about hitler stop okay so when you get
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:27.000]  the stories right so when you hear the stories about disarmament excuse me confiscation leading
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.840]  to disarmament you know there's a lot of talks about how they want you to register your weapons
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:35.640]  so i don't know if they're sure they are they are happening in connecticut okay so when you
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:40.920]  when you have registration that leads to confiscation obama have you seen okay you brought up obama
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:45.560]  let me ask you bro let me ask you bro okay okay you saw him in the debates with mit romney saying
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:49.480]  he wanted to ban assault rifles even though these aren't assault rifles you saw him in the base
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:54.200]  say he wants to ban cheap handguns you have people such as miss diane feinstein who wants to ban
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:58.120]  things for cosmetic features come here come here sir can i take a look at you if we can turn around
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:02.840]  and show this gentleman okay now uh they say to new york they say you can't have this gun because
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:07.160]  of the pistol grip but if you change it to more of a more of a butt socket then that's fine so they're
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:11.720]  trying to ban guns for cosmetic features they're not banning any guns yes they are sir actually
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:16.440]  happening you see yes they are 30 guys no i'm talking about the new york i'm talking about new york
[02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:21.480]  new york we're in texas well that's still a tyrannical number down here five years obama has
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:24.920]  supposedly been banning guns and guess what we're all still walking around because we beat his
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:29.720]  legislation that's good as the legislation fails sir constitution as well the constitution
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:33.720]  protects our right to walk around firearms and you're running around with a firearm and that's
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.680]  and you know the tyrannical government thing there were 300 thousand part of punk that overnight

[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.520]  so gun laws were against black people after the civil war countries being repeated here that has
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:25.800]  nothing to do with history no we're in the united united treaty happens in germany have to do with
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:29.080]  what's happening here we're walking around free well you know those they say the people who don't
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:33.080]  know history are doomed to repeat it so when you see the reason i bring this up you can see these
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.080]  things happen in other countries and when they'll say things are attempted to happen here like you
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:40.360]  said many times they do fail but when they're attempted to happen here you say that has no
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:44.920]  relevance they say lots of things they say for five years obama has been taking our guns
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:49.720]  you just saw 30 people walk by with us that's because he he tried and failed that's because
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:53.960]  we're beating him dumbass excuse me folks i apologize the president has enough hour to just
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:58.760]  go ahead and take obviously doesn't that's i understand what you're saying he's banning importation
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:04.200]  you're creating hysteria about nothing how are we creating hysteria he wants to deny what's happening
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.760]  so he can take over he doesn't that what what is the assault rifle sir nobody's ever gonna take
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:13.960]  those guns there's 300 there's they're now confiscating them in california connecticut new york
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:18.680]  what are you talking about this is texas you keep saying okay all right you said don't bring up
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.360]  no no let me let me let's let's take it all away we're not gonna let the other states fall punk
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.120]  we're not in germany but when i talk about a city in the united states or state united states
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.120]  you say what does that have to do with anything well okay let's talk about austin texas austin
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:34.840]  city councilmember mike martinez said he wanted to make the gun ban legitimate mike martinez is
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:41.080]  one individual he's a big part of mayor's against gun illegal guns do lots of different things that
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:47.960]  okay so here's the deal there's there are too many guns in this country for guns to ever be taken
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.120]  so you guys can there you go say oh they're gonna take this and they're gonna take that
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:57.480]  and that's never gonna happen it's just it's impossible so basically well sir 1776 let me tell
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.640]  you let me tell you at sunnyville california they have banned you know they have banned
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:06.840]  high-capacity magazines you know magazines that hold colorado excellent that's great they probably
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:10.120]  should ban high-capacity but you're saying no i second the guns but they just they're banning
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:16.280]  your your uh your magazines that's that is called making things safer you know what okay now you
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:19.960]  you said nobody you said nobody i'm telling you a city that's happening right now sunnyville
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.040]  california and you're saying that it's not that's a good deal are they taking guns they're moving
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:29.080]  towards it and once again once again hold on bro let me tell you let me tell you bro in uh in new
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.600]  york once again we're going back to the cosmetic features they banned guns based on cosmetic
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:36.200]  features they say you have to turn in your gun destroy it or they can come and get it from you
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.880]  is that not confiscating guns are guns legal in new york yes they are okay not all guns no no no
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:46.440]  they ban most of them in new york city they're banned they're saying if you if you have a firearm
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:52.920]  with a cosmetic feature like the uh the goal is to ban all the guns you take a step to try to make
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:57.560]  things safer okay the immediate assumption no no no no we're not safer when you take our guns
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.960]  jackass you're not taken by safer by changing a cosmetic feature it's like it's safe if you had
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:06.360]  to let me tell you about cosmetic features okay all right i agree with you all right sir we we
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:09.800]  tried a very colorful conversation i gotta catch up with my crew i thank you for being man
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:14.200]  enough to talk to us appreciate you bro all right hey jacari let me say something about that guy he
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:20.040]  is the classic no no so finish up jacari go ahead i say and i disagree with almost everything that
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:23.800]  man just said but i respect him for staying here and dating with us well i've heard a lot of friendly
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:29.640]  things as well but the point is jacari is that that's the classic denial of a fake liberal is that
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.640]  is that they always deny all this stuff's happening but then admit they still want to make us safe
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:37.240]  by restricting the guns you you heard the guy he's like well what what does nazi germy have to
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:40.920]  do with it i'll say okay what about in connecticut what about in new york where they're doing these
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:45.080]  bands where you have to either turn in your rifle uh destroy your rifle or they can come and take it
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.280]  from you he's like well that's new york i was like well okay let's talk about austin texas
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:51.720]  where austin city councilmember mike martinez said he wants to make the gun ban legitimate
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:56.360]  well that's one person so every time we bring up the argument he has some counter argument to uh
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:02.280]  to diminish this and talking about obama uh you know obama said in the debates as i told the gentleman
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:07.640]  that he wants to take away ak-47s he wants to take away things cheap handguns and he also hid behind
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:12.440]  diane feinstein is that he would roll with anything by feinstein says you wanted to do so and
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.640]  essentially he is if not uh supporting the government he's at least content to let diane feinstein take
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.640]  your charge jacari let me ask you this question it looks like from what we've talked to almost
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:25.880]  everybody's pro gun down there except that guy how many people have you i mean what's the percentage
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:30.520]  of people you've talked to that are anti that is the first guy i meant who was blatantly anti gun
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:35.000]  we met some people who were indifferent one way the other but that's the first guy i meant who was
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:39.400]  just blatantly anti gun but i do respect him for standing here and debating with us sure but it was
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:45.400]  it his denial was disgusting though yeah it was it was pretty amazing alex and now i think we've
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:49.160]  actually lost our ground that's all right well we're trying to catch up to these guys here in a
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:56.040]  little bit absolutely we got the feet up there with the leon macadoo um and there she is uh leon
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:01.480]  macadoo give us your take on what's going on it's pretty surprising most people obviously a lot of
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:05.720]  people stopping to take pictures a lot of people trying to find out what we're doing here but most
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.160]  people are pretty impressed and they're like wow welcome to texas and it's like this is actually
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:16.600]  nationwide well leon i think what's happening is that mic that external mic is not activated

[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:42.360]  the days go stronger than the nights i've let go feels like we're running out of time
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:50.920]  yeah it seems much harder to tell it right from block yeah very beautiful words in this song
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:58.120]  don't have some other bands redo it turn up a little bit
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:12.120]  that's why they always want to say they don't want to fight us while they attack us
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:19.960]  standard enemy operations standard military operations
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:27.640]  and that's why they say we're not coming for your guns there's no drones there's no nsa
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:33.800]  there's no tyranny the irs has taken old ladies houses by the thousands this week
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:38.920]  hundreds of thousands every year
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:45.080]  they're taking foster kids doing medical experiments on them and it comes out in the news and nobody
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:50.600]  gets in trouble they're giving kids inoculations that don't protect them and brain damage them on
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:57.400]  record and kill them they are committing so many forms of covert tyranny then they've got
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:01.720]  their minions who are part of the system that guy that jacari talked to i don't think he's an
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:05.880]  evil person or a bad person but he thinks he's part of the power structure because he's a reasonable
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:14.680]  guy he thinks the system is reasonable he is a helpless pathetic weak-minded dangerous jellyfish
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:21.640]  because in this republic he can vote to take my rights away because this republic is no longer a
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:30.760]  republic it is a democracy where two wolves and a sheep can vote on what's for dinner
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:39.080]  now there's been some new developments and i want to get antony gucciardi in here in a
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:43.480]  little while we set that up earlier and i don't know he remembers before the show i told him i
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:49.080]  wanted him to pop in so let's go run around the building and find him as quickly as possible
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:55.320]  because i saw the article up on info wars.com and it reminded me that i wanted him on at 130
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:03.080]  the article is victory connecticut cops suspended after calls for home gun confiscation at first
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:08.680]  they were going to suspend the guy that exposed it now it looks like this is breaking uh because i
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:12.200]  wanted to report on what was happening this morning and now i guess he went and looked into it
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:17.320]  and found that connecticut police officer was suspended this week after vile reports exposed
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:22.440]  his public defense of door to door gun confiscation so they were going to suspend the other people
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:27.800]  involved before telling the truth now they suspended the other guy so that's a really good good good
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:32.600]  news but that's because the system doesn't want to stir everybody up the average cop didn't want
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:37.400]  to confiscate guns and knows that guns and law abiding citizens hands were lower crime you heard
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:43.800]  cops we talked to today in austin uh they don't want to have a debate the politico is above this
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:47.320]  they don't want us to force out the debate the military is being trained to take our guns they
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.240]  don't want to force the debate that special paramilitary police are being trained to confiscate
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:56.200]  guns openly because then there'll be a debate about it i know this is elementary and then we will win
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:01.720]  that's why they have to continue to deny deny what's famous bill clinton quote about when he
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:05.880]  would get caught cheating and stealing and raping he'd say deny deny deny that's like there was a
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:10.680]  tape of it all you do is you just deny deny deny it doesn't matter if they got your video doing it
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:16.760]  you just do not deny deny there's no nsa there's no cylindra there's no ben gazi there's nothing
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:24.200]  going on nothing happened and then he's a swindler he takes 53 percent last time i checked last month
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:29.960]  of the hundreds of millions of dollars his filthy charity brings in for little black kids worldwide
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:35.640]  you know Haiti in places and then he spends it on wide-body jet aircraft fleet basically multiple
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:41.800]  jets lavish apartment complex you know apartments he lives in penthouses and paying for his life
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.040]  i don't have a charity i don't have some kind of political 501c3 i probably should and do like
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:52.520]  the Salvation Army spend 90 percent of it actually on the charity and 10 pay for administrative
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.760]  you don't have to spend you know 40 percent of your money paying to the federal reserve
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:00.440]  wasting money you bring in to fund the operation you got to pay taxes on it like we should set up
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:06.840]  a tax exempt arm and have our books be public because notice the IRS trying to stop libertarian
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:11.960]  groups and patriot groups and pro-life groups from having any tax exemption because if we all go do
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:17.080]  that it's over for them that makes them have 40 percent more money out of the gauge than patriot
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:21.720]  groups because we don't go get tax exemptions we're like oh we're not going to game the system
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:25.880]  like that we've got to ladies and gentlemen i think i'm going to do it i'm going to get with
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:32.600]  the lawyers and create a tax exempt arm why should i get 40 percent of the money comes in here i mean
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:40.840]  when i buy equipment around here i have to pay taxes on it i mean i've had years where i didn't
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:48.280]  pay my shelf last year last year i lost money because i wanted to put into expansion and crew
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.800]  why just put more money in the bank you know i have some money there for backup to fund stuff
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:55.240]  run the place three or four months if we ever got totally you know shut down by something that's not
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:01.560]  very much emergency backup that's like quarter tank you're going on a big road trip but i'm just thinking
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:05.640]  why not play their game because he only they're allowed to really be tax exempt with all their
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:09.560]  operations you imagine if i had some charity that raised enough money to have a jet and i wasn't
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:14.680]  giving it to the little black kids bill clinton could be destroyed with this information the reason
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:23.240]  i bring bill clinton back up is that that criminal with his criminal wife we're going to be hearing
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:28.360]  oh you're against her because she's a woman in a lesbian give me a break what a distraction
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:34.280]  you imagine and a woman being attracted to her i mean she's like a demonic snapping turtle i just
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:39.960]  i don't mean to get off into that i just it's disgusting i mean i would not walk i would run
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:44.920]  from hillary clinton and i don't mean to get off into that i mean it's now reported that she's got
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:49.080]  a string of girlfriends we already knew that and that hillary is even more of a sex-craved addict
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:53.800]  than bill clinton i mean she makes the willful wall street look tame in comparisons with the
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:40:00.760]  reports i've been getting uh so getting serious anthony before we go back on the street with
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:05.720]  jakari jackson and leon macadoo on the second amendment case this story we broke with mckel
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:12.200]  failing three days ago has become viral and is in the connecticut news a lot of stuff's gone back
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:18.280]  and forth in this boil it down quantify it for people your video reports on info wars.com for
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:22.840]  radio listeners exactly so we put out this exclusive report there was a police officer
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:28.200]  from connecticut who went out and reached out to us we contacted him in this exclusive interview
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:33.240]  in a text-based interview at first and he's talking about a police officer in the area
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:38.360]  who said he would do anything pretty much to go and kick down people's doors to confiscate guns
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.440]  that he would like to do it to this guy this guy was actually former navy i'm sorry in the beginning
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:46.840]  who contacted us so he was talking about a local police officer who wanted to confiscate weapons
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:52.040]  and this was after the call in connecticut after sandy hook to actually go around and start you
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:54.760]  know and there's a video of other police and firefighters that say they've talked to the
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:59.160]  same guys yeah so they were saying this is rampant in the police force and that orders from this
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:03.640]  you know top are saying assault weapons are bad and everything and many cops are going into a
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:08.760]  frenzy now blaming gun owners for sandy hook and saying they can't wait to take their guns from
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:12.520]  home to home you know confiscation kicking down doors which is now happening because if you don't
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:18.360]  register they confiscate yes exactly so we did this saying look how insane this is not even
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:23.480]  really promoting it in fact it was my fault michael wrote this story doing a great job and i didn't
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:29.080]  even really promote it and then i wake up the next morning it said 18 000 shares just on facebook
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:33.800]  so it went super major viral like beyond viral that was just on story leak it's even higher on info
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:40.040]  wars and then story leak dot com yeah my website and it's also up on info wars dot com and then
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.040]  i started hearing you know michael was texting me over and over hey the police force is responding
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:48.920]  now officials are responding i'm getting messages you know they're putting him on leave they're
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:55.800]  investigating it all of this from one piece and this is now major national news and it highlights
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:58.520]  not just the fact that he was put on leave that's that's great and everything that's nothing there's
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:01.960]  an internal investigation on this guy but it's not about him at all it's not about attacking
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:07.800]  this individual it's about attacking the attack on our constitution and bill well i mean look
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:11.320]  they want to form an army of cops for gun confiscation a it's unconstitutional
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:17.160]  b it's out of control c man i'm not looking forward to the civil war it's going to start and
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:20.680]  that's what they've geared up for is to go from al-qaeda to patriots but they're going to lose
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:25.480]  it's going to go offensive once they start to fight no because you think about it i mean i don't
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:31.240]  want this i i do i mean literally i'm out of supper saying you better watch it the system
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:36.440]  wants the two chinese or or or sign me fighting fish to kill each other so soros and the globalists
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:41.800]  can come in after the wreckage and reorganize the country that is the plan to make obama
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:47.880]  part two of lincoln i mean they say that we've got to queue up uh from russia to love the
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:53.240]  sign he's fighting fish go ahead i mean guess who's for gun confiscation that spineless weasel
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:56.920]  that jacari talked to you that has no base and anything has no foundation of knowledge
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:00.760]  he's just saying well i think guns are bad those are the kind of people that we don't want them but
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:04.440]  they are taking them for safety he's like well yeah it's double thinking no they don't take them
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:10.120]  we simply do take them well the cop has it that's not a problem we're slaves the cop has it that's
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:13.880]  okay those are the type of people that are for this and no wonder we're beating the back over and
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.640]  over again the real media succeeding this is a message of yeah it's a bunch of cowered chicken
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:22.040]  necks following criminal globalists who are weak don't have moral high ground if we just stand up
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:27.480]  it's over exactly i mean i'm sick of these people i will not be ruled by a bunch of chicken necks come
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:30.360]  and it's like you were saying the real liberals though that aren't like that guy they actually
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.200]  have some foundation they're like no i actually like guns you know second amendment's good that
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:39.240]  guy's a complete weasel and there's so many people like him it's it's actually we've been down there
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:43.960]  myself you and others own reports and you saw jacari one person out of hundreds was anti-gun
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:49.080]  they talked to i mean these are like people going i'm liberal but i bought guns and i like your show
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:54.600]  what does that mean yeah and i go i mean it's literally women men black white oh yeah because
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:44:00.440]  why do i like you yeah who i am they identify because i want freedom because you're not a chicken
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.440]  neck they identify with liberalism because i think it's cool but they're actually on the real
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:07.960]  media side they're on the real third party of reality side they just don't know that because
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:11.880]  they want to be cool with their friends still who are trendy and they want to identify as liberal
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:16.200]  that's basically what it is and they don't like obama but some of their friends think he's cool
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.880]  because he makes funny jokes on television so they think he's funny you know what i mean that's
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:24.600]  more better than those republicans yeah exactly and the republicans are bad people but they'll
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:28.680]  still identify see i'll actually like the second amendment the constitution i actually like liberty
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:33.320]  but oh i'm not no i'm not into any of that weird conservative stuff or any of that uh and the truth
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:37.720]  is if they want to be democrats they should go take the democrats over yeah and make it more like them
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.120]  the truth is the establishment has democrats and republicans under their control the only
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:46.520]  shot we've got is taken over the republican party and we've got a shot at it that's right we are so
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:50.840]  screwed if we don't do that it's going to be civil war maybe not this year maybe 10 years down the
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:55.640]  road maybe five years but i mean it's all the world financial meltdown is starting they're
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.320]  going to try to get the guns before that they can't they're trying to start wars so they have
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:04.440]  the political high ground the people are primitively well i you know after the terrorist hit us obama
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:08.920]  said turn the guns in i guess we had to well it reminds me of the alamo all the people with the
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:13.240]  massive weaponry walking around holding it open carry it was an open carry march in alamo we were
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.560]  about there all those people really nice and willing to talk on camera everything and we're
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:22.280]  really centered and interesting and then we go over to like the three people who were against
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:27.560]  guns the moms against a free to escape all you know guns and they were attacking you the guy was
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.560]  like smacking his wife and telling you to punch him in the face oh they were starting to fight
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:37.800]  only ones there that wanted to confiscate guns the only ones there were running up to you pushing
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:41.640]  you trying to fight us and calling us idiots and yelling and then they always have news articles
[02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:46.840]  that mean alex came and did they came and harassed them when in reality they were trying to fight
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:50.760]  random people wasn't even just us like they were just going up and barking up against people
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.400]  and those only ones that but we had it on video there against violence though and then i thought
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:58.600]  there was more than three people so there's all these big guys behind them and i was like fine
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:02.280]  all of you want to hit me go ahead i'm and i bet you got a gun on you we'd already put the guns
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:06.120]  in the truck i'm like no i don't use it and then i found out those guys were actually our people
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:11.000]  there yeah yeah makes a crazed wife is actually trying to stop me he sees such like smacking her
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.200]  on camera and you're like hey you shouldn't do that he's like yeah i could fight you and she's
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:18.520]  like he could beat you up he's like a 65 year old man we're like hey we don't really want to fight
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:24.040]  you he had to hit me though i was gonna break his nose yeah but we but the thing is that's defense
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:28.680]  this is this is actually a parable because defensively legal firearm someone comes in your
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:33.160]  house starts punching you in the face you know you can use your legal firearm but the criminals
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:37.720]  who are actually the anti-gun people want to use the violence to offensively attack well no look
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:40.840]  how they're running around saying you're at a free speech everywhere exactly and that guy's like
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:46.120]  they're not doing that we don't banning anything trying to ban the word bossy they're not doing
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:51.560]  that they're trying to ban everything they're and people say that's outrageous to have michelle
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:57.160]  obama cannot say we're gonna ban the word bossy people go that's outrageous it's meant to be over
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:00.840]  the top because if they can get away with that exactly if they're at level 10 then they can
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:05.960]  succeed at level eight so basically if they have total insanity they might be able to pass by with
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.680]  crazy so if ban the word bossy is too much well well maybe we should ban you know the word you
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.800]  know not through something like that because everyone hates the word not see you know what i
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:19.080]  mean and then it's like well maybe we should ban the word you know anything it could go it could go
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:24.440]  it's a slippery slippery slope as they would say but it's it's beyond that it's all 1984 style and
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:30.120]  you can see the video right now where this crazed anti-gun guy who wants to confiscate your firearms
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:34.280]  is going to alex randomly because we're over there asking him questions trying to fight him and
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:38.680]  say come on hit me and there's a part it might have passed where the wife tries to stop him he's
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:44.600]  like smacks her away it already showed that yeah that's enough i think that guy's more like 70
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.560]  something because people who are 70 but he was literally trying to get me to hit him i was like
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:53.560]  old people yeah i'm like dude don't hit me man and i actually i i just it's like ridiculous
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:59.880]  and here they are saying they're against violence having some sob story which is horrible whatever
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:04.840]  about the relative dying from something but they were saying oh yeah we're against violence we want
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:10.040]  to take guns now hit me well it's like those women out there today when they're like we're against
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:15.640]  violence of any type and i said what about defensive there's like hunting that's the
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:20.520]  ultimate answer they see they don't have facts or foundations or statistics or logic so instead
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:24.520]  they basically use talking points they heard on cnn like six years ago that they kind of muddily
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:28.440]  remember so they don't really know so when you ask them a question they just use talk like well
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.600]  you you could hunt you know they don't actually know anything if you ask those people in fact
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.240]  jakari should ask them how many people die a year from assault weapons how many people die a year
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:41.240]  from rifles and they're going to say like 10 000 from assault weapons it's like 200 it's like yeah
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:49.480]  it's like 300 now or something like that it depends two percent yeah of crimes uh with guns are with
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:55.400]  assault the dhs put out a memo last year saying off telling the warning the police officers to
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:49:00.280]  stop focusing on mass shootings because there's none of them and that that's all internal yeah
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:05.080]  they know it's a total hoax well the memo came out and we did an article on it it was like 30 people
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:08.520]  a year died from mass shootings on average or less and it's not a big deal they're saying you're
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:13.400]  ignoring thousands from these rapes and homicides it's 167 168 but then almost all those are gang
