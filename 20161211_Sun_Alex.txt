[00:00.000 --> 00:10.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Alex Jones filing an emergency on the road report as I'm driving
[00:10.640 --> 00:14.560]  into the office to get ready for today's radio show, 4-6 p.m.
[00:14.560 --> 00:19.680]  This is the most intense, important alert I've ever put out.
[00:19.680 --> 00:25.640]  I was sure of this last week, I contacted the proper parties, I have run this intel
[00:25.640 --> 00:32.200]  up a lot of important informed flagpoles, and they all concurred that there is a plan,
[00:32.200 --> 00:36.640]  which we now see is quite evident, to try to steal the election from the American people
[00:36.640 --> 00:38.560]  in Donald J. Trump.
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.760]  Now, I'm the fellow that warned everybody they'd try to steal it in the primary.
[00:43.760 --> 00:44.760]  They did it.
[00:44.760 --> 00:47.520]  I'm the fellow that told people Hillary would try to steal it in the general election.
[00:47.520 --> 00:54.320]  She did, but the tsunami election was so big that they failed.
[00:54.320 --> 00:58.680]  Now we've got them with multiple electors saying that they're not going to go for Trump.
[00:58.680 --> 01:04.040]  We had Hillary do these recounts through her surrogate minion Jill Stein, and it only
[01:04.040 --> 01:07.520]  got him hundreds of thousands more votes per state where they did it, showing Hillary
[01:07.520 --> 01:10.880]  had been stealing, proving Trump's point that he had millions of votes that were taken
[01:10.880 --> 01:16.400]  from him with illegals and folks voting in the names of dead people.
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.400]  Now, three weeks ago they come out with this secret intelligence report that Obama talks
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.640]  about and claimed that the Russians were manipulating the election.
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.400]  Now, remember, there was no such thing as election fraud, but we had to have the feds
[01:30.400 --> 01:34.040]  take it over because of the Russian threat.
[01:34.040 --> 01:37.680]  Now, earlier this week the Washington Post came out and said the Russians hacked the
[01:37.680 --> 01:40.560]  election, but then they were forced to come out and say, we have no evidence for that.
[01:40.560 --> 01:41.560]  We just made it up.
[01:41.560 --> 01:44.040]  They had to retract.
[01:44.040 --> 01:45.040]  That was on Wednesday.
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.320]  Then on Thursday, the Obama administration comes out with some fraction or some rogue
[01:52.320 --> 02:02.680]  element of the CIA and says, ladies and gentlemen, we have evidence, but we can't show it to
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.360]  you, that the Russians basically interfered in the election, and then I called everybody
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.600]  and I said, look, I called them on Friday and I called the folks who could imagine I
[02:11.600 --> 02:12.600]  called them.
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.720]  Now, watch, they're going to roll out a bunch of leftist CIA people like Bob Bear, sure
[02:17.720 --> 02:24.320]  enough, he surfaced on Saturday on CNN, and they're going to call for a new election to
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.320]  be held.
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.000]  So everything they're doing is to undermine this landslide because he's appointing a
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.640]  bunch of patriots, a bunch of anti-globalists.
[02:32.640 --> 02:36.080]  They are really, really upset, they're really scared the stock market's up, their security's
[02:36.080 --> 02:40.280]  already acting like a commander in chief before he even gets into office, bringing all these
[02:40.280 --> 02:41.280]  jobs back.
[02:41.280 --> 02:45.160]  At the end of the time, I won't go over all of it, Carrier and the 50 billion from Japan
[02:45.160 --> 02:52.200]  and the 10 billion on New Steel jobs and on and on and on, and confidence is already being
[02:52.200 --> 02:53.200]  way up.
[02:53.200 --> 02:58.160]  So they're panicking, but they're arrogant, and it's the CIA that's become a rogue government,
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.400]  even according to JFK, how Eisenhower said that.
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.200]  It was a CIA only around a few years when Harry Truman said we should have never created
[03:07.200 --> 03:08.200]  it.
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.400]  The National Security Act, the basic operation on its own, is the biggest tallest agency
[03:12.400 --> 03:14.840]  out there.
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.240]  And it's got a whole bunch of different factions, and Obama has his lapdogs that come and give
[03:19.240 --> 03:20.240]  him his briefings.
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.040]  So we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people, he can go pick whoever he wants
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.920]  to listen to, and all these little analyst groups, just like Bush, George W, created
[03:28.920 --> 03:33.840]  the Office of Special Plans inside the Pentagon to make up stuff about W and Bs and Iraq.
[03:33.840 --> 03:36.240]  It's the same story.
[03:36.240 --> 03:40.840]  And you know what, just a different rear end it came out of.
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.400]  So they come out, you can't see the report, but oh my gosh, here it is, and now let's
[03:45.400 --> 03:46.400]  have a new election.
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.320]  Now a lot of people say, oh, Trump has too much support, they won't get away with it.
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.200]  It's not just meant to delegitimize, here's the big red alert.
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.760]  I'm telling you, this is done to trigger COG and other systems where they can try to get
[03:58.760 --> 04:04.840]  quasi-ro groups to believe they've got legal standing to try to basically take out Trump
[04:04.840 --> 04:10.080]  the minute he doesn't accept some call for some new commission to look at it and decide
[04:10.080 --> 04:13.320]  whether, say in six months, there's got to be new elections.
[04:13.320 --> 04:16.720]  They know there's been a counter-cute to try to take the country back.
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.320]  They were afraid that it might be deadlocked and that Scalia would tie-break like 2000
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.120]  and put Trump in so he conveniently died.
[04:23.120 --> 04:24.360]  That was a message.
[04:24.360 --> 04:27.840]  But good people in our intelligence agencies, by the way, the majority of them are awakened,
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.520]  some of the best folks we've got, including inside the CIA, are saying no to all this.
[04:31.520 --> 04:34.360]  And I reached out to some of my contacts, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[04:34.360 --> 04:37.520]  They said, this is not the main CIA.
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.520]  And I've checked with two contacts on that and this is not what's happening.
[04:41.520 --> 04:44.040]  And folks have learned I've got my contacts.
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.600]  I mean, I told you three weeks ago with me, Matt Romney, I told you last week it's going
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.880]  to be Rex Tillerson, you now see if sir Terry State, I've blown smoke here, folks.
[04:52.880 --> 04:57.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am now in studio, got in late working on Intel, sitting
[04:57.400 --> 05:00.520]  that file, they got it up on here, we'll be back with all the details.

[06:13.360 --> 06:24.440]  yes I know it well, another page has turned, are you for real, it's so hard to tell, from
[06:24.440 --> 06:31.920]  the bottom of my heart, it's just a magazine, it is Sunday, 11th of December, 2016, we'll
[06:31.920 --> 06:35.840]  be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday.
[06:35.840 --> 06:41.800]  We are now only 39 days out from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States,
[06:41.800 --> 06:44.800]  Donald J. Trump.
[06:44.800 --> 06:49.880]  And I'm launching a new countdown in the next 39 days until Friday, January 20th, we'll
[06:49.880 --> 06:54.640]  be there in D.C., covering the whole event in the streets.
[06:54.640 --> 06:58.240]  Thank you for joining us, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[06:58.240 --> 07:02.280]  I want to break down the historical context of what's happening, I want to go over the
[07:02.280 --> 07:06.800]  evidence of it, but here's the bottom line, a lot of times when there's already been a
[07:06.800 --> 07:11.600]  coup inside a country by special interest or outside foreign interest, they will go after
[07:11.600 --> 07:15.640]  the nationalists that are exposing their coup by claiming they're working for an outside
[07:15.640 --> 07:21.800]  plot, and that's now been done by the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment.
[07:21.800 --> 07:28.600]  They've been saying for over a year that Donald Trump is a Russian operative, they've been
[07:28.600 --> 07:33.600]  saying Julian Assange is a Russian operative, they've been saying Nigel Farage of UKIP is
[07:33.600 --> 07:37.640]  a Russian operative, they've been saying I'm a Russian operative.
[07:37.640 --> 07:44.080]  On Thursday, on Fox News, a congressman was on the show, and a Democratic congressman,
[07:44.080 --> 07:50.640]  we played the club Friday, and accused Tucker Carlson of actually being a Russian agent
[07:50.640 --> 07:55.760]  with a straight face, of course Carlson's dad was a big anti-communist, ran Voice of
[07:55.760 --> 07:59.560]  America and I'll assure you the guy running the Voice of America wasn't just for the
[07:59.560 --> 08:07.800]  Voice of America, so they are now accusing the sons of famous anti-communists in secret
[08:07.800 --> 08:13.720]  operations of working for the Russians, this is the level we have now reached of absolute
[08:13.720 --> 08:16.960]  absurd garbage.
[08:16.960 --> 08:18.040]  Now why are they doing that?
[08:18.040 --> 08:24.920]  That triggers continuity of government and emergency plan systems that allow, according
[08:24.920 --> 08:30.200]  to this bureaucracy that's hijacked us, this multinational bureaucracy, to imprison, kill
[08:30.200 --> 08:34.640]  whoever they want, to take over the media you name it, and bipartisanly they've passed
[08:34.640 --> 08:40.040]  a bill through the Senate, it was in the House last week, to engage in domestic propaganda
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.080]  and the targeting of what they call domestic propaganda, and the shutting down of what
[08:45.080 --> 08:46.880]  they call domestic propaganda.
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.880]  So the Republican establishment before Trump even gets in, is moving with the Democrats
[08:50.880 --> 08:57.760]  to have a coup d'etat against the legal, lawful election of the American people.
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.000]  Robert Baer, big leftist with the CIA we've interviewed him before, the movie Siriana
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.200]  with another fiction was made about how cool he is, total disinformation in my view, he
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.560]  comes out and says we need to have a new election, Donald Trump stole it with the Russians.
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.720]  Now remember Hillary with Jill Steiner front woman had a recount, in every state they had
[09:19.720 --> 09:25.280]  the recount, hundreds of thousands of votes had been stolen from Trump.
[09:25.280 --> 09:28.800]  He picked up hundreds of thousands, I haven't checked since Friday, it was a couple hundred
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.000]  thousand in Wisconsin, over a hundred thousand in Michigan, they're going as slow as they
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.160]  can, to then say oh we never got it done by the 19th, which is only eight days away
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.120]  to then say oh Trump doesn't get his electoral college votes, they now have not one but two
[09:43.120 --> 09:49.440]  electors saying they're not going to transfer in one state the 15 electors to Trump and
[09:49.440 --> 09:50.840]  another state as well.
[09:50.840 --> 09:55.600]  So they're trying to delegitimize while Trump's up there working making hundreds of calls
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.600]  of data world leaders, getting 50 billion brought in from Japan next year in robotics
[10:00.600 --> 10:06.560]  and other science advances, 10 billion being announced coming back in steel mills, carriers
[10:06.560 --> 10:13.240]  staying, they are busy while the stock market gained a trillion dollars last month, while
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.640]  all this is happening, they're busy trying to sabotage, the fellow reserve is announced,
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.240]  Trump is saying he wants to keep his interest rates low, to spur the economy, he actually
[10:21.240 --> 10:25.160]  agree with that policy, but because he's brought in this exuberance and this conference, they're
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.240]  saying oh we're about to raise them big time, to try to drive the market down and blame him,
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.560]  I'm saying they should be raised moderately, they're talking about big raises, we need
[10:33.560 --> 10:34.560]  to balance.
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is unprecedented, I have all these clips, now I sort of told
[10:38.360 --> 10:44.160]  people last week and I told my sources and people high up, I said I'm looking at the
[10:44.160 --> 10:48.040]  arrogance, I'm looking at Michael Moore, who knew that Trump was way ahead in all the polls
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.640]  internally, who said you watch Trump's going to win, in the landslides, you can't steal
[10:51.640 --> 10:56.440]  a landslide, it's very hard to do, a tsunami will, you'll block most of it, but still some
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.720]  of the wave slaps over and you win.
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.160]  I said you watch, they're putting all of this in question, they're redditing the rioter
[11:05.160 --> 11:08.760]  forces, they've doubled the money they're giving to Black Lives Matter and other liberation
[11:08.760 --> 11:14.400]  theology groups for destabilization, and I said you watch, they're going to just continue
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.320]  to push, they're going to have these electors say because of conscience, they can't follow
[11:18.320 --> 11:26.440]  voters of their states with the electoral numbers that he brings from each state and
[11:26.440 --> 11:29.440]  they're going to double down and say that Trump's a Russian agent.
[11:29.440 --> 11:34.240]  Now just last Wednesday, the Washington Post had to retract a big article claiming that
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.760]  alt-right media and independent media was being run by the Russians, they said our report
[11:37.760 --> 11:40.520]  has no proof, no facts, so that crumbled.
[11:40.520 --> 11:47.520]  Then on Friday, a secret CIA report from the usual suspect, Barack Obama, comes out, now
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.680]  the CIA has hundreds of thousands of employees, millions more operatives, it's just a huge
[11:51.680 --> 11:58.640]  sprawling un-American bureaucracy, shut up, out of the British OSS in 1947, and Harry
[11:58.640 --> 12:03.080]  Truman said I never should have done it, should be torn into pieces, Kennedy said as well,
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.840]  if any group is engaged in globalist coups in this country and is behind more anti-American
[12:07.840 --> 12:12.080]  activities, it is the central intelligence agency, they helped put Mao Zedong into power
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.000]  in 49, that's been declassified, they even have the former CIA section chief, he's dead
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.840]  now, but in his 90s, a decade ago, giving interviews to the history channel admitting
[12:19.840 --> 12:22.920]  it.
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.320]  So Donald Trump's rejected this as pure fraud, of course it's pure fraud.
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.920]  We're now seeing Merkel's losing her election because of the Russians, no because she opened
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.160]  the borders up and brought in two million jihadis, and raised taxes and the country's falling
[12:37.160 --> 12:40.160]  apart.
[12:40.160 --> 12:43.880]  Iceland pulled out of the globalist system because they were raping them politically,
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.400]  the UK did, UKIP was started 25 years ago because the Euro was unelected, nothing to
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.640]  do with Russia, it was still the Soviet Union then, but seeing you're not allowed to kick
[12:53.640 --> 12:56.480]  the globalist out, no, no, no, they're the foreign power, but they're going to tell
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.160]  you, no, no, no, no, we're not the foreign power, we're protecting the media and everything
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.960]  in the elections from the Ruskies, and so we've got to take all of your freedoms now.
[13:05.960 --> 13:11.360]  This is so incredible, and then the next part, when they begin to trigger something like
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.680]  this, the same CIA that told you there were WMDs in Iraq, the same CIA that it's been
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.360]  declassified last year, paid for ugly art and anti-Christian art to basically destroy
[13:21.360 --> 13:23.840]  the morals of America, that's been declassified.
[13:23.840 --> 13:28.640]  The same group that pushes propaganda that families aren't good, it works for the foreign
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.200]  banks that are taking the country over, does that mean everybody in the CIA is bad?
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.440]  No, but at the top, its mission is globalist, a coup against America, 1947, teamed up with
[13:38.440 --> 13:42.840]  the private federal reserve to capture America and use it and exploit it as an engine of
[13:42.840 --> 13:44.400]  global domination.
[13:44.400 --> 13:50.040]  Now, that said, here is the maximum alert, I've never put an alert out this strong, this
[13:50.040 --> 13:55.800]  is the maximum alert, we've had a lot of alerts over the years and you take action, you spread
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.160]  the word, Congress listens, the media picks it up and we have a big effect and it turns
[14:00.160 --> 14:01.160]  the tide.
[14:01.160 --> 14:06.480]  I warned of them trying to steal the nomination from Trump, I warned before that they try
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.520]  to steal the delegates, I warned they try to steal it on election day and Bev Harris,
[14:11.520 --> 14:16.480]  top election fraud expert who is a liberal, concurs that Hillary sold at least five states,
[14:16.480 --> 14:22.600]  how the recounts show the ones that Trump won, he won much, much more massively than they
[14:22.600 --> 14:28.320]  first thought, oh, you know, before your margin is only 50,000, now it's 250,000, oh here
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.400]  your margin is 30,000, now it's even more, this is devastating, they're panicking on
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.680]  every front, they're hitting them with everything they've got, they're trying to steal this
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.400]  from us because they know, he turns the prosperity back on, it was artificial to shut down our
[14:42.400 --> 14:48.520]  prosperity, that automatically massive jobs will flow back in, they've got a dam of higher
[14:48.520 --> 14:53.880]  corporate income taxes and regulations and garbage, all one-sided as an admitted plan
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.600]  to deindustrialize us.
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.800]  New York Times doesn't even tell you that the recounts ongoing but Trump's win to reverse
[15:02.800 --> 15:09.440]  it is unlikely, oh, give me a break, ladies and gentlemen, so now they've got Bob Baer,
[15:09.440 --> 15:14.200]  the darling of the leftist arm of the CIA out saying, looks like Trump stole this, we
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.200]  got to have a new election right now, that is CNN, one of the biggest media conglomerates
[15:19.200 --> 15:26.280]  in the world, full of CIA people like that billionaire Anderson Cooper, and I'm not against
[15:26.280 --> 15:30.080]  the fact he's a billionaire but he's a class warfare guy who ever talks about all of his
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.160]  untold wealth, and they are up there thinking they're going to defeat this country and crush
[15:35.160 --> 15:40.040]  this country, now the big news, when we come back, I've set the table, but the big maximum
[15:40.040 --> 15:46.960]  alert is, they wouldn't be already this bold if they weren't planning and seriously looking
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.200]  at assassinating Trump and using the cover of claiming he's a Russian agent, so get ready
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.840]  folks, I'm telling you, they got the teams ready, they're trying to figure out how they
[15:54.840 --> 16:03.320]  get away with killing Donald Trump right now, you heard it here.
[16:03.320 --> 16:08.360]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[16:08.360 --> 16:12.680]  Let me just read a little thing here from the point one, the American system of justice
[16:12.680 --> 16:17.000]  must be changed to conform to the rest of the world, individual rights, we'll have to
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.760]  take a back seat, do the collective, well you know what the next move is going to be,
[16:20.760 --> 16:21.760]  don't you?
[16:21.760 --> 16:22.760]  It's going to become after you're done.
[16:22.760 --> 16:23.760]  Oh yeah.
[16:23.760 --> 16:27.880]  I think it ain't going to sit well down my way, at all, it ain't going to sit well.
[16:27.880 --> 16:29.880]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[16:29.880 --> 16:32.800]  It's time to ride boys, we need a thousand paul reveres.
[16:32.800 --> 16:39.480]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, and
[16:39.480 --> 16:41.800]  beef was for supper.
[16:41.800 --> 16:47.880]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,

[19:57.200 --> 20:04.400]  Check it out for yourself today.
[20:04.400 --> 20:11.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:16.880 --> 20:23.640]  The Russians, it looks like to me, did interfere in our elections.
[20:23.640 --> 20:28.480]  We'll never be able to decide whether they change the outcome, but I'll tell you, having
[20:28.480 --> 20:33.840]  worked in the CIA, if we had been caught interfering in European elections or Asian elections or
[20:33.840 --> 20:39.680]  anywhere in the world, those countries would call for new elections and any democracy would.
[20:39.680 --> 20:41.640]  And I just, I don't see it any other way.
[20:41.640 --> 20:46.360]  I mean, the electoral college before the 19th has got to know whether the Russians had
[20:46.360 --> 20:51.600]  an effect, whether they went to WikiLeaks, whether they hacked email and whether they
[20:51.600 --> 20:53.120]  affected American opinion.
[20:53.120 --> 20:58.720]  And they had a good reason not to go after Hillary Clinton because Putin hates her for
[20:58.720 --> 20:59.720]  the Ukraine.
[20:59.720 --> 21:03.760]  So, Bob, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying we should have another election.
[21:03.760 --> 21:04.760]  How would that work?
[21:04.760 --> 21:06.760]  Is that plausible?
[21:06.760 --> 21:11.080]  When a foreign country interferes in your election and the outcome is endowed and legitimacy
[21:11.080 --> 21:13.640]  of the government, I don't know how it worked constitutionally.
[21:13.640 --> 21:18.880]  I'm not a lawyer, constitutional lawyer, but I'm deeply disturbed by the fact that the
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.800]  Russians interfered and I would like to see the evidence because if the evidence is there,
[21:23.800 --> 21:27.160]  I don't see any other way than to vote again.
[21:27.160 --> 21:32.880]  I mean, I, as an American citizen, maybe if there's evidence of anthrax and mobile weapons
[21:32.880 --> 21:37.360]  trucks in Iraq, we should invade again or maybe, maybe if Kennedy gets his head blown
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.160]  off and the CIA tells us they didn't do it, we should believe him.
[21:40.160 --> 21:45.880]  The CIA are trained known liars at the level of Bob Baer, and they work for the president
[21:45.880 --> 21:48.120]  supposedly, and so they're still working for Obama.
[21:48.120 --> 21:54.560]  So here comes the leftist darling of Hollywood that they make movies about telling us that
[21:54.560 --> 21:59.320]  the Russians stole it, we should have new elections, but he wants to see the proof.
[21:59.320 --> 22:03.160]  So, let's talk about facts.
[22:03.160 --> 22:07.320]  There weren't 20, 30, 40, 50,000 people at these rallies, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[22:07.320 --> 22:11.080]  of them for Trump, but Hillary on average had 300 people.
[22:11.080 --> 22:14.280]  There weren't big lines of people around the block in exit polls saying they were going
[22:14.280 --> 22:16.840]  for Trump, but in some states, he's still lost.
[22:16.840 --> 22:21.560]  Oh, the recounts in a bunch of states Jill Stein put on for Hillary.
[22:21.560 --> 22:22.560]  What that do?
[22:22.560 --> 22:24.080]  It added more votes to Trump, just like he said.
[22:24.080 --> 22:28.640]  Got all these democratic states admitting they're recruiting illegals to vote, Project
[22:28.640 --> 22:31.880]  Veritas got them on tape admitting it, but they're in the newspapers saying illegals
[22:31.880 --> 22:32.880]  should be able to vote.
[22:32.880 --> 22:37.600]  Then they play this mind game going, that's crazy racism, nobody wants illegals to vote.
[22:37.600 --> 22:42.960]  No, you just passed it in seven legislatures last year, that's right, they passed it in
[22:42.960 --> 22:47.120]  a bunch of states to have illegals vote, but they tell you no such things going on.
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.960]  Now, the laws never got passed to governor because the governor goes, I want to do this,
[22:50.960 --> 22:52.560]  but federal law says I can't.
[22:52.560 --> 22:53.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[22:53.840 --> 22:58.080]  That's how mutinous these globalists are.
[22:58.080 --> 23:04.440]  They have hijacked the nation, they've taken it over and then Bob Bear and all these other
[23:04.440 --> 23:08.080]  operatives and analysts are all over the news.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.080]  Yeah, there's Bloomberg.
[23:09.080 --> 23:12.080]  Some cities want their non-citizen immigrants to vote.
[23:12.080 --> 23:13.080]  That's Bloomberg.
[23:13.080 --> 23:14.080]  Just search engine.
[23:14.080 --> 23:17.000]  Illinois passes out of the house.
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.320]  Bill to allow anyone who's in the US to vote, they don't even call them illegals.
[23:23.320 --> 23:28.800]  Non-citizens to vote, California passes out of its house and five other states.
[23:28.800 --> 23:31.400]  But oh, there's no illegals voting, but listen, I'm digressing.
[23:31.400 --> 23:34.160]  Let me explain, I've studied history.
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.680]  You look at coup d'etats like the one they just had that they tried in Turkey that was
[23:38.680 --> 23:40.520]  then failed a few months ago.
[23:40.520 --> 23:44.200]  You see how third world countries are having them all the time, Germany's had them, Russia's
[23:44.200 --> 23:45.200]  had them.
[23:45.200 --> 23:48.280]  Look what happened with Yeltsin and Gorbachev.
[23:48.280 --> 23:52.280]  This is normal in history, especially when there's a big election that throws the party
[23:52.280 --> 23:53.800]  of power out.
[23:53.800 --> 23:55.840]  They thought they were going to win.
[23:55.840 --> 23:59.240]  They tried to steal it, it blew up in their face, and now they have a recount.
[23:59.240 --> 24:00.720]  Doesn't work.
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.760]  They try to get the electors to say that they're not going to go for Trump.
[24:04.760 --> 24:07.640]  But you see, there's not popular support for that.
[24:07.640 --> 24:08.640]  That will blow up in their face.
[24:08.640 --> 24:13.920]  So they've got to now float, he's a Russian operative to create the illusion that okay,
[24:13.920 --> 24:18.880]  it's okay that electors are going to stand up on the 19th in Congress and say, I'm not
[24:18.880 --> 24:20.760]  representing the votes of my state.
[24:20.760 --> 24:24.360]  I'm not representing those Electoral College numbers.
[24:24.360 --> 24:29.080]  I'm not bringing, say, the 15 Electoral College votes from this state or that state
[24:29.080 --> 24:30.480]  or the 30 of this state.
[24:30.480 --> 24:34.760]  I am going to just forfeit them.
[24:34.760 --> 24:35.760]  That's what they're going to say.
[24:35.760 --> 24:38.160]  They're already saying, we're not going to go to Hillary, we're just going to forfeit
[24:38.160 --> 24:39.160]  it.
[24:39.160 --> 24:41.560]  Well, if you take him away from Trump, then what are they going to say?
[24:41.560 --> 24:44.640]  Well, I guess bring Hillary back, she's back in.
[24:44.640 --> 24:47.240]  That's how crazy they are.
[24:47.240 --> 24:51.160]  And Trump until two weeks ago was like, that's ridiculous, they'll never get away with that.
[24:51.160 --> 24:54.160]  But then notice he had to come out and say, wait a minute, a bunch of illegals voted too.
[24:54.160 --> 24:56.480]  I really won the popular vote, which he clearly did.
[24:56.480 --> 24:58.480]  Now with the recount, it proves it.
[24:58.480 --> 24:59.480]  They're trying to undermine.
[24:59.480 --> 25:03.960]  But let me tell you something, they wouldn't have Mr. Baer crawling off from under a rock
[25:03.960 --> 25:07.560]  with his little sweet, believable puppy dog face.
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.760]  Oh my goodness, we better have a new election.
[25:11.760 --> 25:15.880]  I'm just a nice little man over here.
[25:15.880 --> 25:18.480]  My job's overthrowing elected governments.
[25:18.480 --> 25:22.040]  Oh gee, we better do something.
[25:22.040 --> 25:27.720]  I'm wearing my little CIA, you know, windbreaker, non-threatening little jacket here.
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.360]  I'm a nice little man.
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.320]  The good news is the entire military, I mean like 90% is awake.
[25:36.320 --> 25:38.200]  The FBI is awake.
[25:38.200 --> 25:41.360]  Most of people in the 15 different intelligence agencies are awake.
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.360]  And most importantly, the humet is awake, the American people, and the open source knowledge
[25:46.360 --> 25:50.520]  is that we know we have criminal liars, but it gets more powerful than that.
[25:50.520 --> 25:55.400]  Mika Brzezinski, to her credit, daughter of the bigner Brzezinski, one of the most evil,
[25:55.400 --> 25:59.720]  modern men that's still alive, one of the most evil living people, in my view.
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.840]  Total globalist, she came out and admitted, look, and so did Scarborough, look, Hillary
[26:04.840 --> 26:09.440]  didn't lose because of fake news, she lost because of her record, and when we were mildly
[26:09.440 --> 26:14.920]  critical of her, we had the Clintons call up and put pressure on our bosses, basically
[26:14.920 --> 26:15.920]  threatened to fire us.
[26:15.920 --> 26:18.200]  I have that clip, I'm going to play it after the break.
[26:18.200 --> 26:25.440]  But you think about that, that's up on infowars.com, in an article titled, Fake News Isn't What
[26:25.440 --> 26:27.520]  Determined Election, Morning Joe.
[26:27.520 --> 26:33.160]  That's a powerful headline, but it should be, Morning Joe host, Clinton put pressure on
[26:33.160 --> 26:35.560]  us to shut us up, or Clinton censored us.
[26:35.560 --> 26:36.560]  I mean, that is huge.
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.400]  That's in all the WikiLeaks.
[26:41.400 --> 26:46.160]  That's in the WikiLeaks, from everything from Comedy Central to MSNBC to CNBC to CNN
[26:46.160 --> 26:48.000]  to CBS.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.200]  They fired reporters at CBS that exposed, fast and furious.
[26:53.200 --> 26:59.240]  So here's the big news, a lot of data goes into this, but they are trying to put this
[26:59.240 --> 27:03.680]  out and put out the secret intelligence report to pass around to foreign governments because
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.280]  when you kill a head of state or you carry out a terror attack on your own soil as a
[27:07.280 --> 27:13.240]  false flag, you generally use foreign intelligence agencies to have total plausible deniability
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.600]  compartmentalization or private mercenary groups.
[27:17.600 --> 27:21.520]  And I can tell you, looking at the constellation of data, just like I did two months before
[27:21.520 --> 27:23.920]  9-11, when I said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on their
[27:23.920 --> 27:28.600]  asset bin Laden and bring in a tyranny and launch a bunch of wars, I can tell you, looking
[27:28.600 --> 27:37.360]  at all the data that they are going to come out and basically foment ideology and ideas
[27:37.360 --> 27:40.840]  and propaganda to try to get low nuts to try to kill Trump.
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.640]  And that's all over the news, from Newsweek to Times to the New York Times to the LA Times
[27:45.640 --> 27:48.360]  to you name it, saying somebody needs to kill Trump, kill Trump.
[27:48.360 --> 27:55.200]  They had one guy go with a gun and try to kill him admittedly and a lot of other scares.
[27:55.200 --> 27:58.960]  And so, understand our country's under attack by a lot of multinational interests that have
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.320]  their own former military people, their own spooks, their own spies, their own operatives.
[28:04.320 --> 28:07.960]  They're pissed that America's coming back, that they're not going to get to run us on
[28:07.960 --> 28:09.800]  the ground and sell us out anymore.
[28:09.800 --> 28:11.440]  They're upset about the prosperity message.
[28:11.440 --> 28:15.060]  It's the opposite of the globalist message of austerity.
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.720]  They believe they're undefeated.
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.800]  They believe they can take Trump out and they are really scared right now because in the
[28:21.800 --> 28:29.680]  words of Fox News host, Mr. Williams, we're already seeing what I'm calling, what he's
[28:29.680 --> 28:36.320]  calling, what others are calling beyond the Trump effect, we're calling it the Trump way.
[28:36.320 --> 28:41.240]  And he's already acting more presidential than Obama, he's already done more in 30-something
[28:41.240 --> 28:46.000]  days as President-elect and Obama did in eight years and they're not going to let him get
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.480]  into office if they have their way.
[28:47.480 --> 28:53.120]  They are, I guarantee you, developing the hit teams right now with the weird claim that
[28:53.120 --> 28:54.120]  it was an illegitimate election.
[28:54.120 --> 28:59.760]  There's been a Russian coup to kill Donald Trump, I know they're planning it.
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.400]  Michael Moore says something crazy could happen to stop Trump from becoming president.
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.160]  Appearing on late night with Seth Meyers, leftist filmmaker Michael Moore said the inauguration
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.440]  is more than six weeks away and it's possible that something crazy might happen to Trump.
[29:17.440 --> 29:21.600]  To President-elect Donald Trump, something that we're not expecting.
[29:21.600 --> 29:24.120]  I made that prediction back in the summer.
[29:24.120 --> 29:25.120]  You called it.
[29:25.120 --> 29:27.560]  So I'd like to make another one tonight.
[29:27.560 --> 29:28.560]  We're very excited.
[29:28.560 --> 29:31.040]  He's not president of the United States yet.
[29:31.040 --> 29:32.040]  Yeah.
[29:32.040 --> 29:34.320]  He's not president, right?
[29:34.320 --> 29:36.120]  This has been the craziest election year.
[29:36.120 --> 29:37.120]  It certainly has.
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.040]  Nothing anyone has predicted has happened.
[29:40.040 --> 29:42.000]  The opposite has happened.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.760]  So is it possible, just possible, that in these next six weeks, something else might
[29:46.760 --> 29:47.760]  happen?
[29:47.760 --> 29:48.760]  Yeah.
[29:48.760 --> 29:50.280]  Something crazy, something we're not expecting.

[31:01.160 --> 31:05.040]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[31:05.040 --> 31:07.320]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[31:07.320 --> 31:09.600]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[31:09.600 --> 31:14.200]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in
[31:14.200 --> 31:19.680]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[31:19.680 --> 31:22.960]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[31:22.960 --> 31:26.080]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[31:26.080 --> 31:28.800]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[31:56.280 --> 32:00.080]  That's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[32:00.080 --> 32:02.880]  I want to tell you about a brand new often-read product.
[32:02.880 --> 32:05.080]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[32:05.080 --> 32:07.080]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[32:07.080 --> 32:12.320]  It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators to keep
[32:12.320 --> 32:13.760]  your food from spoiling.
[32:13.760 --> 32:16.360]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[32:16.360 --> 32:17.360]  It's mobile.
[32:17.360 --> 32:22.160]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[32:22.160 --> 32:26.720]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating
[32:26.720 --> 32:29.200]  your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[32:29.200 --> 32:30.200]  A true innovation.
[32:30.200 --> 32:32.480]  I have never seen anything like this.
[32:32.480 --> 32:34.160]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[32:34.160 --> 32:36.720]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[32:36.720 --> 32:40.880]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[32:40.880 --> 32:43.000]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[32:56.400 --> 32:58.200]  Limited one for household.
[32:58.200 --> 33:22.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.400 --> 33:35.720]  We have the WikiLeaks and it's hundreds of thousands of emails, thousands of them, everything
[33:35.720 --> 33:43.000]  from Comedy Central to CNN to CBS News, being directed by the White House.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.880]  And now we have Mika Brzezinski coming out last Friday and saying, look, when we would
[33:46.880 --> 33:50.240]  criticize Hillary, she would put pressure on our bosses and they'd basically threaten
[33:50.240 --> 33:51.240]  the virus.
[33:51.240 --> 33:52.560]  So, the pressure's there.
[33:52.560 --> 33:57.840]  We have multinational banks coming in, looting the country, getting rid of our sovereignty.
[33:57.840 --> 34:01.520]  All over the world, people are pulling out of the New World Order from Russia to the
[34:01.520 --> 34:06.680]  UK to Iceland to Italy, just said, we don't want to have the EU get rid of what rights
[34:06.680 --> 34:10.600]  we have left and put an EU army inside our country.
[34:10.600 --> 34:14.520]  The EU's saying, oh, you want to pull out, we're going to send a military in.
[34:14.520 --> 34:17.800]  This is so crazy.
[34:17.800 --> 34:21.400]  Instead of backing off, it's all over the news.
[34:21.400 --> 34:24.040]  Oh, we had recounts, so we gained hundreds of thousands of votes.
[34:24.040 --> 34:25.040]  We'll forget that.
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.480]  We've got electors that are saying that they're not going to go for Trump on the 19th.
[34:29.480 --> 34:36.000]  And now Bob Barron, others, super liberal from the CIA, involved in their nastiest stuff
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  in my view.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.280]  I mean, he admits it, torture, you name it, assassinations, disinfo.
[34:41.280 --> 34:48.240]  This guy, the CIA, ruling our country since 1947, running coups against our nation, it's
[34:48.240 --> 34:49.440]  calling American people.
[34:49.440 --> 34:55.560]  We got some secret data that the Ruskies run this, and Rex Tillerson, why the head of
[34:55.560 --> 35:01.480]  Exxon Mobil, why he's a Rusky agent, because he drilled in Russia, and yeah, and he drilled
[35:01.480 --> 35:03.280]  in hundreds of other countries, too.
[35:03.280 --> 35:08.720]  He's a Mexican agent, is he a Venezuelan agent, is he a Portuguese agent, is he a Japanese
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.320]  agent, is he a Scottish agent, he's drilling a bunch off Scotland.
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.520]  This is the level of the globalists who have taken our country over.
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.400]  They're the outsiders, they're telling voters, you didn't vote for Trump, you're under Russian
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.400]  mind control.
[35:22.400 --> 35:26.840]  And I'm telling you, and I've run this up the flagpole, a lot of smart people.
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.080]  They're working for Obama, they'll do what Obama says.
[35:30.080 --> 35:33.200]  And if they're already saying he basically is a Russian agent, then in the continuity
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.360]  of government COG, that means they're looking at assassinating Donald Trump.
[35:37.360 --> 35:42.600]  I've studied this deeply, it means they'll go to any ends, they're on TV with high-level
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.880]  former CIA people saying we've got to have a new election.
[35:45.880 --> 35:50.720]  This is an open attempt to overthrow our election in our country, they're the ones that need
[35:50.720 --> 35:51.720]  to be seriously investigated.
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.760]  And let me tell you something, you saw the Army-Navy game, and we're going to Roger
[35:55.760 --> 35:59.080]  Stone here until about 10 minutes, 15 minutes for the next hour, and he's got a lot of interviews
[35:59.080 --> 36:01.480]  right now, he's busy writing his book, he knows he'll be the best seller, but I'll tell
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.840]  you, this fight isn't over, folks, I've been telling you that day one, we're 39 days out,
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.040]  and here's the clip of Bayer, and he goes on and on and on, and put the full clip earlier,
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.440]  but here's the shorter part, saying we need to go ahead and have a new election.
[36:14.440 --> 36:18.400]  This is on CNN, and this is all over the newspapers today, here it is.
[36:18.400 --> 36:21.440]  The Russians, it looks like to me, did interfere in our elections.
[36:21.440 --> 36:26.200]  We'll never be able to decide whether they change the outcome, but I'll tell you, having
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.560]  worked in the CIA, if we had been caught interfering in European elections or Asian elections or
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.480]  anywhere in the world, those countries would call for new elections.
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.200]  And any democracy would, and I just, I don't see it any other way, I mean, the electoral
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.960]  college before the 19th has got to know whether the Russians had an effect, whether they
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.800]  went to WikiLeaks, whether they hacked e-mail and whether they affected American opinion.
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.080]  And they go on to repeat it three or four more times, the full clips on infowars.com
[36:55.080 --> 36:58.520]  and prisonplanet.com, but here's what I'm getting at, they're bringing in web censorship,
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.720]  that pill passed the Senate today to set up a new bureau run by the CIA and the State Department
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.760]  to shut people down. They're already censoring us on Reddit, Google Chrome, EU ordered us
[37:08.760 --> 37:15.920]  banned on Monday. By Wednesday, we were being blocked in the Eurozone. It's not even news.
[37:15.920 --> 37:21.040]  The story's up on infowars.com. Look at drudgerport.com, then we're going to Roger Stone. The Russians
[37:21.040 --> 37:26.960]  did it, weapons of disinformation. So don't forget what was in the WikiLeaks, the Russians
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.520]  gave the material, which they didn't, it was US intelligence we now know, mainly, a lot
[37:31.520 --> 37:36.960]  of groups. So we've got to give it to Hillary. You know, I'm almost glad they're doing
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.560]  this because it's so arrogant. It's so naked. It's so crazy. I want to play one more short
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.320]  clip than Roger Stone on Stone Cold Truth.com, joining us from New York, saying a lot of
[37:46.320 --> 37:53.360]  time at Trump Tower lately, but loose lip sync ships, as they say, with Mika Brzezinski
[37:53.360 --> 37:55.240]  finally telling the truth. Here it is.
[37:55.240 --> 38:02.520]  Listen, when I was concerned the campaign was not understanding that perhaps there was
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.240]  an arrogance that needs to get up their I-Wars and understand that this isn't over. I'll
[38:07.240 --> 38:13.680]  just say it, NBC got a call from the campaign. Like, I had done something that was journalistically
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.960]  inappropriate or something and needed to be pulled off the air. I mean, think about that.
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.640]  That's just shooting the wrong messenger.
[38:22.640 --> 38:28.480]  And they go on to admit Hillary, Joe says, lost the election because of Hillary, not
[38:28.480 --> 38:32.960]  fake news. They're the fake news. They're the WMD liars. They got caught last week saying
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.960]  Trump and his crowd booed John Glenn when they said, all John Glenn died. What a hero.
[38:36.960 --> 38:42.520]  They went, oh, that's now a boo. Or Fox got caught having a Christmas party at Trump Tower.
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.040]  Total lie. Or fake quotes they put out on the web. It's on infowars.com right now. A new
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.360]  story about it. Fake quotes of Trump saying he hates his constituents. These people aren't
[38:52.360 --> 38:57.480]  going to turn loose. So joining us is Roger Stone. Roger, you know, you've been in the
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.640]  Nixon Winehouse. You've been in a lot of Whitehouses. I mean, we know the CIA was heavily involved
[39:01.640 --> 39:04.880]  in killing Kennedy. They were probably involved with the whole thing with Reagan. This is
[39:04.880 --> 39:09.120]  a government within a government to have them openly telling us about legitimate government
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.040]  when their job is overthrowing elected governments. This is very creepy. And I'm telling you,
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.600]  they're getting ready to move against Trump. Thank God he's put in the Trump effect and
[39:18.600 --> 39:21.880]  the Trump way and is already the commander in chief, according to many and already turning
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.000]  things around. If they kill him, he's going to be a martyr. But I don't think we're being
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.960]  incendiary or, you know, fear mongering here. I mean, this is real.
[39:29.960 --> 39:37.520]  Yeah, this is the last desperate grasp at power by the establishment who see them losing
[39:37.520 --> 39:45.400]  control. And this entire narrative of the Russians hacking the elections, we still have
[39:45.400 --> 39:53.240]  no proof. Yesterday, the New York Times says with bated breath that that's the case and
[39:53.240 --> 40:00.640]  Congressman McCall from Texas first reiterates the Times claim. When I checked with his spokesman,
[40:00.640 --> 40:07.160]  he's acting on the basis of a briefing from the CIA. He's seen no proof. No member of
[40:07.160 --> 40:14.160]  the Senate or House Intelligence Committees on the Republican side. So this is a harangue.
[40:14.160 --> 40:22.400]  Now, the CIA has a decades long history of lying about everything, whether it is Benghazi
[40:22.400 --> 40:28.120]  or whether it's the Kennedy assassination. So why would we believe them? They are merely
[40:28.120 --> 40:36.640]  taking the Clinton campaign talking points and recycling them yet again as the last pretext
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.200]  to deny Donald Trump the office of president. I don't think this is going to work. I think
[40:42.200 --> 40:48.520]  the effort in the Electoral College, while he may drop a few votes, he will still resoundingly
[40:48.520 --> 40:55.360]  be seated and this nonsense will be over on January 20th. And then he can launch a real
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.480]  investigation into our intelligence community and see why they're lying about this.
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.080]  I was about to say he's played nice and said, let's all be friends. And then they've stabbed
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.800]  him in the back at every front contested the election going after him lying about it. They
[41:10.800 --> 41:15.840]  have only dug in. So it's not vindictiveness as I mean, it's not an off the record talk.
[41:15.840 --> 41:19.600]  I told him weeks ago, I said, you've got to go after the criminals, sir. They're never
[41:19.600 --> 41:22.680]  going to back off. If they claim there's a deal, they're going to stab me in the back
[41:22.680 --> 41:27.480]  the next day and look what they're doing. Well, and as he said today, the claim that
[41:27.480 --> 41:33.640]  the Russians controlled or hacked or affected the election is I'll use his word ridiculous.
[41:33.640 --> 41:39.680]  Yesterday, he pointed out that they have lied about weapons of mass destruction. Why would
[41:39.680 --> 41:46.360]  we believe the CIA? Why would we? Would we believe the political appointees of Barack
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.080]  Obama? I was about to say, I was about to say these are the political leftist known
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.240]  minions of that whole wing of the CIA. And they're the admittedly the biggest liars on
[41:55.240 --> 42:01.800]  the earth and serve Obama and Hillary still. Well, frankly, the president elect is focused
[42:01.800 --> 42:08.080]  on forming a government. He I think he regards this as so much background noise, put out
[42:08.080 --> 42:14.360]  a very good statement on it yesterday, went out to the press today. In the meantime, Alex,
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.680]  I think I can report with some confidence that the candidacy of Mitt Romney for secretary
[42:19.680 --> 42:26.360]  of state is dead. And I fully expect the president elect to appoint Rex Tillerson is the next
[42:26.360 --> 42:31.120]  secretary of state. And by the way, we're going to come back and really break all this
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.600]  down. But but Roger, I love how you say you can report this now. I mean, I guess we can't
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.840]  say when you knew you could really report this. Well, I really can't without Victorian
[42:40.840 --> 42:47.160]  competences, but I've now had enough conversations with people in a position to know that indicate
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.880]  that that is where the president is headed. And it's safe to say Romney was being played
[42:50.880 --> 42:57.520]  with like a cat in a mouse. Yeah, I think at the end of the day, what's your stay there?
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.320]  I want to come back and talk about this. We have the new product and enforce life.com
[43:02.320 --> 43:08.320]  bio true selenium. We've had so many requests over the years for selenium. And just recently,
[43:08.320 --> 43:14.840]  we were able to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract.
[43:14.840 --> 43:19.600]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[43:19.600 --> 43:25.200]  body. It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify selenium is another one
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.560]  of those absolute must have the highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland. But it's
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.360]  actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that
[43:35.360 --> 43:43.000]  are directly dependent upon selenium. So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.920]  really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is so key bio true selenium is the product,
[43:48.920 --> 43:52.120]  the best selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best out there at a very,
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.880]  very low price, exclusively available in enforce life.com or by calling toll free triple eight
[43:56.880 --> 44:02.360]  two five three three one three nine. We're selling a product DNA force that is the very
[44:02.360 --> 44:08.120]  best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years to develop DNA force
[44:08.120 --> 44:12.040]  for us. It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.760]  I think it's very, very important. What the aging process is is when the cell replicates,
[44:17.760 --> 44:23.640]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[44:23.640 --> 44:28.680]  and when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[44:28.680 --> 44:33.520]  clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an
[44:33.520 --> 44:39.240]  antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to deliver the
[44:39.240 --> 44:45.200]  maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five star reviews. I take this. This
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.120]  is this is the product that I take in enforce life.com and the profit we make. We fight the
[44:50.120 --> 44:54.920]  global. If we fight the new world order, secure your DNA force today at info wars live.com

[45:04.120 --> 45:10.400]  we did on this day, change has come to America. Something's wrong. We all know it. I'm Charity

[45:22.240 --> 45:31.000]  heritage, mom and apple pie. God was in school. Morality had a future and beef was for supper.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.840]  Revelation dawn of global government. We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more
[45:36.840 --> 45:43.120]  to it than that. Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels and Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin,

[47:03.840 --> 47:15.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:15.480 --> 47:20.320]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up
[47:20.320 --> 47:28.320]  on top. The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey
[47:28.320 --> 47:37.320]  back to hell. And it's our hope to reverse that course. Because there's a war on for
[47:37.320 --> 47:44.920]  your mind. I'm Alex Jones. We're 39 days out from the inauguration. I told you they try
[47:44.920 --> 47:48.880]  to have recounts. They don't care. They got hundreds of thousands more votes for Trump
[47:48.880 --> 47:55.920]  when they just did a few states. I told you they are in hysteria. Okay. I have a body
[47:55.920 --> 48:02.360]  guard now. Okay. Former military, patriot, uh, Blackwater whole nine yards. I mean,
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.880]  the real deal. And we were on the Hike and Bike trail this morning and, you know, had
[48:05.880 --> 48:11.240]  a guy come up and get my face and a big guy and say, why are you against world government?
[48:11.240 --> 48:14.560]  It's the right thing. It's the thing to do. You need to support it and really get in my
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.960]  face with just shaking world government. It's the right thing. It's good. It's good.
[48:19.960 --> 48:24.600]  He was like a cult member. It's like a big guy, you know, in good shape. He ran up the
[48:24.600 --> 48:29.040]  big hill passes and lapped around, came back down. He laughed, sent me and then turns around
[48:29.040 --> 48:33.560]  in my face. I've had people threaten me. You name it. They've gone into a total mental
[48:33.560 --> 48:39.600]  illness. I'm the liberal. I'm a libertarian. I want low taxes. Live how you want. Do what
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.600]  you want. Leave me alone. I'm telling you how to talk and what to do like Hillary and
[48:44.600 --> 48:50.080]  the globalist and Merkel. I don't like Islamist is enslaving women, but the left's all allied
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.520]  with them. It's bizarre. And then they're on the news. It's in my local paper. It's
[48:55.520 --> 49:03.560]  in the New York times. You know, we need a new election. The Russians, give me a break.
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.920]  The Russians kick the same globalist oligarchs out of their country. So they're nationalist.
[49:08.920 --> 49:14.400]  They have the same view as the patriots of this country, but all over the world this
[49:14.400 --> 49:19.000]  is happening and Roger Stone is bringing up the really big issues here. You know, I understand
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.480]  the POTUS 45 is confident. He's an honorable, tough guy, but I'm telling you, man, they
[49:25.480 --> 49:29.960]  mean business. They know their whole world government's going down. The new Renaissance
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.320]  is here. Trump gets in next hour. We're going to talk about a two front war because I'm
[49:35.320 --> 49:41.240]  having to deal with not so much my listeners, but some of the other libertarians and patriots
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.160]  and other folks that see who he's appointing and really don't get the full history of what's
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.800]  happening and the fact that Trump's already delivering, but he's getting key people from
[49:49.800 --> 49:54.200]  corporations that are in the power structure, but actually agree with him like Rex Tillerson,
[49:54.200 --> 49:58.560]  who was forced to stop financing the whole anti-global warming movement. He was forced
[49:58.560 --> 50:04.080]  to quote tacitly get on board or be removed from standard oil's chairmanship, which is
[50:04.080 --> 50:09.600]  ExxonMobil. He took ExxonMobil away from the Rockefellers in 2006. That's coming up
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.320]  next hour, but Roger Stone, I want to give you the floor, my friend. Let's repeat what
[50:13.320 --> 50:17.560]  you said because that's a bombshell and I want to use it for a promo quite frankly
[50:17.560 --> 50:21.680]  because I mean weeks ago I knew about this obviously from sources and then I talked to
[50:21.680 --> 50:24.360]  you about it. You said, yeah, that's pretty dead on, but I wouldn't go there yet. So we've
[50:24.360 --> 50:29.000]  sat back. We've waited. People are all mad about the Romney thing. So go over what Trump
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  was really doing.
[50:30.000 --> 50:36.180]  Yeah. Alex, in retrospect, I now realize that President-elect Trump was toying with Mitt
[50:36.180 --> 50:44.280]  Romney. Let's not forget that Mitt Romney called him a con man, a fraud and a phony.
[50:44.280 --> 50:49.640]  That crosses a certain line. It's one thing to oppose Trump's election. That's fair enough.
[50:49.640 --> 50:56.240]  Maybe say in your view he's unqualified, but that kind of name calling is beneath contempt
[50:56.240 --> 51:05.280]  and Trump is not a guy who forgets. So in retrospect, I now realize that he was diddling
[51:05.280 --> 51:11.360]  the guy and someone very close to the president-elect told me that Romney's tongue was hanging
[51:11.360 --> 51:18.800]  out, that he kept calling Trump Tower repeatedly. My sources tell me that the president-elect
[51:18.800 --> 51:25.360]  told Mitt Romney that in order to be considered for secretary of state, he would have to issue
[51:25.360 --> 51:32.120]  a public apology for the names he called down from something he declined to do. So instead
[51:32.120 --> 51:37.080]  he went out and had this presser where he said, well, same thing you want about Donald
[51:37.080 --> 51:43.240]  Trump, he was able to do the one thing I was not able to do, get elected. Nice, but not
[51:43.240 --> 51:44.920]  what was required.
[51:44.920 --> 51:51.120]  So I think the Romney candidacy is dead. I think Tillerson is an excellent choice. Actually,
[51:51.120 --> 51:56.400]  I think his skirmish with the Rockefellers is what first brought him to Trump's attention
[51:56.400 --> 52:04.520]  some time ago. He has that same confidence and that same can-do spirit that Trump has.
[52:04.520 --> 52:09.760]  I think you'll be totally loyal to the president, which is the most important quality for a secretary
[52:09.760 --> 52:10.760]  of state.
[52:10.760 --> 52:17.720]  And let's be clear. Let's be clear. I mean, Rex Tillerson started as a on-the-line oilfield
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.760]  engineer and moved up to the head of what some years is the biggest corporation in the
[52:22.760 --> 52:27.280]  world, number five right now. Reportedly, he is the most magnetic salesman anybody's
[52:27.280 --> 52:32.600]  seen and has gotten exon into countries and mobile into countries nobody else can. That's
[52:32.600 --> 52:38.600]  how he went right to the top is because he's such an incredible diplomat and negotiator.
[52:38.600 --> 52:41.880]  Oil companies have to be able to do things nobody else can do. This shows pure genius
[52:41.880 --> 52:43.880]  in my view by Trump.
[52:43.880 --> 52:49.360]  Well, the most of the criticism I've seen today is, well, he doesn't know anything about
[52:49.360 --> 52:50.360]  foreign policy.
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.400]  Well, Alex, the people who have been running our foreign policy for 30 years know all about
[52:55.400 --> 52:58.600]  it. They're trained for it. How are they doing?
[52:58.600 --> 52:59.600]  Horribly.
[52:59.600 --> 53:05.240]  Not too well. So this is, there's no secret here. Jim Baker, regardless of whether you
[53:05.240 --> 53:11.360]  agree with his positions, he was a lawyer in Houston with no particular expertise in foreign
[53:11.360 --> 53:12.360]  policy.
[53:12.360 --> 53:17.280]  Yet I think he was an effective secretary of state for the policies of the bush.
[53:17.280 --> 53:20.400]  Well, he was devastating. I mean, everything went his way.
[53:20.400 --> 53:25.680]  So look, this is a question of putting in a strong, capable man who has a direct line
[53:25.680 --> 53:30.320]  to the president doesn't have to go through the national security and Trump's not stupid.
[53:30.320 --> 53:34.000]  He knows the best salesman in the world other than maybe him. It's a well-known thing in
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.600]  the corporate world are, for whatever reason, Texans. They had up more corporations. I mean,
[53:38.600 --> 53:40.400]  it's just people love Texans.
[53:40.400 --> 53:45.480]  Well, I think this is a very true choice. In fact, I think all of his choices thus far
[53:45.480 --> 53:50.840]  have been true choices. You know, there's some other people that I might have put in
[53:50.840 --> 53:55.000]  some of these slots, but I'm not going to second-guess the president-elect. I think
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  he's doing great so far.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.280]  Because the proof's in the pudding. Let's talk about what he's done. Let's talk about
[53:59.280 --> 54:00.880]  what he's done so far.
[54:00.880 --> 54:06.720]  Well, he is, first of all, the Mexicans and the Canadians are both ready to renegotiate
[54:06.720 --> 54:13.000]  NAFTA. That's not bad right there. He's not even in power yet. And they're ready to sit
[54:13.000 --> 54:20.920]  at the table and cut a new deal, which is, I think, one of the centerpieces of his strategy.
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.560]  By putting Steve Mnuchin and now Gary Cohn in charge of economic policy, I think you're
[54:26.560 --> 54:33.760]  going to see the Trump economic proposal that he put out during the campaign actually enacted.
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.880]  How rare a politician, or in this case, an elected official, who actually does what they
[54:38.880 --> 54:44.560]  say they're going to do. I know Larry Kudlow was over at Trump Tower the other day for
[54:44.560 --> 54:50.520]  a private conference. I think that's great news because Kudlow is a real advocate for
[54:50.520 --> 54:56.800]  economic growth and for cutting the corporate tax rate, which is maybe the single most important
[54:56.800 --> 55:00.400]  thing Trump can do to move this economy forward.
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.640]  Well, I mean, Trump is assembling a dream team. Already $10 billion in steel jobs. Confirmed
[55:04.640 --> 55:11.040]  coming back. $50 billion at least in the first year of super high-tech jobs from Softbank
[55:11.040 --> 55:18.440]  and Mr. Sun, who just loves Trump, continuing 85% of the 1,400 jobs loss coming back to
[55:18.440 --> 55:23.080]  Carrier. Now, multiple Ford plants. They had a Ford says he'll bring them all back if they
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.520]  simply make the corporate income tax the global average. I mean, this is incredible. The stock
[55:27.520 --> 55:30.800]  markets added a trillion dollars in one month.
[55:30.800 --> 55:38.040]  Plus his public objection to the multi-billion dollar price of the new Air Force One, which
[55:38.040 --> 55:43.280]  will not even be ready in time for him to use. He'll never fly in it. But he looked
[55:43.280 --> 55:47.640]  at the price tag and said, this is too much. Now, Boeing executives are going to work with
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.560]  him to try to get the price down. We're actually going to get economy and government for the
[55:52.560 --> 55:57.800]  first time in my lifetime, probably from the first time since Calvin Coolidge was president.
[55:57.800 --> 56:00.880]  That's unbelievable. I want to come back in the next two segments with you, Roger. And
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.120]  before you leave, talk about your amazing book because I've had a few first looks at
[56:04.120 --> 56:07.760]  some of the chapters. Incredible. Talk about inside. And I don't know if you can get into
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.280]  details, but you've gotten tested approval from somebody pretty high up to do this.
[56:12.280 --> 56:17.200]  But this is pretty amazing, the access and everything because you play down, you know,
[56:17.200 --> 56:23.440]  your role. But I mean, the truth is you've been very, very central as let's just say
[56:23.440 --> 56:26.440]  as one of the top brains up there.
[56:26.440 --> 56:30.520]  Well, look, all credit goes to Donald Trump. At the end of the day, I'm going to show you
[56:30.520 --> 56:36.600]  in this book how it is his intelligence, his instincts, his courage and his guy that got
[56:36.600 --> 56:42.160]  him elected. In many ways, he got elected despite his campaign. He left the campaign
[56:42.160 --> 56:47.320]  behind. That's right. He had a guerrilla grassroots campaign. It was great. But when you come
[56:47.320 --> 56:51.160]  right down to it, it was Trump, the communicator who beat Hillary Clinton.
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.680]  That's right. And here's my frustration on the two front war. And I'm going to have
[56:54.680 --> 56:57.400]  David Knight in here to debate this tomorrow. He's back for vacation. I'm not sure I love
[56:57.400 --> 57:01.960]  David's super smart guy. Totally honorable. I love having a co-host like that that is
[57:01.960 --> 57:05.120]  as smart as I am or smarter when it comes to factoids. He was tweeting, tweeting, tweeting
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.640]  last night, all Rex Tillerson was for a carbon tax. You know, he was for the whole, you know,
[57:08.640 --> 57:10.320]  treaty over in Paris last year.
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.160]  They almost removed him because he was the guy behind fighting it. And then he had to
[57:14.160 --> 57:20.440]  hold on. And now Trump says it's a bunch of bull and you watch, you watch, I will, I will,
[57:20.440 --> 57:24.560]  I will punch myself at the nose on air, break my, I mean, I'm being sarcastic, but if Tillerson
[57:24.560 --> 57:28.960]  doesn't come out and come out against carbon taxes, that's who he is. So I get David saying,
[57:28.960 --> 57:33.960]  hey, he was, you know, he was good. Now he's bad. Just watch because I'm seeing Trump already
[57:33.960 --> 57:38.200]  with his appointments, just use them to carry out his will. So we're going to come back
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.600]  at 70 seconds to talk to Roger Stone about that. His book is already in pre-sale. We'll
[57:42.600 --> 57:46.120]  tell you about that when we come back. I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com. They're censoring

[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.560]  of information I want to cover here and a ton of news coming up. I'll also open the phones
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:24.640]  up after Roger leaves us in about 20 minutes. Roger stonestonecoltruth.com is a book. We'll
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.600]  give you the title in a moment is already available for pre sale. It's important to send this

[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:42.160]  it'll be a blueprint to winning future campaigns and a lot of this ties into what Bannon's
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.120]  been talking about this blueprint to make America so wealthy again. The blue collar
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.200]  folks that we break the back of the leftist trying to make people dependent and domesticated
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.480]  because that's in the WikiLeaks that they want us domesticated as if we didn't already
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.400]  know it. That's what's so incredible. Everything we've talked about for 20 years because we
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.520]  have their own source documents before is confirmed in WikiLeaks. It's not a Russian phenomenon.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.720]  These are the crimes of this ruling elite. But I got to go back in this brief segment
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.920]  and then get into other issues with you, Roger stone, let you lead these next two segments.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:18.400]  I mean, getting into more of this just in two minutes. What really happened with Romney?
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.440]  I mean, how much can you tell people? Well, in retrospect, it's very clear that Donald
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.680]  Trump was interviewing Mitt Romney for Secretary of State in order to torture him, to toy with
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:35.040]  him. And given the history, that's completely understandable. Mitt Romney crossed the line.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.680]  He didn't just oppose Trump, which is his democratic right. He called him a phony and
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.440]  a fraud and a con man. And that's not the kind of man you want is Secretary of State.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.640]  And Trump gave him a ton of money, supported him in the campaign. And he acted like he
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.960]  was Trump's friend for many, many years. And from what I've read, I've seen the chemistry
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.720]  Trump genuinely liked him. So that made it worse.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.960]  Well, you know, Trump correctly said he was a choker. And at the key moment in the campaign
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.200]  against Barack Obama, he choked. Donald Trump is not a choker. In fact, he's a scratch
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:17.000]  golfer. So in this particular case, Trump did what Romney couldn't. It has always kind
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.320]  of tickled me. Romney's struggled to carry Ohio. And they poured millions and millions
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.320]  into it.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.320]  And didn't get Pennsylvania.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:33.080]  Trump carried Ohio easily, despite the opposition of the Kasek Republican machine. It was never
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.880]  in doubt. He pulled out to a lead in Ohio, and he never lost it. It was the one state
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:44.880]  we had in the bank. Pennsylvania, which was outside Romney's grasp, was won by Trump because
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.160]  of Trump's unique appeal to working class Democrats in the western part of the state.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.720]  Something a country clubber like Romney could never match.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.040]  Well, I've been around the country, so have you. He is a rock star with most Hispanics
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.680]  I've talked to, tons of black folks, record numbers, the whites that put Obama in who
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.840]  aren't racist voted for him. The media trying to claim that this was a white lash just shows
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.000]  why they lost this to begin with. And despite all their fraud, all their election chicanery,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.840]  they still lost and they're hopping mad.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.800]  Well, and the fact that the African American vote was down overall, and down in the key
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:25.640]  states where it was crucial to Hillary Clinton, that is a non-Clinton vote in a way. While
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.760]  it may not be a vote for Donald Trump, it's a vote against Hillary Clinton. I think it
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.600]  may have been determinative in Wisconsin, in Michigan, and in Pennsylvania.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.840]  All right. We got one more segment with you. I've been asking the questions. When we come
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:45.840]  back, what's front and center for Roger Stone? Let's talk about fake news. Boy, I'm glad.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.920]  Well, we got a minute here. They have, I mean, you said, hit back. I am hitting back. I talked
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.480]  to you a few days ago. They're taking quotes where I'm talking about Hillary's behind the
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.200]  rebels. So she's back, people that cut up children and murder children. They edit the
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.440]  clip together and then they put it out as a newspaper headline and then they take the
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.320]  quote out on NPR, everywhere else and read it. And the Washington Times is if I'm talking
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.000]  about pizza game and I mean, this is incredible. Well, again, a reporter in the Washington
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.920]  Post quotes some guy who was furious because he said his children who are at this pizza
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:25.040]  place were endangered when a man showed up with a gun and that he holds Roger Stone personally
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:31.040]  responsible. Alex, I have never discussed pizza game. Never go to my personal Twitter
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.200]  feed. You won't find it. It's not that we're running from it. We covered the Podesta emails
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.760]  and all the weird stuff. It's that the media just took it, diverted off onto it and then
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.200]  just says, that's that's what we cover. That's what we do. And then calls for censoring us
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.720]  and they just passed the legislation folks to start the censoring domestically with the
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.360]  State Department CIA. That's breaking straight ahead. It's on info wars.com. I'm Alex Jones,
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:02.720]  Roger Jones, our guest stone cold truth.com. Stay with us, Michael Moore says something
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.880]  crazy could happen to stop Trump from becoming president appearing on late night with Seth
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:15.000]  Myers left his filmmaker Michael Moore said the inauguration is more than six weeks away
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  and it's possible that something crazy might happen to President elect Donald Trump, something
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.760]  that we're not expecting. I beat that prediction. Yeah, you made it. You called it. So I'd
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.840]  like to make another one tonight. We're very excited. He's not president of the United
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:37.040]  States yet. Yeah. He's not president, right? This has been the craziest election year.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.760]  It certainly has. Nothing anyone has predicted has happened. Yeah. Every the opposite has
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:47.440]  happened. Yes. So is it possible, just possible that in these next six weeks, something else
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.880]  might happen? Yeah, something crazy, something we're not expecting. And you can watch this
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:06:09.400]  video in its entirety right now at info wars.com. We now take you live to the central Texas
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.440]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:22.040]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-Alex. That's the weekend number different than the
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:29.720]  weekday show number 877-789-2539-877-789-2539. We're going to turn the phone system on.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.840]  Our record is 24,000 calls in three hours on a weekday show. We did our own phone system.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.680]  It's computerized. Think about that number of calls. Other shows have to beg for calls.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.680]  Our problem is like just so many come in. The show is just gigantic. We're so blessed.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.600]  Thank you for joining us. I'll be back tomorrow. We're dwelling 11am to 3pm central. Coming
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.720]  up after Roger Stone leaves us in the segment, I'm going to play a clip of Obama at the Army
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.600]  Navy game with no one even noticing him. And then Trump there yesterday was a rock star.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:05.160]  I want to warn Robert Bayer and the people in the CIA that are basically putting out
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.600]  this rogue message that the Russians ran this election. You know that's a load of bull. Nobody's
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:15.240]  buying it. And if you think the military and police and others and the American people
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.640]  are going to put up with your hutzpah and your arrogance and your bravada and your delusional
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.840]  garbage that you're going to be able to pull something and kick Trump out of office, you're
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:33.760]  crazy. This hit in 1963. So in the words of that famous, famous movie, but life imitates
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:40.960]  art, feel your hand. I mean, you people are out of your minds. Roger Stone, you wanted
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.320]  to get into fake news, shouldn't quietly passes the countering disinformation and propaganda
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:52.000]  act $170 million just to begin. They got another bill that's passed the house as well. This
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.520]  talks about the CIA and others interfacing with local media and even planning disinformation
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.280]  to counter us. I think we're already seeing that Roger. Yeah, the president needs to veto
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:07.560]  this legislation if it gets to his desk. A point you made some months ago, Alex, and
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:14.480]  that is throughout the entire campaign, they have accused us repeatedly of doing exactly
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:21.840]  what they are doing. There is fake news. It's a real problem. CNN, for example. Now, there's
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:30.320]  fake news. CBS, ABC, the New York Times. There's fake news. Fake news in those cases gets all
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:36.720]  the way to the front page, to the top of the news, like this entire Russian hacking the
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:44.200]  election meme for which there is still no proof whatsoever. The government says it happened.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:49.960]  They say it happened. Why would anybody believe the Central Intelligence Agency? Why would
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:57.880]  anybody believe Harry Reid? These people are habitual pathological liars. So there is a
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.880]  fake news problem in the country, but you won't find it at Info Wars or Breitbart or
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:10.160]  the Daily Caller or a dozen other fine news outlets who bring you the truth every week.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.920]  Glenn Greenwald got new WikiLeaks documents. And of course, it's the Hillary people feeding
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.760]  direct fake news MSNBC, more than 30 stories that they took whole cloth, knew or fake,
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.080]  and ran. They got this other reporter says, I'm a hack. Tell me stuff. I'll lie. He goes
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:30.480]  on MSNBC last week and says censor us. And by the way, we're named, you're named. They're
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.520]  even saying censor Trump off Twitter. They're that bold in the Washington Post. They say,
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.960]  he's a bully. Take the president's Twitter away. These people are, I think, disconnected
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.200]  from reality, Roger.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.800]  Well, liberals love free speech as long as it's theirs. I mean, according again to the
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:54.040]  New York Times story, they say people with close associations with the Russians hacked
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:02.400]  information and gave it to WikiLeaks and WikiLeaks released it. That's a lie. That's not true.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.640]  But New York Times, name those people. Give us their names. Who are the people you refer
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.720]  to? I submit you don't have the names because they don't exist.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.280]  Well, that's right. And look, I've had over the years, journalists training when I first
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.800]  got in talk radio once a month into a lawyer's seminar about things, obviously. And so I
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.960]  learned the basics and I took some RTF didn't learn much there in community college. But
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:29.360]  the point is under federal statute, but also most states, it's 14 days to retract. So I've
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.200]  noticed what the Washington Post did was about 17 days ago, they put on an article that,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.640]  oh, total proof the election was run by the Russians, bots pushed in full wars and drudge
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:45.120]  and all this. And then 14 days later to the date, they retract and say we had no proof.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.560]  It was a mistake, but no one's reading it then. And now I'm seeing more and more where
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.920]  they retract like it seven o'clock at night, CNN says Donald Trump, Boo John Glenn. And
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.000]  then at midnight, they say, Oh, that was a mistake. So I mean, they're doing this on
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.600]  perfect on purpose to cover their butts. Meanwhile, we're squandering taxpayers money in Wisconsin
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:12.040]  in Michigan in Pennsylvania, where their entire claim is based on two things. One, these voting
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.080]  machines can be easily hacked. Well, when I said that before the election, God, the heavens
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:24.640]  opened up and all hell broke loose. And secondarily, the polls didn't show this outcome. Therefore,
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.160]  the outcome must be wrong. Isn't it kind of obvious? It's the polls that were wrong.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.840]  So the Wisconsin recount has proved nothing zero. Well, now, now, sir, they're saying
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.960]  that Merkel is saying she's lost the last three parliamentary elections. And so she's
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.880]  about to lose the chancellorship. They're now saying it's the Russians.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.720]  Yeah, well, people who are understanding the technology, first of all, tell me the Russians
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:59.080]  aren't even this adept that they're not in the league, say of the Chinese when it comes
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:03.800]  to their hacking ability. Also don't think they have a complete understanding of American
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.720]  politics. Everybody's pissed off in the world. That's why people are pulling on a global
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.720]  capitalism.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.600]  Well, and Putin was smart enough to know that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were hurtling
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:21.040]  this country towards war in Syria. We have a verdant nuclear war with the outcome of
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.000]  this election. I'm convinced of it because they would have instituted a no fly zone.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.200]  And that is an open invitation for World War Three.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.000]  Look, I know Megan Kelly likes you before you were shadow band at Fox. He had you on
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.320]  all the time, but she's now blaming Trump for Americans not trusting her. What advice
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.520]  would you have for Megan Kelly?
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.280]  Well, first of all, stop lying about Roger Ailes because all of that, everything she
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:49.960]  has said about Ailes is a lie, a bald face lie. And she has changed her testimony over
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:57.080]  time. You know, Roger Ailes was lynched, Alex. This was a lynching. And I've known him 40
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.600]  years. This is not the man I know. I think the charges against him are false. Let's see
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.600]  what happens when he gets his money from Fox and he's free to re-enter the marketplace.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:13.080]  All right, I'm going to put this book up on screen because I know it's going to be powerful.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.320]  You've already been a New York Times bestselling author on the Kennedy assassination of their
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.520]  issues. But I'll tell you, you've been, you know, worked for three administrations. You've
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.040]  been in nine campaigns. The making of the president 2016 have Donald Trump orchestrated
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.960]  a revolution. I don't have a stake in this. I don't own part of the book. I am ordering
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:35.560]  10,000 of them because I believe this is going to be a bestseller. And I mean, this is, the
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.040]  cover is beautiful. You're writing it day and night right now. You're only getting four
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.960]  hours sleep. I know the book's getting close to being done. You'll have it out on or right
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.520]  after inauguration. Tell people how they pre-order the book because you don't just order a book
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.640]  that's powerful and gives you the inside scoop. There's some stuff you can't even say on
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.480]  air. It's only going to be a modest guy, plus you want to keep the pipeline going. Boy, I
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.440]  tell you, everything Roger's told me has come true. It's amazing Intel. I tell you, the
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.000]  mainstream media, they had any idea. I guess they do would be really jealous. How do people
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.840]  order the book? I mean, obviously we're going to order it this week. We'll have it pre-ordered
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.200]  info wars.com, infostore.com. I don't care where they get it, but I'm going to tell you,
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.240]  when it actually comes out, I don't be able to order a second copy at Amazon.com to push
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.680]  it to number one political because then it'll cascade to number one.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.760]  Thank you, Alex. I appreciate this. The making of the president 2016 is both a look at the
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.080]  larger trends in the country that allowed the election of Donald Trump as long as well
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.480]  as an examination of his strategy and how he implemented it. And then we've got a lot
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:40.080]  of down and dirty vignettes about the various people in this campaign. I told the president
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:46.080]  elect about the book last week. He's cooperating. He's glad to hear about it. But I think if
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.120]  you really want an insider's view of how this all happened, this is going to be the book.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:57.600]  Now, it's not entirely written. It's about three quarters done, like a lot of footnoting
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.960]  to do tonight. But this is going to be the best thing I've written in my opinion. And
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.160]  I think it'll be the definitive account of this campaign. Now, there are some people
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:14.560]  who aren't going to like this book. I don't want to name any names, Ted Cruz. I don't want
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.160]  to talk about who's not going to like it, Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:23.680]  Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney. And I hope to take us right up to the transition. So it's not
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:29.640]  just the election and the outcome of the election, but it's also what has transpired since the
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.580]  election. All the historic stuff that's happening. This is just so amazing happening in real
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:40.240]  time. Roger Stone, the book is already on pre-sell, correct? Yes. You can go to Amazon.com.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.160]  You can go to BarnesandNoble.com. You can go to RogerStone.com in order right now.

[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.400]  documentary. One of mine said it's the number one, then that makes it just absolutely explode.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.760]  Roger, we'll talk to you soon. Get back to writing. We'll be back, folks. Stay with us

[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:43.320]  a ways to describe this but surreal is the best word to be attacked in it's not
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:50.200]  exaggerate 50 60 70 newspapers a day on average now that I know of some days
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:55.520]  it's hundreds some days I get Google alerts and it will be thousands of
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.480]  articles with my name in it or info wars in it or those combinations and you go
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.720]  read it and you know a couple years ago they'd say some stuff that wasn't true
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:12.760]  or twist some things now they'll just say complete lies or they'll completely
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.200]  twist what I've said or done and a lot of people hear that they go well I better

[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:26.920]  bring down so the truth is they just want you to see me getting attacked and
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.160]  want to intimidate you from speaking out that's all this is it's why they're
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.880]  encouraging Trump supporters getting beat up your houses getting burnt down

[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.400]  I gotta be careful about what I say but Trump's wife can't even get one of the
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:50.720]  famous gown makers to make her gown it's on drugs today that his kids are
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.640]  getting harassed all over Manhattan I have people used to have somebody once

[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:04.440]  it's every day now and I mean aggressive and they're just holier than now like
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:08.600]  brown shirts running around you know knocking out shop windows and people
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:15.040]  they disagreed with in Germany I mean they are crazed they're ignorant but
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:20.360]  they just feel good because the mainstream media is their God and we've
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:27.760]  got the EU all of it naming us saying shut us down and the censorship starting
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.920]  so here's the deal I've seen some fools other websites though good shutout
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.560]  shows down you know like they're jealous of it you understand that if they can
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.480]  shut us down they can shut you down but where's your sense of decency I'm not
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:45.720]  gonna get shut down I'll be one of the last people standing they shut off
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.640]  little people first that's how the censorship on Facebook and Google's
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:54.400]  always work they're just selling the idea with household names like drudge and
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.760]  Breitbart and info wars and they're naming us you understand how dangerous
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:05.520]  that is they're passing laws like they did today countering disinformation
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.120]  propaganda how's it disinformation to point out CNN's a bunch of liars and
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.080]  got caught in wiki leaks are a lot about WMD's we're gonna take your phone calls
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.800]  the next segment but you know Megan Kelly and people say they're hated now
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.960]  because Donald Trump you viciously attacked you lied about people you went
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.840]  after people and then when somebody hits back you freak out it's like the head
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:30.680]  of that union after Trump only got 1,080 something of the 1400 jobs back the
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:35.400]  union couldn't do it Obama didn't even try they bitched at him and Trump said
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:40.640]  what is your problem no wonder you you you lost all the jobs griping at me for
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.200]  keeping 80 plus percent and they have the Washington Post saying Trump's gonna
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:51.040]  get people killed that's right when they punch you you just talk back to them
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.720]  you're gonna get people kill Alex Jones talking about the Podesta emails he's
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.840]  gonna get people killed well they're the ones in Newsweek and Time the New York
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.920]  Times and LA Times saying kill Donald Trump you watch tomorrow it'll be
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.440]  conspiracy theorist Jones claims just because the former CIA people say have
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.440]  a new election on CNN that they're gonna try to kill Trump of course they're
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:21.160]  trying that they're hyping the the atmosphere the climate to do it before
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.760]  I go any further I'm not like other talk show hosts I don't plug every every
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:31.040]  segment products and things because it's unlistable I don't do that but

[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.280]  talked to in Japan or people I talked to in Russia people I talked to in Iceland
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.760]  or people I talked to in Brazil everywhere they say info wars in the
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:49.280]  last 15 20 years but it got big the last 15 there was no media there about what
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.480]  was happening and people began listening Nigel Farage it said that on air they
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.000]  got the Brexit to pass now the EU's ignoring it well I told you that would
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  happen now it'll become more apparent as dictatorial they're gonna lose once you
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.760]  force a dictatorship out in the open and they said no it's the info war for
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:12.480]  Russia more than half the people he said it on air half the people that he knocked
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.880]  on doors back when you can't wasn't growing for over a decade 25 years ago
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:19.640]  about 10 years later knocking on doors and all of a sudden info wars was so hot
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.360]  there was a time we're not as big as we were in the UK as we used to be we're
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:27.160]  like number 27 in the UK for a while but they started censoring and blocking us
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.560]  and things we're like 86 according to Concaster in the US that's just you know
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:37.320]  drudges like number three that's out of hundreds of millions of websites I'm not
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.640]  bragging I want you to know this message is dominant this message is popular
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:48.240]  because of you I mean it makes the globalist so mad that I talked to the
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.000]  president of the United States and I'm not gonna get into it or that he's
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.800]  bringing people in that may not have perfect records but behind the scenes
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.320]  they've pledged allegiance to the flag and restoring the Republic and you see
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.720]  the delivery already before he gets into office he's already the commander in
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.240]  chief it's the Trump way
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.920]  but the CIA was set up by British intelligence not the British people but
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:15.880]  the British Empire corporate structure that's admitted out of the Pratt Street
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:21.520]  CFR out of the OSS and it's really a foreign group and now it's trying to
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.600]  overthrow this country it's done it before it's killed presidents before
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.600]  and now it's saying we can't have Trump well you weren't you're not doing this
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.960]  to a flat-footed citizenry that trusts everything anymore but you know three
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:40.800]  networks and no so just crawl back in your hole but I want to say this and I'm
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.280]  going to the clip your calls Trump I just go with my gut I intellectually
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.120]  analyze things I'm very cold about it but one but then I go with my gut as the
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.320]  final analysis and I you know whenever I talk to Trump you want to tell him
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:58.040]  surges please cut the taxes and bring back the jobs and and absolutely in
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.480]  power the minorities what he goes I am I am with jobs so they're not dependent

[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.560]  on the air go ahead Alex hi Alex how you doing hey you know after now
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.720]  analyzing all this material regarding the fake news I gotta share something
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.600]  first of all I've been listening to you for well over 10 years and with anything
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.640]  I learned when I was in and I was in the military as a journalist and broadcasters
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.280]  you gotta check your facts and so part of an important part of my job is
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.720]  any of the four stars and analysis the information that we that our offices
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.000]  provide to the news media sometimes they got it right but sometimes they got it
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.640]  wrong and they corrected themselves we pointed out but man actually when we
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.640]  check the facts and after listening to all these years I check your facts and
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.720]  I'm gonna say like 99% of the time you're right on the money you got it you
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.280]  gotta write you know sometimes an explosive headline to get somebody's
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:55.120]  attention because for most part people are asleep well sir is it not explosive
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.520]  that they got really dirty CIA people that are known for overthrowing
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.640]  government saying let's have a new election you know Trump's illegitimate
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:07.640]  this is CNN saying remove the president Alex I have never in my life and I'm
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:11.160]  not that old but I'm not that young so I remember Bobby Kennedy getting shot
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.680]  okay let's just put it like that so that's my earliest political and we know
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.880]  there were up to nine CIA operatives photographed in that ballroom you bet
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:21.680]  you're bippy and so what I'm trying to say is that I have never seen such
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.200]  weaponized media in my life and you can see the little nuances the play on
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.080]  words they can be a subtlest you know as throwing an equip you know mocking
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.160]  somebody or questioning how they look to flat out lies and and you know that as
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:38.080]  well as I so the point is is that man I got you know if the folks are just
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.040]  listening the first time check the facts read what what what's written on
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.760]  info wars listen to what's what said and then check the facts and you're gonna
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.640]  find out whether you like it or not that you guys are on the money so let me
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.800]  ask you this question that gets your other point because your great color
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.280]  making these good points look Michael board hangs out with the top levels I
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.080]  know that from Hollywood folks he hangs out with the Rothschilds or Rockefellers
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.480]  the Steven Spielbergs and you know that's why he said look watch Trump's
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:06.320]  gonna win because he knew it was 15 20 points ahead and internal polls so I
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.640]  Hillary in the media was panicking they weren't arrogant they were acting and
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:12.520]  Mika knew about the internal she's like why are you so arrogant you're behind
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.920]  and they had you know her getting trouble because Mika they did know she was
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.440]  behind they were gonna steal it but they couldn't because it was such a big
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.720]  win when he comes out last week I played the clip and goes you watch don't just
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.720]  think I said he's gonna win but he's not getting in something's gonna happen and
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.680]  he starts smiling and I add that to a thousand other points I've got and
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:36.840]  history in my analysis I might I mean not my gut my my facts I told people on
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.520]  Friday watch they're gonna start calling for a new election and I even told crew
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:43.640]  watch it'll be Robert Bear because I know the usual players and boom they did
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.320]  it today I mean it's now happening yeah I mean look they are they are very
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:52.160]  pleased suddenly they have made some evil decision well I tell you what and
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:55.480]  see that's right off the bat for somebody with Michael Moore stature and
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.000]  the connections that he has and the people he has access to I would call
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.940]  him like the antithesis of you he's like the anti Alex Jones and if he is
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:07.440]  smiling and laughing and saying something's gonna happen that would prompt
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.440]  me if I was the Attorney General of the United States the head of the Secret
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.360]  Service to pay a little visit to Mr. Moore and find out just what is what is
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.880]  going on here anything and then all and I agree and if something happens to Trump
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:22.760]  all these people need to know you bet you bet and not only that him calling for
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.120]  an open March to disobey the laws and go to DC and stop the inauguration he's
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:31.440]  calling for insurrection I get what that's illegal I guarantee you if I call
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.120]  for shutting down a legal event that's insurrection that's that's that that's
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:39.400]  that's trying to foam it's racketeering you would you would be swat team no

[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.320]  years for you to develop DNA force for us it's been something that I've been
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.880]  working on for a long time Alex because I think it's very very important what the
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:19.640]  aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.240]  telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.040]  it runs out you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over a hundred and
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.480]  seventy-five different clinical trials it's one of the most effective
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:36.320]  substances in the world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve

[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.080]  three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems can keep
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:48.720]  eight hundred square feet incredibly clean this is a system I'm personally
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.200]  putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.080]  didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today and
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.200]  then for war store.com
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:08.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:22.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.640]  boy that Navy specials is a great color lightning let's go to Andrew
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.560]  let's go to Andrew and Pennsylvania Andrew you're on the air go ahead yeah
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.480]  Alex I want to get your opinion on a couple of inauspicious things that a
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.000]  couple people said about Donald Trump's day after the election David I said a
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.800]  lot of people that support Trump are under the impression that he's on the
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:51.080]  spider and I said I seriously doubt Trump's on the spider and a 32nd degree
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:55.240]  Freemason whose name I'm not one that I both I did speak to said Trump's father
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:59.440]  didn't have ties to the Freemasons not that Freemasons are bad or anything but
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.160]  it kind of makes you ask some questions and I raise some eyebrows about this
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.760]  whole thing so any comments on that? Sure I appreciate your call and a race
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.480]  through calls now and then over back tomorrow 11 a.m. and I'm gonna take a
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.040]  lot of calls this week coming up these are great questions I mean you can find
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:17.240]  Donald Trump at a race car race you know doing the devil sign joking or
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.720]  whatever you can see whatever I don't know about his dad and and Mason's I
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.840]  had a lot of great grandparents and people that were Masons and they were
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.920]  good people I mean have the Masons been taken over in some cases is George
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.360]  Washington right about that did the Illuminati try to take it over absolutely
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.840]  but I mean what matters is you judge a tree by its fruits and the globalists are
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.400]  really upset at him this is real they want us poor and controlled and you
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:48.520]  know folks think that I'm using NLP or something I've never taken any voice
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.840]  lessons or any speaking lessons I took a few courses in community college on in
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.280]  it was just worthless so that's why I'm getting out of college you know 25 years
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.000]  ago or whatever it was and started my own local radio show was successful so I
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.440]  have no formal training in speech or anything I'm speaking from the heart all
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.800]  that NLP and stuff is I have looked at it since people accused me of using it is
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.280]  just basically taking normal ways people talk that's effective and then
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:19.000]  falsely packaging it but I'm gonna sit back and watch what Trump does I don't
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.200]  think Trump's perfect but Trump isn't out to create austerity he's a different
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.320]  type of guy that's why he doesn't fit into the new world order model now we'll
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.280]  see what he does but they're trying to keep him from getting an office for a
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:34.920]  reason and all over the world there's rebellion against globalism David I
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.320]  guess he put that on the call deal about David Ike having questions David
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.920]  predicted there'd be a huge uprising as globalism in 2016 15 years ago I don't
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:48.880]  know how he did it and it's happening everywhere Nigel Farage isn't perfect
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.960]  David Ike's not perfect I'm not perfect but this is happening so so Trump is
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.120]  riding a wave of awakening whether he's perfect or not that's happening so
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.680]  again the globalists are trying to stop him from getting in folks for a reason so
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.720]  no I trust Donald Trump he's the real deal we'll see what happens let's talk
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:14.520]  to Paris in Ohio you're on the air Paris hey Alex thanks for the product ditto
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.720]  all that yeah I'll just call him cuz I like a lot of people I think I have a
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:25.560]  lot of friends in this country that respect in our intelligence but when
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:29.720]  they look at Donald Trump they don't see the idea that he represents all they
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:34.840]  see is that he's a successful businessman and through jealousy or envy or
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.920]  whatever they've lump him in with the same group of international bankers
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:49.160]  etc etc that have been given it to us high and hard for 50 or 60 years and my
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:54.320]  thing is like how do we get through to these people to let them understand that
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:59.120]  you know even if you're not crazy about the man himself the idea that he
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:05.000]  represents is a return to prosperity and a solution to all these problems that
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.840]  have caused all the hardships for our fellow Americans that Paris I just took
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:14.600]  a note of your call because I'm gonna take this clip and tomorrow I'm gonna
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.280]  shoot a special report around it and put it on the front and it's been ten
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.400]  minutes breaking this down because what you just hit is the heart of
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.600]  everything I talked about this last night in a special report I did where
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:28.520]  people go he's rich he must be bad and I'm like wealth from someone that made
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.200]  their money is good if they created things if they're central banks and did
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:37.600]  it through swindling and manipulation then it's bad and it's the big ultra
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:41.640]  rich that are pushing all the class envy to get rid of the middle class their
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:45.920]  their hereditary enemy so yeah people are very very jealous of a guy with a good
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:50.360]  looking wife and a guy that's successful and they think the fix must be in again
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:55.520]  he must be bad or it must be a big conspiracy see people go with these
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:59.920]  nebulous conspiracy theories they can't prove instead of the real conspiracies
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:05.720]  that are documented and coming out in the wiki leaks and more so absolutely I
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:09.560]  mean you got to reach out to him and explain no he doesn't want to cut
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.920]  corporate income tax because he wants more money he understands it will bring
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:16.480]  the money back to America because we have the highest of any major nation do
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:21.040]  you understand that's why there aren't the jobs and a lot of times they just
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.280]  have grown up in such a wealthy country they're spoiled brats and they kind of
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:28.680]  think mainstream TV's their friend so they spot what they heard they must be
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.200]  intellectual I appreciate your call it's a great question I'm gonna elaborate on
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.040]  that in a longer video I'm gonna shoot tomorrow because it's so important let's
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:42.240]  go ahead and talk to Joe in Florida you're on the air hey Alex I was in the
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.440]  movie theater last night and once they dim the lights and got everyone's
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:50.120]  attention they ran two back-to-back commercials for MSNBC showing their
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.720]  popular anchors with slogans like when the going gets tough come to us we are
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.840]  the professionals and the best one we're the ones you can trust yeah what I've
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:04.600]  seen movies in theaters this year I'm a big movie goer first time I've ever
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:08.040]  seen anything like this years I've never seen an ad like this before in a movie
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  theater yeah that's because it's not an ad and actually already saw an article
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:15.480]  and what was it a variety I think a few days ago I meant to cover that the
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:19.840]  government is is working with the big production houses the communist shinies
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.780]  are buying the major six as we speak and the process to put propaganda in the
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:30.080]  ads and to just redouble their domestic propaganda that Congress passed a law
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:33.640]  three years ago they can engage in lying today they passed a law giving them
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:37.400]  hundreds of millions of dollars to do it and so they're writing the scripts the
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:42.800]  information to now just brainwash you and make you watch their channel even
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.520]  though you won't watch it on cable and know their liars it's called force
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:51.360]  feeding and so they've also announced that they're gonna force feed kids in
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:57.840]  school CNN and MSNBC as young as six years old so it oh my gosh our brain
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:02.360]  watching didn't work we've got to intensify at 50 times so that's basically
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:07.800]  what's being announced and all you do is basically let that theater chain know
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:10.520]  I'm not coming to you anymore because you're running those but this is an
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:15.620]  act of desperation the mainstream media has died this is defibrillators on it
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:19.960]  trying to get it back up yeah I mean they're showing racial matter space and
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:26.000]  they're saying we're the ones you can trust right down the middle well I mean
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  look Rachel Maddow is an abomination and so are all these people make a
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.320]  Brzezinski admits now they were censored for being just critical mildly of
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.760]  Hillary trying to support her that she was really behind because they had the
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  you know real pulse and to stop being arrogant thank you Joe yeah no this is
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:43.720]  the eight look they're gonna try to shut us down and force feed you I mean you
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.920]  want to live in authority and what's crazy is they're acting like Trump's
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:50.600]  never gonna get in they're just passing the laws doing it all as if he's not
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.840]  gonna come in and the question is will he reverse it this is this we're living
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:59.520]  in an action invention you're we're all living in an action adventure movie right

[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.880]  want to say something about the reason Donald Trump is such a target is because
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:25.800]  he's telling truth in in Egypt Pharaoh was scared to death of the Israelite
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.600]  because they would rise up against him and and he had him killed and and the
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:36.200]  same thing when Jesus was born he was the truth and and many times God will
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:41.760]  use an imperfect vessel like Trump to do this and there's undoubtedly this is
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.480]  Providence happening I agree with you on call me back Marcus I love you I gotta

[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:03.120]  said for a year that they're gonna say Trump if you get the nomination if you
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.400]  get if he if he wins the presidency there in there in hundreds of newspapers

[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.760]  infowars.com the headline but the crosshairs and thank God you're talking
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:21.080]  about sir they wouldn't have the CIA out saying he's a foreign asset unless they
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.440]  were getting ready to shine papers Obama may have papers on his desk I'm not
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:29.240]  getting. No we're screaming you got a screaming this week because this can be
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.520]  the big story. Listen Obama's engaged in so many crimes so much illegal
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.640]  droning criminal activity opening the borders I'm telling you the elites are
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.720]  asking Obama right now to sign the paperwork to kill the 45th. I love you
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:46.240]  brother. And I'll just say it I mean I'll just say it I mean they've got people
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.920]  on TV that have overthrown foreign governments that run hit squads saying
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.880]  Trump's illegitimate a Russian agent we should have new elections I'm not saying
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.360]  Barrie himself is involving anything like that but I'm telling you when they
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.160]  come out from the rocks like this they're taking the gloves off and these
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.960]  are the foreign globalists that run this country that's what they're claiming some
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:05.920]  foreign power the Russians can barely run their own country.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:09.400]  George Soros admits he's tried to overthrow Russia five or six times the
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.480]  last few years. I'm out of time for Sean and Chris and Cash and others call me
