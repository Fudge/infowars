[00:00.000 --> 00:26.900]  It's Friday, June 28th, 2019, and the clock is ticking down as we approach the crossroads.
[00:26.900 --> 00:33.260]  Will humanity accept global governance run by private, ruthless technocrats, or will
[00:33.260 --> 00:39.260]  we leap forward again towards the Renaissance, towards the nation-state, and towards the
[00:39.260 --> 00:42.900]  empowerment of the individual and the human family?
[00:42.900 --> 00:48.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing astounding routes of the globalist forces across the
[00:48.960 --> 00:49.960]  planet.
[00:49.960 --> 00:57.460]  It is because nationalists in the United States, in the last 60 years, going back to the John
[00:57.460 --> 01:05.260]  Burt society and others, accurately analyzed the global corporate structure of the globalist,
[01:05.260 --> 01:10.060]  and their plan for the future to destroy the nation-states, collapse the borders, impoverish
[01:10.060 --> 01:17.500]  the people, open the borders, and now, because of sites like Info Wars, we were able to popularize
[01:17.500 --> 01:25.500]  in the last 25 years what was only academic, it was only learned specialists and high-level
[01:25.500 --> 01:31.820]  military officers and FBI agents and those types of people who were trained to identify
[01:31.820 --> 01:37.700]  foreign enemies, corporate takeover systems that were aware of our government being bought
[01:37.700 --> 01:43.260]  off and being controlled, international sovereignty and wealth being transferred.
[01:43.260 --> 01:49.340]  This is just how Russia and the Soviets were run by outside oligarchs and outside banks.
[01:49.340 --> 01:54.380]  Some of the very same banking dynasties and families that ran the Soviet Union are the
[01:54.380 --> 01:59.820]  groups taking over America, literally the Rothschilds, the British royal family, a lot
[01:59.820 --> 02:00.820]  of their money.
[02:00.820 --> 02:05.060]  If you ever wonder why you turn on the news, you think that the U.S. is run by the royal
[02:05.060 --> 02:12.580]  family and everyone's worshiping them, they were hated up until the 1920s and literally
[02:12.580 --> 02:18.700]  hundreds of millions of dollars at that time, billions today, was spent anglifying is what
[02:18.700 --> 02:24.540]  they called it and the East Coast even affected a British accent, all of this to again bring
[02:24.540 --> 02:29.700]  us into this global empire that Cecil Rhodes and others envisioned, but I'm digressing
[02:29.700 --> 02:30.820]  into history.
[02:30.820 --> 02:37.460]  The reason I raise all this is we have come so incredibly far that they thought they would
[02:37.460 --> 02:42.380]  just build their world government, we'd all just watch sports and then we would just give
[02:42.380 --> 02:46.060]  up our culture, give up our money, give up our children, give up our language, give up
[02:46.060 --> 02:50.820]  our futures and ladies and gentlemen, that has not happened.
[02:50.820 --> 02:55.100]  Everywhere globalists are being voted out of office, everywhere they're fighting back,
[02:55.100 --> 03:01.100]  but they're losing ground because once their authoritarian system is identified, it's
[03:01.100 --> 03:02.100]  over.
[03:02.100 --> 03:06.620]  Now I've said this thousands of times and I beat this horse because it's not dead, folks.
[03:06.620 --> 03:10.220]  We're riding this horse to victory and incredible things are happening.
[03:10.220 --> 03:13.900]  Robert Barnes and Owen Troyer are going to be hosting today.
[03:13.900 --> 03:19.340]  The crew has convinced me to take off at least a few hours to be with my family, but I am
[03:19.340 --> 03:25.140]  taping this morning some very important pieces for the broadcast.
[03:25.140 --> 03:29.140]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Vladimir Putin has come out and said globalism is basically
[03:29.140 --> 03:35.220]  dead, that it's a cancer, that it's designed to basically destroy our nations and that
[03:35.220 --> 03:37.140]  people are rejecting it everywhere.
[03:37.140 --> 03:43.340]  It is incredible and I'm going to read his quotes for you coming up at the bottom of
[03:43.340 --> 03:44.340]  the hour.
[03:44.340 --> 03:50.220]  The article is again up on newswars.com and infowars.com, but whatever you do realize,
[03:50.220 --> 03:56.700]  we are the heart of the reboot of nationalism and capitalism and Christianity and freedom
[03:56.700 --> 03:58.340]  against the globalist onslaught.
[03:58.340 --> 03:59.900]  You are the reboot.
[03:59.900 --> 04:01.420]  You are the megaphone.
[04:01.420 --> 04:05.540]  You are the lightning that Zeus throws down from heaven.
[04:05.540 --> 04:09.540]  You are the resistance and when you spread the articles and when you spread the videos,
[04:09.540 --> 04:14.220]  it is the very oxygen in this fight that allows us to move forward.
[04:14.220 --> 04:20.780]  So please, whatever you do, spread the word about the live broadcast on local AM and FM,
[04:20.780 --> 04:25.580]  on shortwave, on satellite, and of course, at infowars.com, forward slash show.
[04:25.580 --> 04:27.140]  We're going to go to break.
[04:27.140 --> 04:30.180]  Robert Barnes and others are going to have all the big highlights of the incredible debate
[04:30.180 --> 04:34.780]  last night where the Democrats say that they openly represent illegal aliens and that's
[04:34.780 --> 04:36.860]  the party that they are.
[04:36.860 --> 04:37.860]  It's just incredible.
[04:37.860 --> 04:43.300]  So we've never seen such clear cut lines of globalism versus Americanism as we're seeing
[04:43.300 --> 04:50.300]  right now.
[04:50.300 --> 04:56.780]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[04:56.780 --> 05:04.740]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation where
[05:04.740 --> 05:10.420]  the mainstream media, in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[05:10.420 --> 05:17.660]  The false claim that you purposely sent kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous
[05:17.660 --> 05:19.500]  as well as false.
[05:19.500 --> 05:20.820]  It's a smear.
[05:20.820 --> 05:22.780]  Somebody sends you, somebody that's encrypted.
[05:22.780 --> 05:24.220]  You don't even open it.
[05:24.220 --> 05:29.580]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you.
[05:29.580 --> 05:31.180]  This is Kafkaesque.
[05:31.180 --> 05:32.180]  This is bizarre.
[05:32.180 --> 05:38.580]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[05:38.580 --> 05:43.220]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected
[05:43.220 --> 05:44.220]  and clarified.
[05:44.220 --> 05:45.820]  But I went to where the big boys?
[05:45.820 --> 05:47.020]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[05:47.020 --> 05:48.020]  Where's Associated Press?
[05:48.020 --> 05:53.100]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was
[05:53.100 --> 05:54.100]  inaccurate?
[05:54.100 --> 05:59.020]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your
[05:59.020 --> 06:09.020]  dollars.
[06:09.020 --> 06:10.020]  You found it.
[06:10.020 --> 06:12.020]  The tip of the spear.
[06:12.020 --> 06:19.020]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[06:19.020 --> 06:26.020]  Well, here we are.
[06:26.020 --> 06:35.260]  On June 28th, 2019, this is the Alex Jones show, Owen Troyer and Robert Barnes filling
[06:35.260 --> 06:36.260]  in for Alex today.
[06:36.260 --> 06:40.660]  But we will be hearing from Alex throughout the broadcast.
[06:40.660 --> 06:45.020]  We also have Carpe Donckton, who is going to be joining us in the second hour.
[06:45.020 --> 06:51.500]  But I think, I think Bob, me and you need to discuss the clown show that was last night
[06:51.500 --> 06:56.380]  and more than anything, just kind of reflecting on it and then, and you and I were briefly
[06:56.380 --> 06:58.780]  talking before we went live here.
[06:58.780 --> 07:02.500]  This isn't really, you know, us to pat ourselves on the back, but pretty much all everything
[07:02.500 --> 07:04.540]  we said before the debate came true.
[07:04.540 --> 07:07.700]  Biden ended up being the punching bag that took the licks.
[07:07.700 --> 07:09.020]  He was the big loser.
[07:09.020 --> 07:11.100]  Yang was the most Googled search term.
[07:11.100 --> 07:14.980]  He was the one that created the most curiosity about him as a candidate.
[07:14.980 --> 07:20.100]  Marion Williamson creeped up as number two just for the sheer shock value and the oddity
[07:20.100 --> 07:22.340]  that she is.
[07:22.340 --> 07:26.740]  We saw obviously the Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, exchange go viral.
[07:26.740 --> 07:30.020]  That was kind of, I think the highlight from the thing is Biden getting the licks and getting
[07:30.020 --> 07:31.020]  cut over the eye.
[07:31.020 --> 07:33.100]  He's bleeding out now politically.
[07:33.100 --> 07:37.260]  But I, you were talking to how you were watching MSNBC afterwards.
[07:37.260 --> 07:41.180]  I was kind of watching some of the commentary afterward too.
[07:41.180 --> 07:47.020]  And it's just amazing how out of touch mainstream media is with the average American voter.
[07:47.020 --> 07:53.300]  And it almost made me realize or re-realize that most of these people when they go on
[07:53.300 --> 08:01.380]  air, like a Rachel Maddow or a Chris Hayes or a Chuck Todd, they're telling their audience
[08:01.380 --> 08:02.380]  what to think.
[08:02.380 --> 08:07.540]  They're in a position of a dictate telling the audience what to think where we're just
[08:07.540 --> 08:09.500]  saying, Hey, here's what we see.
[08:09.500 --> 08:10.500]  Here's the evidence.
[08:10.500 --> 08:11.500]  Here's the facts.
[08:11.500 --> 08:12.500]  Here's how we think it's going to go.
[08:12.500 --> 08:14.620]  Turns out to go that way because we're just in touch with reality.
[08:14.620 --> 08:18.580]  I mean, it's amazing to watch these people talk down to their audience.
[08:18.580 --> 08:23.780]  There's no wonder they're losing ratings at an astronomical rate.
[08:23.780 --> 08:24.780]  No doubt.
[08:24.780 --> 08:28.620]  And what's amazing is if you go back and look at the video that got Infowars kicked off
[08:28.620 --> 08:34.200]  of Instagram, it was the video that showed that Joe Biden had serious cognitive capacity
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.200]  problems.
[08:35.200 --> 08:40.140]  And the net effect of those cognitive capacity problems got you, everybody was commenting
[08:40.140 --> 08:41.140]  on it last night.
[08:41.140 --> 08:44.180]  So even you had David Axelrod commenting on it.
[08:44.180 --> 08:47.580]  You had Sean Trendy for Real Clear Politics commenting on it.
[08:47.580 --> 08:51.980]  And people, I mean, Donald Trump Jr. in his own inimitable way commenting on it, whether
[08:51.980 --> 08:54.220]  that was Joe Biden's attempt to speak Spanish.
[08:54.220 --> 08:59.260]  But what you really saw was this is someone who has a serious health problem.
[08:59.260 --> 09:00.940]  And it was only Infowars that covered it.
[09:00.940 --> 09:03.860]  It was attacked by CNN and Oliver Darcy and everybody else.
[09:03.860 --> 09:04.860]  This was fake news.
[09:04.860 --> 09:08.300]  When, in fact, it turned out to be once again, tomorrow's news today.
[09:08.300 --> 09:10.380]  Because what happened is, in fact, everybody got to see it.
[09:10.380 --> 09:15.300]  He couldn't finish a single sentence of a single question without him working at it.
[09:15.300 --> 09:16.820]  It was like watching a stroke victim.
[09:16.820 --> 09:19.140]  I mean, it was a sad thing to watch.
[09:19.140 --> 09:22.380]  Well, he admits he had his head cut open and he had the surgery on it.
[09:22.380 --> 09:26.660]  And you've never seen a candidate when you've got 10 people on stage fighting for time volunteer
[09:26.660 --> 09:27.660]  to stop talking.
[09:27.660 --> 09:28.660]  Oh, exactly.
[09:28.660 --> 09:32.220]  I mean, that was clearly his, like sometimes when I have people in trials, I give them a
[09:32.220 --> 09:33.220]  fallback point.
[09:33.220 --> 09:36.660]  It's like, if you get into a jam and you can't remember where you're at and you're sort of
[09:36.660 --> 09:40.820]  emotionally upset, you remember your main point and make that point.
[09:40.820 --> 09:42.300]  And clearly, that was his.
[09:42.300 --> 09:47.180]  His point was, hey, by the way, if you completely stall out, if the brain just won't function
[09:47.180 --> 09:50.140]  at all up there, say, my time's up, my time's up.
[09:50.140 --> 09:53.900]  And of course, now that's become the meme and it may be the closing statement of Joe
[09:53.900 --> 09:57.740]  Biden's career, sorry, my time's up.
[09:57.740 --> 10:03.100]  I mean, it will be somewhat sad, not entirely sad, but we may have seen the end of Joe Biden
[10:03.100 --> 10:04.100]  last night.
[10:04.100 --> 10:05.100]  That was it.
[10:05.100 --> 10:07.660]  My time is up exactly.
[10:07.660 --> 10:09.660]  And again, appropriately said, sorry.
[10:09.660 --> 10:13.860]  But look at, if you just look at the way the news, they force Biden down your throat.
[10:13.860 --> 10:17.780]  They tell you Biden is leading in the polls, Biden, Biden, Biden.
[10:17.780 --> 10:20.860]  He can't even complete a political debate.
[10:20.860 --> 10:21.860]  Really is what it was.
[10:21.860 --> 10:22.860]  Oh, I'm out.
[10:22.860 --> 10:24.340]  And you know, that's him tapping out.
[10:24.340 --> 10:25.780]  He couldn't even complete the debate.
[10:25.780 --> 10:27.860]  It was a tap out before it was like the guy who walked into the room.
[10:27.860 --> 10:31.260]  I get it was a Peter, whatever his name was that fought Mike Tyson when Mike Tyson got
[10:31.260 --> 10:36.140]  about a jail and his guy in the corner couldn't wait to throw the white towel in when he had
[10:36.140 --> 10:37.140]  it ready.
[10:37.140 --> 10:40.580]  I mean, within like 20 seconds, uh, that was basically Joe Biden last night.
[10:40.580 --> 10:43.860]  And so it's, uh, he has serious, there was no Mike Tyson on that stage though.
[10:43.860 --> 10:44.860]  Let's be clear.
[10:44.860 --> 10:49.260]  Kamala Harris is not Mike Tyson, you didn't need to be because they were ready to quit
[10:49.260 --> 10:50.860]  no matter who they were fighting.
[10:50.860 --> 10:53.900]  And I think I always, I thought Biden was not going to run.
[10:53.900 --> 10:57.260]  And the reason why I thought Biden was not going to run was because he's his age as
[10:57.260 --> 11:00.380]  cognitive health issues, his family corruption issues.
[11:00.380 --> 11:03.980]  Now he managed to dodge any of those consequential questions, but he can't do the rest of the
[11:03.980 --> 11:04.980]  debate.
[11:04.980 --> 11:09.180]  Here's a guy who couldn't even handle defending his busing position 40, 50 years ago.
[11:09.180 --> 11:10.580]  That's the political place he's at.
[11:10.580 --> 11:14.700]  He is not, he, we got a Biden gaff and we got a Biden hammer.
[11:14.700 --> 11:15.700]  Biden was hammered by Harris.
[11:15.700 --> 11:19.580]  Uh, and then we got the Biden gaff when he said the very first thing he will do as president
[11:19.580 --> 11:24.580]  is make sure he beats the other guy who's president, which is the only way you can beat
[11:24.580 --> 11:29.140]  Donald Trump is if you've, uh, actually already beaten Donald Trump in terms of being president.
[11:29.140 --> 11:31.700]  So all of the problems of Biden were there.
[11:31.700 --> 11:37.860]  And when it gets to the point that David Axelrod on CNN, the Obama campaign manager is talking
[11:37.860 --> 11:41.700]  about it, then you know how bad it is because they were never willing to acknowledge Hillary's
[11:41.700 --> 11:42.700]  health problems.
[11:42.700 --> 11:46.460]  No, no, no, no, no, but they, but that's the thing too is again, it comes, these people
[11:46.460 --> 11:50.340]  are such dictates on the air, they'll sit here and they'll complain about Trump.
[11:50.340 --> 11:53.180]  Oh, Trump needs to have a physical Trump's too old.
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.180]  He's unfit.
[11:54.180 --> 11:55.180]  He's unhealthy.
[11:55.180 --> 11:57.380]  Meanwhile, he's never had a drug or a drop of alcohol in his life.
[11:57.380 --> 11:58.540]  I don't know how many people could say that.
[11:58.540 --> 11:59.540]  I don't know.
[11:59.540 --> 12:00.540]  I certainly couldn't.
[12:00.540 --> 12:02.460]  So it's like, he's clearly there.
[12:02.460 --> 12:04.540]  Yeah, is he old, but he's, he's with it.
[12:04.540 --> 12:05.540]  He's got the energy.
[12:05.540 --> 12:07.220]  He has still the vitality.
[12:07.220 --> 12:08.220]  Biden lacks all of it.
[12:08.220 --> 12:11.460]  But no, Trump has the, he's unfit, but Biden somehow is fed.
[12:11.460 --> 12:17.060]  I mean, again, really the aftermath of this in the media, I think just reminded me not
[12:17.060 --> 12:21.540]  even how fake they are, but just how authoritarian they are.
[12:21.540 --> 12:25.340]  And I think they basically forced Biden to run because they thought everybody else was
[12:25.340 --> 12:26.340]  weak.
[12:26.340 --> 12:27.340]  He's desperate.
[12:27.340 --> 12:28.340]  Exactly.
[12:28.340 --> 12:30.740]  He was doing really well against Trump in the polls.
[12:30.740 --> 12:34.500]  Theoretically, he's blue collar Joe, so he could appeal to middle America in the middle
[12:34.500 --> 12:36.140]  part of the country.
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.820]  And I think what they saw last night was, oh man, this guy couldn't stand five seconds
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.900]  against Trump.
[12:40.900 --> 12:43.740]  And that's why they were willing to throw him to the curb and throw him off the cliff
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.820]  and in half a second.
[12:45.820 --> 12:49.420]  And he enabled that because of his health problems, because of his corruption problems
[12:49.420 --> 12:50.420]  that are still lingering.
[12:50.420 --> 12:55.220]  But when they saw that Kamala Harris could bait him, literally with race bait, could
[12:55.220 --> 12:58.860]  debate him that quickly, that easily, and this wasn't something that came out of nowhere.
[12:58.860 --> 13:02.300]  This wasn't like all the debating of Donald Trump, where during the debates, he heard
[13:02.300 --> 13:06.580]  something for the very first time right in the middle of the debate in some sort of attack.
[13:06.580 --> 13:10.340]  Here, this is an attack that they've been waging on Biden for two weeks.
[13:10.340 --> 13:11.420]  This is not new.
[13:11.420 --> 13:15.380]  This is something that they've been testing over and over and over again, and he still
[13:15.380 --> 13:17.380]  wasn't ready to defend it.
[13:17.380 --> 13:22.180]  And I think part of that, my guess is he had a prepped answer, is cognitive capacity.
[13:22.180 --> 13:27.180]  Well, and if Kamala Harris can outwit you, you're in trouble.
[13:27.180 --> 13:28.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[13:28.180 --> 13:31.460]  She's still the dumbest lawyer I've ever gone up against in court.
[13:31.460 --> 13:34.380]  This is someone who failed the bar exam in California twice.
[13:34.380 --> 13:37.300]  Well, luckily in California, you don't have to pass the bar, right?
[13:37.300 --> 13:38.780]  You can still practice law.
[13:38.780 --> 13:41.660]  You don't have to go to an accredited law school, but you still have to pass the bar.
[13:41.660 --> 13:42.900]  The Kamala Harris University.
[13:42.900 --> 13:43.900]  Yes, exactly.
[13:43.900 --> 13:44.900]  The law.
[13:44.900 --> 13:45.900]  Yes.
[13:45.900 --> 13:46.900]  She has a stamp.
[13:46.900 --> 13:48.900]  She'll stamp on your wrist.
[13:48.900 --> 13:50.740]  And it was repeated failures.
[13:50.740 --> 13:55.300]  So the, I mean, the fact that they did so, that Biden was so unready for her, knowing
[13:55.300 --> 14:01.020]  it was coming from weeks in advance, couldn't finish sentences, struggled to get math statistics
[14:01.020 --> 14:05.820]  right, was misanalogizing different components, struggling to cite the names of statutes,
[14:05.820 --> 14:10.300]  struggling to remember what his talking points were, that without a teleprompter, Joe Biden
[14:10.300 --> 14:11.300]  is DOA.
[14:11.300 --> 14:15.860]  Now, that little tidbit that the media did not cover, after the debate, Joe Biden refused
[14:15.860 --> 14:17.420]  to go into the little news section.
[14:17.420 --> 14:19.820]  So everybody goes and does all the interviews afterwards.
[14:19.820 --> 14:20.820]  Trump loved the Dukes.
[14:20.820 --> 14:21.820]  He loved his kill.
[14:21.820 --> 14:25.140]  He was just going there and slay, slay, slay, slay, slay.
[14:25.140 --> 14:26.140]  Joe Biden refused to.
[14:26.140 --> 14:28.140]  They said, oh, you know, he doesn't need to.
[14:28.140 --> 14:33.020]  So, I mean, so it was like a Mad Max joke, you know, to grandpa, you know, between Bernie
[14:33.020 --> 14:36.060]  and Biden, two grandpa under only one grandpa left.
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.820]  And I think that Joe is really done.
[14:37.820 --> 14:39.940]  Uncle Joe is the Joe that it's like Ross Brosez.
[14:39.940 --> 14:41.340]  It's time to put him in the basement.
[14:41.340 --> 14:47.420]  Well, and I think it now the Democrat Party establishment elite are in panic mode because
[14:47.420 --> 14:50.020]  Joe Biden is obviously who they wanted and there's no way.
[14:50.020 --> 14:53.180]  I mean, maybe they still think they can force him down America's throats, but that would
[14:53.180 --> 14:54.180]  be.
[14:54.180 --> 14:57.020]  I think based on the media reaction, they were like, oh, he can't handle it against
[14:57.020 --> 14:58.020]  Trump.
[14:58.020 --> 14:59.020]  And that was his only utility.
[14:59.020 --> 15:00.020]  We'll have to see.
[15:00.020 --> 15:01.500]  So here's what's going to happen today on the Alex Jones show.
[15:01.500 --> 15:03.660]  We've got Alex coming up in the next segment.
[15:03.660 --> 15:05.660]  He's going to break all of this down.
[15:05.660 --> 15:07.580]  We've got Carpe Doctin coming up in the second hour.
[15:07.580 --> 15:11.260]  I think we'll open up the phone lines, see what America thought about last night's debate
[15:11.260 --> 15:12.260]  as well.
[15:12.260 --> 15:17.300]  We'll take your calls and folks, we want to continue extended coverage like we had
[15:17.300 --> 15:19.340]  for the last two nights of the Democrat debates.
[15:19.340 --> 15:21.180]  I mean, the clown world did not let down.
[15:21.180 --> 15:26.580]  I mean, between transsexual men getting abortions and Joe Biden first thing when he gets into
[15:26.580 --> 15:28.380]  office is to getting into office.
[15:28.380 --> 15:31.300]  I mean, just incredible stuff from the clown show.
[15:31.300 --> 15:34.140]  And it's all possible with your support at info or store.com.

[15:58.580 --> 16:00.580]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.580 --> 16:04.540]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.540 --> 16:06.060]  I sued the IRS and won.
[16:06.060 --> 16:09.020]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.020 --> 16:12.300]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:12.300 --> 16:14.540]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.540 --> 16:15.860]  I can help you too.
[16:15.860 --> 16:18.860]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:18.860 --> 16:21.100]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:21.100 --> 16:29.260]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.260 --> 16:33.020]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:33.020 --> 16:37.780]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[16:37.780 --> 16:39.700]  at heart and body extract?
[16:39.700 --> 16:42.860]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[16:42.860 --> 16:44.180]  Don't just take my word for it.
[16:44.180 --> 16:51.820]  Check out all of the success stories at hbxtrack.com or to order call 866-295-5305.

[16:56.660 --> 16:58.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:58.820 --> 17:03.380]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[17:03.380 --> 17:05.300]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:05.300 --> 17:06.980]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:06.980 --> 17:12.460]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[17:12.460 --> 17:13.540]  my life.
[17:13.540 --> 17:18.820]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:18.820 --> 17:24.020]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[17:24.020 --> 17:27.140]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[17:27.140 --> 17:31.820]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[17:31.820 --> 17:34.140]  and totally change your life.
[17:34.140 --> 17:39.380]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[17:53.620 --> 17:57.620]  That's 800-506-6740.
[17:57.620 --> 18:01.660]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.660 --> 18:02.660]  Marcus here on the air.
[18:02.660 --> 18:03.660]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.660 --> 18:06.260]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.260 --> 18:10.180]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.180 --> 18:12.380]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.380 --> 18:16.780]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.780 --> 18:21.180]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[18:21.180 --> 18:22.180]  2020.
[18:22.180 --> 18:23.180]  That's it.
[18:23.180 --> 18:25.180]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.180 --> 18:27.980]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:27.980 --> 18:29.260]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.260 --> 18:30.260]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.260 --> 18:33.460]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.460 --> 18:35.380]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.380 --> 18:38.340]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.340 --> 18:40.580]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.580 --> 18:43.820]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.820 --> 18:48.420]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.420 --> 18:49.740]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.740 --> 18:51.660]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.660 --> 18:55.700]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[18:55.700 --> 18:58.180]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.180 --> 19:00.860]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:00.860 --> 19:03.980]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the maximum alert.
[19:03.980 --> 19:04.980]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[19:04.980 --> 19:06.580]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[19:06.580 --> 19:08.180]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[19:08.180 --> 19:11.860]  We need financial support, and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at
[19:11.860 --> 19:12.860]  infowarstore.com.

[19:54.780 --> 19:55.780]  Thank you for your support.
[19:55.780 --> 19:58.900]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[19:58.900 --> 20:03.020]  We're not going to back down.
[20:03.020 --> 20:28.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.020 --> 20:35.980]  Vladimir Putin dropped the bombshell of bombshells because what he said is so incredibly true
[20:35.980 --> 20:42.380]  that no one, no world leaders, except for he and Trump, would dare say it.
[20:42.380 --> 20:48.260]  Globalism is a neoliberal fascistic system that overwrites every culture and destroys
[20:48.260 --> 20:53.820]  any type of independence and is designed to create as much debt over the nation state,
[20:53.820 --> 20:56.100]  individual and family as possible.
[20:56.100 --> 21:01.860]  And Putin understands this because Russia labored for decades under a globalist system
[21:01.860 --> 21:05.420]  using communism as the management program.
[21:05.420 --> 21:11.380]  And Putin has come out, the articles on infowars.com, and he has talked about the elephant in the
[21:11.380 --> 21:17.260]  room and said that globalism is basically dead because liberalism as an operating system
[21:17.260 --> 21:23.580]  has been so betrayed that everyone is rejecting it because it's not classical liberalism.
[21:23.580 --> 21:26.060]  It's globalism.
[21:26.060 --> 21:32.660]  Liberalism is dead in the hearts of men and women and in our minds, but the globalists
[21:32.660 --> 21:34.260]  are still in place.
[21:34.260 --> 21:38.700]  And that's the paradox that they have stolen the money, they control the banks, they control
[21:38.700 --> 21:43.780]  much of the infrastructure, but they're losing the hearts and minds at an accelerated rate.
[21:43.780 --> 21:48.060]  And that's why they're doing a Hail Mary to flood Europe and flood the United States
[21:48.060 --> 21:53.180]  and flood Canada and flood Australia and New Zealand with as many military age men as
[21:53.180 --> 22:00.060]  possible who spend up to a year, usually six months, in hardcore UN refugee camps where
[22:00.060 --> 22:04.260]  they are brainwashed to hate the West and to be social justice warriors.
[22:04.260 --> 22:10.780]  They're then given backpacks with food, medicine, and thousands of euros or dollars and sent
[22:10.780 --> 22:12.660]  in to the West.
[22:12.660 --> 22:18.580]  These are the equivalent of paratroopers, you know, jumping out of airplanes and invading
[22:18.580 --> 22:24.500]  your country when the Nazis famously invaded Greece with the first paratrooper attack
[22:24.500 --> 22:25.500]  of World War II.
[22:25.500 --> 22:32.380]  That's all this is, is a military invasion, and there's a very important article on Town
[22:32.380 --> 22:33.380]  Hall.
[22:33.380 --> 22:38.780]  There's other ones from the other major sites out there like Daily Caller that lay all of
[22:38.780 --> 22:39.780]  this out.
[22:39.780 --> 22:44.780]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[22:44.780 --> 22:55.580]  From Town Hall, the biggest winners of Thursday night's dem debate were illegal immigrants.
[22:55.580 --> 23:00.420]  The Democrats on stage Thursday night's debate looked more like they were competing to be
[23:00.420 --> 23:04.940]  the president of illegal immigrants than they were of Americans.
[23:04.940 --> 23:09.020]  Not only did all 10 Democrats on stage raise their hand when asked who supported giving
[23:09.020 --> 23:13.700]  illegal immigrants free healthcare, remember when they used to deny that, they also advocated
[23:13.700 --> 23:15.500]  for open borders.
[23:15.500 --> 23:19.540]  They went on to advocate for giving them driver's licenses, even letting them vote.
[23:19.540 --> 23:22.460]  This is the globalist takeover plan.
[23:22.460 --> 23:25.740]  Most Democrats raised their hand when asked whether they believed crossing the border
[23:25.740 --> 23:28.780]  illegally should be a civil offense rather than a crime.
[23:28.780 --> 23:31.860]  Even though a third of the children being brought in have been kidnapped and many end
[23:31.860 --> 23:34.620]  up dead, that's okay because it's liberal.
[23:34.620 --> 23:38.180]  Here were some of the responses to that on the issue of deportation.
[23:38.180 --> 23:42.180]  Buddha Judge said when he's president, well, just it's going to be totally legal and the
[23:42.180 --> 23:43.940]  borders are going to be open.
[23:43.940 --> 23:48.620]  Biden said that the person, someone who only offenses being here without documents, should
[23:48.620 --> 23:50.660]  not be the focus of deportation.
[23:50.660 --> 23:53.660]  We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.
[23:53.660 --> 23:56.540]  Well, we're basically totally open right now.
[23:56.540 --> 23:58.620]  90% don't show up to damn hearings.
[23:58.620 --> 23:59.620]  Swallows well.
[23:59.620 --> 24:03.900]  No, that person, someone who's only offenses being here without documents can be part of
[24:03.900 --> 24:05.500]  the great American experience.
[24:05.500 --> 24:07.140]  That person can contribute.
[24:07.140 --> 24:11.180]  My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America and we see the benefits
[24:11.180 --> 24:14.940]  when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they're not in the shadow
[24:14.940 --> 24:18.900]  of the economy, which is what the Democrats want to keep them in the shadow actually by
[24:18.900 --> 24:23.380]  not making them become documented when it goes on.
[24:23.380 --> 24:29.180]  It's just unbelievable to watch them all compete to bust the nationwide open.
[24:29.180 --> 24:35.420]  But again, this is the larger globalist plan and now it's out in the open.
[24:35.420 --> 24:39.980]  And Putin understands and Trump understands and we understand that the social contract
[24:39.980 --> 24:44.260]  has been broken and that the globalist are simply using the fact that the third world
[24:44.260 --> 24:49.060]  has close to 7 billion people in it and that they all want to come here and that they're
[24:49.060 --> 24:53.020]  all being weaponized before they get here and when they get here.
[24:53.020 --> 24:55.300]  They literally have training camps all over the country.
[24:55.300 --> 24:56.300]  This is even on CNN.
[24:56.300 --> 25:00.180]  They brag about it, where they take any illegal aliens and radicalize them.
[25:00.180 --> 25:04.980]  In Austin, Texas, in Atlanta, Georgia, in New York, it's everywhere.
[25:04.980 --> 25:10.100]  So I'm going to take you back live right now to Robert Barnes, Owen Schreuer, and others.
[25:10.100 --> 25:16.900]  And then my big breakdown on what Putin had to say at the G20 today is coming up in the
[25:16.900 --> 25:18.220]  next segment.
[25:18.220 --> 25:23.700]  And then Carpe Duncan is coming up next hour, the king of memes and so much more.
[25:23.700 --> 25:28.380]  But this is an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:28.380 --> 25:31.940]  And I just want to again encourage all of you to understand how important you are and
[25:31.940 --> 25:36.420]  to understand that your word of mouth is king and overrides the censors and that your financial

[26:15.660 --> 26:17.740]  And my daughter just walked over and said, hi, I love you, baby.
[26:17.740 --> 26:20.300]  So again, back to the crew in the ATX.
[26:20.300 --> 26:21.300]  More coming up.
[26:21.300 --> 26:24.820]  It's nice to have Alex be able to get out of the studio for a couple of days, spend
[26:24.820 --> 26:26.320]  some time with his family.
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.540]  And it's good to have you, Robert Barnes, attorney here, constitutional attorney in
[26:30.540 --> 26:32.860]  studio with me as well.
[26:32.860 --> 26:35.500]  And we're selling that Clown World t-shirt.
[26:35.500 --> 26:41.580]  I'm not even sure if we could have imagined that epic of a Clown Show.
[26:41.580 --> 26:47.300]  I mean, we're still kind of getting the reverb of some of these Clown candidates like Marianne
[26:47.300 --> 26:48.300]  Williamson.
[26:48.300 --> 26:51.700]  You've been enjoying yourself on Twitter, looking at some of our old tweets over here.
[26:51.700 --> 26:55.580]  Yeah, I mean, it's going to be, maybe it'll be the next t-shirt, it'll be sort of a meditate
[26:55.580 --> 26:59.740]  with Marianne, some of her wisdom from the past.
[26:59.740 --> 27:04.220]  So for example, we're all pregnant with other versions of ourselves, which made you abort
[27:04.220 --> 27:05.220]  that other version.
[27:05.220 --> 27:06.220]  Exactly.
[27:06.220 --> 27:07.460]  I mean, really, that's what Julian Castro was thinking.
[27:07.460 --> 27:11.540]  He was thinking of Marianne Williamson, hey, everybody's pregnant with someone else.
[27:11.540 --> 27:15.460]  So hey, shouldn't we be able to abort our own selves if our own selves don't want to
[27:15.460 --> 27:16.460]  be ourselves?
[27:16.460 --> 27:18.460]  So I mean, this was literally the Democratic debate.
[27:18.460 --> 27:20.340]  This is next level stuff.
[27:20.340 --> 27:21.580]  No question.
[27:21.580 --> 27:25.020]  Whether it's, you know, the next level of the asylum.
[27:25.020 --> 27:28.900]  So the, I mean, it was clear, it was a Clown world at multiple levels in the sense he had
[27:28.900 --> 27:32.140]  the old Clown going out and the new Clowns coming in.
[27:32.140 --> 27:33.820]  But you had some, some crazy.
[27:33.820 --> 27:35.720]  We need to have something.
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.980]  We already have the meme from The Simpsons, but it's like, it's like all the Democrats
[27:38.980 --> 27:45.620]  like pull up in a little car and they're like honking their horn.
[27:45.620 --> 27:47.140]  I mean, it's a joke.
[27:47.140 --> 27:48.140]  Completely.
[27:48.140 --> 27:50.340]  I mean, it's sad at a certain level.
[27:50.340 --> 27:52.500]  It's scary at another level.
[27:52.500 --> 27:55.380]  I think the, the president's tweets, he, people thought he would tweet a lot.
[27:55.380 --> 27:58.900]  He ended up doing only three tweets between all of both debates.
[27:58.900 --> 28:01.940]  The first one was that the first debate was mostly boring.
[28:01.940 --> 28:07.460]  And then the, the incredible Mike mess up and we'll have Carpe Dantaman at the next
[28:07.460 --> 28:12.700]  hour to talk about his great meme that went viral and was spread and shared by the president,
[28:12.700 --> 28:13.700]  set the media mad.
[28:13.700 --> 28:17.700]  And last night, he just made the point of the craziest things that happened wasn't the
[28:17.700 --> 28:22.980]  loony things being said on stage in terms of just personalities, but was instead some
[28:22.980 --> 28:28.620]  of the loony policies that were being endorsed policies that just, I mean, last night, every
[28:28.620 --> 28:33.380]  Democratic candidate, every serious major Democratic candidate in both nights basically
[28:33.380 --> 28:38.460]  said that Barack Obama, it was way too far to the right on immigration.
[28:38.460 --> 28:40.420]  That's where the Democratic party is.
[28:40.420 --> 28:43.700]  Not only will it be legal for them to come across the border, now they get free healthcare
[28:43.700 --> 28:44.700]  if they do so.
[28:44.700 --> 28:48.380]  Well, we used to, I mean, we've been reporting on this, how the Democrats want open borders
[28:48.380 --> 28:51.020]  for years and people would say, Oh, you know, that's ridiculous.
[28:51.020 --> 28:52.020]  Nobody wants open borders.
[28:52.020 --> 28:53.020]  I mean, they're there.
[28:53.020 --> 28:54.620]  They're totally open borders.
[28:54.620 --> 28:55.620]  That's what they want now.
[28:55.620 --> 28:56.620]  Total human trafficking.
[28:56.620 --> 28:58.980]  That's the policy of the Democrat party.
[28:58.980 --> 29:03.260]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[29:03.260 --> 29:05.020]  without all the speculation.
[29:05.020 --> 29:10.300]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[29:10.300 --> 29:14.660]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[29:14.660 --> 29:19.180]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs
[29:19.180 --> 29:21.340]  who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[29:21.340 --> 29:25.980]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:25.980 --> 29:30.500]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[29:30.500 --> 29:36.700]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each
[29:36.700 --> 29:37.700]  month.
[29:37.700 --> 29:38.700]  Don't miss this one.
[29:38.700 --> 29:45.380]  For today, call 800-600-3388, that's 800-600-3388.
[29:45.380 --> 29:47.500]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[29:47.500 --> 29:52.860]  Call now 800-600-3388, 800-600-3388.
[29:52.860 --> 29:55.260]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[29:55.260 --> 29:59.260]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security, which requires an offering document.
[29:59.260 --> 30:05.900]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[30:05.900 --> 30:10.620]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented
[30:10.620 --> 30:14.860]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom
[30:14.860 --> 30:18.900]  of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw all those lies against
[30:18.900 --> 30:22.780]  us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars,
[30:22.780 --> 30:24.500]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[30:24.500 --> 30:29.020]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in
[30:29.020 --> 30:30.020]  my heart.
[30:30.020 --> 30:32.900]  I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've
[30:32.900 --> 30:36.900]  done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed
[30:36.900 --> 30:41.780]  to fight to the end, but I want to win and without you, I'm going to be destroyed and
[30:41.780 --> 30:44.340]  it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[30:44.340 --> 30:45.620]  The enemy could win.
[30:45.620 --> 30:47.740]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:47.740 --> 30:48.980]  We're being used by God.
[30:48.980 --> 30:50.180]  You're being used by God.
[30:50.180 --> 30:54.060]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[30:54.060 --> 30:55.060]  of my heart.
[30:55.060 --> 31:00.700]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.700 --> 31:05.700]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[31:05.700 --> 31:08.020]  the last year or so.
[31:08.020 --> 31:09.020]  It's Orwellian.
[31:09.020 --> 31:10.020]  It's biblical.
[31:10.020 --> 31:11.020]  It's authoritarian.
[31:11.020 --> 31:12.020]  It's insane.
[31:12.020 --> 31:18.060]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as
[31:18.060 --> 31:22.380]  the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[31:22.380 --> 31:25.980]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real
[31:25.980 --> 31:26.980]  SOS.
[31:26.980 --> 31:30.780]  We're going to buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting.
[31:30.780 --> 31:33.580]  Infowars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[31:33.580 --> 31:34.580]  And so we've reached that point.
[31:34.580 --> 31:39.220]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have stood so many of their attacks.
[31:39.220 --> 31:41.780]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[31:41.780 --> 31:45.100]  You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed.
[31:45.100 --> 31:47.940]  They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[31:47.940 --> 31:54.100]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com.
[31:54.100 --> 31:55.460]  It's your fight.
[31:55.460 --> 31:59.980]  And whether or not you want Infowars to continue because we could be shut down.
[31:59.980 --> 32:05.140]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[32:05.140 --> 32:09.780]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[32:09.780 --> 32:14.700]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[32:14.700 --> 32:15.700]  one another.
[32:15.700 --> 32:20.340]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[32:20.340 --> 32:25.100]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[32:25.100 --> 32:29.340]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[32:29.340 --> 32:33.700]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[32:33.700 --> 32:34.700]  in supporting Infowars.
[32:34.700 --> 32:39.340]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[32:39.340 --> 32:43.220]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[32:43.220 --> 32:48.380]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[32:48.380 --> 32:52.180]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[32:52.180 --> 32:53.180]  to hold.
[32:53.180 --> 32:57.420]  This is the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of
[32:57.420 --> 33:03.980]  free press and free speech with free markets.
[33:03.980 --> 33:11.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.980 --> 33:21.980]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.980 --> 33:38.820]  President Trump and President Putin were able to meet again today and discuss ways the two
[33:38.820 --> 33:42.780]  nations can try to work together in the future.
[33:42.780 --> 33:48.540]  But that didn't stop the corporate globalist media from trying to inject more of the fairy
[33:48.540 --> 33:54.740]  tale, more of the fiction that the Russians meddled in the 2016 election and that's why
[33:54.740 --> 33:59.900]  the walking, undead creature Hillary Clinton lost, no?
[33:59.900 --> 34:06.580]  You lost because you're unpopular and Americans see through your globalist operation.
[34:06.580 --> 34:12.740]  But this is very revealing because they have to project onto the Russians that they're
[34:12.740 --> 34:17.060]  this outside threat that's trying to destroy Western nations.
[34:17.060 --> 34:22.700]  And everyone knows that it's globalism that's antithetical to the free market system and
[34:22.700 --> 34:27.580]  the nation states and to groups of people that are allowed to have any culture that
[34:27.580 --> 34:33.660]  is original because the global corporate culture of the technocrats is meant to overwrite
[34:33.660 --> 34:41.100]  all culture and is designed to dehumanize and atomize individuals and families on its
[34:41.100 --> 34:42.100]  face.
[34:42.100 --> 34:46.740]  It is literally the corporate borg.
[34:46.740 --> 34:49.300]  And President Putin understands this.
[34:49.300 --> 34:58.540]  He understands that globalism is a system that breaks the social contract between the
[34:58.540 --> 35:03.380]  culture, the government, the system and the people because it is a system itself that
[35:03.380 --> 35:06.740]  is meant to overwrite society and culture.
[35:06.740 --> 35:15.260]  And while at the G20, Putin made astounding statements that I am now going to read to
[35:15.260 --> 35:23.220]  you in full from a Paul Joseph Watson article on infowars.com.
[35:23.220 --> 35:26.460]  Many of these quotes are from the Financial Times of London.
[35:26.460 --> 35:31.180]  This story needs to go viral.
[35:31.180 --> 35:32.180]  Listen to this.
[35:32.180 --> 35:37.940]  Putin says multiculturalism is no longer tenable, close quote.
[35:37.940 --> 35:41.580]  The liberal idea has become obsolete.
[35:41.580 --> 35:43.540]  Putin continued.
[35:43.540 --> 35:49.980]  But Vladimir Putin says that liberalism has outlived its purpose and that multiculturalism
[35:49.980 --> 35:51.780]  is no longer tenable.
[35:51.780 --> 35:52.780]  Those are quotes.
[35:52.780 --> 35:59.620]  In an interview with the Financial Times, Putin explained that he had caused the rise
[35:59.620 --> 36:04.460]  of the Trump phenomenon, and I messed up there, so cut it there.
[36:04.460 --> 36:10.020]  In an interview with the Financial Times, Putin explained what had caused the rise of
[36:10.020 --> 36:16.140]  the Trump phenomenon in the United States as well as the success of right-wing, populist
[36:16.140 --> 36:18.940]  parties throughout Europe.
[36:18.940 --> 36:24.780]  The ruling elites have broken away from the people, he said, adding that the so-called
[36:24.780 --> 36:31.660]  liberal idea has outlived its purpose, and some Western leaders had acknowledged that
[36:31.660 --> 36:35.420]  multiculturalism is no longer tenable.
[36:35.420 --> 36:40.540]  Liberals cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting
[36:40.540 --> 36:44.580]  to do over the recent decades, said the Russian president.
[36:44.580 --> 36:49.860]  Branding Angela Merkel's decision to allow over a million migrants to enter Germany as
[36:49.860 --> 36:56.980]  part of a refugee wave, a cardinal mistake, the liberal idea proposes that nothing needs
[36:56.980 --> 37:02.900]  to be done, that migrants can kill, plunder, and rape with impunity because their rights
[37:02.900 --> 37:07.380]  as migrants have to be protected, said Putin.
[37:07.380 --> 37:11.020]  He added, every crime must have its punishment.
[37:11.020 --> 37:14.580]  The liberal idea has become obsolete.
[37:14.580 --> 37:19.980]  While Putin's comments have caused consternation amongst Western liberal elites, they are not
[37:19.980 --> 37:24.820]  far removed from remarks made public yesterday by the Dalai Lama.
[37:24.820 --> 37:30.580]  The spiritual leader of the Tibetan Buddhist told BBC he did not want to see Europe become
[37:30.580 --> 37:38.140]  Muslim or African, asserting that most refugees should be returned home in order to keep Europe
[37:38.140 --> 37:40.660]  for Europeans.
[37:40.660 --> 37:47.300]  Here is a clip of that BBC interview with the Dalai Lama.
[37:47.300 --> 37:52.100]  His emotion also a little bit too complicated.
[37:52.100 --> 37:54.060]  What do you mean by that?
[37:54.060 --> 37:55.780]  What do you think of him in office?
[37:55.780 --> 38:01.100]  One day he says something, another day he says something, but I think lack of moral
[38:01.100 --> 38:02.100]  principle.
[38:02.100 --> 38:13.700]  When he became president, he expressed America first, that is wrong, America should take
[38:13.700 --> 38:16.540]  the global responsibility.
[38:16.540 --> 38:25.740]  Vladimir Putin and the Dalai Lama's cardinal sin is there simply stating historical, biological
[38:25.740 --> 38:30.380]  cultural, religious reality.
[38:30.380 --> 38:39.300]  If the cultures in Africa were fundamentally so wonderful and good like the imaginary Marvel
[38:39.300 --> 38:49.060]  comic Black Panther series, then Africa itself would be a technological shining jewel.
[38:49.060 --> 38:55.540]  If you import hundreds of millions of people as the UN openly plans to Europe from Africa,
[38:55.540 --> 38:59.900]  it will not be Europe, it will be Africa.
[38:59.900 --> 39:02.300]  Same thing goes for the Middle East.
[39:02.300 --> 39:08.180]  Europe is having on average 1.3 children for every two adults, just like Japan.
[39:08.180 --> 39:10.780]  That is societal collapse level.
[39:10.780 --> 39:15.220]  That is not even replacing the population, but you don't bring in uneducated third world
[39:15.220 --> 39:20.580]  populations with totally different cultural backgrounds and replace those people.
[39:20.580 --> 39:25.300]  It doesn't work like that in all the studies and all the demographics showing.
[39:25.300 --> 39:27.220]  So what is Vladimir Putin doing?
[39:27.220 --> 39:34.140]  He is incentivizing Russians having children and he's incentivizing people coming to Russia
[39:34.140 --> 39:39.380]  who have degrees and skills and merit-based systems.
[39:39.380 --> 39:43.380]  Vladimir Putin understands that if a country is going to be successful, even if it has
[39:43.380 --> 39:48.780]  resources, it's got to have a good culture and there's got to be a social contract between
[39:48.780 --> 39:50.820]  the state and the people.
[39:50.820 --> 39:55.700]  And the people have to be represented and you have to build a future for humans.
[39:55.700 --> 40:00.940]  But the technocrats who have their system of global government, they are building a
[40:00.940 --> 40:07.180]  post-human world and teaching you that you're bad and that you shouldn't have a vision and
[40:07.180 --> 40:10.380]  you shouldn't have a life force and you shouldn't have children.
[40:10.380 --> 40:16.740]  They have inflicted in the West the psychology of not having a family.
[40:16.740 --> 40:22.860]  And by the time the old feminist at 45 or 50 figure it out, it's too late to have children
[40:22.860 --> 40:25.340]  and there are massive numbers of women.
[40:25.340 --> 40:29.620]  In fact, the majority of feminists saying, we were trapped.
[40:29.620 --> 40:31.100]  We were deceived.
[40:31.100 --> 40:36.140]  We wish we wouldn't have done this, but when you travel to trendy areas across the United
[40:36.140 --> 40:42.340]  States or Europe, you will see the young, beautiful women laughing about men and laughing
[40:42.340 --> 40:49.060]  about families and saying, we don't need it, buying into the poison of the pop culture
[40:49.060 --> 40:53.460]  inflicted on them by the universities and by Hollywood.
[40:53.460 --> 40:59.220]  The media is acting like what Putin has said is radical and it is radical, radical in that
[40:59.220 --> 41:06.420]  in an ocean of lies, just a symbol's worth of truth can absolutely override it.
[41:06.420 --> 41:12.540]  Well, Putin's dumped out an entire ocean of truth here, ladies and gentlemen, and the
[41:12.540 --> 41:15.260]  system doesn't know how to deal with it.
[41:15.260 --> 41:19.340]  Upwards of 90% of the people brought in from the Middle East and brought in from North
[41:19.340 --> 41:22.620]  Africa don't have jobs five years later.
[41:22.620 --> 41:25.260]  They are five times more likely to commit crimes.
[41:25.260 --> 41:26.260]  Pull the numbers up.
[41:26.260 --> 41:32.340]  90% of the asylum seekers in the US never return for their hearings because they're not asylum
[41:32.340 --> 41:33.340]  seekers.
[41:33.340 --> 41:40.220]  The Democratic Party is advertising to the world that they can come here and get free
[41:40.220 --> 41:43.620]  stuff and the Democrats will represent them.
[41:43.620 --> 41:47.180]  That's what we saw last night during the debates.
[41:47.180 --> 41:52.740]  The Democratic Party competing to be the party of illegal aliens.
[41:52.740 --> 41:55.340]  That is, again, the essence of globalism.
[41:55.340 --> 42:00.020]  Bring down the West, divide and conquer the planet and rule it with a worldwide corporate
[42:00.020 --> 42:01.020]  system.
[42:01.020 --> 42:05.340]  So I salute Vladimir Putin, I salute the Dalai Lama and others, and I salute all of you
[42:05.340 --> 42:09.500]  that are awake and taking action and understand what's happening because it's not too late
[42:09.500 --> 42:10.820]  to reverse the tide.
[42:10.820 --> 42:14.020]  We could bring in many of these numbers of people and educate them and make them part
[42:14.020 --> 42:19.900]  of our system, but the globalists from the onset are making that already hard job impossible
[42:19.900 --> 42:24.900]  by brainwashing them and weaponizing them and teaching them to hate the West and that
[42:24.900 --> 42:31.900]  it's their right to come here and conquer us culturally and usurp us.
[42:54.900 --> 43:03.740]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[43:03.740 --> 43:08.260]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[43:08.260 --> 43:13.220]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[43:13.220 --> 43:16.740]  that's not being funded by secret foreign government, it is completely independent
[43:16.740 --> 43:17.740]  of all that.
[43:17.740 --> 43:23.020]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[43:23.020 --> 43:24.020]  and freedom of speech.
[43:24.020 --> 43:27.580]  That in fact the founders were so concerned with, at the beginning of the country, they
[43:27.580 --> 43:32.260]  actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of
[43:32.260 --> 43:35.780]  press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[43:35.780 --> 43:39.740]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control
[43:39.740 --> 43:44.660]  and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the
[43:44.660 --> 43:47.340]  Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[43:47.340 --> 43:51.740]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[43:51.740 --> 43:52.740]  freedom.
[43:52.740 --> 43:57.660]  It has been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel
[43:57.660 --> 43:58.660]  targeting youth.
[43:58.660 --> 44:02.260]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[44:02.260 --> 44:06.220]  We're going into the season of war and they had been inches from shutting down the final
[44:06.220 --> 44:11.020]  mega counts we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need to know
[44:11.020 --> 44:13.780]  that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[44:13.780 --> 44:14.780]  We need the end year.
[44:14.780 --> 44:18.860]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage
[44:18.860 --> 44:20.460]  forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[44:20.460 --> 44:24.300]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[44:24.300 --> 44:26.100]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[44:26.100 --> 44:30.340]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies not just brings
[44:30.340 --> 44:31.340]  more people here.
[44:31.340 --> 44:34.460]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[44:34.460 --> 44:35.460]  I need gas.
[44:35.460 --> 44:39.900]  I need ammo politically now, but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood
[44:39.900 --> 44:43.700]  us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[44:43.700 --> 44:44.700]  We're unstoppable together.
[44:44.700 --> 44:46.140]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[44:46.140 --> 44:49.460]  I want to raise a couple of million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their
[44:49.460 --> 44:53.140]  attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[44:53.140 --> 44:54.300]  You have my commitment.
[44:54.300 --> 44:58.060]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right
[44:58.060 --> 45:00.980]  about this.
[45:00.980 --> 45:05.500]  ClownWorldInfoWars.com, ladies and gentlemen, it's already being printed.

[45:52.420 --> 45:57.980]  InfoWarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, please support
[45:57.980 --> 45:58.980]  us today.
[45:58.980 --> 46:01.540]  These sales are big.
[46:01.540 --> 46:05.540]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided that we're
[46:05.540 --> 46:09.180]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back five, six years ago
[46:09.180 --> 46:12.500]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk
[46:12.500 --> 46:15.940]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd
[46:15.940 --> 46:19.260]  leave doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few
[46:19.260 --> 46:22.820]  years I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down, the biggest thing
[46:22.820 --> 46:25.420]  people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful
[46:25.420 --> 46:27.900]  they work and the left always has headlines everywhere.
[46:27.900 --> 46:32.980]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements, no, under federal
[46:32.980 --> 46:38.460]  law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[46:38.460 --> 46:42.060]  no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[46:42.060 --> 46:46.500]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate
[46:46.500 --> 46:50.020]  it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great, they have side effects not with
[46:50.020 --> 46:54.380]  Mother Nature but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[46:54.380 --> 47:12.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:12.420 --> 47:39.980]  All right, we're head bobbing and rocking right now but we're going to have to change
[47:39.980 --> 47:46.780]  the universe here and the multiverse here very shortly because we're about to launch
[47:46.780 --> 47:51.060]  a brand new segment, probably one and only, this is probably a one off but it may be so
[47:51.060 --> 47:56.860]  popular that maybe Robert Barnes and I are going to have to do this a lot but before
[47:56.860 --> 48:02.500]  I do this, you know, we're about to meditate with Mary and Williamson who's so in touch
[48:02.500 --> 48:06.740]  with the universe is incredible but I really wanted to get everything out of this segment
[48:06.740 --> 48:12.020]  so I've got my happy's right here from info wars store.com so just remember if you're
[48:12.020 --> 48:17.220]  ever going to meditate, be sure to take your happy's before you meditate and I'm not going
[48:17.220 --> 48:21.860]  to lie, I actually did this for the first time this week, I'm not usually someone that
[48:21.860 --> 48:27.220]  has to deal with stress or anything like that but this is kind of what it feels like when
[48:27.220 --> 48:31.820]  you do the happy's and it's actually really good too so I'm going to do one directly
[48:31.820 --> 48:44.620]  to really get my chakras going so and then I'm going to do one in my coffee, oh I'm getting
[48:44.620 --> 48:53.540]  greedy, I'm going to do two so now there's two happy's in my coffee so now Robert I am
[48:53.540 --> 49:02.860]  fully aligned now so I think it's time for meditation with Mary Ann, now Robert Barnes
[49:02.860 --> 49:07.900]  my co-host has a series of tweets from the enlightened one, Mary Ann Williamson that
[49:07.900 --> 49:13.340]  we will be reading here on air for your enjoyment and then we will be discussing the topics
[49:13.340 --> 49:19.660]  so Robert Barnes please get us started in meditation with Mary Ann, Mary Ann has a
[49:19.660 --> 49:25.500]  solution for nuclear war, the power of your mind is greater than the power of nuclear
[49:25.500 --> 49:32.580]  radiation, visualize angels dispersing it into nothingness, now let's think about that
[49:32.580 --> 49:37.940]  for a second Robert because we've had some serious nuclear tragedies in this world, if
[49:37.940 --> 49:44.300]  only the Japanese could have known that in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, if only the Russians
[49:44.300 --> 49:49.740]  could have known that in Chernobyl, if only the Japanese could have known that again with
[49:49.740 --> 49:54.460]  Fukushima, think about the world today and we wouldn't even have to worry about nuclear
[49:54.460 --> 49:58.540]  conflict or nuclear war, we could even launch nuclear weapons and not worry about it because
[49:58.540 --> 50:06.100]  if we just put our minds to it all the radiation will vanish, now let's just take five seconds
[50:06.100 --> 50:11.900]  to meditate on all the nuclear radiation in the cesium 137 leaking from Fukushima, if
[50:11.900 --> 50:16.460]  we just take five seconds, I want you to use and I want the audience as well, I want to
[50:16.460 --> 50:21.860]  use the full strength of your mind right now to focus for the next five seconds, meditate
[50:21.860 --> 50:36.820]  and let's clean up the Fukushima radiation, well we just solved the Fukushima disaster
[50:36.820 --> 50:43.340]  so I think that's a positive, without question and probably could have solved Chernobyl at
[50:43.340 --> 50:47.380]  the same time if we thought about it long enough and I'm thinking too, you know we keep
[50:47.380 --> 50:54.380]  having these issues with Iran and North Korea and nuclear arms deals, why don't we just
[50:54.380 --> 51:00.740]  forget about these deals and just meditate on it, exactly just do some yoga moves and
[51:00.740 --> 51:04.660]  you'll be okay, you know the world will be okay, Trump is at the G20 right now meeting
[51:04.660 --> 51:09.700]  with world leaders, I think there's too much talking and not enough meditating, precisely
[51:09.700 --> 51:15.300]  they just do the eagle pose and that will probably cure everything, very enlightened
[51:15.300 --> 51:21.140]  stuff, let's move on now to another enlightening moment for Marianne Williamson, we've seen
[51:21.140 --> 51:25.700]  a lot of bad oil spills, well Marianne does have the solution for that if you meditate
[51:25.700 --> 51:35.380]  with Marianne, visualize the oil spill plugged, close your eyes for five minutes and see angels
[51:35.380 --> 51:43.540]  coming over it, filling it with sane and sacred thoughts, wow I'm visualizing it right now
[51:43.540 --> 51:57.220]  Robert and I see the angels, they're swooping down now and they have a giant plug, it's
[51:57.220 --> 52:08.420]  sustainable, it's green, it's all natural organic and I believe that it is Himalayan
[52:08.420 --> 52:15.940]  oil spill, this is incredible, I'm seeing it in my mind, are you seeing it Robert Barnes?
[52:15.940 --> 52:22.140]  The BP oil spill, it's slowly dissipating and disappearing, the Alaskan oil spill is
[52:22.140 --> 52:26.820]  slowly disappearing, I don't have to, you can go back to eating Louisiana oysters again
[52:26.820 --> 52:33.060]  I think, probably just maybe within minutes but at least within days, this is incredible
[52:33.060 --> 52:40.900]  for those of you who have had your wildlife ruined in the Gulf or in other areas where
[52:40.900 --> 52:47.820]  there have been oil spills, we now have the answer, it's visualizing angels coming down
[52:47.820 --> 52:54.740]  with a sustainable Himalayan salt rock plug to stop these oil spills and I can tell you
[52:54.740 --> 53:00.620]  just from the two minutes we've spent discussing this now and meditating on it, we've probably
[53:00.620 --> 53:07.060]  cleaned up at least 30-40% of all the oil spills and all the nuclear radiation spills
[53:07.060 --> 53:13.380]  both just obliterated overnight, this audience and the power of meditation has almost cleaned
[53:13.380 --> 53:18.620]  up the earth, exactly that's all it took, it just took a few yoga moves and the right
[53:18.620 --> 53:24.580]  meditation with Marianne and to think that they almost didn't even let Marianne Williamson
[53:24.580 --> 53:29.420]  on the Democrat debate stage, how would we even be solving these issues right now, exactly
[53:29.420 --> 53:35.940]  I mean all she wanted was just to give some love to Donald Trump and just give love and
[53:35.940 --> 53:41.940]  that's going to solve everything and really without meditation with Marianne the world
[53:41.940 --> 53:47.260]  probably would be doomed, well thank goodness that she was able to get on that stage and
[53:47.260 --> 53:53.180]  we're now practicing meditation with Marianne, let's go back to another enlightening moment
[53:53.180 --> 53:59.980]  from the enlightened one, Marianne Williamson. If you want a simple explanation for what's
[53:59.980 --> 54:06.940]  happening in America, watch Avatar again. Well I think that there's only one thing that
[54:06.940 --> 54:13.980]  we can do right now and that's obviously pull up as many Avatar GIFs as possible because
[54:13.980 --> 54:19.420]  you know Robert there's a lot of confusion out there and people they don't know what
[54:19.420 --> 54:25.380]  to make of it all and there's probably some people on earth that haven't even seen Avatar,
[54:25.380 --> 54:30.660]  I mean that's a real issue. Oh no doubt, I mean it relates really to another meditation
[54:30.660 --> 54:36.180]  with Marianne point which is don't let the shrieks of the temporal disturb the silence
[54:36.180 --> 54:41.580]  of your eternal self. Oh my goodness I've been bothered by those shrieks for so long,
[54:41.580 --> 54:51.220]  now I know. And if I was watching Avatar while confronting those shrieks in my mind
[54:51.220 --> 54:58.140]  with the power of my third eye I could have burned all the sage and I could have inhaled
[54:58.140 --> 55:05.140]  it and then I could have been the Avatar. Exactly as another great meditation with Marianne
[55:05.140 --> 55:10.660]  point is that when enough minds are vibrating a high enough level then all lower thought
[55:10.660 --> 55:18.940]  forms fall on their own dead weight. Now that is the kind of stuff that folks you have to
[55:18.940 --> 55:26.060]  be an expert level of, you have to be a meditation expert, really a guru, a mystic if you ever
[55:26.060 --> 55:30.540]  want to reach that level of enlightenment so I don't want to challenge our audience
[55:30.540 --> 55:38.140]  with too much today, you might sprain a brain muscle but just think about your mind vibrating
[55:38.140 --> 55:43.100]  to the patterns and the images of Avatar while you're solving the world's energy crisis
[55:43.100 --> 55:50.060]  and cleaning up oil spills and radiation spills and this is why Marianne Williamson is probably
[55:50.060 --> 55:56.100]  destined to be present really just because of her mind. No question, with our last meditation
[55:56.100 --> 56:02.380]  with Marianne humanity needs a mental shower, we need to wash off all prejudices and stand
[56:02.380 --> 56:09.620]  naked beneath the waters of eternal truth. Wow, you know it reminds me of another meditation
[56:09.620 --> 56:15.460]  with Marianne moment how we're all pregnant with our future self and I think about that
[56:15.460 --> 56:25.500]  and I think about cleansing my mind with the juices from birthing my future self and cleansing
[56:25.500 --> 56:33.140]  all of the abstraction with just one single birth of thine self. Well I think really it
[56:33.140 --> 56:38.500]  explains Julian Castro's comments, he was imagining that Joe Biden might transition
[56:38.500 --> 56:46.140]  and then in Joe Biden's transitioning he too may need to abort his future self. Well
[56:46.140 --> 56:52.020]  we know that abortion is obviously a human right and so if you do want to abort your
[56:52.020 --> 56:58.780]  future self you obviously have to go into deep meditation and focus like the avatar
[56:58.780 --> 57:04.300]  and think about that future self and envision it and that's the only way to have true equilibrium.
[57:04.300 --> 57:09.100]  And if that doesn't work for you we leave you with this last meditation with Marianne
[57:09.100 --> 57:17.140]  peacock feathers are created by peacocks eating thorns. Every thorn you have eaten has become
[57:17.140 --> 57:24.540]  the peacock. Ladies and gentlemen this has been meditation with Marianne. Do what you
[57:24.540 --> 57:30.620]  please with this intel but always remember as Robert Barnes said if you want to be the
[57:30.620 --> 57:38.460]  peacock you must ingest the thorn and then visualize the colors as the angels swoop
[57:38.460 --> 57:44.540]  down from the heavens and they anoint you the peacock one. This has been meditation
[57:44.540 --> 57:50.580]  with Marianne the future president of the United States of America. Robert Barnes what
[57:50.580 --> 57:54.220]  does big tech become? A big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they
[57:54.220 --> 57:58.380]  did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal for
[57:58.380 --> 58:02.220]  their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[58:02.220 --> 58:06.180]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[58:06.180 --> 58:09.620]  members of the public in the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[58:09.620 --> 58:13.780]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[58:13.780 --> 58:17.460]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[58:17.460 --> 58:21.660]  century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until
[58:21.660 --> 58:25.340]  we were able to recover after the Great Depression. The inforware's audience is the fuel that
[58:25.340 --> 58:30.660]  flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free
[58:30.660 --> 58:35.020]  speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is
[58:35.020 --> 58:39.740]  big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections
[58:39.740 --> 58:43.860]  to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's
[58:43.860 --> 58:47.460]  not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw
[58:47.460 --> 58:53.500]  even it is what what you just saw. In the 40 years that I've been in American politics
[58:53.500 --> 58:59.180]  I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence
[58:59.180 --> 59:06.060]  no longer matters the false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the sandy hook
[59:06.060 --> 59:12.420]  plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's a smear somebody sends you something that's
[59:12.420 --> 59:17.940]  encrypted you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents
[59:17.940 --> 59:23.500]  and then it's blamed on you this is Kafka esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream
[59:23.500 --> 59:29.700]  media rushes out to say jones set kitty porn is really outrageous I have a lot of respect
[59:29.700 --> 59:34.380]  for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified
[59:34.380 --> 59:38.740]  but I wonder where the big boys where's the wall street journal where's associated press
[59:38.740 --> 59:43.380]  when are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was
[59:43.380 --> 59:48.820]  inaccurate so we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support info wars
[59:48.820 --> 59:59.660]  with your dollars you're listening to the Alex Jones show I mean honestly you really
[59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.220]  believe that there's concentration camps at the border yeah then why are so many people
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:10.060]  trying to come over well they're trying to get freedom they'll do but all they're gonna
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:15.180]  be met with is a concentration camp in your words doesn't make sense does it I mean I
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:27.100]  don't know much but yeah we're here in st. Louis Missouri and I don't know why we chose
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.820]  the city to come to to ask this question but we are asking people if they agree with Ocasio
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.060]  Cortez when she says that detention centers on the US Mexico border are the same as concentration
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:41.580]  camps used during World War two let's see if people think that's pretty ridiculous
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:01:01.340]  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez recently said that the detention centers used at the
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:07.620]  US Mexico border are comparable to the concentration camps used during World War two do you agree
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:13.380]  with that I do yes do you agree with that notion I personally do yes do you agree with
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:20.420]  that notion I didn't know about it but it's not good do you think do you think that that's
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:25.860]  what we're doing at the border putting them in concentration camps I hope not do you agree
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:33.380]  with Ocasio Cortez yeah so you I mean honestly you really believe that there's concentration
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:39.580]  camps at the border yeah then why are so many people trying to come over um well they're
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:44.420]  trying to get freedom they'll do but all they're going to be met with is a concentration camp
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:51.460]  in your words doesn't make sense does it I mean I don't know much but yeah so she has
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.980]  recently said that the detention centers at the US Mexico border are comparable and basically
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:03.420]  the same as concentration camps use in World War two yeah do you agree with that I mean
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.820]  I personally do I think when we look back on history we always like to think that we're
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.460]  on the right side of history with things and then history repeats itself and everyone's
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:16.620]  really against it so I mean I think it's going to take some time for people to kind of see
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:21.660]  it for what it is you know when you look at the pictures of concentration camps when they
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:28.100]  look like they were just a little bit worse you know um but I guess in this day and age
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:33.100]  I mean there's a it's good to draw correlations but that's a little over the top for me so
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:40.140]  you say they're just a little bit worse how do you find them similar well um taking any
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.660]  demographic and sticking them in one place is what how they're similar to me what demographic
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.660]  is being stuck in the detention center oh absolutely Hispanic do you think that's a
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:56.020]  fair comparison it depends I think for her party probably makes sense right um but I
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.500]  think that if she really wants to win over all of America it's going to be tough with
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.660]  such a polarizing comment do you think that most Democrats would agree with her notion
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:08.820]  that they're the same I think that they would probably it depends where you are right I
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:14.900]  think maybe half of Democrats would agree with her comment bearing it to a concentration
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:21.260]  camp that's almost disrespectful to like the people who actually went through that I don't
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:26.180]  think they're the same but I feel like it's because they're not you know they're not we're
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.940]  not killing people where I mean we're not how we're not killing people but we don't
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:35.700]  that we know of but um I don't know that's a tough one like I feel like it could be almost
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.900]  the same but not quite I haven't been in a concentration camp so I don't I don't have
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.140]  any things to compare it with well I mean we can hear from people who have been several
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:48.660]  people are alive today that live through that concentration camp in Germany they're coming
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:53.220]  out saying that it's not quite the same as what's going on at the border do you take
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.860]  their word for it I mean are we killing six million people at the US border and tripping
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:02.780]  their identities and then again I didn't hear them say it so I don't you know I'm just
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.940]  taking your word for it do you think that even if just one person is killed by illegal
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.780]  immigration that that's a problem and we should do something at the border I think anyone
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:15.820]  being killed is a problem I don't think people are being killed due to illegal immigration
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:21.340]  I think there's about 4,000 people that were some illegal immigrants may end up killing
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:25.900]  people but that's not the same as saying people are being killed due to illegal immigration
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:31.260]  we have a congresswoman named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who recently compared the detention centers
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.700]  at the US Mexico border to concentration camps used during World War two what are your thoughts
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:44.740]  on that do you agree all right super male vitality is what he needs to be able to talk
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:05:02.740]  about these things what a pansy serving with info wars is a great honor but I still need

[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:24.940]  as carpe donkton joining us here today in just a few minutes live with on shroyer robert
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:29.980]  barnes and others and I have to control myself when I start talking about somebody like this
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:37.900]  because this guy has victory written all over him there he is young man of a father family
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:44.940]  man to making his memes a couple years some of the memes that I have looked at have gotten
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:56.900]  over 70 million views with just one meme CNN has on average 89,000 viewers to view average
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:06.420]  24 hour day out their top shows a million viewers it's a total joke it's a total con man facade
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:12.780]  and the whole confidence game of globalism and world government and corporations above
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.020]  the law and paying no taxes and then opening our borders and exploiting the third world
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:22.420]  exploiting us that's not working anymore and we see all these incredible things happening
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:29.300]  and you've seen them try to get carpe donkton banned we've seen the media claim that he's
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:36.700]  engaged in doctoring when he put out the joe biden groping joe biden no CNN no MSNBC
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:43.420]  no democrats everyone knows when you have a cardboard cut out of joe biden pop up behind
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.420]  joe biden and smell his hair and rub his hands on his shoulders that it's a joke that's not
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:56.460]  doctoring it's not doctoring when we zoom in on jenna costa attacking the young woman
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:01.940]  who's the moderator but I just wanted to say that there are other carpe donkton's out there
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:08.380]  listening right now and one of the things I'm most proud of is that the info wars audience
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:16.500]  boast among it almost all of the most effective people that are out there today on radio and
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.900]  grassroots TV and with memes every time we get some great activists on they're like hey
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:26.500]  info wars woke me up or help wake me up that means so much to me to know that not only
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.380]  have we gotten people to be aware of the new world order but that we've gotten folks to
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:37.020]  take action and that's what the censors can't stop is all of you whether your meme gets
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:42.420]  100 views or a million views or 70 million views it doesn't matter it's the action it's
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:47.940]  the will that matters so again thank you all for your support thank you carpe donkton for
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:53.100]  the memes he's done helping info wars because we are the focal point of the populist uprising
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.420]  and the enemy believes they can shut us down they can silence everyone so from the bottom
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.740]  my heart to carpe donkton to the guys guest hosting to the wonderful producers and crew
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:07.380]  in there that make this all possible thank you all for making info wars the standard
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:13.540]  in the resistance now we take you live the atx and carpe donkton and we've got carpe
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:20.140]  on the line with us but before we go to the meme king let's go ahead and show you some
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:24.020]  of the memes that alex is talking about first let's go with the I mean I couldn't tell this
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:28.980]  was doctored joe biden groping joe biden video I didn't even know it was doctored here it
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:38.980]  is right here oh no joe is coming up behind joe look out joe oh no joe don't sniff the
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:44.580]  hair joe say it ain't so joe I believe history will look back on for years of this president
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:49.580]  not again all the embraces on a second announcement has an aberrant moment in time oh the hand
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:10:00.100]  joe but if we get down to the white house he will forever in front of me oh my god where
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.140]  did he come from now I would have never known this video was doctored if it wasn't for the
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:07.500]  geniuses at cnn pointed that out not exactly I thought joe had a twin at least one twin
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:11.300]  made it five and then it was twin is the groping twin how many twins can you have if you're
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:16.860]  a democrat ten yeah precisely so now though let's go to the latest viral meme from carpe
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:21.900]  donkton this one had me rolling it is during you didn't see this that's why they cut away
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:29.060]  on msnbc here's what actually happened during the msnbc blackout senator warn i want to
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:35.020]  start with you we are less than fifty miles from parkland florida where seventeen people
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:49.260]  were killed in a school we are going to take a quick break we're going to get this situation
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:56.460]  what's happening is we told that out okay the lights come back in the fog and a mysterious
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:04.260]  figure a shadow in the fog it's donald jade trump this is why they cut the way donald
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:10.140]  jade trump was at the den debates he told it he shut it down and he won it and so this
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:16.420]  went majorly vital it's carpe donkton he's with us now carpe i mean it's amazing you
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:21.740]  were able to capture that on the msnbc when they cut away yeah i had an inside source
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:27.860]  that got me the source footage for that that's what's key that that's the necessary connection
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:33.140]  so you had the the the foreshand connection the the inside intel to to get to the bottom
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:38.740]  line it was a whistle it was a whistleblower that was a upset with rachel maddow so they
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:44.420]  sent me the real clip and then you guys all saw the the undocked one which was which was
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:49.500]  mine the doctored one was the one that they showed on tv that's true that's what msnbc
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.660]  does best is doctor videos and you know that's why they want to claim the year the doctor
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.180]  of the videos i mean it's obvious joe biden has at least five twins maybe ten you never
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:04.540]  really know how many hands might show up behind joe biden but also the fact that msnbc would
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:09.020]  cut away when president trump showed up at the democrat debates and it really just shows
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:15.380]  you the control they have right i know i can can you imagine being graced with the presence
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:20.340]  of donald trump and then cutting away but think about this let's get real for a second
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.660]  you started making memes it's like an internet viral sensation and you kind of took it to
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:31.820]  the next level in 2016 really you kind of broke ground and created just new moving memes
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:38.860]  that had the power of of animation to it and it's it's taken off so much now where you've
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:45.940]  been retweeted by the president multiple times you ever think that would happen i'm no not
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:51.420]  really i mean it didn't start out what it's become it didn't start out that way you know
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:13:03.060]  it was uh it was 2017 it was the the great me more of 2017 the cnn blackmail of the creator
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:09.180]  of that wrestling jiff that really got it all started and then you know it's it's kind
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:12.100]  of snowballed from there there's been lots of people that have joined the fight and
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:18.140]  all that kind of stuff so i never thought it would be the level that it's at but i mean
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:24.980]  you have obviously now been had your mean seen probably over 100 million times that's
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:30.820]  more than as average cnn week of viewers what is the bigger honor for you is it being retweeted
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:39.940]  by the president or making bryan stelter cry well a small part of me really likes making
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:49.940]  bryan stelter cry um and uh chris qualmo ozzy osbourne rem that that that's really
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:56.180]  what makes it for me i i i i love to wake up and see a tweet from ozzy uh from uh Sharon
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:02.300]  osbourne where she's really super mad about uh crazy train wait did that actually happen
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:07.380]  yeah yeah she uh yesterday she was mad about she's like uh we don't ever want you to use
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:14.380]  our music again so ozzy didn't complain because ozzy may or may not have been sobered various
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.940]  times i ran into him a couple of times in malibu he's an interesting personality his
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.500]  wife uh you know also sort of interesting of course uh their daughter made famous rounds
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.540]  a couple of years ago and she said uh that we really need to have all the illegal immigrants
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:32.940]  and and and allow mexican americans uh be to be around the country because who else would
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.580]  quote clean her toilets uh so you know there's all kinds of racist at all yeah so nice insights
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:42.700]  there from the uh the osbourne thing but the i mean i mean the crazy train is a perfect
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:47.940]  does a great song uh it's uh notable that that she is that way so by the way where did
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:52.460]  so it's carpe donkton the at carpe donkton on twitter uh where'd you come up with the
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:59.780]  name carpe donkton by the way oh it's it's been an old it's been around since uh right
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:06.260]  1996 or something when i was in high school uh i don't even remember why but it means
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:11.900]  sees the donkey now in pretend latin so it still fits i don't know if it fit back then
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.180]  but if it's now the i have you been surprised at how memeable the democratic debates and
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.820]  democratic candidates have turned out i mean we were having some fun with mediation with

[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:48.540]  we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really going
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:52.060]  to plant child porn on us then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else i mean the
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.660]  democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the chi
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:03.500]  com so go to infowarstore.com info wars the most banned network in the world so the info
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.580]  wars model is a self fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting free press and
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:12.820]  free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:18.100]  another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:22.740]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting self sustaining
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:27.260]  self structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:31.620]  content goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:35.500]  and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.100]  it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:43.460]  want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:48.420]  at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:52.500]  they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:20:01.420]  expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:09.860]  for listening to the alex jones show we're gonna go with guns and senator warren i want
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:15.860]  to start with you we are less than fifty miles from parkland florida where seventeen people
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:20.500]  were killed in a school shooting last year and where there has been significant activism
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.420]  on gun violence ever since many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:30.460]  ban but even if implemented there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:37.020]  should there be a role for the federal government everybody's my son i think we have a i heard
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:41.420]  that too that's okay i think we had a little mike issue in the back control room we've
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:52.220]  got we have the i think we heard hope yet we have the audience all right we are we are
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:21:01.380]  hearing our colleagues audio i if the control room the control room can turn off the mics
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:12.980]  of our previous moderators we are going to take a quick break we're going to get this
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:23.820]  technical situation next we will be right back oh what a clown show it was and one
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:29.460]  of my favorite clowns was maryan williamson and um i have to get serious for a second
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:36.140]  here and and robert barnes and i were a little we were a little upset here in studio to hear
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:42.620]  carpe donkton talking down on maryan williamson like that saying disparaging comments um you
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.940]  know carpe you're pretty good at memes you're pretty smart you know in your own in your
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:55.020]  own right but for you to go after an intellectual giant a spiritual guru like maryan williamson
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:00.900]  on this alex jones broadcast is uh i i can't i'm sorry i can't allow that that's that's
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:04.460]  not going to fly here i think what really what carpe needs is he just needs a little
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:08.180]  bit of meditation with maryan i mean that will be able to help him so for just think
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:15.060]  of it this way uh carpe your mind is like an airplane and you are the pilot rise above
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:22.580]  the clouds fly above the turbulence seek a smoother ride then you'll be okay if that
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:30.460]  doesn't work remember a gray sky is actually a blue sky covered up by gray clouds a guilty
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:36.860]  person is actually an innocent soul covered up by mistaken behavior oj simpson liked
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:44.300]  that tweet literally i don't know if he did i feel so much better now i you know i like
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:49.760]  her a lot she she seems like a very smart lady exactly she's helped cure nuclear war
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.660]  she's helped cure oil spills she's helped cure well the other thing she pointed out
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:23:00.260]  is that down deep you may feel like an alien uh is everyone feels at some level like an
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:06.540]  alien in this world because we are we come from another realm of consciousness and long
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:13.860]  for home so the what seems crazy is really just uh she's she's just an alien from another
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:18.100]  place and if we understood that then we can connect to it we can fly above the clouds
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:24.300]  we can uh we can recognize the sky truly is blue we can return home cure nuclear war
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:30.380]  cure oil spills uh and bring love uh to donald trump in the universe so carpe now that you've
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:36.740]  been enlightened maybe you can finally meme marianne williamson maybe have joe giving her
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:43.140]  some friendly uh friendly uh handsy advice some hands-on advice hands-on advice possibility
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:49.740]  you you've talked me into it it it might happen now i i do want to say that uh that i think
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:57.060]  that's uh it was actually a documentary and marianne just never loved there you go exactly
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:01.100]  it was she she's still connected she has the vibe she's connected to that that energy
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:07.060]  that those uh uh well one of the memes so far about marianne was that she's the the
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:11.740]  girlfriend that everybody brings to the poker party that is driving everybody nuts because
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:16.820]  she keeps talking about crystals so the uh you know it's that kind of means yeah dynamic
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.580]  well i mean you can bring marianne williamson to the poker party she talked about crystals
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:24.620]  or you could bring aoc to the poker party who does crystal math i mean you take your
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:30.700]  picture you take your picture you have multiple options there well at least aoc would uh assemble
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:34.620]  your furniture for you if you brought her to a poker party yeah but it would probably
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:39.860]  break down but you know speaking of memes with the king of memes carpe donton how about
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:45.820]  all the meme magic of aoc going down to an empty parking lot posing for a photo shoot
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:49.820]  and the crazy thing is too she brings like a whole gang of people they're all wearing
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:55.860]  white like at some sort of event that she organized and she's sitting at a parking lot crying
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.740]  i mean they all must have done some serious opium well it was like a jim jones cult meeting
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:06.260]  yeah the uh but i assume that's gonna have permanent memeable use uh carpe it's gonna
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:13.300]  be used forever that it will never not be funny you know the uh the video that trump
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:21.380]  tweeted was really popular but second to that the picture that i did with uh the lineup
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:27.300]  of uh the first debate and then aoc crying in front of it was probably my second most
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.420]  popular thing i did that night oh exactly i mean you can just put her in so many places
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:37.500]  so many settings so many connections you combine sort of meditation with marianne aoc's movable
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:42.660]  uh empty parking lot crying imagery uh joe biden with biden you really can just do the
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:47.140]  hands you don't even have to do the face really just joe biden's hands uh and you have permanent
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:52.380]  memeable use in a wide range of settings and circumstances the and it just changes the entire
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:58.380]  dynamic so the uh yeah exactly exactly by the way who wouldn't feel like you know the
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.500]  exactly i'd be like uh you know the one thing i was curious about was whether or not joe
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.100]  biden would uh would hug anybody last night the uh but you notice what they did they actually
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:12.980]  kept him from even going backstage like they only they only let him in limited circumstances
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:18.400]  um yeah i think that was a smart idea they they should surround him with with secret
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.300]  service just in a circle completely surround him and then just walk him around and they
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.900]  just need to make sure the secret service people are comfortable with joe's unique form
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:33.020]  of physical interaction we notice how joe how biden is with hands do you see his reaction
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:38.260]  to bernie's hands oh i did a video i did a video about it uh where bernie's slamming
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:45.260]  the table yeah and he keeps seeing joe do that that shock look the uh oh yes yes he's
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:49.660]  always going this way it's going this way it's going this way the uh i mean yeah there
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:56.780]  it is yeah for someone who can't keep his hands to himself yeah exactly he knows he
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:01.260]  he knows what that means that's basically he has his own personal bubble but he doesn't
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.740]  doesn't understand the other bubbles no you guys are misunderstanding you're misrepresenting
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:09.860]  joe biden here he was just upset that bernie didn't finish the job he's like oh look man
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:12.900]  if you're going to bring your hands into my space like that i mean you know at least finish
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:17.540]  the job over here well i mean that was the one of the jokes last night was uh with bernie
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:22.300]  and biden you know two grandpas enter one grandpa leave after the sort of mad max thing
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:27.260]  the uh so what do you think is memeable with kamala harris you know moving forward it looks
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:31.340]  like the media is going to start celebrating her elevating her uh well where do you think
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:34.580]  i mean there's the kid image that she put up where she's got the pony you know like
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:39.460]  the ponytails or whatnot there's probably some things there um right the uh i mean she's
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:44.260]  so serious for this elementary school kid she's like i'm participating in berkeley busting
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:48.740]  i'm i'm ready to politically well she was so woke i mean she knew she was obviously
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.020]  going to be present back then oh yeah i mean she's got basically she's got the black panthers
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:56.860]  jacket on i mean she's ready to lead the revolution but what else do you think is sort of memeable
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:02.500]  about kamala harris moving forward you know i'm gonna have to do some thinking about it
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:09.420]  because there's nothing like uh that's this innately funny about her is she's she's such
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:15.620]  an empty suit maybe that's what's memeable that may be what actually is the memeable
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:21.740]  thing about her but uh she's just she's she's angry all the time but she doesn't really
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:26.660]  do anything and then like if she gets i think one of the best moments so far with her uh
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:31.980]  um was when she got uh stopped in the airport and then she just completely shut down because
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:37.580]  she couldn't even oh yeah that was anna paulina who uh who confronted her and yeah she she
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:41.780]  started fumbling and bumbling and she needed her security to come like escort her away
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:45.340]  it really showed how small she is talking to her and she's like oh i don't know what
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:48.740]  you do well let's talk about on the other side because you know you you've been censored
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:53.540]  on twitter and it's democrats are now pushing for censorship and one of them basically had

[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:03.020]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided that we're
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:06.620]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.140]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it I would talk about
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.860]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:17.260]  on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years I'm like
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.580]  hey you need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:23.500]  to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:28.300]  and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:33.580]  claims are supplements no under federal law since nineteen ninety six you can't say that
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:37.340]  a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:41.340]  it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:44.780]  the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.140]  things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:53.540]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info or store dot com

[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:19.060]  from the front lines of the information war it's owin shroyer you're listening to the
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.060]  alex jones show
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:28.300]  let's just recap for a second there were more trump supporters outside of the democrat
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:33.980]  debates than there were democrat supporters which is incredibly ironic considering their
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:37.780]  running fake polls saying that six democrats will beat trump in florida even though he
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:42.640]  gets 150,000 to sign up for a rally biden can't fill a high school gymnasium and nobody
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:49.500]  shows up for the democrat bates except trump supporters so what do the democrats do and
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:57.620]  what do their cohorts in media do in specifically big tech they censor the truth they censor
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:03.300]  reality they don't want you to know that trump beats any democrat right now 30 times over
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:08.180]  they don't want you to know that all the momentum and all the energy is in trumps favor they
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:16.460]  want you to think that these weak chicken neck nely democrat candidates have some a chance
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:21.340]  to beat trump even though there's literally zero and so what do they do they censor story
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:26.940]  of news wars dot com democrat senator post for censorship of the donald before it was
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:34.780]  quarantined by reddit now this is something that we see way too much we see this with
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:40.180]  uh... clowns like oliver darcy and brian stelter flagging people uh... judd legum
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:44.700]  uh... jared holt these are the biggest losers on earth i mean you know you talk about the
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.300]  biggest losers in america i just named four of them and so ron wyden the guy that doesn't
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:55.660]  pass the schmeltest he was pushing for the censorship of the donald subreddit just before
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.980]  it got banned or quarantined as they say so
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:02.500]  literally big tech is colluding
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.420]  with the democrat party
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:09.500]  to attempt to manipulate reality because they know so many people live in the digital world
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:14.100]  to manipulate reality to go with this lie that anyone of these democrats has a chance
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:17.420]  to beat trump there is zero chance there is zero
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.460]  energy so so first let's go to carpet dot com who's been censored before
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:26.340]  i mean what do you make it you seem to happen to you uh... american-hating leftist target
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.340]  you for censorship twitter response
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.980]  uh... democrats target conservatives and trump supporters for censorship
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.500]  big tech response me
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:38.700]  that is total collusion and that's total proof that they are trying to deceive the american
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.500]  people
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:45.900]  above and beyond just the fact that i've that i've been censored before uh... i'm from
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:49.740]  the donald that's where that's where i got my start i'm friends with
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.700]  with all the moderators there
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:55.940]  uh... my friends with a lot of the mean makers from there but that's
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:59.620]  i would consider that my home that's that's where i started out that's the first place
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.580]  that ever supported in my work
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.140]  uh...
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:09.620]  and uh... the attacks from uh... this the senator and uh... also uh... what's his name
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.900]  uh... carlos uh... matzah or whatever his name is
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.140]  uh... from
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.580]  that that was uh...
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:19.900]  trying to shut down prouder and all those people he also attacked only a day one days
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:20.780]  before
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:22.420]  yet they want uh...
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.220]  and that's not a slur that's his actual chosen handle on twitter
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.740]  uh...
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.380]  yeah that's the fifth biggest loser
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.100]  i mean seriously these people are just losers
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:36.740]  yet they have nothing to do uh... better than just goes shut people down and the
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:40.980]  donald has been uh... target for a long time i don't know people know this but
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:42.700]  uh... the donald is
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.460]  the only subreddit
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.020]  ons on on the whole site
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.740]  that cannot read reach the front page
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.460]  uh... they have been blocked from reaching the front page for more than a
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.340]  year and it's not a big a subreddit
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:59.180]  it's one of the biggest yeah it's got to be uh... politics is a little bit bigger
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.020]  but
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:00.820]  uh...
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:05.500]  they also hide the numbers uh... of how many people actually subscribe there's
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.260]  probably about six million people but they only show
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.860]  eight hundred thousand that are
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:13.100]  uh... on the actual site
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.340]  but they've uh...
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.100]  reworked their entire algorithm
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.420]  uh... to
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:20.620]  hold down
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:23.540]  the votes the upvotes from the donald
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:27.180]  there they have taken many actions for this one this is the
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:29.580]  most recent and most egregious but
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.940]  uh...
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.900]  they have been trying to censor and
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.620]  successfully censoring
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.060]  uh... to a certain extent
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.180]  two years now
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.420]  this is just the
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:42.620]  the newest wave of it and they've done this to us before
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.300]  uh... probably
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.940]  i'd say twelve months ago
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.380]  maybe fourteen months ago
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.900]  uh... they quarantined us for a couple days
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:50.900]  uh...
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:54.660]  and it is all about the same this all comes from the same group of people
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.860]  these leftist progressive democrats these fake liberals
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:01.420]  who hate free speech here's the analogy that i would say robert
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:02.940]  it's like this it's like okay
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.340]  let's go back to high school because these people have really never developed
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:08.780]  uh... i think maturity-wise
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.460]  past high school level
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.820]  it's like okay
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:13.500]  let's say we're in high school
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.340]  and uh... i'm gonna have a party this weekend i'm a pretty popular guy people
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.500]  like to come to my party is always a good time
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:22.740]  but there's this one kid in the class who picks his nose and eats his boogers
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.660]  you know he tells on you if you're passing notes to your you know
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:29.260]  you're the guy sitting on the desk next to you he's brown nosing the teacher all
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:30.140]  day
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:33.980]  uh... you know he's constantly nitpicking at you or whatever so
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:37.060]  you don't want that kid at your party you know nobody likes him nobody wants
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:37.660]  him there
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:38.980]  so that kid
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:43.100]  maybe bryan stelter high school which is surprisingly that's only like from five
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:43.780]  years ago
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:48.060]  uh... so so that's like that kid is like you know he's calling the teachers
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:51.420]  hey oh he's gonna have a party this weekend you should shut it down
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:54.380]  he's calling the cops there's gonna be a party at this address this weekend you
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:55.420]  should shut it down
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.420]  and so that's what it is
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.740]  they're like high school losers that because they never were able to develop
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:02.900]  social skills
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:06.100]  or they never had any interest in developing social skills they want
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.340]  everyone else to have a bad time they want nobody else to be able to have any
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:09.980]  fun
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.180]  that's who these people are that's who bryan stelter is that's a lot of arceus
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:17.140]  that's who chad ligum is that's who carlos masses that's who jared holt is
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:17.940]  guys
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:21.580]  you don't have to be losers like we want you to have fun with us but they just
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:22.980]  want to be total losers
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.860]  well i mean there's a good article today in the federalist uh... that's entitled
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:27.140]  voters are fed up
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.940]  with big tech monopolies trying to run their lives
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:33.500]  and it's about more surveys about more jury evidence it's about more
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.900]  uh... reviews from scholars and the rest
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.780]  with talking about with big tech
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:42.260]  people at the big tech has weaponized the ability to dehumanize people at a
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.660]  scale and without consequence
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.500]  social expectations
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.820]  as you're talking about do not limit them
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.020]  it's a new world
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:54.180]  where a hands-off model is falling very short of of understanding what's
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.100]  taking place
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:58.900]  his big tech is filled with people who quote wish to have absolute control over
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:39:59.980]  your interactions
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.860]  want to monitor every movement of your eyeball every twitch of your finger
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.700]  every thought of your mind and they do not see you as a human
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.140]  a human with dignity
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:12.140]  but it's nothing more than a click of a mouse or a tap on a screen
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.900]  there people who i mean half of them believe that the simulation is actually
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:17.340]  happening and occurring so there are people who
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:20.780]  they're the re the you know if some rejects become serial killers
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:23.100]  other rejects become big tech sensors
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.540]  and that's what's happened you have these uh... people who become
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.380]  were social rejects of dehumanized uh... everyone else
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.380]  want to control
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:33.900]  and the kind of kid who had sort of a controlling mommy at home who is saying
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:36.180]  you know make sure you go here make sure you go there
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.460]  make sure you do this make sure you do that there's sort of
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:40.900]  kyle from south park kind of personalities
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.140]  and the and now they have taken over
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.180]  and they actually control what's what you're allowed to say what you're allowed
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:48.660]  to speak what you're allowed to hear what you're allowed to read
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:52.020]  i mean not only was the donald uh... censored and taken off of reddit
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:55.580]  when it's already as because some loser ron wyden doesn't like it
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:59.700]  well completely i mean this is well senator and these are the clown world was
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.180]  such a bad show
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.820]  and it was a bad show that it was an unintended comedy
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:07.980]  and it was so such an unintended comedy that the only thing to go viral out of
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.620]  it is carpe's
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:10.620]  uh... video
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.940]  mean about it
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.100]  that's the only thing that really anybody's gonna remember aside from the
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.920]  fact that joe biden still likes busing but let's go back to the old high
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.860]  school analogy because there because there comes a time in high school to you
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:22.740]  know by your senior year people kind of
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:25.980]  the the whole popularity thing kind of just you know it the people don't know
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:28.980]  and so everybody gets invited to the parties that get the geeks the jocks
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.740]  and losers everybody at that point
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:33.820]  and it's like we're not even inviting them let's use the fourth of july as an
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.900]  example
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:38.180]  they could come out to the big fourth of july party and have a great time with
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:41.580]  everybody we're all american we're all celebrating they don't want to go now
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:45.260]  they're gonna protest america on the fourth of july
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:49.740]  i i would go talk to brian stelter if he was on the the national mall
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:53.500]  i'd go say hi to him if you if you wanted to have a beer with him i'll be
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.180]  drinks any beer not maybe one of those tiny little
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:58.700]  uh... soy milk if you get a little bit of soy milk
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:41:59.420]  here's
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.220]  as well as so it's a little bit of the kind of group here
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:03.660]  uh...
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:07.260]  if you want to have one of those i'd say tell them you jared jared hold is
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.060]  asking to go have coffee i don't have coffee with them
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:15.020]  and maybe not after the stuff that he's done recently but
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:18.620]  i can only go so far but uh... but that's the point is that we're sitting here
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:22.460]  like hey like you know you guys can be crazy leftist but let's at least come
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:25.260]  together and don't try to shut me up don't try to shut down my party don't

[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.140]  they wonder why they have no lives they wonder why there's such rejects
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:37.980]  because you suck quit sucking hate me
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:40.700]  yeah why does everybody hate me i'm just trying to shut them down and ruin

[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:56.780]  thanks for coming on alex jones on the other side hopefully uh the leftist
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:59.500]  don't complain barbara marge what does big tech become
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.300]  a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:06.300]  so is because they face no consequence social economic political or legal for
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.500]  their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.780]  the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.340]  that care about this the ordinary members of the public and the audience
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:18.460]  that care about this have to bring real social political economic
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.660]  consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:24.540]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:27.580]  trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran american
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:30.940]  economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:33.340]  depression the informer's audience is the fuel that
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:36.380]  flames the the light of liberty across the world
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:40.460]  to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:44.220]  promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.980]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:51.020]  shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:54.220]  it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:57.740]  isn't what you just saw even it is what what we just saw
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:01.340]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:04.860]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:08.780]  network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:12.380]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.580]  secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:20.140]  an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.660]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:26.940]  concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:30.620]  and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.580]  they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:37.020]  been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:41.180]  able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.260]  or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:48.780]  that they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:52.060]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:58.700]  onslaught of the blackwarming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:01.500]  in the 40 years that i've been in american politics
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.940]  i've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:08.620]  facts and truth and evidence no longer matters
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:12.540]  the false claim that you purposely said kitty porn
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:15.980]  to the sandy hook plaintiffs is ludicrous
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:21.020]  as well as false it's a smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.340]  you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:30.460]  documents and then it's blamed on you this is Kafka-esque this is bizarre
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:33.420]  but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:38.940]  jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous i have a lot of respect for those media outlets
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:42.940]  and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified but i went to
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:45.580]  where the big boys where's the wall street journal where's
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:49.740]  associated press when are they going to report that they made a mistake and
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:54.380]  what they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your help and i urge
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:58.860]  folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:02.220]  funny very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:05.340]  season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:08.380]  final mega counts we have do their criminal activity in their and their
[01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:12.220]  digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:14.620]  months a year we need to end here we need to be
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:18.300]  provisioned and you've got my total commitment that i am going to rampage
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:22.060]  forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm loving every minute of this because i
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:25.580]  know i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:29.420]  i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies not
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:32.940]  just brings more people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and i
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:36.700]  need war bonds i need gas i need ammo politically now
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:39.980]  but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:42.140]  purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.180]  you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong message
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.180]  to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:50.460]  right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.140]  will stand with us and i will never back down you have my commitment this only
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.860]  gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.140]  and that we were right about this

[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:03.740]  operation thanks to you the amazing audience and this amazing crew
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:10.700]  and everybody else we will prevail on this global friday edition i've got a
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:13.740]  big question for everybody yes we love trump he's in
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:17.580]  battled he's got a lot of great stuff done the media lies about him constantly
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.180]  so i i tend to defend him even when really he
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:25.420]  shouldn't be defended on some issues like censorship
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:28.220]  let me give you a great example it's breaking right now in full wars dot
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:31.580]  com and news wars dot com senator widen
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:34.780]  who's joined senator murphy bloom and thaw and others
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:38.460]  for calling me to be completely removed off the air period
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.380]  saying i'm a threat to american democracy well
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:45.580]  he came out and said the exact same thing about the donald
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:52.780]  subreddit the biggest subreddit on reddit now i was eradicated off reddit
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.500]  years ago and then once you're taken off there people
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:59.100]  can sit there and lie about you all they want make up whatever stories they
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.820]  want people who try to defend me they get banned too
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:05.580]  they become these authoritarian echo chambers well now
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:09.020]  you have the head of reddit and ask me anything
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:14.860]  event with senator widen on there and the full text of this screenshots
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:18.140]  is an apologist of what's an article in full wars dot com
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:22.060]  demanding that it be completely removed well
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:30.380]  reddit simply froze the account locked it down so no one could say anything
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:33.420]  that's beyond shadow banning i'm going to read some of the statements here in a
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.580]  moment but think about this all of these guys are on record when i got
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:41.180]  banned in august of last year 10 months ago
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:45.420]  the first big band the big concerted cartel band
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:49.820]  they all came out and said listen this is good but there's thousands of sites
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:56.300]  as bad or worse that's a quote from widen and all these other people
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:59.500]  all of a sudden all the other talk show hosts all the other bloggers
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:03.500]  almost all of them said ooh we better not come on alex jones' show anymore
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:08.380]  ooh we better not have him on our shows anymore
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:13.900]  because if we do that we'll get banned no when you act like that you get banned
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:17.900]  later and there's no one to stand up for you these are authoritarian tactics
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.500]  that have been used for thousands of years there's playbooks
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:26.620]  literally on it communist playbooks on it and we're falling right into the trap
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:32.780]  when someone gets banned i have them on when someone uh gets lied about i have
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.980]  them on when somebody's getting boycotted i buy
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:39.980]  advertising on their show like i did with limbaugh back when they were trying to
[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:43.980]  take him down seven eight years ago we hang together
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:48.060]  or we hang separate who is the only major media
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:53.180]  outlet that's big that understands us other than info wars
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:57.340]  it's mad rush the more we get persecuted the more he supported us
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:01.500]  and everybody else for that matter that's being persecuted oh who else
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:06.220]  tucker carlson and then you've got people like steven Crowder
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:10.940]  who said yes i'm directly having you on because of the latest
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:16.300]  facebook man two months ago and that's what it takes is it takes standing
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:21.820]  together and recognizing what's happening i care about the censorship of
[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:24.700]  all of us i could care less about it happening to only to me
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:28.060]  i care about my children i'm doing this because the globalist
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:32.300]  or tyrants and must be opposed i'm not doing this because i want the biggest
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:36.220]  radio or tv show so many people get into media to be popular
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:40.380]  and then when the going gets tough they become conservative light
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:44.540]  or patriot light or nationalist light no not me
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:48.780]  when the going gets tough i get 10 times more hardcore because that historically
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:53.740]  is the only way to make it out of a tyranny like this
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:59.340]  so think about it just yesterday twitter came out and said oh we're under a lot
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:01.740]  of pressure to censor conservatives by liberals but
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:03.980]  we're not going to do that which they've always been doing that
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:08.460]  it's just gotten worse we're going to shadow ban people lightly
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:10.300]  so we're not going to put you in a concentration camp we're just going to put
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.700]  you in a gulag or we're going to put you uh in a ghetto right now
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.140]  and then later we'll starve your death or blow your brains out i mean that's the
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:21.420]  equivalency of this because they know they can't
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:25.340]  hide the shadow banning anymore they know those congressional investigations
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:29.260]  and so now they're just going well yes we're going to hide some of trump's
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:31.340]  tweets and we're going to put little
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:34.700]  informationals literally created by the southern primary law center
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:39.580]  and snopes beside them it's incredible i played a clip
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:44.300]  of the cia director actually eddie bravo did on his podcast
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:47.900]  and the former cia director was talking about weather control
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:51.340]  weather modification when they pulled the youtube up where he was admitting
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:58.140]  weather control brennan they actually had a
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:01.900]  wikipedia link an encyclopedia link below it
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.260]  saying there's no such thing as weather modification this is a conspiracy theory
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:09.900]  so he's at the cfr he's saying it but because the countervailing statement is
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:14.220]  i'm wrong none of this exists even when they're admitting it to their own people
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:18.700]  the system has an automated pop up it puts that garbage out
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:23.260]  so when i say trump hasn't done enough on the censorship
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:27.500]  he hasn't it's just completely overwhelming because as i started out
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:32.460]  this transmission this report trump knows senator
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:35.660]  widen is doing this he knows senator murphy's doing this
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:39.020]  he knows they have hearings in congress where they say we want paul watson
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:41.500]  ban we want alex jones ban we want steven
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:46.060]  crowder band and no one is safe from this ladies and gentlemen this is
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:49.100]  oppression this is authoritarianism and we've already gone
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:53.740]  off the deep end now the left are censoring each other more and more
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.780]  this is beyond a slippery slope so here's the article
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:02.060]  dim senator pushed for censorship of the donald before it was quarantined
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:05.900]  by reddit ron widen told reddit's ceo form was
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:11.260]  inciting hatred on june 5th democrat senator ron widen pushed for the
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:14.220]  censorship of donald's subreddit just weeks before
[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:18.860]  it was quarantined by reddit as we reported on wednesday
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:24.300]  reddit quarantined the forum which is often a precursor to the total ban
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:28.300]  so do you get the picture president trump
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:32.380]  twitter is already shadow banning your tweets and already not letting most
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:37.020]  people see them and pushing them down that's been going on for two years
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:39.900]  now they're going to put comments on the side of your tweets
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:43.900]  or shadow ban them and they're announcing it to see what you'll do
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.020]  there's been calls in the media totally ban you off twitter
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:51.420]  and now the donald subreddit where they know most of the powerful memes come
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:57.580]  from is being blocked ahead of being totally banned
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:01.580]  the week you relaunched your presidential campaign 2020
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:07.340]  and who's demanding it the democratic party senators
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:13.580]  who sit on top the network that obama set up in the defense department
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:20.540]  before he left in 2017 in december of 2016
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:24.380]  he signed the executive orders creating the countering
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:30.380]  foreign disinformation and propaganda act and you notice what google did
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:33.420]  their head of censorship when she got caught this week
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:38.380]  in project veritas report she put out a report saying oh we just meant
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:44.140]  that we shadow ban and block foreign interference that would get trump
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:49.180]  reelected that's the cover they use when a senator calls up
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:53.260]  reddit or sends them messages publicly saying
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:59.100]  we want you to take down donald trump's biggest support website
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:05.420]  this is insane president trump this is not free market this isn't companies
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.380]  having their own policies this is the democratic party
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:11.740]  threatening regulation and sanctions on big tech
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.380]  if they don't censor the american people and meddle in the 2020
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:20.860]  election and you with brad parskills and all those other people
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:27.020]  obviously know what's going on so again i care about your president trump i
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:29.660]  admire you and i've gone through hell supporting you
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:32.700]  and i want to beat these people because if they get in power i'm probably
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:35.100]  going to have to leave the country they're already trying to put me in
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:39.100]  prison in your family in prison so don't be so confident that you think it's
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.340]  your rallies and you that's totally winning this
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:45.340]  what amplifies your voice to defeat the globalist is us
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.540]  and so when they shut us up they're shutting you up
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.380]  we need relief we need defense we need support right
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:55.820]  now president trump right now it's illegal
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:58.940]  it's election meddling and they're doing it in front of god
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:06.060]  and country at high noon pissing in our faces defend us defend yourself defend

[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:22.700]  trump to take action but it's time for american people to take action
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.900]  unbelievable they are probing and they are testing

[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:41.980]  from the president we don't need talk about lawsuits and talk about antitrust
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:45.500]  we need action
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:51.340]  info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:55.900]  unprecedented attack the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:58.620]  biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:03.340]  and i keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:06.620]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:10.860]  and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and thanks for
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:14.940]  keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:19.100]  and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:23.340]  cripple and so we've reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:25.820]  whatever we have with stood so many of their attacks
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:29.740]  we've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:33.100]  but let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.460]  and they're giving us their full assault so we need your prayers
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:40.700]  your financial support and your word of mouth now at info wars core dot com
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:44.380]  it's your fight decide whether or not you want info wars to continue
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:49.980]  because we could be shut down let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:53.500]  the air thanks for holding yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.460]  to fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:00.380]  and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:03.660]  think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:07.340]  war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in
[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:10.540]  the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:13.660]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:16.380]  think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.700]  praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.660]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:25.500]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.620]  80 years old i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:33.500]  if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you won a lot of battles
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:36.860]  and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:39.340]  continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.900]  and even if something does happen to you or your show
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:46.140]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.940]  sir for calling
[01:59:51.020 --> 02:00:04.940]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:09.900]  all right
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:15.980]  well ladies and gentlemen alexandria or geziocortesa
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:23.500]  or sandy went to an empty parking lot and brought her
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:28.220]  gang of thieves out there all with her dressed in white to show solidarity
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:33.580]  over fake news staged a photo shoot an empty parking lot claiming she was
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.540]  witnessing i guess the awful scene going on at
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:42.220]  what she believes are concentration camps maybe she should go to the holocaust
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:45.420]  museum in dc since he lives there now if you really want to see it
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:48.940]  uh actually really a great historical museum if you're into that
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:55.660]  but paul joseph watson has just put out a response to the total clown that is aoc
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:01:06.780]  here is the latest paul joseph watson video
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:11.100]  you know all those concentration camps on the border aoc has been telling us
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:14.300]  about well she's actually found one just look at the
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:19.420]  raw emotion the pain the anguish oh the humanity
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:22.460]  i'll never forget this because it was the moment i saw with my own eyes that
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:26.140]  the america i love was becoming a nation that steals refugee children from
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:30.060]  their parents and cage them i feel her emotions in every single picture
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:33.820]  especially the last one it's pure anger and how can one not feel anger after
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:38.060]  seeing what she saw really so what did she see
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:42.700]  distraught children separated from their parents mexican miners left to suffer
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:46.380]  alone in metal cages crying kids interned in barbaric
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:53.260]  concentration camps
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:58.060]  turns out it was an empty parking lot
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:01.980]  oh the humanity it's pure anger and how can one not feel anger after seeing
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:06.140]  what she saw i mean sometimes i get a bit peeved if i see a car parked
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:10.540]  slightly over the line when there's plenty of room but pure anger
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:15.820]  not really why so serious i mean we know aoc is big on the environment maybe
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:19.740]  she was mad at the lack of trees i saw with my own eyes that the america i
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:22.540]  love was becoming a nation that steals refugee children from their parents
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:25.100]  and cage them yeah you saw with your own eyes a few
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:28.700]  bored cops and a few dozen hysterical sanctimonious
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:33.980]  idiots pretending to cry over nothing for a crass photo op that's what you saw
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:37.820]  oh the humanity i'm just glad that uncle joe was there to comfort her
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.660]  i'm just glad that she was able to visit a planned parenthood abortion mill
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:45.020]  afterwards to cheer herself up oh the humanity
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:48.860]  i'm just glad that this photographer and this photographer
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:51.980]  and this photographer all captured her authentic
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:58.220]  in the moment grief ridden reaction to an empty parking lot in photos that
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:02.540]  were definitely not staged this definitely wasn't a photo
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:06.060]  up attended by over a dozen virtue signaling celebrities
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:09.900]  and it's definitely not a little odd to show up to a protest in the middle of
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:13.020]  a desert dressed in a pristine white outfit wearing
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:17.500]  bright red lipstick and a luxury watch because this definitely wasn't staged
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:21.980]  oh my gosh i'm so upset i'm just like oh i didn't even know there's gonna be a
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:25.980]  camera crew here today you need to let those children go
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:32.460]  oh my gosh i can't take it i'm gonna fake let those children go
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:35.580]  did you get that did you guys get a picture of that guys please make sure
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:39.660]  you get my thousand dollar Gucci watch on my designer boots in every shot okay
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:43.420]  when you're wanting chick filet really bad and you realize it's a sunday
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:47.740]  when you accidentally step on your dog's foot after gorging herself on burritos
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:52.700]  and retried beans aoc realized she had picked the wrong day to wear white
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:56.700]  when you realize the electricity it takes to power waste disposal units means
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:00.380]  the world's gonna end in 11 years not 12 when the
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:05.340]  breadline is too long all right no more boomer means a promise aoc's reaction
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:08.940]  in these photos is about as authentic as her fake black accent
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:13.500]  looks like ain't nothing wrong with that not authentic it's about as authentic
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:17.660]  as her claim of growing up in the Bronx when in reality she spent most of her
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:22.460]  childhood in york town heights which is 90 white not authentic it's
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:26.380]  about as authentic as her claim to care about the financial struggles of
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:29.820]  working-class new yorkers when she literally helped cancel a deal that
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:34.700]  would have brought 25 000 new jobs to new york
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:40.220]  no authentic you know it's really evil
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:43.660]  alexandra okcio-cortez is really an evil person
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:48.940]  to deceive to knowingly deceive to be a known fraud to be a blatant fraud
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:52.540]  you are an evil person you are truly a despicable human being
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:56.540]  it makes me sick to see what they do to people
[02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:00.700]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:04.860]  so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:08.460]  that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:11.100]  supporting one another and sustaining one another
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:15.900]  it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:19.580]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting
[02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:23.820]  self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure that because the
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:27.660]  audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:31.180]  is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:34.220]  because the audience spends their whatever it is whether it's five dollars
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:37.340]  or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:41.020]  actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:44.860]  and at the same time support press support speech support letting the
[02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:48.300]  audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:52.220]  and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is
[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:57.820]  the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:10.700]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex john show and
[02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:15.820]  now your host owin schreuer
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:24.860]  you know alexandra ocasio-cortez got her start behind the bar
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:31.020]  but probably belongs behind bars for the blatant deception she's engaged in you
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.900]  know it really actually angers me i'm trying to call myself here right now
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:38.780]  because she's just such a known fraud and she just acts like the most
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:42.940]  genuine caring person just a known fraud man
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:47.260]  i mean honestly i robert barnes with me here in studio
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:49.900]  we're gonna open up the phone lines we're gonna take your calls on last
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:53.980]  night's debate we're gonna take your calls on just the total phony that aoc
[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:57.980]  is but i mean what do you make of that i mean
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:01.500]  she obviously plans this whole thing she gets her gang out there but it's like
[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:04.780]  think about the the photo journalists that are involved in the hoax
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:08.540]  think about all the mainstream media that are involved in the hoax i mean
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:14.380]  this is the epitome of the democrat party all of them engaging in known hoax's
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.740]  known fake news is to deceive the american people
[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:21.180]  that's all they do well precisely i was actually reviewing an article that was
[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:24.860]  called america's white saviors and about how the white liberals are
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:28.220]  leading a woke revolution that is transforming american politics
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.940]  meanwhile the white liberals are literally the most racist people you'll
[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:32.780]  ever meet oh and well that was the other part the
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:37.340]  competence downshift by white liberals that when white liberals use less
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:40.380]  competence related languages to minority audiences
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:43.900]  now as they pretend to be dumb they basically presume what
[02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:47.660]  what elizabeth warn did in the debates where the first introduction she has to
[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:51.740]  african-american and latino voters is in relationship to prisons
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:54.860]  she's like in prisons and think about all the black and brown people and it's
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:58.060]  like hold on a second so so that's the only people to go to prison and that's
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:02.380]  her first words in a visual association with black and brown people is
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:05.980]  either their illegal immigrants that's what swalwell said swalwell said look at
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:09.340]  how offensive this illegal immigration policies are of the president
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:12.700]  towards all the hispanic people in the united states like all the hispanic
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:16.140]  people every mexican american is illegally according to swalwell so
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:18.620]  the that's the mindset they really have they they
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:22.620]  they have the worst racist biases of anybody
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:25.980]  they they engage in them and they relate to them and they connect to them
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:30.460]  and it's really part of this millennial culture aoc good bad and otherwise
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:34.300]  is a perfect manifestation of millennial leftism in america
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:37.900]  so it's it tends to be fake it tends to be shallow it tends to have very little
[02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:41.580]  substance but what it does well is it understand social
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:44.940]  media because that's what the article in tablet magazine was about
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:48.780]  was about the there has been no radicalization of the right in america
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:52.620]  they've you know they blamed info wars for radicalizing people info wars hasn't
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:55.180]  radicalized people info wars hasn't formed people
[02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:58.860]  and info wars has simply helped organize the populist movement
[02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:03.020]  by ordinary people all across the country joining info wars making info wars
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:06.940]  happen not corporate back not not sponsored by some billionaire
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:10.700]  we're beholden to nobody here there's no teleprompter up here there's no
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:13.980]  script that we have to read off of like poor joe biden was trying to do last
[02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:17.900]  night and couldn't remember his lines like an old actor who's passed his prime
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:22.540]  the instead what the millennial leftism culture has embraced and become a part
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:26.460]  of is this woke clickbait culture they grew up in a safe space culture where
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.580]  they're always scared of being kidnapped off the street their parents were
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:32.300]  so they didn't they weren't allowed to interact with other people they weren't
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:35.980]  allowed to interact in random ways they were the very social
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:39.420]  psychologists have pointed this out that's why they created a safe space
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:44.460]  culture online created a safe space culture in the on the college campuses
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:48.140]  created a safe space culture the debate was really a safe space debate
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:51.260]  it was a let's not ask any tough questions let's not ask any hard
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:54.380]  questions and how the biggest moment in the debate
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:58.460]  like what aoc feeds off of was when harris challenged biden
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:02.540]  on purely identity politics that's what that was and what biden was is because
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:05.980]  he did not understand the context of modern woke politics
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:09.820]  where this reinforced phenomenon of the radicalization of the white left
[02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:13.900]  has taken place in america over just the last three or four years
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:17.180]  to the point that barack obama is now considered a right-wing nut
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:21.100]  his policy positions of barack obama are completely
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:25.660]  anathema to today's democratic party that's why only joe biden was
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:29.100]  willing to even defend obama care last night nobody was willing to defend
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:32.620]  obama's immigration position kamala harris took shots at obama's
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:35.340]  immigration position so one of the presidents who
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:39.180]  what who create who was trying to allow illegal immigrants to become
[02:10:39.180 --> 02:10:41.900]  legal citizens one of the most radical moves in
[02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:46.220]  50 60 years of american politics that's considered too conservative for the
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:49.180]  modern-day democratic party and it's part of this millennial
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:52.860]  leftist push and what really happened is they grew up in a safe space culture
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:56.700]  they took over journalism they took over clickbait journalism in particular
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:00.620]  just as the white left was becoming increasingly dependent upon
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:03.660]  clickbait journalism places like the huffington post or even the new york
[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:07.340]  times for example they had a piece here in this tablet
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:10.300]  magazine article called america's white savior this
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:14.220]  predominantly a jewish-american publication and one of the things they
[02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:18.060]  talk about aside from showing first of all that white liberals are the only
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:21.180]  group in the entire country who hate themselves
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:25.340]  so african americans like themselves latinos like themselves asian americans
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:27.580]  like themselves and every white person who's not a
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:31.340]  not a liberal likes themselves but not white liberals that's why they prefer
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:34.300]  out groups that's why they celebrate somebody who's distant somebody who's
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:37.500]  foreign somebody who's exotic but they love abortion
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:40.380]  exactly they it's consistent across the board
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:44.140]  there's a self-hatred that sits underneath it and what they've shown is
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:48.300]  there's a reciprocal relationship between modern technology
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:51.340]  and these outrage mobs that have been formed online
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:55.580]  that are also about censorship and control which of course is all based on
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:59.900]  fake reality like aoc presenting herself being at a detention facility that she
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.020]  calls a concentration camp even though she's in an empty parking lot
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:06.860]  a known liar she's a known liar well in fact that's one of the things they
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:09.500]  point out here is there's been this massive search
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:13.100]  and articles and clickbait articles and that's led to google searches that leads
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.900]  to political discussion online by the white left
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:19.180]  and issues like white privilege racism social justice
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:22.300]  institutional racism people of color oppression
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:26.460]  marginalized groups all of these things have exploded in just the last several
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:29.020]  years because of the millennial culture taking over
[02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:32.700]  journalism reinforcing its social media bias amongst the older portions of the
[02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:36.380]  white left and that leads to people believing
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:40.140]  only white liberals suddenly believing racial discrimination is a very serious
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:43.660]  problem in america and that it relates somehow to illegal immigration
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:47.420]  because of the the racial prejudice prejudices that actually the white
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:50.780]  left has they went from only you know 25 30 percent of people
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:53.100]  believing that for 20 years to all of a sudden 60 percent
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:56.540]  well and that's another that's a form of projection where the average white
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:59.740]  liberal is a racist and so they just project it on
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:02.460]  everyone else they just assume everyone is as racist as they are
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:05.980]  even though that's not the case exactly in fact but and again because they like
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:09.180]  the out they they like outgroups better than they like in groups
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:11.820]  the and the sort of persecution by the privilege
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:15.420]  uh is is the sort of the attitudes they get but going to that point
[02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:17.900]  what happens is and this is what they say in the article
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:21.500]  the problem is when these moral emotions of the outrage white left
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:25.180]  become hyperactive and as you were pointing out detached from objective
[02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:27.580]  reality they're no longer connected to the real
[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:30.060]  world they motivate division of the society into
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:34.140]  allies and enemies they generate a level of sanctimonious outrage and
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:36.860]  judgment that places all political dissent beyond
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:40.380]  the pale because what happens is they have to associate it with race in order
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:43.260]  to get outraged and feel good about the outgroup
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:46.780]  that's part one and part two is by doing so everybody who disagrees with them
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:50.060]  becomes a racist and that allows them to censor them that allows them to
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:53.580]  control them that allows them to systematically censor them
[02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:56.620]  and they create and they use modern technology to achieve this
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:14:00.700]  twitter facebook social media mechanisms all the clickbait journalism
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:03.900]  that's occurring you know in slate and vox and other places
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:08.780]  the uh in their world white racism greets african-americans at every corner
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:11.900]  and what's fascinating is african-americans and latinos and asians
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:15.180]  have not changed their minds so it's it's only the white left that's getting
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:18.940]  radicalized because of their outgroup obsession that's really rooted in
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:22.940]  various forms of racial prejudice that people like aoc playoff of
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:27.100]  and that last night joe biden was the victim of of the race bait politics
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:31.180]  that is effectively completely destroying the democratic party i mean if
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:34.300]  you take that apart and this actually goes back to the 1970s
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:36.940]  where you know african-americans were critical of white liberals because they
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:40.300]  saw them as hypocritical and fake that's what camala harris was playing on
[02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:42.460]  last night she was playing on the clickbait
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:47.580]  wokeness culture uh the in fact van jones on cnn referred to biden is not
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:50.700]  being woke enough um now he was asleep in a lot of
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:54.460]  other ways sleepy joe but uh but he was uh he was asleep
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:58.300]  in terms of the woke revolution of the white left that now sees race above
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:02.060]  everything sees racism everywhere sees color everywhere even in places african
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.780]  americans latinos and others do not you know like if you're not addressing the
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:10.140]  bogeyman or racism you're not legitimate and that's how an issue from the 1970s
[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:13.820]  which was his opposition to busing and the reason why he opposed busing is
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:16.300]  because about 90 percent of america opposed busing
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:19.500]  that's the real reason why he opposed busing he was a populist right the
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:22.060]  the joke is that he opposed busing because he knew camala harris was going
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:24.940]  to throw him under the bus uh and that other people have done so in the past
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:28.380]  and then she did and she did she threw him under the bus completely and uh
[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:32.140]  that's why he he got run over run backwards run sideways and he wasn't
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:35.900]  ready for the woke revolution of the white left who's here to defend us
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:38.300]  from uh the the great evils of uh of racial
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:41.980]  oppression and so and so we're the laughing stock of the world because of
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:44.780]  the left putin is calling it out we'll address that on the other side but the

[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:21.580]  robert barneson studio as well we're about to take your phone calls at
[02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:24.780]  eight seven seven seven eight nine alex
[02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:27.980]  we've got callers lined up and ready to go
[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:34.380]  i want to put two stories together and explain why we're the laughing stock
[02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:38.300]  of the world because of people like aoc
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:43.100]  you see i don't know if consciously people like aoc have realized that
[02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:46.140]  they're only reaching the lowest iq voter
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:49.900]  they may be doing that intentionally maybe there's she's just low iq herself
[02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:53.740]  and doesn't realize that uh that's who she's pandering to but i would imagine
[02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:56.540]  so when she stages totally fake photo shoots and
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:00.620]  gets a hundred thousand likes for it uh i mean she obviously knows it's fake
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:04.620]  but vladimir putin has called up uh has gone
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:07.820]  really strongly against globalism and liberalism saying it's no longer
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:11.500]  tenable uh and there's all kinds of stuff and of
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:15.660]  course that's why the democrats are trying to demonize russia and try to
[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:17.580]  start a war with russia because russia isn't
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:21.340]  self-destructive russia is not communist russia doesn't want to
[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:24.700]  sexualize its kids with drag queen story time
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:27.980]  or the lgbtq agenda so therefore russia is bad
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:31.660]  they're not sexualizing the kids they're not driving their citizens into
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:37.180]  poverty with fake socialism which is just uh enriching themselves
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:40.860]  like bernie sanders does or aoc does but
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:45.020]  i look at the aoc story as the perfect example as to why
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:48.300]  we are the laughing stock of the world when you have
[02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:57.020]  a complete dumbass aoc winoff is do fakes photo shoots lie about who she is
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:59.900]  and you have hundreds of thousands of people loving it
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:03.420]  to me it's like depressing like oh my gosh like
[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:07.340]  really this this total phony woman can become so popular
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:10.940]  yeah that's why liberalism is dying yeah that's why liberalism is untenable
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:15.340]  because it's all fake it's all phony it's a it's a paper mache it'll blow over
[02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:19.180]  in a in a windstorm and so that's aoc but she knows she's a total
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:21.980]  liar she knows she's a deceiver she knows she's the
[02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:27.740]  devil and you know i don't know aoc but you know there's this
[02:22:27.740 --> 02:22:31.020]  thing robert about first impressions and you know
[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:35.980]  presenting yourself as a public figure so i don't know aoc but
[02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:39.340]  based on what i've seen she's a total phony she's a total liar
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:42.780]  and she's evil what she does is she effectively
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:46.540]  emulates the the millennial leftist culture
[02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:50.220]  which believes in various forms of government control believes in all the
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:53.820]  mythology they've been taught in their public education in public universities
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:57.180]  basically doesn't believe in the country doesn't believe in the idea of country
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:59.740]  you saw they reflected on yesterday doesn't believe in anything really except
[02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:02.540]  socialism exactly i mean elissa malano was on there talking
[02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:06.140]  yesterday about on twitter about she didn't understand why people were
[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:09.500]  obsessed with this arbitrary line she's referring to the border
[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:13.100]  just called it an arbitrary line yeah yeah but but that's progressive you know
[02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:16.460]  getting rid of borders is progressive even though having borders was progressive
[02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:19.180]  at one time like when humans were starting to figure out how to build
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:22.620]  civilizations in society or even just four years ago i mean like the
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:26.220]  go back and look at the polling survey 90 percent of white liberals said we
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:29.660]  should not have more immigration oh absolutely biden used to run on closing
[02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:33.900]  the border and deporting obama did i mean they voted to build a wall even i mean
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:37.740]  it's a total joke but that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying is that
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:42.300]  they know that they can lie there's sadly so many low IQ people that are so
[02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:45.500]  uninformed misinformed brainwashed they know they can lie they know they can
[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:48.700]  stage fake photo shoots they know they can lie about their heritage
[02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:51.980]  they know they can lie about who they are they know they can lie about socialism

[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:18.780]  chase the patriot in california go ahead
[02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:22.780]  hey what's up on great show the last couple days and i want to start on that
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:26.700]  you know you really think about the way you guys did your broadcast with savannah
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:31.020]  hernandez and great grease on the street it really gave a great perspective
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:34.700]  but first of all did nobody actually cared about 20 democrats
[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:38.620]  all in one city but nobody even cared and nobody showed up
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:43.260]  but at the same time you see the multimillion dollar corporation of ms
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:46.060]  nbc and they can't even get their mics to work
[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:50.460]  but luckily when their mics didn't work it was right at the perfect moment
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:55.020]  it was like the hand of god coming down i could not believe over and over
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:58.460]  chup todd asking one after the next how are you
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:02.620]  going to go get those hundred million guns from the law abiding citizens i just
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:06.460]  could not believe it oan how long ago was it where
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:09.740]  you know we're not going for your guns nobody wants your guns and what is it
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:12.940]  today they're the same thing with the open border
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:15.500]  but that's what i'm saying that's what's so frustrating about all this i mean
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:18.940]  that's why i got into political news i mean i don't even know there's nothing
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:21.980]  i can really say there's no amount of emotion there's no amount of anger
[02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:26.380]  there's nothing i can do to really show you how i truly feel about these liars
[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:30.460]  that's what this is i mean these are liars i mean really at the end of the
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:35.100]  day let's just cut it simple the average democrat is a liar
[02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:38.380]  the average left-wing media pundit is a liar
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:42.780]  that's who these people are well truth is their adversary because truth makes
[02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:46.540]  them unpopular and so consequently they can't really discuss and debate the
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:49.980]  issues in a truthful honest way and the few who can
[02:26:49.980 --> 02:26:53.500]  people like andrew yang what do they do they they cut off his mic in the second
[02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:57.340]  debate the people like tulsi gabbard what do they what does the media do
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:01.420]  they try to that the only negative confrontational question
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:04.860]  asked in two nights of debate over four hours
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:09.580]  of 20 candidates is the tulsi gabbard that's it i mean this is like i mean
[02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:14.220]  maybe this is a crude comparison but i've worked at camps before
[02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:18.780]  uh you know where it's for mentally ill mentally retarded kids
[02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:21.740]  and you know when you're when you're leading that camp you have to be really
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:24.700]  focused on keeping everybody organized and you know keeping everybody on task
[02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:28.300]  and everything and it imagine though it's like
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:32.940]  imagine a cat a camp counselor for mentally retarded kids have down syndrome
[02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:36.940]  or something like that and the camp the camp counselor wants like you know his
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:41.020]  car cleaned or something so it's like oh we got a project today we're cleaning
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:44.380]  the cars and like every day it's like oh you're cleaning his car
[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:46.940]  you're you know cleaning his house or something like that well you're gonna be
[02:27:46.940 --> 02:27:49.580]  like wait a second you're a total scumbag
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:52.940]  you're taking advantage of of mentally retarded people for your own agenda
[02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:55.900]  lying about it i mean maybe again maybe that's a crude
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:59.100]  comparison that's what the democrats do to their voters
[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:02.060]  well it's necessary to sort of gin them up in other words if they ever actually
[02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:05.500]  succeeded in delivering meaningful protection for african-american
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:09.180]  community which they never have done exactly because they can't
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:12.700]  because if they ever do then the african-american community no longer
[02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:16.380]  needs the democratic party for special protection because that's their pitch
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:20.300]  their pitch is you need us for special protection otherwise there's these bad
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:23.820]  evil people that are going to come for you so they have to create this false
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:27.980]  racial reality to terrorize their own constituency and voting for them and
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:30.860]  then they have to not solve their problem oh my gosh
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:34.220]  no exactly it's like it's like again if you're the camp counselor for
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:37.980]  for this this camp of mentally retarded kids and you say
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:41.980]  oh if you don't clean my car you know the big bad boogeyman is going to take
[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:45.020]  your mommy and daddy from you that's literally what these democrats do man
[02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:48.860]  it's pure evil it's pure evil man i'm just sick of it

[02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:55.180]  revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the chai com so go to info
[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:59.100]  war store dot com
[02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:07.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:23.660]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he it's alex jones and now your host
[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:27.900]  owin treuer so we're taking your calls but in the break
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:31.740]  robert barnes and i are just discussing this because i'm just at a loss for
[02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:36.220]  words i really am and i studied psychology in college
[02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:40.780]  but i just cannot understand how people can be known
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:43.980]  committed liars like to go into a situation and plan
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:47.260]  online like you know that that's the incredible thing like
[02:33:47.260 --> 02:33:50.780]  and we just use this aoc instance now because it's trending right now it's the
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:54.060]  story but it's like and this is why putin is like no your leftism your
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:56.700]  globalism is not tenable it's a house of cards it's built on a fake
[02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:59.420]  foundation it's all lies he's a hundred percent right
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:04.860]  and just i just i can't even get that mindset but maybe you just hit on it
[02:34:04.860 --> 02:34:09.420]  how can you go into a situation consciously and plan on lying and deceiving
[02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:12.700]  like aoc did at the park lot but i think that you answered that
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:15.980]  because we have a hoax culture a hoax culture where you can become a celebrity
[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:19.900]  by hoaxing that's why we have so many hoax crimes hoax hate crimes
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:22.540]  they i mean they just do it repeatedly and there's really no adverse
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:25.900]  consequence that they suffer for it so that's a big component like i could
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:28.700]  come on here and i could lie and make stuff up and get famous
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:32.460]  but it's it would never even cross my mind it's because they've grown up in a
[02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:35.580]  culture where they get rewarded and celebrated for it if they do so
[02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:38.380]  that they don't suffer an adverse consequence even if they're caught and
[02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:41.020]  exposed look at all the people doing these hoax hate crimes
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:43.980]  not a single one within the left has been criticized instead they're
[02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:46.620]  they're still sympathized with they're still made celebrities
[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:51.180]  that it's it's sort of jerry springer combined with safe space lefty culture
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:55.020]  you you mix the two and you end up with hoax culture no that
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:57.740]  you you actually just hit it on the head i just realized it
[02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:03.740]  whenever i would tell a lie even even karma would come and get me for i
[02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:06.060]  learned this i learned this at a very young age
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:08.780]  and and so i never wanted to wrong people again because karma kept would
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:11.420]  always come back or i would feel so bad or whatever
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:15.180]  that's what it is these people have never met karma
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:18.860]  they've never had their lives come and catch up to them and discipline them
[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:24.220]  now it will eventually maybe not tomorrow but that's what it is
[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:28.220]  that's what that's why they could never grow up they've never had to be
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:32.380]  responsible for their actions and that's why they tout all these policies of
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:35.340]  lack never taking responsibility for your actions
[02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:38.700]  never just being able to lie about whatever you want because
[02:35:38.700 --> 02:35:41.900]  well you can get away with it so when you combine those two things it's a very
[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:44.860]  dangerous thing this is what the left has become self-destructive
[02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:49.340]  they hate themselves you covered that story it's really sad that we're watching
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:54.380]  our our our fellow americans just get deceived and brainwashed
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:59.100]  like this it honestly hurts my soul and i wish that
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:02.620]  there was some way we could wake them up but i guess when you know aoc has the
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:05.900]  power of twitter and instagram boosting all of her
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:08.460]  lies and fake news and you know that's what we put up with
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:11.260]  and then meanwhile they censor us all right let's go back out of the phone
[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:16.540]  line let's go to darrell in texas go ahead darrell
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:19.500]  good afternoon gentlemen thanks for calling
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:23.180]  hey i wanted to give my theory on why i do not i do not think that
[02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:27.740]  democrats uh it is not their time this next election
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:33.900]  and that is they are basically the same place the republican party was
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:38.220]  two elections ago when we were trying to get run paul elected
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:42.060]  the best thing for their party is tolsey gabard right now
[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:45.020]  and they don't want her no that's what we were discussing too
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:48.780]  or or even andrew yang and again i'm not even saying i like necessarily the two
[02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:51.260]  as a candidate but just from a neutral perspective
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:53.660]  observing it from a political perspective
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:57.260]  the democrats need fresh blood right now oh and they're they're dead
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:01.020]  from a political betting perspective tolsey gabard from a trumpian perspective
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:05.180]  uh tolsey gabard would be uh crim tonight to trump superman
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:09.180]  uh appeal because you have someone who's a veteran who's a woman who's from
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:12.700]  hawaii uh who you know serfs in their spare time
[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:16.540]  you know not john carrey kind of windsurfing but like real surfing
[02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:19.580]  uh she did like a whole physical workout before the debates and she's level
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:22.860]  headed very level headed very realpolitik
[02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:26.860]  clearly consistently anti-war used to have conservative social opinions before
[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:30.620]  she ended up with lefty social opinions so she's the kind of candidate who could
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:34.220]  pose a real risk to trump but ideally but you know perfect
[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:37.340]  for trump the democrats are going to run her off in isolator she's the only one
[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:41.260]  who got a negative question out of the 100 plus questions asked over two
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:43.820]  nights over four hours to 20 different candidates
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:46.780]  the only one who got a negative question was the one who was at you know one
[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:49.580]  two percent in the polls well and just because you're so scared the democrats
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:53.660]  are so scared of her and not only that look at the disdain that the democrats
[02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:57.660]  have even for their voter base when if you look organically
[02:37:57.660 --> 02:38:01.340]  who are the two most popular people tolsey gabard andrew yang
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:04.700]  yeah that's just organic natural politics you think they'd be picking up on
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:07.420]  that no they have total disdain for the american people
[02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:10.700]  they have total disdain for their constituents and so they say oh you want
[02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:13.500]  tolsey gabard you're not going to get her oh you want andrew yang
[02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:16.860]  we're going to cut his mic off i think that the democrat voter voters are
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:20.620]  going to see this i don't they are so mismeasured right now they're
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:24.860]  this is what it is they they become such phonies they become such liars
[02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:28.220]  they become so detached from reality they don't even understand how they're
[02:38:28.220 --> 02:38:31.180]  killing themselves now exactly i mean one of the things in that article that
[02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:34.460]  the tablet had about the so-called white saviors of the left
[02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:38.540]  is how out of touch they were with other democrats in their own party african
[02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:42.380]  american democrats latino democrats and other white democrats i mean half of
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:45.100]  the white vote within the democratic primary process
[02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:48.220]  are going to be non-college blue collar middle class americans
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:52.620]  they're not into this woke revolution yet nobody is talking to them at all
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:55.180]  yeah but but the democrats are going to get every
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:59.420]  um trans male transsexual man that's pregnant they're going to get every one
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:02.300]  of those to put those votes so that may put them over the line thanks for the
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:06.140]  call darryl let's go to matt in california go ahead matt
[02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:13.100]  hello royal what's up man hey it's matt out in california again i got an idea
[02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:18.380]  for the next debate if carpe could pull it off or possibly somebody out there
[02:39:18.380 --> 02:39:27.100]  in the audience has a wherewithal to create a deep fake live with the
[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:30.540]  candidate oh no no i think i get what you're saying
[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:33.500]  so it's basically like on snapchat and stuff they have these filters where they
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:37.660]  can put like a dog on your face or like you know make you look like a man
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:42.460]  have a clown mat have like a clown thing and you record it with the clown thing
[02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:45.180]  and then you record the democrat debates and they'll have clown clown on the
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:49.740]  clowns on their face live yeah if it can be done
[02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:53.820]  oh man some for oh it could definitely be done
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:58.940]  i have some for rubber too this is totally crazy sounding but uh
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:07.420]  the world seems so corrupted now and the possible blackmail so deep i wonder
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:11.740]  if there would be possibility of pulling off some kind of legal
[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:15.340]  way out for all these people that might be compromised
[02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:20.540]  like when you're testifying against you know mob bosses or whatever you get an
[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:25.420]  immunity so would there be possibility like people against corruption
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:29.260]  and anybody who decides to come forward would get immunity
[02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:33.100]  to just say just spill our guts and say okay this is what they got on me
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:36.460]  and just you know we're gonna use this and we're gonna
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:39.500]  absolve you basically of your sins and give you forgiveness
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:43.500]  for for for allowing you know well i could see i could see that could maybe
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:46.540]  be going on behind the scenes and i want to get your response to this robber
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:50.620]  but i look at a guy like eric swalwell on the stage and adam schiff in office and
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:53.420]  i'm thinking i mean how that's blackmail like there's no
[02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:56.620]  way those guys are in office that has to be a hundred percent blackmail but
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:59.500]  coming from the legal perspective i mean have you ever dealt with something like
[02:40:59.500 --> 02:41:02.860]  that i mean the only people that can do that within our legal system are
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:06.380]  prosecutors either state or federal particularly federal uh so you could i
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:09.260]  would call it a reverse comey because it is what comey did all of for all of
[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:12.700]  hillary's people the reason why he was given away immunity like candy and
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:16.940]  immunity is supposed to be a very controlled uh discipline process that
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:20.540]  gets multiple levels of high-ranking approval clearly didn't happen in coma
[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:24.620]  in the hillary investigation case but the reason he did that is he immunized
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:27.900]  tons of people it's the same reason why moeller kept showing up immunizing
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:32.140]  people that were caught with child porn real child porn and again this is
[02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:35.260]  he was the one that cut the deal with alexandra costa who's in trump's
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:38.700]  administration so maybe that's a specific example maybe a cost is like
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:42.220]  all right here's what they got on me i let this pedophile off
[02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:45.340]  i'll work with you to expose them well all those people have i'm not saying i
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:48.060]  know that i'm just well all those people have extraordinary blackmail files
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:50.780]  so the i mean the reason why i mean moeller did a big deal with asimov's
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:55.500]  kid in san francisco back around 2001 in which he the the inference was why did
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:58.620]  this guy get such a sweetheart deal when they found the information on him
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:01.900]  and the same with epstein epstein is listed as a as a basically as a witness
[02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:04.780]  for moeller that's the reason why epstein got the deal
[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:08.540]  the moeller had the miller moeller did a deal with that nater
[02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:11.580]  george nater character who ended up having all kinds of child porn finally
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:14.700]  got prosecuted on it recently when he was trying to get him to say bad things
[02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:17.980]  about trump that the nater story is unbelievable this guy's been caught
[02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:22.380]  with child porn like five times and it's like he still hangs out around dc
[02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:25.740]  like he's one of the crew and as long as he was reading the script that the
[02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:28.460]  that moeller or someone like moeller wanted to have happened
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:31.020]  then then what was happening was that these guys were getting to walk
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:34.780]  repeatedly uh tony pedesta never faced prosecution for his involvement in
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:38.460]  what he organized manifold to do you know what i just wish you know the left
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:41.580]  sits here in virtue signals like they care about kids and everything
[02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:45.420]  don't you wish that the left was anti pedophile for once oh precisely i mean
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.300]  the especially you look at the there's more increasing movement to try to
[02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:50.540]  normalize pedophilia i mean i i'm not saying they're all
[02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:53.580]  pedophiles but it's like if you're not against pedophilia i mean
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:57.500]  what am i what else might i think info wars and free speech
[02:42:57.500 --> 02:43:01.900]  and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:05.740]  it's it's it's orwellian it's it's biblical it's it's authoritarian it's
[02:43:05.740 --> 02:43:09.500]  insane and i keep trying to judge and gauge when
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:12.940]  is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:17.100]  captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking
[02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:19.980]  i've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat but
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:22.940]  this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products
[02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:27.100]  and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just
[02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:29.740]  crippled and so we've reached that point
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:33.020]  it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever we have withstood so many of
[02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:36.380]  their attacks we've gone through so much because of your support
[02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:40.140]  you have you have been there but let me tell you they are pissed they haven't
[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:43.500]  been successful and they're giving us their full assault so we need
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:47.180]  your prayers your financial support and your word of mouth now
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:51.420]  at info warscore.com it's your fight decide whether or not you want info
[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:55.500]  wars to continue because we could be shut down
[02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:59.100]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[02:43:59.100 --> 02:44:01.500]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars
[02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:05.660]  is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate
[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:08.940]  donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:12.140]  that's not being funded by secret foreign government it is completely
[02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:16.460]  independent of all that it is an old-school american 1776 style
[02:44:16.460 --> 02:44:19.500]  experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.860]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:25.660]  country they actually tried to support and subsidize
[02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:28.940]  organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:32.140]  and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:35.660]  by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:39.980]  and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or
[02:44:39.980 --> 02:44:42.380]  hear and the info wars audience has broken through
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:46.220]  that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:49.020]  ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an
[02:44:49.020 --> 02:44:52.300]  unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation
[02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:59.100]  lawfare and libel targeting you i talk about this on the air and i know it
[02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:02.300]  sinks into people but i've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:05.660]  supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship
[02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:08.940]  of the tax and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:11.980]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors
[02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:15.100]  on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:18.220]  i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:20.540]  thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and
[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.420]  how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere
[02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:28.220]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:31.820]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:34.860]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[02:45:34.860 --> 02:45:38.220]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them
[02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:41.500]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and
[02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:44.620]  manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have
[02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:48.140]  side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing
[02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:51.580]  about god's medicine chest info or store dot com
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:56.620]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:45:56.620 --> 02:45:59.980]  only very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the
[02:45:59.980 --> 02:46:03.100]  season of war and they had been inches from shutting down the
[02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:06.060]  final bank accounts we have do their criminal activity in there and their
[02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:09.740]  digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:13.580]  six months a year we need to in here we need to be provisioned and you've got
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:16.940]  my total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the enemy
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:20.780]  fearlessly i'm loving every minute of this because i know i'm getting under
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.340]  their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically
[02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:26.940]  i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies
[02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:30.300]  that just brings more people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so are you
[02:46:30.300 --> 02:46:34.460]  and i need war bonds i need gas i need ammo politically now
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:37.740]  but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product
[02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:39.900]  purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth
[02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:42.860]  you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong message
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:44.940]  to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:48.220]  right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you
[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:50.780]  will stand with us and i will never back down you have my
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:54.140]  commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding of what
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:57.740]  we're facing and that we were right about this
[02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:15.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:24.140]  it's the gung slinging wild west of news it's info wars dot com started more than
[02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:28.860]  20 years ago by alex jones and is now the most influential impactful news
[02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:32.780]  organization in the world despite more censorship than any
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:36.220]  news outlet has ever endured in modern history
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:41.020]  alex jones is on the line with us now alex
[02:47:41.020 --> 02:47:44.940]  you're trying to enjoy some time away from the office but wild horses can't
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:49.180]  drag you away my friend well that's right i'm rarely here by a creek
[02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:54.300]  really in to let you have us catch it fast hurts you've had this with my daughters
[02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:57.180]  uh i'm just listening over the phone i can't help it
[02:47:57.180 --> 02:48:00.140]  guys this is not going to have a part incredible job all the listeners but
[02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:02.860]  that last caller matt i'm gonna start a show now this week
[02:48:02.860 --> 02:48:06.220]  give him a nice weekend every Saturday that in a few months will be hosted by
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:08.940]  the by the caller you got to get that matt gas
[02:48:08.940 --> 02:48:11.900]  full name in about i want him to be one of the callers of the first show is
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:16.220]  every time he calls he has three points what a genius idea about not even a
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:19.100]  beat effect they'll call it that but they only have two or three different
[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:23.500]  camera shots so just have a clown face we already made great ones for our world
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:28.780]  that goes over each one uh and then just basically lay in as a template over the
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:32.540]  next debate that's actually pretty easy to do if you've already got the clowns
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:35.100]  ready you see the shots they're going to use beforehand
[02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:38.700]  within a few minutes into the show and start turning into clowns
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:43.260]  when they tell them they're woppers so we're gonna i do but the even better idea
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:46.620]  that guy is that we need trump to really freak the left
[02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:49.900]  out i know my cell's back i'll take it off in a minute
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:54.300]  uh we need him to say hey i'll give partners to anybody that exposes
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:57.820]  criminal activity in the republican or the democratic party
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:01.580]  that leads to you know indictments or whatever and say
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:04.780]  we know the democratic party's a globalist mafia working for the psychoms
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:08.620]  and so is hollywood so all these big tech people that are already going public
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:16.220]  will give you basically uh amnesty uh or or or a pardon uh give you come out and
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:20.140]  expose the crimes that are going on and i think that right there of trump put in
[02:49:20.140 --> 02:49:26.460]  a anti uh a mafia hotline a organized crime hotline
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:29.900]  for any crime republican or democrat you'll be able to fry the neocons and
[02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:33.020]  the democrats and barns as a constitutional lawyer smart on this but
[02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:36.380]  just the stunt of doing it is pure genius so that matt guy
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:40.220]  he's our he's our new consultant uh well and imagine too that would be like
[02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:43.740]  trump launching project veritas right out of the white house
[02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:46.620]  exactly that's what trump instead of just having a fire set yet
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:50.460]  he needs project veritas out of the white house and then once a week
[02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:53.820]  or whoever he wants does a presentation
[02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:57.100]  and all the circumstances with the corruption and and and well that's what
[02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:59.340]  the summit coming up with things like that but i'm telling you
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:01.900]  this is what needs to happen back to the gentleman the back of the wonderful
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:06.940]  group we have changed the world globalism is in
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:10.460]  retreat the left is getting more hardcore and trying to finish with the
[02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:13.900]  original project was because we've unmasked them they're admitting they're
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:16.380]  unclogged you so many good things are happening and
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:19.900]  yeah it's well for those of us with a spear not being punished but it's all
[02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:22.220]  been so worth it i just don't think we've come with
[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:24.300]  joy said not that the successes we're having
[02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:27.740]  still in one hell of a life but we are at the tip of the spirit and not just
[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:30.620]  just saying all of this we're just up here claiming we're changing the world
[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:33.340]  thanks to you we're all doing it together it's really
[02:50:33.340 --> 02:50:37.340]  happening we'll prove those Jesus Jesus who's not so much and just
[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:40.140]  god bless you all back to the great gods and everybody have a wonderful weekend
[02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:44.060]  we'll have four lives tomorrow get on the screen tomorrow
[02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:49.660]  Sunday show coming up it's beautiful it's just damn amazing
[02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:53.100]  and and you know listening to alex and kind of remembering what some of the
[02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:57.660]  other callers said and just my complete lack of understanding
[02:50:57.660 --> 02:51:01.260]  how somebody could be such a a bold-faced liar i realized now too
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:04.460]  because see there's one thing that i don't think anybody
[02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:08.780]  most people could never relate to specifically myself
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:12.540]  i would imagine most people have never been blackmailed
[02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:16.300]  to such an extent that basically your life is no longer your life
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:20.140]  and if you just have two or three candidates from the democrat side
[02:51:20.140 --> 02:51:23.260]  blackmailed into forcing your narrative out there
[02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:26.140]  that changes the whole narrative and even people that may not be under your
[02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:29.260]  control now have to go with that narrative just to try to fit in
[02:51:29.260 --> 02:51:32.540]  with what they think is the organic movement of a popular democrat
[02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:37.580]  even though it's all astroturf and at the very base of it is just blackmail
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:39.660]  so maybe that's i mean look at joe biden i mean
[02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:44.060]  ukraine could blackmail joe biden i mean you want to talk about blackmail i mean
[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:47.260]  with joe biden's son hunter and everything i mean it's crazy
[02:51:47.260 --> 02:51:50.460]  well there's a reason why hoover had the files that he had and if you dig into
[02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.660]  it and sort of what alex is talking about we don't need amnesty for illegal
[02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:56.380]  aliens we need amnesty for deep state whistleblowers
[02:51:56.380 --> 02:52:00.780]  what we need is a and if the president himself can do that the president can
[02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:03.900]  he has the power to the power of the pardon the power of the pen
[02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:08.780]  he can do that across the board he could reanimate a whistleblower culture
[02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:12.060]  against the deep state established corruption so it's actually a great tv
[02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:16.460]  show called deep state that was on epics network that's in i think season
[02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:19.260]  two now it's on available on amazon prime and other
[02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:22.860]  places but it goes into exactly this it portrays the template of how power
[02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:26.540]  operates if you you know i used to do a gift to people who wanted to learn
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:29.020]  american political history i said go back and read
[02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:32.220]  james elroy's uh american tabloid trilogy the
[02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:35.340]  is american tabloid it called six thousand bloods at rover
[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:39.260]  about the 1960s but what it really is is the template of how american power
[02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:41.900]  operates just in the same way that alex has often
[02:52:41.900 --> 02:52:45.260]  often referenced operation northwoods it gives you a sense of the mindset the
[02:52:45.260 --> 02:52:47.740]  mentality and part of that mindset mentality has
[02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:51.020]  always been blackmail i was a the lawyer who brought one of the first
[02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:53.980]  the suits against the irs the biggest class action ever
[02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:57.340]  against the the department of treasury or the u.s government and what was
[02:52:57.340 --> 02:53:00.300]  happening is under obama would never nobody put together
[02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:03.100]  was the reason why he was digitizing medical records
[02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:06.140]  is it allowed the irs to know everything about you
[02:53:06.140 --> 02:53:10.060]  not only did they now have your self confession inquisit self inquisition
[02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:13.260]  mechanism of your tax return where you tell them where you live you tell them
[02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:15.900]  who you live with you tell them you tell them who your loved ones are you
[02:53:15.900 --> 02:53:18.780]  tell them where you go to church you that you tell them which party you
[02:53:18.780 --> 02:53:22.460]  support you tell them what the what you're at all of your economic
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:25.900]  activities the reason why they create a lot of those deductions and tax forms
[02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:29.740]  is because it becomes a self confession self inquisition mechanism of the
[02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:33.900]  government having massive data on you then add your private medical records
[02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:36.380]  when i brought that suit they were going after somebody
[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:39.900]  it would they had taken the irs had taken 60 million medical records are more
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:42.620]  than 10 million americans every state judge in the state of
[02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:45.580]  california many of the politicians in california
[02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:48.860]  now that's not even legal screen and it wasn't supposed to be
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:52.140]  screen actors guild directors guild major players
[02:53:52.140 --> 02:53:56.140]  a major league baseball and since it's all digitized and organized it's so
[02:53:56.140 --> 02:53:59.900]  easy to search and find whatever you want absolutely i mean i even tested it
[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:02.780]  and found out all kinds of things about all kinds of people
[02:54:02.780 --> 02:54:06.060]  it was basically hoover's dream blackmail list
[02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:10.220]  so the the if anybody's out there that's effectively continually being blackmailed
[02:54:10.220 --> 02:54:12.860]  you have people like robin gritz who's brought a suit
[02:54:12.860 --> 02:54:15.900]  against the fbi because she exposed andrew mckabe
[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:19.580]  you have these people that have suffered consequence due to the blackmail that
[02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:23.260]  that has taken place that takes place on a daily basis in the political arena
[02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:26.220]  and the president needs to exercise the power of the pardon the power of the
[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:29.980]  pen the power of the presidency to basically bring back and say we're
[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:33.740]  going to give am not amnesty to illegal aliens not amnesty to trespassers
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:36.940]  not amnesty to the cartels not amnesty to the human smugglers
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:40.140]  not amnesty to those who break and enter into the country we're going to give
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:43.740]  amnesty to the whistleblower to the whistleblowers who expose the deep
[02:54:43.740 --> 02:54:47.180]  state corruption and collusion that is taking place that is undermining
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:50.380]  democracy in its most fundamental institutions and exacerbating war and
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:54.060]  conflict around the world perfect example is the nix of them sex cult
[02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:56.700]  which has ties to hillary clinton chuck schumer
[02:54:56.700 --> 02:54:59.740]  a gilla brand who was up there last night like hey you're in one of these sex
[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:03.740]  cults you know because because it came out uh i think it was renary or whoever
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:09.340]  was like no i mean it all came out in in the the i guess the litigation process
[02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:12.220]  i mean they were putting people in office i mean they were literally getting
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:16.460]  people in office they were trying to have hundreds of congressmen and women in
[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:18.380]  office they understood the power of blackmail
[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:21.820]  they understood the power of of either basically bundling money to help
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:25.180]  influence candidates and campaigns and ultimately they were going to be able to
[02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:29.500]  entrap people in a wide range of ways so the these kind of cultish cultures
[02:55:29.500 --> 02:55:32.940]  live off of political protection and the only way they can survive is with
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:36.700]  political protection and that goes all the way back to a wide range of similar
[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:40.140]  comparable cases people forget jim jones had a lot of political protection
[02:55:40.140 --> 02:55:43.260]  initially let's there's a lot of things where you
[02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:45.660]  have to wonder if you want to even put this out to the audience but i'll just
[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:47.820]  go ahead and say it because the enemy already knows it's anyway but
[02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:52.620]  let's just look at julien assange there's a reason why they've removed him from
[02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:55.980]  the embassy and put him in a jail in london now
[02:55:55.980 --> 02:55:59.500]  a lot of americans libertarians are ticked off
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:05.260]  that trump is not you know offering an exoneration or amnesty or whatever to
[02:56:05.260 --> 02:56:08.700]  assange folks you got to understand trump
[02:56:08.700 --> 02:56:11.820]  has to extradite assange here to talk to him
[02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:15.980]  they took him to the jail in london to keep him away from trump
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:19.980]  like that was the whole purpose yeah trump of course is trying to expedite
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:23.020]  julien assange how the hell else is he going to talk to him
[02:56:23.020 --> 02:56:25.980]  that's the whole point assange knows where the bodies are buried
[02:56:25.980 --> 02:56:29.420]  now i don't know if assange would ever tell trump so much hey here's who gave
[02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:31.580]  me this here's who gave me this here's who gave me this
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:35.580]  but if trump can bring him in and say all right look we brought you here
[02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:39.100]  here's the crimes that we have you know espionage would have you but
[02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:42.860]  i want to offer you a deal but you got to work with me
[02:56:42.860 --> 02:56:47.900]  well i think for sure the ideal goal is if uh people hope that is what president
[02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:50.460]  trump intends and then he's just keeping it under wraps
[02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:53.900]  uh he has to though because oh that's how deep this goes i mean that's again
[02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:55.820]  that they took him out of there they put him in jail because they don't want
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:58.380]  trump to talk to him well knowing that they had sweet and all of a sudden
[02:56:58.380 --> 02:57:01.740]  start talking about uh bringing back the allegations and it's important for
[02:57:01.740 --> 02:57:04.940]  people to know the julien assange is not accused of any
[02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:08.300]  rape in a conventional way they're saying whether he used birth control in a
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:11.340]  proper way which is a crazy they were but now they're talking
[02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:14.700]  about reinstating them so the and what that would do is that would
[02:57:14.700 --> 02:57:17.660]  potentially preclude extradition to the united states so that's so again they're
[02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:21.420]  going through multiple layers to try to protect or try to keep assange from
[02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:24.380]  trump because they know look we know who are up against those these are evil
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:27.420]  people they're running sex cults they're running child trafficking rings
[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:30.060]  they're running all of it trump isn't involved with that doesn't mean he's
[02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:32.380]  perfect but that's why they're all going after trump
[02:57:32.380 --> 02:57:35.020]  all right nick baggage is about to take over the alex joneshaw i'm not sure if
[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:37.820]  robert barneson's sticking around but are you alive tomorrow too is that the
[02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:39.580]  plan uh i think we're gonna do some shooting
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:45.020]  awesome info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen share those links
[02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:47.660]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding
[02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:51.500]  hey elix yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:55.020]  a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that
[02:57:55.020 --> 02:57:58.860]  almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:02.780]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[02:58:02.780 --> 02:58:06.700]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[02:58:06.700 --> 02:58:09.980]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[02:58:09.980 --> 02:58:12.620]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:15.500]  it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i
[02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:18.620]  just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the

[03:00:14.620 --> 03:00:20.780]  and welcome back you know uh you know this friday afternoon uh fourth hour i'm
[03:00:20.780 --> 03:00:24.860]  standing in for alex and i'm here in alaska and actually we've got
[03:00:24.860 --> 03:00:28.620]  horse fires in south central alaska and i was just
[03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:34.060]  telling daria during the break there that you know it's like a fog in town
[03:00:34.060 --> 03:00:36.380]  it's like you might be in beijing or somewhere
[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:40.300]  anyway it's kind of standard deal here in alaska you don't hear much about it on
[03:00:40.300 --> 03:00:45.660]  the national news because most of the twilderness no one lived there
[03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:49.740]  but the point is we have them sometimes are pretty dangerous and
[03:00:49.740 --> 03:00:54.140]  you know when you think about uh today it's going to be 82 and
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:57.500]  anchorage today and tomorrow that's like our high for the year
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:01.500]  you know it's a hundred or more in uh austin today
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:07.020]  so you know i was thinking about um all the kind of doom and gloom and the
[03:01:07.020 --> 03:01:11.020]  nonsense um you know the free stuff
[03:01:11.020 --> 03:01:17.500]  debate you know and it reminds me of i'm actually a tactic used here uh
[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:21.340]  during the last governor's race and it was this deal of where the governor said
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:25.340]  hey we're going to give everybody triple their dividend you know or
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.660]  make up for the years we couldn't give you the full amount because he
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:33.020]  what we have here that most americans don't know is we have
[03:01:33.020 --> 03:01:39.820]  uh a government by endowment here's we don't have income tax here
[03:01:39.820 --> 03:01:43.740]  we don't have a state property tax here we don't have a state
[03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:48.300]  income tax what i'm talking about we don't have a state property tax
[03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:53.660]  or a state sales tax uh what we have is a corporate tax you make over i think
[03:01:53.660 --> 03:01:56.780]  it's a quarter of a million net you pay nine percent the first quarter of a
[03:01:56.780 --> 03:02:00.620]  million net in a corporation small corporations exempt
[03:02:00.620 --> 03:02:04.300]  and then we have oil and gas and natural resources which are held
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:07.820]  you know in common and that brings in revenue to the state of Alaska under
[03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:13.180]  lease agreements and other things and we have um what would be called what we
[03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:17.500]  we call it the permanent fund but in international jargon you would call
[03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:21.340]  that a sovereign wealth fund that alaska has
[03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:27.660]  like 60 65 billion maybe close to 70 billion now in that fund
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:31.820]  and our you know that that throws off a pretty good chunk of money every year
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:35.660]  you know in in earnings because it's invested in all kinds of stuff you know
[03:02:35.660 --> 03:02:39.020]  and that came out of our natural resource base out of our balance sheet
[03:02:39.020 --> 03:02:44.220]  and i've talked often on this program about the national well
[03:02:44.220 --> 03:02:48.700]  you know and here's these morons talking about
[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:55.020]  writing off at 1.6 trillion dollars in student loans well admirable idea you
[03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:58.380]  know i mean as far as echoes when we needed the
[03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:03.900]  economic stimulus you know back in 2008 when people were losing their homes and
[03:03:03.900 --> 03:03:07.660]  all this was going on and we were bailing out the banks and
[03:03:07.660 --> 03:03:11.980]  corporations that made bad decisions when we could have
[03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:15.660]  then maybe instead of giving a couple trillion to the bankers
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:19.580]  done that and actually stimulated more spending which might have boosted the
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:23.660]  banks with legitimate money and in the economy by real
[03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:27.580]  consumers who could then buy those houses that were coming on the market and do a
[03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:30.780]  lot of other things instead we you know we spent the
[03:03:30.780 --> 03:03:33.900]  money on others when we have this
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:41.340]  and a demand that's offset by the debt ratios of student debt
[03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:46.300]  against graduating graduates from college you know so even in a tight
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:49.900]  market we've seen you know kind of what's
[03:03:49.900 --> 03:03:53.340]  happened and well i admired trump for all kinds of
[03:03:53.340 --> 03:03:57.020]  stuff that he's done the one thing that people kind of forget
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:04:00.700]  in this mix is business benefited greatly
[03:04:00.700 --> 03:04:04.220]  and they need to make sure that money is now spending america
[03:04:04.220 --> 03:04:07.740]  on americans doing doing things that make america
[03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:11.980]  great again and not exporting that money but repatriating you know they're
[03:04:11.980 --> 03:04:16.460]  taxing international income uh from these multinational
[03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:19.980]  corporations that are domiciled in the u.s. they're doing a lot of things
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:24.700]  differently but they also lowered domestic taxes by a substantial amount
[03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:27.660]  for corporations and i think that's a good idea
[03:04:27.660 --> 03:04:31.500]  in the long run um but we need to see that translate into things that
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:35.980]  benefit also people working in america so you know
[03:04:35.980 --> 03:04:40.700]  i mean really uh it's about sovereign wealth though i want to get into that
[03:04:40.700 --> 03:04:44.620]  and the looting of the nation and what's going on behind the scenes as
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:48.140]  the fake news propaganda stream from the mainstream
[03:04:48.140 --> 03:04:53.020]  continues to feed us fertilizer that most of us just call bs we'll be right
[03:04:53.020 --> 03:04:56.940]  back with info wars in the 40 years that i've been in american politics
[03:04:56.940 --> 03:05:00.380]  i've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which
[03:05:00.380 --> 03:05:04.060]  facts and truth and evidence no longer matters
[03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:07.980]  the false claim that you purposely said kitty form
[03:05:07.980 --> 03:05:12.460]  to the sandy hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as
[03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:16.380]  false it's a smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted
[03:05:16.380 --> 03:05:20.780]  you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million
[03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:24.780]  documents and then it's blamed on you this is kafka esk
[03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:28.780]  this is bizarre but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say
[03:05:28.780 --> 03:05:33.260]  jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous i have a lot of respect for
[03:05:33.260 --> 03:05:37.020]  those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected
[03:05:37.020 --> 03:05:40.540]  and clarified but i wonder where the big boys where's the wall street journal
[03:05:40.540 --> 03:05:44.540]  where's associated press when are they going to report that they made a
[03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:49.180]  mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your help
[03:05:49.180 --> 03:06:01.980]  and i urge folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars
[03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:08.780]  the alex jones show because there is a war on
[03:06:08.780 --> 03:06:17.980]  for your mind with nick baggage
[03:06:17.980 --> 03:06:21.820]  and welcome back and i'm coming to you from
[03:06:21.820 --> 03:06:29.820]  anchorage alaska today and you know as we went out of the last segment i'm
[03:06:29.820 --> 03:06:34.780]  thinking about a sovereign wealth and i was mentioning the alaska permanent
[03:06:34.780 --> 03:06:38.940]  fund and how that fund got formed it was republican governor
[03:06:38.940 --> 03:06:45.340]  jay hamid back in the uh 70s uh and into the 80s
[03:06:45.340 --> 03:06:50.540]  he uh just brought it to the uh legislature and subsequently to the
[03:06:50.540 --> 03:06:55.500]  alaskan people this idea of taking 25 percent of all of our revenue from
[03:06:55.500 --> 03:07:00.860]  non-renewable resources oil and gas and minerals and so on and
[03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:04.140]  put it in a permanent fund and there's jay for those that can see him and he
[03:07:04.140 --> 03:07:07.580]  was a great governor and it was a visionary thing and what he did
[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:12.220]  is this money then would be invested for the future when these resources ran out
[03:07:12.220 --> 03:07:15.740]  you know so we would have a sovereign wealth fund you know literally a
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:18.940]  permanent fund and what he did to enfranchise
[03:07:18.940 --> 03:07:24.460]  alaskan citizens we became shareholders in that fund so
[03:07:24.460 --> 03:07:28.940]  it's invested in all kinds of things all around the world and what happens is
[03:07:28.940 --> 03:07:35.420]  um that's uh fund then takes its average earnings over five years
[03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:40.220]  and it moves forward every year and is recalculated and half of that earnings
[03:07:40.220 --> 03:07:43.660]  is then distributed half of the average for the year
[03:07:43.660 --> 03:07:49.260]  over a five-year average is distributed to uh the population in alaska and as i
[03:07:49.260 --> 03:07:53.340]  said we don't have a state income tax state sales tax or state property tax
[03:07:53.340 --> 03:07:58.140]  tax pretty low here in terms of any of them but we have minerals taxation oil and
[03:07:58.140 --> 03:08:02.060]  wealth royalties off state lands and things that bring wealth into the state
[03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:07.340]  and that's how this fund got formed so like last year it was like $1,600 for
[03:08:07.340 --> 03:08:10.940]  each person that lives here now it's expensive to live here so you know i mean
[03:08:10.940 --> 03:08:15.500]  you got to realize that too but without those uh state taxes that's kind of
[03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:18.220]  nice we have local taxes property taxes and
[03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:23.500]  acreage for instance um but you know when you think about uh
[03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:30.780]  this uh the nation and the wealth of the nation that has been looted
[03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:36.540]  literally for a couple of centuries and even before you know because like in my
[03:08:36.540 --> 03:08:41.420]  region alaska the looting started with the russians who were here first
[03:08:41.420 --> 03:08:45.980]  they kind of uh enslaved everybody who lived on the
[03:08:45.980 --> 03:08:49.020]  elution islands all the native peoples there and anyone they could
[03:08:49.020 --> 03:08:52.380]  conquer on the coastline they never made a far inland but
[03:08:52.380 --> 03:08:55.500]  that you know wherever they could they did and they enslaved them into the fur
[03:08:55.500 --> 03:09:00.060]  trade where they had to then you know and basically they wiped out some species
[03:09:00.060 --> 03:09:04.380]  entirely uh and then others were almost brought to the
[03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:08.700]  brink of extinction and have come back but the point of the matter is
[03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:13.980]  once the fur seals ran out they see much margin here and they saw the
[03:09:13.980 --> 03:09:17.740]  united states kind of move in west and figure we take it anyway or someone
[03:09:17.740 --> 03:09:22.060]  would so they sold it to us for two cents an acre two cents
[03:09:22.060 --> 03:09:27.180]  uh in the treaty of secession in 1867 the russian ceded this to us
[03:09:27.180 --> 03:09:31.420]  under the czar and you know what what happened here is we then
[03:09:31.420 --> 03:09:36.060]  uh discovered uh gold here in the 1890s and uh
[03:09:36.060 --> 03:09:40.380]  the rush was on and that lasted until war war two
[03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:44.300]  where our gold industry was shut down completely most people don't realize
[03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:48.300]  what happened here gold silver non-essential minerals
[03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:52.540]  all the resources stopped for the war effort and gold was fixed at 35 bucks
[03:09:52.540 --> 03:09:57.580]  an ounce by then and uh what happened after the war is inflation
[03:09:57.580 --> 03:10:01.820]  tripled everything but gold was fixed so you know the gold industry never revised
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:05.340]  here because it choked off and died you know for
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:09.100]  four years uh during the war so you know when you
[03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:12.140]  look at uh the mineral wealth in this part of the
[03:10:12.140 --> 03:10:15.100]  world never got developed we don't have a railroad here
[03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:18.780]  and i've talked in the past about the jones act which is an act
[03:10:18.780 --> 03:10:22.540]  um that benefits shipbuilders in the united states and i understand to keep a
[03:10:22.540 --> 03:10:25.900]  vibrant shipbuilding industry for defense and other purposes
[03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:29.900]  we subsidize and the way we do in the united states is we make sure that
[03:10:29.900 --> 03:10:35.820]  any shipment between u.s ports has to be flagged by a u.s vessel
[03:10:35.820 --> 03:10:40.220]  which costs 10 times as much as a foreign flag vessel
[03:10:40.220 --> 03:10:44.460]  which is why all of the raw minerals produced in alaska
[03:10:44.460 --> 03:10:49.260]  are never going to land in the united states in terms of the lower 48 states
[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:54.620]  uh because there's no linkage by rail or otherwise now today in the paper i'm
[03:10:54.620 --> 03:10:58.460]  really encouraged uh and we talked about a foreign on this
[03:10:58.460 --> 03:11:01.980]  program for years is a rail link to canada which
[03:11:01.980 --> 03:11:07.020]  within allows us to move commodities um overland and this is now
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:10.860]  being studied in a very serious way perhaps it will happen this time
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:16.460]  this is vital uh to moving the national treasury the wealth of the nation
[03:11:16.460 --> 03:11:20.860]  into the rust belt where value added can happen because alaska doesn't have the
[03:11:20.860 --> 03:11:24.380]  population for that value added but it would be nice to have it
[03:11:24.380 --> 03:11:30.940]  whoops happen in the united states uh and and we have that possibility
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:35.660]  and and we're ignoring the possibility of a sovereign wealth fund now norway
[03:11:35.660 --> 03:11:39.180]  has a sovereign wealth fund and they put all their oil money in there and then
[03:11:39.180 --> 03:11:44.380]  they allocate it in their uh social security system but you know what they
[03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:47.420]  built from their oil revenue their natural resource
[03:11:47.420 --> 03:11:51.740]  revenue in norway they built a trillion with a
[03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:57.820]  t a trillion dollar fund instead of running deficits you know norway
[03:11:57.820 --> 03:12:02.220]  kind of runs a surplus you know based on that national wealth
[03:12:02.220 --> 03:12:08.940]  that they uh didn't let industry just loot you know what they did is they
[03:12:08.940 --> 03:12:16.380]  contracted to industry to extract those resources and they competed for those
[03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:20.380]  contracts which makes good sense right this public resource
[03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:23.660]  you know the oil and gas well in the united states we're gonna do that
[03:12:23.660 --> 03:12:27.500]  we had these fire sales and tax incentives and all this crap
[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:31.980]  built into the tax code and it is it's too complicated to get into in this
[03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:36.540]  segment maybe another time another place but the whole
[03:12:36.540 --> 03:12:41.020]  charade started with the income tax back
[03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:45.660]  in 1913 okay this goes back you know flocks back
[03:12:45.660 --> 03:12:48.860]  and how the mineral oil and gas industries were spared
[03:12:48.860 --> 03:12:52.140]  the biggest burden of taxation even to this day those codes
[03:12:52.140 --> 03:12:58.380]  exist but the point i'm making today is because of interest groups
[03:12:58.380 --> 03:13:03.100]  america and americans have been screwed over
[03:13:03.100 --> 03:13:07.900]  and it pisses me off from the standpoint of everybody
[03:13:07.900 --> 03:13:11.900]  is screaming poverty including in this state of alaska
[03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:17.020]  the richest state per capita in the nation and they're whacking the budget
[03:13:17.020 --> 03:13:21.580]  and worrying about the sky is falling and you know
[03:13:21.580 --> 03:13:26.220]  it's moronic and ignorant and uninformed leadership
[03:13:26.220 --> 03:13:32.380]  that approaches this state in this way because within the
[03:13:32.380 --> 03:13:37.980]  purview of national resources and state resources in terms of land
[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:42.220]  and what's under the land and native resources under the land for that matter
[03:13:42.220 --> 03:13:47.020]  nine percent of the state is native owned here based on their legislation by my
[03:13:47.020 --> 03:13:50.300]  father back in the 70s native land claim settlement act
[03:13:50.300 --> 03:13:53.260]  and they own their mineral estate and oil and gas estates
[03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:56.540]  and then we had the mental health trust which has about three quarters of a
[03:13:56.540 --> 03:14:00.060]  million acres and it is a trust and it generates
[03:14:00.060 --> 03:14:02.860]  something but it's pretty inefficient if you ask me but
[03:14:02.860 --> 03:14:07.340]  the point of the matter is the state then has like a hundred
[03:14:07.340 --> 03:14:13.260]  title or intended title about 105 million acres and you know and then
[03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:17.260]  which is about 18 19 percent and the rest 70 percent is federal government
[03:14:17.260 --> 03:14:20.780]  one percent is the rest of private parties but
[03:14:20.780 --> 03:14:25.260]  70 percent is the national government which is you and me and under that
[03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:29.340]  including that doesn't include the 200 mile
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:32.860]  coastal limit out on the continental shelf which is an oil base
[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:36.700]  the whole northern part of the state of alaska and has trillions
[03:14:36.700 --> 03:14:41.580]  and trillions and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and perhaps
[03:14:41.580 --> 03:14:45.180]  a hundred billion barrels of oil or more maybe more i don't know
[03:14:45.180 --> 03:14:48.300]  it's going to be crazy when the full tally comes out but
[03:14:48.300 --> 03:14:52.300]  already five trillion dollars has been taken out of there looted
[03:14:52.300 --> 03:14:55.420]  from my perspective by multinational corporations
[03:14:55.420 --> 03:15:00.700]  and the state thrown a pittance and the feds thrown a pittance for this
[03:15:00.700 --> 03:15:08.380]  you know these are national resources uh we have to shift them overseas
[03:15:08.380 --> 03:15:12.380]  because it's cheaper to do it yeah they're double hole tankers now and
[03:15:12.380 --> 03:15:16.860]  they're made somewhere else but here's the equation the jones act
[03:15:16.860 --> 03:15:23.100]  bringing a ship in from china uh to la is about
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:28.540]  eight 900 bucks to bring the same ship halfway back to hawaii from la is
[03:15:28.540 --> 03:15:33.340]  eight thousand and more there's your jones act
[03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:37.340]  and that's what it costs us it costs us a lot to support the shipping industry
[03:15:37.340 --> 03:15:42.060]  at the expense of raw materials getting that value added from alaska
[03:15:42.060 --> 03:15:44.940]  for the wealth of the nation we're going to be right back after these three

[03:17:56.700 --> 03:18:00.700]  hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot
[03:18:00.700 --> 03:18:03.980]  of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that
[03:18:03.980 --> 03:18:07.820]  almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[03:18:07.820 --> 03:18:11.740]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:18:11.740 --> 03:18:14.940]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[03:18:14.940 --> 03:18:17.740]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll
[03:18:17.740 --> 03:18:20.380]  be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be defeated
[03:18:20.380 --> 03:18:23.020]  other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend
[03:18:23.020 --> 03:18:25.980]  i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're

[03:20:17.740 --> 03:20:25.820]  host nick baggage
[03:20:26.060 --> 03:20:32.380]  and welcome back i appreciate being here today you know uh thinking about uh
[03:20:32.380 --> 03:20:37.660]  this whole uh a topic again sovereign wealth what does that really mean you
[03:20:37.660 --> 03:20:42.860]  know when we hear discussions um about our budget on the national level our
[03:20:42.860 --> 03:20:45.740]  national budget we're always listening to this
[03:20:45.740 --> 03:20:49.740]  uh discussion about taxes and who's paying and how much is coming in and how
[03:20:49.740 --> 03:20:52.460]  much is going on and what we're spending it on and we all
[03:20:52.460 --> 03:20:56.300]  complain about how much they take from us and how little we get back in what they
[03:20:56.300 --> 03:21:01.180]  just how they redistribute our wealth you know and and and the thing about the
[03:21:01.180 --> 03:21:05.420]  debates the last couple of nights was you know it's more of the same you know how
[03:21:05.420 --> 03:21:08.540]  to get down dig down deeper and take a little more
[03:21:08.540 --> 03:21:15.020]  but the point um is the the big theft is on the balance sheet you know the
[03:21:15.020 --> 03:21:18.460]  things that matter you know your assets that produce revenue
[03:21:18.460 --> 03:21:22.060]  you know or avoid costs like when your house is paid off you don't have a house
[03:21:22.060 --> 03:21:25.660]  payment anymore many a property tax insurance maintenance but you know what
[03:21:25.660 --> 03:21:29.820]  i'm saying so when you have assets real assets maybe
[03:21:29.820 --> 03:21:32.860]  apartment buildings they throw off some rents when they're paid off you know
[03:21:32.860 --> 03:21:37.420]  but think about real stuff producing real revenues and natural resources
[03:21:37.420 --> 03:21:43.260]  are the very base of the balance sheet of a nation when you think about land
[03:21:43.260 --> 03:21:48.780]  and natural resources and so we auction them off at a giveaway price under all
[03:21:48.780 --> 03:21:53.100]  kinds of different terms and conditions when what we should be doing
[03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:56.940]  on at least oil and gas is pretty predictable now the science is really
[03:21:56.940 --> 03:22:00.140]  good there's not really wild catting as such
[03:22:00.140 --> 03:22:05.260]  pretty predictable um but if we captured the national oil and
[03:22:05.260 --> 03:22:08.940]  gas and then contracted the work so all those jobs are there
[03:22:08.940 --> 03:22:12.380]  all those jobs are privately sector managed
[03:22:12.380 --> 03:22:17.100]  you know like they should be not some other way of doing it you know but keep
[03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:20.700]  those managed you know like corporations manage but
[03:22:20.700 --> 03:22:24.540]  bid it and keep the natural resource instead of
[03:22:24.540 --> 03:22:30.220]  leasing it and giving it away and you know what you end up with
[03:22:30.220 --> 03:22:34.940]  is a tremendous amount of throw off i mean look at Saudi Arabia
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:38.780]  Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is several trillion dollars
[03:22:38.780 --> 03:22:43.820]  generating significant revenue that's non oil and gas related revenue you
[03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:48.380]  know when you start to think about sort of what are we doing with the wealth
[03:22:48.380 --> 03:22:52.620]  of this nation who's benefiting by it now there are some ways that we used to
[03:22:52.620 --> 03:22:56.220]  as individual citizens benefit by the national wealth we used to be able to
[03:22:56.220 --> 03:22:59.660]  go out and we still can in some areas of Alaska
[03:22:59.660 --> 03:23:04.460]  for instance go out and discover and say valuable mining claims and you used to
[03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:08.780]  be able under the federal rules go to patent now the laws are still on the
[03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:13.020]  books but they haven't funded that in years it's one of the
[03:23:13.020 --> 03:23:16.700]  way they strip out the effect of the law so you oh no we didn't do anything
[03:23:16.700 --> 03:23:19.980]  change law we just didn't give it any funding
[03:23:19.980 --> 03:23:23.820]  i can't implement the law and that's what they did with patenting of mining
[03:23:23.820 --> 03:23:26.940]  claims at the federal level the reason they did is it was really
[03:23:26.940 --> 03:23:32.460]  such a bargain to own the titles with very little wealth
[03:23:32.460 --> 03:23:36.620]  transferring back to the nation you know because these rules haven't been changed
[03:23:36.620 --> 03:23:40.540]  some of them in a hundred years or more now over a hundred years
[03:23:40.540 --> 03:23:44.380]  so when we look at all of this in terms of the
[03:23:44.380 --> 03:23:50.860]  real wealth of the nation isn't being misspent in terms of the national
[03:23:50.860 --> 03:23:55.340]  budget it's being looted on the other end by
[03:23:55.340 --> 03:23:58.300]  globalists and multinational corporations
[03:23:58.300 --> 03:24:02.780]  they keep the shell game going so well we're all looking over here at the
[03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:08.780]  budget and all these other aspects of the news the fake news
[03:24:08.780 --> 03:24:12.940]  the unnews you know we're about the info wars we're the unnews maybe you know
[03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:16.140]  we're kind of unravel the news on the other side
[03:24:16.140 --> 03:24:22.780]  of the equation is uh the looting trillions of dollars out the gate no
[03:24:22.780 --> 03:24:26.460]  one's even seeing it go you know they're not even running the numbers
[03:24:26.460 --> 03:24:29.580]  they're just going ah say la vie you know oh you're going to leave we better
[03:24:29.580 --> 03:24:33.660]  give you some tax incentives you might go to the third world screw them over for
[03:24:33.660 --> 03:24:37.660]  a while till they throw you out see and this is what happened with oil and
[03:24:37.660 --> 03:24:40.860]  gas everywhere in the world the multinationals were thrown out
[03:24:40.860 --> 03:24:43.980]  the other 88 percent of oil producing countries
[03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:48.620]  actually just bid the work to keep the oil and the gas
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:52.700]  much better equation you know some of me that on the downstream you know the
[03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:57.580]  value added like uh Saudi you know they they own the refining and the
[03:24:57.580 --> 03:25:02.540]  pipelines and the ships you know and that gas
[03:25:02.540 --> 03:25:05.740]  takes you know they're kind of integrated across the
[03:25:05.740 --> 03:25:10.700]  deal and optimize their profit margins for their sovereign wealth but
[03:25:10.700 --> 03:25:16.860]  you know they're a kingdom you know for gosh sakes you know but they throw up
[03:25:16.860 --> 03:25:19.260]  so much money their people don't work for 11
[03:25:19.260 --> 03:25:23.020]  they go to college anywhere they want in the world and import everybody else to
[03:25:23.020 --> 03:25:26.940]  do the rest of the work you know uh you know think about
[03:25:26.940 --> 03:25:31.180]  the wealth of a nation under a democratic republic like ours
[03:25:31.180 --> 03:25:37.340]  and wow what used to happen in a brown paper bag that we called bribery
[03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:42.780]  the same thing happens today only we call it a campaign contributions we have
[03:25:42.780 --> 03:25:46.140]  committees and regulations and rules about who
[03:25:46.140 --> 03:25:50.300]  who can bring the bag of money to the party you know
[03:25:50.300 --> 03:25:55.100]  and that's really all that's changed you know but we we somehow have legitimized
[03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:58.780]  bribery and corruption by giving it a new name
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:02.780]  isn't that the most ridiculous yeah I say all raise their hands
[03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:08.060]  hallelujah to the democratic republic on two bit nights of debate
[03:26:08.060 --> 03:26:14.060]  give me a break you morons the the republic is being hijacked every day
[03:26:14.060 --> 03:26:21.740]  and in a million different ways and looted by the
[03:26:21.740 --> 03:26:29.180]  you know looted literally every day the national purses
[03:26:29.180 --> 03:26:33.980]  picked and our taxes didn't go down you know
[03:26:33.980 --> 03:26:37.340]  hey but but what i want to say on the positive note
[03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:40.460]  you know because we all know about all that you know we get angry about it we
[03:26:40.460 --> 03:26:42.700]  get mad about it but we can't get mad about it
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:46.300]  yeah we have to take on a different tactic we have to recapture
[03:26:46.300 --> 03:26:49.980]  the nation so that we don't let it bleed
[03:26:49.980 --> 03:26:55.100]  anymore in the way that it has and really bring these multinationals to
[03:26:55.100 --> 03:26:58.140]  account for what they've done here
[03:26:58.140 --> 03:27:01.820]  you know it's not about you know you and me
[03:27:01.820 --> 03:27:07.980]  anymore it's about them really they've taken over the
[03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:13.100]  reins of government by controlling it to such a great degree the apparatus
[03:27:13.100 --> 03:27:18.140]  of government and communications in the 21st century has been handed off to
[03:27:18.140 --> 03:27:22.140]  these nazi leftists can you believe it i mean
[03:27:22.140 --> 03:27:25.740]  i never thought i could combine the two you know
[03:27:25.740 --> 03:27:29.020]  you know it's like they're doing the same thing
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:33.500]  that they oppose so bitterly you know shutting down speech shutting down
[03:27:33.500 --> 03:27:37.660]  um some sense of uh an equality in the world
[03:27:37.660 --> 03:27:41.500]  for a major segment of this population in america you know
[03:27:41.500 --> 03:27:45.500]  like the majority of americans and perhaps maybe
[03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:49.180]  a lot of people in the world but you know like every
[03:27:49.180 --> 03:27:52.620]  station and every network uh they're not perfect neither
[03:27:52.620 --> 03:27:55.740]  is this one but at least we don't work from a script
[03:27:55.740 --> 03:27:59.820]  you know we work based on good research and taking sort of an alternative view
[03:27:59.820 --> 03:28:02.700]  of the world and then trying to put that into plain language
[03:28:02.700 --> 03:28:06.940]  so we might address it within the context of a democratic republic within
[03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:12.220]  the 21st century instead what we have is 1984
[03:28:12.220 --> 03:28:17.900]  on steroids ladies and gentlemen you know i mean
[03:28:17.900 --> 03:28:27.100]  this uh is is like the worst nightmare of sci-fi writers
[03:28:27.100 --> 03:28:34.940]  playing out in this century by these little men
[03:28:34.940 --> 03:28:40.460]  who are running these corporations and they are they do not recognize the
[03:28:40.460 --> 03:28:44.140]  courage that it requires to maintain pre-speech in a
[03:28:44.140 --> 03:28:47.020]  democratic republic they don't have the balls

[03:32:01.580 --> 03:32:06.140]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting
[03:32:06.140 --> 03:32:11.340]  together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of
[03:32:11.340 --> 03:32:16.780]  this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[03:32:16.780 --> 03:32:22.060]  self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure that because the
[03:32:22.060 --> 03:32:26.460]  audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately
[03:32:26.460 --> 03:32:30.620]  reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends
[03:32:30.620 --> 03:32:34.860]  there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like
[03:32:34.860 --> 03:32:39.260]  and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[03:32:39.260 --> 03:32:44.620]  and at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they
[03:32:44.620 --> 03:32:49.180]  want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression
[03:32:49.180 --> 03:32:53.420]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[03:32:57.020 --> 03:32:59.660]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:59.660 --> 03:33:22.860]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:22.860 --> 03:33:34.700]  and welcome back this is uh dr nick baggage on this friday uh morning still my time in uh afternoon
[03:33:34.700 --> 03:33:40.940]  and most of the rest of the country you know um we've been talking about swapping wealth and the
[03:33:40.940 --> 03:33:46.220]  wealth of nations and the looting of the country really by global small nationals i mean a whole
[03:33:46.220 --> 03:33:53.260]  lot of interests have literally conspired by cooperation and uh you know kind of the joint
[03:33:53.260 --> 03:33:59.180]  agenda of take which can and leave nothing behind and now what they've done too is they've exported
[03:33:59.180 --> 03:34:05.020]  most of the factory's plants dismantling them moving them overseas uh what they're bringing back
[03:34:05.020 --> 03:34:09.900]  here to the united states now is robotics you know and and robotics will create a lot during
[03:34:09.900 --> 03:34:16.540]  the construction phase but then there's not a lot of jobs left behind there but the the real well
[03:34:16.540 --> 03:34:21.260]  you know in addition to those factories coming back what you know what then becomes relevant
[03:34:21.260 --> 03:34:30.780]  it's raw materials right value added which is labor at some level um and and also uh transportation
[03:34:30.780 --> 03:34:38.300]  and energy and the us is like exporting energy again you know and when you think about again
[03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:43.100]  the wealth of the nation and should we give it away in lease sales or should we begin
[03:34:44.060 --> 03:34:50.380]  transforming that into a different approach an approach where we contract out the services of
[03:34:50.380 --> 03:34:57.660]  exploration and subsequent drilling and then construction contracted out the same way industry
[03:34:57.660 --> 03:35:03.660]  does and you know and the thing is most countries do this with their oil and gas now i'm not talking
[03:35:03.660 --> 03:35:08.220]  about those that are grandfathered in because they own the oil and gas rights privately in the country
[03:35:08.220 --> 03:35:15.100]  there's a lot of that but in the west uh most of the west that's not the case most of the west
[03:35:15.100 --> 03:35:22.380]  the rights um were uh withheld retained by the government never went with the land and there's
[03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:29.020]  exceptions in alaska and 12th west in various places but most of it remains um public land
[03:35:29.020 --> 03:35:36.860]  with with those rights inclusive and so when you think about um the public wealth now in the 21st
[03:35:36.860 --> 03:35:42.460]  century how do we leverage that wealth in the 21st century that's never going to be replaced once
[03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:49.340]  it's gone um you know depending on what we're doing we need to rethink that and look back at the tax
[03:35:49.340 --> 03:35:56.540]  code and get rid of things like depletion allows and depreciate which is a really false uh kind
[03:35:56.540 --> 03:36:03.340]  of accounting tactic used uh to reduce the tax liability to about half of the normal corporate
[03:36:03.340 --> 03:36:09.340]  rate when you factor in depletion allowances for minerals oil and gas industry and what that means
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:15.260]  is that public resources public owned lands are being applying this tax code when the the owners
[03:36:15.260 --> 03:36:22.300]  are really you and me not the private companies as is the case with other uh depletable or depreciable
[03:36:22.300 --> 03:36:27.660]  assets think about in that same vein so these codes haven't been changed since the tax codes were
[03:36:27.660 --> 03:36:34.380]  invented in uh 1913 because of mineral oil and gas industry powerful lobby then and is remaining
[03:36:34.380 --> 03:36:41.020]  for over 100 years that powerful so with the tax reductions to 20 corporate rates for these
[03:36:41.020 --> 03:36:47.580]  organizations expected rate is half of that and they're taking public resources out of the bargain
[03:36:47.580 --> 03:36:53.980]  basement price this is all upside down we ought to give them fair profit margin on their construction
[03:36:54.620 --> 03:37:00.540]  and all of that work for americans is great to see that work happen but the resource the underlying
[03:37:00.540 --> 03:37:07.500]  wealth is being taken primarily by multinationals you know in alaska the north slope was about half
[03:37:08.140 --> 03:37:14.220]  at one point british petroleum you know and british petroleum up until the 80s you know for
[03:37:14.220 --> 03:37:19.420]  the first number years of peak production oil two million barrels a day coming out in those days
[03:37:19.980 --> 03:37:26.540]  the crowns still own 25 percent of british petroleum till they divested in the 80s but the
[03:37:26.540 --> 03:37:33.900]  point is we were still a colony for god's sake you know i mean come on think about it we're still
[03:37:33.900 --> 03:37:42.700]  paying the crown up into the 1980s on money made by their multinational hold in these corporations
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:49.340]  isn't i mean it's kind of ridiculous isn't it i mean stop and think about this it's just a shell
[03:37:49.340 --> 03:37:56.140]  game you know in terms of how we create new words new ideas new syntax to throw into the mirage that
[03:37:56.140 --> 03:38:01.420]  we're living in and call it reality and you know that's uh my friend ashrop i want to tell you
[03:38:01.420 --> 03:38:07.980]  about ashrop ash is uh good guys in his 80s and he was talking to me he says it's like the coliseum
[03:38:07.980 --> 03:38:12.860]  you know and we're the last act and i and it's true and ashrop he comes from a really interesting
[03:38:12.860 --> 03:38:19.820]  background he was raised by his grandparents in egypt in the 1950s and in egypt in 90s it's
[03:38:19.820 --> 03:38:24.140]  quite different place and he was his grandfather who happened to be the prime minister at the time
[03:38:24.140 --> 03:38:30.220]  so he was kind of a privileged position to see egypt in the 1950s and you know he lives in
[03:38:30.220 --> 03:38:38.140]  united states has you know since the 70s 60s i think anyway a long time home college on you know and
[03:38:38.140 --> 03:38:44.460]  he had a career here and did this thing here and the changes when he went back after so many years
[03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:50.940]  you know it's not just the culture moving to europe but the culture that resides there now is not
[03:38:50.940 --> 03:38:59.980]  the culture in the late 60s early 70s not at all it's unfortunate he sat i mean grief
[03:38:59.980 --> 03:39:05.500]  streak and i would say more not so in what's happened to egypt in the middle east in general
[03:39:05.500 --> 03:39:10.940]  you know he says don't go there nick don't go there it's not safe it's not what it was you
[03:39:10.940 --> 03:39:16.780]  know and that's a sad thing you know you think if we spoke of our nation in that manner if it were
[03:39:16.780 --> 03:39:22.620]  so changed my friends uh my business partner in germany left germany he didn't now live somewhere
[03:39:22.620 --> 03:39:32.380]  else in the world in thailand because germany became so hostile uh to him in terms of both
[03:39:32.380 --> 03:39:37.580]  taxes and culture it just changed dramatically and you know my time traveling back and forth
[03:39:37.580 --> 03:39:44.780]  the last 25 years in and out of europe i can tell you it's a dramatic change throughout most of
[03:39:44.780 --> 03:39:50.220]  europe because of what they've done and in the last segments you know there was comments on that
[03:39:50.220 --> 03:39:59.020]  of what's happening there the globalist agenda is to acquire the wealth of nations this is the agenda
[03:40:00.380 --> 03:40:05.340]  everything else according to a symptomatic of that agenda with this pharmaceutical industry
[03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:13.180]  the military industrial complex the academic complex you know it's it's really about
[03:40:13.180 --> 03:40:19.660]  it's not just screwing the guys jumping over the wall it's screwing everybody in just different
[03:40:19.660 --> 03:40:26.380]  ways you know why is 10 of mexico's adult population trying to run away to america
[03:40:27.340 --> 03:40:31.180]  because their government's corrupt and every time they try to have a revolution you know we
[03:40:31.180 --> 03:40:36.300]  prop them up you could tamely try to have one and clean administration propped up the government
[03:40:36.300 --> 03:40:42.460]  they're the most corrupt government you know anywhere near us and it's on our border that
[03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:46.060]  has been the problem now they elected new leadership there let's see what happens you know
[03:40:47.180 --> 03:40:51.340]  but maybe they change and maybe they don't but you know it's they're a sovereign nation you know
[03:40:51.340 --> 03:40:58.220]  they need to be accountable to their people just like everybody else or have a revolution for god's
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:41:03.740]  sake that's what we did and it worked out pretty well a couple hundred years ago you know i think
[03:41:03.740 --> 03:41:09.180]  everybody would agree sometimes you need a revolution and we had one you know and now we
[03:41:09.180 --> 03:41:15.260]  need a revolution of spirit and mind and heart in this country not a violent revolution you know
[03:41:15.260 --> 03:41:22.140]  the stuff the left is trying to whip up by dividing us under some tribalistic nonsense and rhetoric
[03:41:22.140 --> 03:41:30.060]  and you picked all that out of the last two days of rhetoric you know from these guys inflaming
[03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:36.540]  the tribalism of the nation and the world let's divide everybody and hack them up into little
[03:41:36.540 --> 03:41:45.260]  subsections of what this great nation is about what a bunch of nonsense all they do is amplify
[03:41:45.260 --> 03:41:52.780]  the division that is not what this nation needs that is not that is the diversion you know the
[03:41:52.780 --> 03:41:58.220]  left is diverting us in one direction and aspects of the right you know and i voted donald trump
[03:41:58.220 --> 03:42:03.340]  sort of my oldest son nicholas you know much this is great the rest of my family you know but i'm
[03:42:03.340 --> 03:42:09.420]  disappointed in one thing because on the right it's about abortion and the border and other things
[03:42:09.420 --> 03:42:18.460]  and they're all important but the big enchilada the national wealth as expressed in the p&l statement
[03:42:18.460 --> 03:42:26.540]  and the taxes given away to corporations to see we stimulate some mirror and you know the crumbs
[03:42:26.540 --> 03:42:31.340]  thrown to the rest so let's remember you know those corporate chains were permanent ours are
[03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:39.260]  temporary you know let's decorate the mahogany with the truth uh what's the long-term program
[03:42:39.260 --> 03:42:45.180]  and are we part of that program coming back next i want to talk about uh the programming of the
[03:42:45.180 --> 03:42:49.660]  nation for the globalist and what that means we'll be right back this is dr nick vegich in the info
[03:42:49.660 --> 03:42:57.660]  wars it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other
[03:42:57.660 --> 03:43:03.180]  thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[03:43:03.180 --> 03:43:07.500]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[03:43:07.500 --> 03:43:11.820]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[03:43:11.820 --> 03:43:17.420]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[03:43:17.420 --> 03:43:21.660]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[03:43:21.660 --> 03:43:26.540]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[03:43:26.540 --> 03:43:31.100]  wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporation
[03:43:31.100 --> 03:43:35.820]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[03:43:35.820 --> 03:43:40.940]  persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the uh
[03:43:40.940 --> 03:43:45.580]  that they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and
[03:43:45.580 --> 03:43:50.220]  freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation
[03:43:50.220 --> 03:43:56.140]  lawfare and liable targeting you well we're very very clear with everybody about all of this we're
[03:43:56.140 --> 03:44:00.620]  going into the season of war and they had been inches from shutting down the final mega counts
[03:44:00.620 --> 03:44:05.260]  we have do their criminal activity and their and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've
[03:44:05.260 --> 03:44:10.620]  got capital to go six months a year we need to end here we need to be provisioned and you've got my
[03:44:10.620 --> 03:44:15.020]  total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm loving
[03:44:15.020 --> 03:44:19.980]  every minute of this because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically
[03:44:19.980 --> 03:44:24.460]  i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies that just rings more
[03:44:24.460 --> 03:44:29.900]  people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and i need war bonds i need gas i need ammo
[03:44:29.900 --> 03:44:34.380]  politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product
[03:44:34.380 --> 03:44:38.540]  purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together
[03:44:38.540 --> 03:44:42.220]  i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[03:44:42.220 --> 03:44:46.140]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and i will
[03:44:46.140 --> 03:44:50.700]  never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding of
[03:44:50.700 --> 03:44:57.660]  what we're facing and that we were right about this info wars and free speech and your right to
[03:44:57.660 --> 03:45:03.260]  speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's
[03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:09.820]  biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane and i keep trying to judge engage when is the right time
[03:45:09.820 --> 03:45:16.700]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've
[03:45:16.700 --> 03:45:20.860]  begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you
[03:45:20.860 --> 03:45:26.060]  don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down
[03:45:26.060 --> 03:45:31.100]  not just cripple and so we've reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever
[03:45:31.100 --> 03:45:35.740]  we have was stood so many of their attacks we've gone through so much because of your support
[03:45:35.740 --> 03:45:40.460]  you have you have been there but let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful
[03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:45.100]  and they're giving us their full assault so we need your prayers your financial support and your
[03:45:45.100 --> 03:45:51.100]  word of mouth now at info wars.com it's your fight decide whether or not you want info wars to
[03:45:51.100 --> 03:45:57.740]  continue because we could be shut down robert barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big
[03:45:57.740 --> 03:46:01.740]  babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence
[03:46:01.740 --> 03:46:06.060]  social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because
[03:46:06.060 --> 03:46:10.140]  of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press
[03:46:10.140 --> 03:46:13.740]  that care about this the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have
[03:46:13.740 --> 03:46:18.220]  to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will
[03:46:18.220 --> 03:46:22.300]  never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the
[03:46:22.300 --> 03:46:26.860]  19th century who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until
[03:46:26.860 --> 03:46:31.660]  we were able to recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the
[03:46:31.660 --> 03:46:36.380]  the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech
[03:46:36.380 --> 03:46:41.100]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big back in big
[03:46:41.100 --> 03:46:45.580]  media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake
[03:46:45.580 --> 03:46:49.260]  people's thoughts and then the war of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the
[03:46:49.260 --> 03:46:53.820]  ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just
[03:46:53.820 --> 03:47:05.180]  saw you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:05.180 --> 03:47:24.540]  and welcome back this is dr. nick bagington this is war tower and i want to encourage

[03:47:54.940 --> 03:48:03.100]  important well they're looting us this is important trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars
[03:48:03.100 --> 03:48:09.740]  in debt is being registered by the federal reserve which shouldn't even exist for god's sake it ought
[03:48:09.740 --> 03:48:19.420]  to be the treasury you know period period not debt instruments issued by the federal reserve and
[03:48:19.420 --> 03:48:28.140]  their 300 member banks you know this was also part of that 1913 screwing of america by the
[03:48:28.140 --> 03:48:34.140]  bankers who we bailed out the tune of first the snl's during the bush administration that was a
[03:48:34.140 --> 03:48:39.580]  trillion and then another few trillion to the bankers in the last obama administration and
[03:48:40.220 --> 03:48:46.860]  14 trillion international bankers who also got money out of the federal reserve backed up by our
[03:48:46.860 --> 03:48:52.780]  good faith and credit you know and we're paying debt on our share of this national debt when it
[03:48:52.780 --> 03:48:59.100]  ought to be the treasury donald trump if you're for real take a look at the constitution in terms
[03:48:59.100 --> 03:49:05.020]  of the treasury and take the money back don't figure out who's screwing us at the federal reserve
[03:49:07.020 --> 03:49:13.740]  and the federal reserve you know propose a piece of legislation to take it back let's see where our
[03:49:13.740 --> 03:49:22.860]  congress and our u.s senator standards it just bs just more of the same from you mr president
[03:49:22.860 --> 03:49:28.380]  and the congress and the senate you know my brother was one of the few democrats insisting on a full
[03:49:28.380 --> 03:49:35.260]  audit of the federal reserve from start 1913 to now and they wouldn't do it they still haven't done
[03:49:35.260 --> 03:49:42.940]  it how about start there mr president a full audit that's fair to ask for any good businessman would
[03:49:42.940 --> 03:49:49.660]  ask for that where's the money you know come on let's see where it went where it came in where it
[03:49:49.660 --> 03:49:56.220]  went out why are we doing this think about the wealth of the nation mr president and redeploying
[03:49:56.220 --> 03:50:02.460]  those assets and the public good that's you the ceo of the nation's wealth you know we're being
[03:50:02.460 --> 03:50:13.260]  looted in this instant right now and you're the man it's your hour stop the looting you know put
[03:50:13.260 --> 03:50:24.300]  your finger in the dike of america's balance sheet and stop the blood from breaking through anymore
[03:50:24.300 --> 03:50:32.140]  you know it's propaganda time take a look at free speech right now or we will not have this
[03:50:32.140 --> 03:50:39.580]  dialogue in the future anywhere about the things we're talking about on info wars that's why people
[03:50:39.580 --> 03:50:44.860]  need to support info wars and more importantly people in government need to take action and
[03:50:44.860 --> 03:50:53.500]  those that aren't in government pick up the phone you know the phone that thing that has every other
[03:50:53.500 --> 03:51:01.180]  use but a phone call your congressional offices in your states and that's at the national office
[03:51:01.180 --> 03:51:07.660]  look it up get the phone number call them on the phone call them on the phone until they can't
[03:51:08.700 --> 03:51:18.540]  answer anything but you and not in an outraged way but hey get them to pay attention to why free
[03:51:18.540 --> 03:51:25.980]  speech is important whether you like what's being said or not it's the basic foundation of a nation
[03:51:25.980 --> 03:51:32.940]  next time it's the other guy and and alex is absolutely correct on this it's always starts
[03:51:32.940 --> 03:51:41.340]  somewhere oh it's him it's not me but someday it is you it's you know you might like the government
[03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:47.900]  you got but the government you get might be a lot different so you know as someone who comes from
[03:51:47.900 --> 03:51:54.540]  three generations of political family at the national international state level local level
[03:51:54.540 --> 03:52:02.700]  i've seen it all and i can tell you the only things that change is the way the bag man with the money
[03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:09.580]  arrives okay and there's a few that are ethical and honest you got to really dig through and some
[03:52:09.580 --> 03:52:17.820]  of them are vulgar you know are vulgar in a lot of ways but um what do we looking for in a nation
[03:52:17.820 --> 03:52:23.660]  right now you mean the last time we needed a bully someone to just go in there beat some heads
[03:52:25.260 --> 03:52:30.540]  and we got donald trump who has been very effective at i look at the free trade agreements that are
[03:52:30.540 --> 03:52:35.500]  now a little better trade agreements you know between mexico and canada now the chinese discussion
[03:52:35.500 --> 03:52:40.300]  and what's going on with nato paying more of their bill instead of us underwriting all the europe
[03:52:40.300 --> 03:52:47.180]  again you know why are we paying 65 percent of nato's bill all these years later you know grow up
[03:52:47.180 --> 03:52:56.780]  europe 70 percent of 70 years later you know grow up take care of your own business you know we
[03:52:56.780 --> 03:53:01.660]  don't have to do it we shouldn't meddle in your affairs you know we do all the time i know but
[03:53:01.660 --> 03:53:05.500]  you shouldn't meddle in ours you know what people forget you know they talk about russian meddling
[03:53:05.500 --> 03:53:13.020]  all the time do you remember when natinier who came over here had a israelan went to the congress
[03:53:13.020 --> 03:53:18.860]  and addressed both houses of congress about even getting a hello to the president on his way in to
[03:53:18.860 --> 03:53:23.660]  criticize what was going on here and that's you know that's like collusion you know that's like
[03:53:23.660 --> 03:53:28.780]  overstepping your boundaries right no one complained everybody went oh wow what are we doing
[03:53:28.780 --> 03:53:34.380]  what you know obama went over to great britain and commented publicly about brexit it's not his
[03:53:34.380 --> 03:53:38.380]  affair it wasn't his affair as president of the united states to interfere with great britain's
[03:53:39.100 --> 03:53:45.260]  domestic affairs you know that's just not what we should be doing you know when you stop and think
[03:53:45.260 --> 03:53:50.940]  about these are national questions within sovereign boundaries you know we're talking about sovereign
[03:53:50.940 --> 03:53:56.940]  wealth also it begins with sovereign humans individuals not sovereign corporations this is
[03:53:56.940 --> 03:54:05.420]  not how the country this republic was founded yet we've transferred by legislation and by uh
[03:54:05.420 --> 03:54:11.820]  supreme court decision even free speech rights we've now conveyed to corporations without equal
[03:54:11.820 --> 03:54:17.260]  accountability because you know you can criminally indict a corporation but who's going to jail nobody
[03:54:18.140 --> 03:54:25.260]  you need to make it so that these guys who are running big tech today can be criminally indicted
[03:54:25.260 --> 03:54:31.980]  for severing your civil liberties of free speech criminally indicted the board of directors
[03:54:32.860 --> 03:54:43.420]  the officers the folks that shareholders elect these guys who run these corporations and decided
[03:54:43.420 --> 03:54:52.540]  to be the 1984 filter for what's tolerable in speech the tolerance party of the liberal left
[03:54:52.540 --> 03:55:01.100]  is telling us what's okay to say because everybody should get a trophy except someone we don't agree
[03:55:01.100 --> 03:55:08.620]  with you know i mean come on ladies and gentlemen the republic is at stake and it is the info wars
[03:55:08.620 --> 03:55:14.380]  it's globalists who are controlling it looting now another segment of the public wealth the airways
[03:55:14.380 --> 03:55:21.500]  which used to be for free and governed in our interests as public resources have been sold off
[03:55:21.500 --> 03:55:29.980]  as if they're a used car no these are what protects the republic it's just why the public airwaves
[03:55:29.980 --> 03:55:37.340]  have always had a legitimacy of disagreeing on ideas we couldn't say the seven bad words or
[03:55:37.340 --> 03:55:44.140]  whatever it was you know that george carlin used to joke about but everything else was permitted
[03:55:44.140 --> 03:55:50.940]  even the most uh repugnant ideas were permitted whether we like them or not and this is what this
[03:55:50.940 --> 03:55:56.860]  republic was built on the idea of censoring it tamping down uh view counts that's what they've
[03:55:56.860 --> 03:56:01.260]  been doing to me you can't even do sorts on me anymore so i'm appearing on this network
[03:56:01.260 --> 03:56:06.140]  they can find me all over the place but ask what i've done in the last month and nothing here will
[03:56:06.140 --> 03:56:14.620]  show up you know and and yet i hear every week and it's because the messages are what they're
[03:56:14.620 --> 03:56:19.500]  standing in the way of right now which is why people need to pass this on through all of your
[03:56:19.500 --> 03:56:26.940]  networks because it is a network it's and and they created it but boy they're screwing us now
[03:56:27.900 --> 03:56:33.340]  with this network and this is one phase of what mind control has been all about you know next
[03:56:33.340 --> 03:56:39.180]  friday when we come back we're going to run out of time i want to talk about that uh because i've
[03:56:39.180 --> 03:56:46.700]  been talking about that for 25 years and it goes back to the 70s and the 50s even and before and
[03:56:46.700 --> 03:56:52.140]  next time we'll get into the whole history of how this has happened and then throw the modern
[03:56:52.140 --> 03:56:58.380]  overlay which is where we are today so it's not just about looting the national well it's deluding
[03:56:58.380 --> 03:57:06.060]  the national uh opportunity to have debate over that well so the looting can be perfect
[03:57:06.940 --> 03:57:12.860]  and this is what's happening now uh we have a chance to stand in the gap for this network
[03:57:12.860 --> 03:57:19.500]  uh for alex jones and all of the other hosts uh go to info wars get stuff you need uh there's
[03:57:19.500 --> 03:57:24.860]  great supplements there's books there's videos my books and videos are there support the network
[03:57:26.620 --> 03:57:33.900]  patronize the info wars store dot com and get the products and that's how this network stays
[03:57:33.900 --> 03:57:39.580]  on the air they are trying to snuff out the voice this voice is the voice of the info wars
[03:57:39.580 --> 03:57:46.060]  and you're the tip of the spear the info warriors i just want listeners to understand money is what
[03:57:46.060 --> 03:57:50.380]  allows us to beat this and stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the
[03:57:50.380 --> 03:57:55.900]  save info wars 50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up and stuff we're
[03:57:55.900 --> 03:58:00.620]  making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of okay but you move
[03:58:00.620 --> 03:58:04.620]  a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for
[03:58:04.620 --> 03:58:08.300]  all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions
[03:58:08.300 --> 03:58:12.940]  and millions of dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for six months we've not
[03:58:12.940 --> 03:58:17.820]  just made a standstill the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored and labored and labored
[03:58:17.820 --> 03:58:21.900]  on this i like to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the info
[03:58:21.900 --> 03:58:26.700]  war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed
[03:58:26.700 --> 03:58:30.940]  up we never have time to get into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to
[03:58:30.940 --> 03:58:36.060]  silence us then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me or you or
[03:58:36.060 --> 03:58:40.060]  anybody else i mean the democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign
[03:58:40.060 --> 03:58:46.220]  banks in the tricom so go to mfullworkstore.com let's talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the
[03:58:46.220 --> 03:58:50.860]  air thanks for holding hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a
[03:58:50.860 --> 03:58:55.260]  lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody
[03:58:55.260 --> 03:59:00.140]  agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[03:59:00.140 --> 03:59:04.540]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[03:59:04.540 --> 03:59:09.180]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[03:59:09.180 --> 03:59:12.860]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying
[03:59:12.860 --> 03:59:16.620]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to
[03:59:16.620 --> 03:59:21.660]  shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[03:59:21.660 --> 03:59:26.060]  80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down
[03:59:26.060 --> 03:59:31.820]  no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself
[03:59:31.820 --> 03:59:35.980]  and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even
[03:59:35.980 --> 03:59:40.940]  if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
