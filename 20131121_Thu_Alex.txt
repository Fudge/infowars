[00:19.040 --> 00:23.040]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.040 --> 00:29.520]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm filling in for Alex we
[00:29.520 --> 00:34.800]  have an exciting show today Alex is on the front lines literally of the
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.840]  information war this is Thursday November the 21st 2013 one day away from
[00:40.840 --> 00:45.120]  the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination in Dallas and the city of
[00:45.120 --> 00:49.520]  Dallas is doing everything they can to shut down any free speech any
[00:49.520 --> 00:54.840]  demonstration any information about the real assassination and that's the story
[00:54.840 --> 00:58.880]  the attack on the first amendment and Alex is there with the crew we're going
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.840]  to him live in just a moment he's broadcasting on Skype and you stream and
[01:02.840 --> 01:08.360]  there he is right there Alex David yes I'm gonna be co-hosting here with you
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.240]  over the next three hours and with the rest of my reporters covering what's
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.880]  happening here there is so much to discuss but if TV viewers look at their
[01:15.880 --> 01:22.600]  screen you can see the reunion tower shrouded in fog we were going to have
[01:22.600 --> 01:28.520]  five to six airplanes today and six airplanes tomorrow towing JFK truth
[01:28.520 --> 01:32.320]  info wars dot com behind them but they warned me about four days ago when I was
[01:32.320 --> 01:36.280]  renting the airplanes they're not that much to get the word out and by the way
[01:36.280 --> 01:39.600]  both companies we called were patriots and listeners they said look there's
[01:39.600 --> 01:43.400]  gonna be fog but maybe by the afternoon on Thursday probably not Friday so we'll
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.400]  still see if we get five six or maybe even seven it depends on the pilots they
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.200]  got aircraft in the air flying around with big banners barnstorming with the
[01:52.200 --> 01:57.080]  information but here in Dallas Texas my hometown so much has happened when we
[01:57.080 --> 02:02.120]  come back from break I'm gonna give you all the huge news that is unfolding here
[02:02.120 --> 02:06.920]  I was heartened last night when about 250 people or so over the hour and a
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.120]  half showed up in front of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and the
[02:11.120 --> 02:14.440]  eight or nine police that were there were very friendly and waving at us and
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.360]  agreeing with us about the tyranny of the New World Order but then I was about
[02:20.360 --> 02:24.000]  to leave and more police showed up and passed the word down to us we'd be
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.240]  arrested or ticketed that we cannot hand out anywhere on a street or road
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.760]  within 75 feet of quote public property we cannot hand out any type of free
[02:33.760 --> 02:36.600]  speech material now imagine there's nowhere where there isn't a side street
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.960]  or road where there's 75 feet away that's always inside the buildings and
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.200]  they're telling you that you can't videotape anywhere downtown because the
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.760]  mayor announced it he's the dictator and so I got in the police face because they
[02:49.760 --> 02:53.920]  had like this fake spokeswoman cheerleader Dallas cheerleader you know
[02:53.920 --> 02:58.400]  style lady playing the part of Mrs. nice was totally fake they're threatening
[02:58.400 --> 03:01.920]  our free speech threatening to have us arrested or ticketed so I blew up better
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.640]  probably should have gotten so angry but it's just shocking to realize I'm
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.960]  almost living in North Korea we've had our reporters harassed by the so-called
[03:09.960 --> 03:12.440]  mainstream media that comes over and tells them that they're not allowed to
[03:12.440 --> 03:17.160]  be down here it is the establishment trying to maintain control over the
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.360]  psyche of the people it is an elite corrupt group with a prostitute media
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.040]  doing this and we come back from break the big news I left but Rob do saw it
[03:26.040 --> 03:29.920]  the videos up on info wars calm where he gave his testimony we have some of it
[03:29.920 --> 03:33.480]  in high-def video we haven't had time to upload yet because it takes time to
[03:33.480 --> 03:37.040]  crunch that we've just been having live you stream and YouTube's uploaded
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.080]  quickly but the police showed up with about 20 riot police and others and
[03:41.080 --> 03:45.800]  plastic handcuffs and said where is Alex Jones and then they were overheard
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.920]  saying we got to take him down we cannot let him stand up to us like that it was
[03:50.920 --> 03:54.800]  literally from the movie ants I want to come back with that intro if we can if
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.360]  you let one aunt stand up they might all stand up those puny little ants out
[04:00.360 --> 04:06.400]  number us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out that's the end for
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.880]  us so that's what this is coming down to David and it is outrageous so we'll
[04:11.880 --> 04:16.080]  officially kick things off when we come back we have some other big announcements
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.960]  and I'm gonna break this all down then I'm gonna walk over to the media literally
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.440]  50 satellite trucks plus hundreds of TV cameras and the minute they see info wars
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.480]  they begin hissing like piranha and and will either try to have the police
[04:30.480 --> 04:33.280]  throw us out declaring hip to have a permit to be in downtown Dallas as
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.480]  happened yesterday to John bound and others or they will run over and begin
[04:38.480 --> 04:41.480]  hissing saying conspiracy theorist conspiracy theorist that's like the new
[04:41.480 --> 04:46.000]  racism where where where where anyone that questions the establishment as a
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.760]  conspiracy theorist and we're demonized and we're subhuman for not believing

[09:03.760 --> 09:08.640]  asserting that they have the right to tell people they can't get within 75
[09:08.640 --> 09:12.280]  feet of a street telling them that this is for their safety well you know what
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.400]  we're not going to give up our liberty for safety and controlled speech is not

[09:26.640 --> 09:32.200]  in Austin Texas and I'm here with my great crew and reporters in Dallas Texas
[09:32.200 --> 09:41.080]  again I wasn't even going to come up here this year until the mayor last year
[09:41.080 --> 09:46.920]  came out and said that no one was allowed to hand out flyers or have
[09:46.920 --> 09:50.000]  conspiracy theories actually said you're not allowed to question the official
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  story five thousand people are allowed in who we pick who agreed with the
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.200]  official story that alone guy did this and that leprechauns are basically real
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.840]  and so I've said on record I'm coming up here and I've asked my listeners to come
[10:02.840 --> 10:06.120]  here to defend the First Amendment now we went out to the Federal Reserve last
[10:06.120 --> 10:09.280]  night I'm about to go up to the police line and the rest of it and the
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.920]  establishment lapdog media and confront them in a moment but we get to the
[10:13.920 --> 10:18.000]  Federal Reserve in a day's notice about 250 people show up great folks I salute
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.640]  them the police were real nice they were nodding agreeing with us about what's
[10:21.640 --> 10:26.320]  happening to America I was there pointing out you know it's wrong that Martin
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.240]  Luther King had to be arrested over a hundred times just so black folks could
[10:30.240 --> 10:34.880]  go eat at a lunch line I mean they literally couldn't go to restaurants
[10:34.880 --> 10:38.960]  couldn't go to bathrooms you name it and I said but now in America you can be
[10:38.960 --> 10:42.240]  arrested or ticketed for handing out flyers now this is over with a big
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.160]  giant sidewalk by the Federal Reserve in the in the museum district of Dallas
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.520]  nice area and I'm over there having this rally without a permit because I have
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.800]  the First Amendment that's my permit and the police were agreeing with me and
[10:53.800 --> 10:57.040]  saying that's a good point yeah this city ordinance the mayor's put in is a
[10:57.040 --> 11:02.320]  load of bull and then all the sudden I'm told hey the police are here the police
[11:02.320 --> 11:06.520]  spokeswoman's here they're gonna arrest or ticket people if you don't leave
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.960]  you're not allowed to hand out flyers anywhere off any street that can carry
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.720]  cars side side roads highways it doesn't matter within 75 feet well folks
[11:15.720 --> 11:20.680]  there's nowhere 75 feet from a road that isn't somebody else's private property
[11:20.680 --> 11:25.000]  this is our public space going back to Rome you name it the public streets are
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.280]  where people communicate where the soapboxes are where they talk they
[11:28.280 --> 11:33.520]  want us watching TV watching sports not being real people out in the street not
[11:33.520 --> 11:37.480]  not communicating not handing flyers and info and discussing hey they killed
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.440]  our president hey they covered it up now I get mad at her and I tell her how
[11:42.440 --> 11:47.960]  dare you and then they leave the police all leave where they're about other 30
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.000]  minutes we're done with the rally I leave Rob do still there because one of
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.400]  the crew went to get the car they were in and his testimony is up on info
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.200]  wars.com in a video and he heard it from somebody else and went over and
[11:59.200 --> 12:01.520]  actually caught some of it on tape we've got it in high def can upload it
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.480]  tonight if we have time there's so much going on the police a senior police
[12:05.480 --> 12:08.760]  officer a black police officer in the blonde haired lady who was the senior
[12:08.760 --> 12:12.600]  spokeswoman really from the mayor's office he was telling us but via the
[12:12.600 --> 12:18.920]  police we cannot allow them to stand up like this and and and and stand up and
[12:18.920 --> 12:22.080]  get in our face like that we have to show them we're in control and that we
[12:22.080 --> 12:25.720]  have power and that we control these streets unbelievable right out of the
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.640]  movie a bug's life where they say if you let one aunt stand up they might all
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.160]  stand up I mean at eight o'clock at night in the middle of a museum district
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.840]  with nobody around with big giant sidewalks that are like you know 20 feet
[12:39.840 --> 12:43.920]  wide we're out there meeting our activist listeners to give them all a
[12:43.920 --> 12:47.760]  hundred flyers to hand out about the censorship in Dallas we're handing out
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.080]  flyers against censorship of the first amendment and the right of assembly and
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.000]  this woman comes with the cops and says we'll either arrest you what she told
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.680]  people in the crowd that I went over to her yes you'll be ticketed if you don't
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.160]  leave you might be arrested so I get mad at them I say how dare you the
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.080]  outrage was palpable I mean we're being completely overrun by tyranny the police
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.680]  around here in Fort Worth are now taking blood without warrants randomly at
[13:11.680 --> 13:14.840]  checkpoints that's mainstream news we played it yesterday even mainstream
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.120]  media starting to freak out the systems out of control and so I leave and 20
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.000]  riot cops with a bunch of other cops with the plastic handcuffs show up and
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.640]  they go where's that guy where's Alex Jones and they're like he left and then
[13:29.640 --> 13:33.660]  they were overheard basically saying words of the effect that trailed off we're
[13:33.660 --> 13:37.880]  gonna get him tomorrow so that's fine at 4 o'clock today I'm gonna be down it's
[13:37.880 --> 13:41.840]  listed on info wars calm in the JFK free speech section by the park we're
[13:41.840 --> 13:44.960]  meeting at we're just gonna march down the barricades on the sidewalk again in
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.000]  America and if you crazy tyrants want to arrest me or beat my head in because I
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.120]  dare walk down a street with a sign the mayor says this is illegal because he's
[13:54.120 --> 13:59.840]  God the people are fighting back the sign says tune into 104.1 FM and that's
[13:59.840 --> 14:05.360]  the rest of the story I'm gonna get to here in just a moment but the issue is
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.960]  I got so outraged that even when the court told the mayor last week look you
[14:10.960 --> 14:15.000]  can't restrict people's speech this is unenforceable this is a panhandling
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.960]  ordinance about bugging people in their cars you can't put this on the free
[14:18.960 --> 14:24.360]  speech the mayor basically only backed off about an inch and then that's only
[14:24.360 --> 14:28.280]  publicly he's still enforcing all this unconstitutional garbage so I made a
[14:28.280 --> 14:35.040]  decision we talked to some folks we know and we got a small FM transmitter that
[14:35.040 --> 14:42.480]  covers all of downtown on an open frequency 104.1 FM to broadcast the
[14:42.480 --> 14:45.320]  three days or to transmit the truth for the three days and that open clean
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.840]  frequency out to everyone as an act of defiance against people that say in
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.480]  America I can't hand out little flyers I can't have science and again this won't
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.960]  win the war but it will win the battle and it's the act of resistance to this
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.920]  that will keep us free if we lay down to this we will become China or North
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.480]  Korea or worse than what Russia was it's happening no one can deny that this is
[15:09.480 --> 15:12.920]  the reality of what we face as a civilization so I didn't just do that
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.280]  I printed 30,000 flyers we put together what several hundred of these posters on
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.840]  phone board for folks this is where we put the capital we bring in from your
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.640]  support is into the info war and we haven't talked to the pilot today he
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.040]  wasn't sure of either four or five or six pilots he got us a discount because
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.560]  they're all listeners both places we call all listeners they said but look
[15:32.560 --> 15:35.720]  there's fog in the forecast as you can see up there if you're watching us on
[15:35.720 --> 15:40.000]  info wars.com for his last show but if you're a radio listener you just go to
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.720]  the weather channels and sell the fog here but if it clears that we're gonna
[15:42.720 --> 15:49.960]  have our aircraft up here with JFK truth info wars.com JFK truth 104.1
[15:49.960 --> 15:53.320]  imagine what that would have done really getting the word out for the whole
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.760]  city seeing that that was our plan but it doesn't matter resistance is victory
[15:56.760 --> 16:00.640]  that's why we run multi-pronged operations the flyers the activism the
[16:00.640 --> 16:07.360]  marching all of it to come here and let the prostitute Decepticon corporate
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.040]  horror media know that they've lost credibility they're imploding over 80%
[16:12.040 --> 16:15.520]  of Americans know that criminal elements of the shadow government the
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.360]  military industrial complex and foreign banking cartels killed Kennedy it doesn't
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.200]  matter how much deception they're involved in and their attempt to shut down
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.560]  free speech is only backfiring so transmitting the truth imagine if it had
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.360]  that in Tiananmen Square fighting hard the airplanes that are coming as soon as
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.040]  the cloud cover clears with the banners getting the truth out and then we're
[16:36.040 --> 16:42.480]  also going to again March today four o'clock what's the park do Ferris part
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.120]  four o'clock we're gonna meet because it started like 630 and then at five we're
[16:46.120 --> 16:49.240]  gonna march down how dare us dirty Americans who think we have free speech
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.920]  who think we're in the land of the free home of the brave how dare us plan to
[16:53.920 --> 16:57.160]  march today and then again tomorrow and again folks you don't have to worry
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.800]  about getting arrested they come in want to violate your free speech that's your
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.200]  decision whether you want to get arrested or not I personally will march and walk
[17:04.200 --> 17:09.040]  down the sidewalk of my hometown as an extremist as a conspiracy theorist who
[17:09.040 --> 17:11.520]  believes they're violating my free speech see now it's conspiracy theory to
[17:11.520 --> 17:14.160]  think they're violating my free speech having a thought is a conspiracy theory
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.200]  being informed as a conspiracy theory being knowing we're in trouble is a
[17:18.200 --> 17:21.640]  conspiracy theory this is how they make us the new heretics this is the new thing
[17:21.640 --> 17:24.920]  to make us the new slaves the new demon you know the new group it's the problem
[17:24.920 --> 17:27.880]  because we're pointing out the power structures corrupt no it's not a
[17:27.880 --> 17:30.960]  conspiracy it's conspiracy fact that they're trying to violate free speech
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.760]  here in Dallas to a communist Chinese level we've had police come up to our
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.760]  reporters yesterday you name it it is crazy that this is going on so

[18:01.640 --> 18:05.800]  they have the grassy know literally occupied by 50 plus TV trucks or more
[18:05.800 --> 18:10.160]  hundreds of TV cameras and no real media is allowed in they're shutting down the
[18:10.160 --> 18:13.160]  streets they're saying you can't hand out literature you can't hand out
[18:13.160 --> 18:17.040]  pamphlets you can't hand out cards they're saying oh you can but find a

[18:39.320 --> 18:43.400]  Easter Bunny and the Kebler elves and the unicorns everywhere else no the first
[18:43.400 --> 18:47.800]  of minutes here because we're exercising it and we're not backing down in a few

[19:34.640 --> 19:39.160]  not a free press and control speech is not free speech what they're doing is
[19:39.160 --> 19:42.920]  essentially what the FISA court has done this is a document page from a FISA
[19:42.920 --> 19:46.760]  decision that was released look at the redaction that's what they're doing on
[19:46.760 --> 19:50.160]  the public streets we're not gonna take it we're there in their face we'll be

[24:08.160 --> 24:12.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm here in the studio at
[24:12.120 --> 24:16.800]  Austin but Alex Jones is on the street in Dallas he's on his way to confront the
[24:16.800 --> 24:21.600]  controlled press cabal the official press they've got a large contingency
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.360]  there this is the day before the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination but
[24:26.360 --> 24:31.920]  it's a very controlled situation and control speech is not free speech but
[24:31.920 --> 24:35.960]  here's Alex Jones and Dallas live on the streets that's right they've got
[24:35.960 --> 24:39.520]  Dealey Plaza lockdown the word is starting tonight they're gonna block it
[24:39.520 --> 24:43.520]  down many streets that's in the Dallas morning news official announcements but
[24:43.520 --> 24:48.960]  that's not happened yet even some of the prostitute media the establishment
[24:48.960 --> 24:54.680]  media has had to admit that that they are censoring people but the mayor says
[24:54.680 --> 25:01.160]  that's how they keep it classy they'll decide who is allowed to be on the air
[25:01.160 --> 25:05.600]  they will decide who can hand out flyers they will decide who can go into the
[25:05.600 --> 25:11.880]  events they will decide who has free speech and who doesn't because well
[25:11.880 --> 25:18.600]  after all they're the bosses they're the establishment and they are in charge but
[25:18.600 --> 25:24.840]  again we're here with the crew we're on 104.1 right now just a great marvel of
[25:24.840 --> 25:28.080]  modern technology doing more real reporting on what's actually happening
[25:28.080 --> 25:32.920]  at this 50th anniversary international media is here just hundreds of outlets
[25:32.920 --> 25:38.520]  and there will be no discussion by them of course unless we go educate them that
[25:38.520 --> 25:46.000]  this is all literally a projection this is all literally a staged event here so
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.080]  that they can project the illusion that everyone buys in to the official story
[25:52.080 --> 25:58.560]  and you sit here with all this fascist iconography all over the walls here in
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.640]  downtown Dallas you think about how 50 years ago tomorrow they blew John F
[26:03.640 --> 26:09.760]  Kennedy's head off here and now right over the hill by the train yard just
[26:09.760 --> 26:14.240]  hundreds of media outlets more than 50 trucks that's conservative we're gonna
[26:14.240 --> 26:16.440]  go show you some video of that live here in a minute if you're watching on
[26:16.440 --> 26:19.200]  info wars.com forward slash show of radio listeners I'll describe it all to you
[26:19.200 --> 26:22.440]  and we're about to go to break here in a few minutes as a short segment then I'll
[26:22.440 --> 26:28.360]  cross across over when we get back and I will go over and talk talk to the talk
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.920]  to the police let's just all wait right here guys and then broadcast here
[26:31.920 --> 26:37.840]  giving a shot across at Dealey Plaza and then we will walk across and I would
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.440]  figure by the time by the time we come back in the next segment the police will
[26:41.440 --> 26:43.400]  be over here do you're good over here come on back over here with me brother
[26:43.400 --> 26:48.400]  but again they've already cordoned it off so they can bring in all their
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.320]  hand-picked people to put out their official story and the police have been
[26:53.320 --> 26:56.560]  trained well that anyone that looks like an American anyone that talks about
[26:56.560 --> 27:02.480]  freedom is basically the enemy anyone who is not ABC NBC CBS Fox CNN anybody
[27:02.480 --> 27:09.080]  that doesn't have a anti-liberty agenda is evil and is bad and they've just got
[27:09.080 --> 27:13.960]  tons of undercover military and undercover police here strutting around
[27:13.960 --> 27:18.560]  with satisfied looks in their eyes staring at us like we're the enemy the
[27:18.560 --> 27:22.120]  rank-and-file police have been pretty nice but there's all sorts of plain
[27:22.120 --> 27:27.840]  clothes guys walking around literally in their hipster outfits like like like
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.120]  Keystone cops are coming over and listening to us and then thinking they've
[27:31.120 --> 27:34.160]  gotten intel and running off they come and stand here me go we're gonna have
[27:34.160 --> 27:39.400]  airplanes in the sky we're on 104.1 like we have intel we have intel that was
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.160]  act like we're hiding something I mean we're like right out in the open about
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.400]  all this is dominating with alternative real media against their dinosaur
[27:47.400 --> 27:54.960]  kleptocrat media and it is just ultimately ultimately ultimately totally
[27:54.960 --> 27:59.720]  and completely ridiculous what's going on and the entire attitude of the
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.240]  establishment is fear of the people and that's because at the top the globalists
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.200]  have robbed everyone seven ways to Sunday they've got mounted police coming
[28:07.200 --> 28:11.480]  down this way in a few minutes in their you know Marine Corps drill sergeant
[28:11.480 --> 28:13.960]  hats but they're not drilling young men to go off and fight they're just
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.120]  drilling the public to be good little slaves but this is historic we're
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.360]  standing up to point out that their attempt to squash free speech will not
[28:21.360 --> 28:24.760]  be put up with and we will go over and talk to the police and in the media in
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.160]  the next long segment but let's get Anthony Gucci Artie's take we got a
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.280]  minute or two before we go to break on what you've seen so far well what's
[28:32.280 --> 28:35.560]  amazing to me is last night they actually came up and said hey everyone
[28:35.560 --> 28:39.520]  that's holding a sign right now next to the street not even near the street is a
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.280]  criminal yeah this on video yeah it's already up it's on info words right now
[28:43.280 --> 28:46.880]  my video and then you confronted them but I initially confronted her and said
[28:46.880 --> 28:49.920]  so everyone here is a criminal she said well yeah we could arrest everyone here
[28:49.920 --> 28:53.480]  and find you $500 and it's a city ordinance and I said what about the
[28:53.480 --> 28:56.160]  First Amendment she said well I don't want to talk about that why don't they
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.720]  just pass a city ordinance to take our kids I guess they do yeah exactly it can
[28:59.720 --> 29:03.200]  just be a city ordinance or a federal law that trumps the Constitution and the
[29:03.200 --> 29:06.760]  First Amendment doesn't exist anymore so technically right now Darren is holding
[29:06.760 --> 29:09.040]  a sign by the way he should be arrested because he thought he's a thought
[29:09.040 --> 29:13.240]  criminal and show the thought crime anyone holding a sign near a road in
[29:13.240 --> 29:17.200]  Dallas which is the entire city is a criminal literally for holding a sign
[29:17.200 --> 29:20.800]  actually they said also trying to hand things out to people is even worse
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.960]  that's it that's even a higher level crime so even trying to so communicating
[29:24.960 --> 29:28.360]  with a fellow slave you're meant to go work in a slave deal until the robots
[29:28.360 --> 29:32.560]  get produced or replaces watch TV be programmed all day die of all the soft
[29:32.560 --> 29:35.680]  kill roll over and die and you maybe have some kids for him in case they want
[29:35.680 --> 29:39.480]  some kid slaves to send us out of Arabia or Thailand we'll be right back with
[29:39.480 --> 29:42.800]  David Knight in Austin Texas I'm Alex Jones reporting to defend the Republic

[34:09.240 --> 34:13.320]  intense and parking lots it just everywhere and they've got all these
[34:13.320 --> 34:17.760]  big American flags they're putting up these big stages to try to project the
[34:17.760 --> 34:23.640]  official the official story it is absolutely insane to be down here and
[34:23.640 --> 34:26.760]  and and now we're gonna talk to this officer right here before we walk on
[34:26.760 --> 34:30.720]  down the road hi how you doing officer hi how you doing you talked to us for
[34:30.720 --> 34:38.920]  a second please oh you're working what am I not important enough to talk to so
[34:38.920 --> 34:43.960]  as you can see the Praetorian Guard we're just lowly taxpayers ladies and
[34:43.960 --> 34:47.640]  gentlemen we're like hi officer how you doing he looked at me and with an
[34:47.640 --> 34:52.880]  imperious look of trying to project dominance and power bugged his eyes out
[34:52.880 --> 34:58.080]  a little bit that a slave scum American would dare even try to look at his
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.120]  direction and of course he's armed as well most governments are trying to
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.840]  disarm the public so they'll have the monopoly of armaments against us I was
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.720]  very friendly very nice and when I wanted to bring up to him was this is
[35:09.720 --> 35:14.120]  that here let me see that Leanne walk over here Leanne and show folks this see
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.240]  that's the reason we're here I wanted to talk to you as we were told you can't
[35:17.240 --> 35:22.240]  have signs anywhere in the city here in North Korea I meant Tiananmen Square
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.640]  China Beijing and it says the establishment killed me 50 years ago
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.480]  now they're killing free speech the people are fighting back that's on the
[35:30.480 --> 35:34.520]  front and on the back you might want to tune into it officer it's a new station
[35:34.520 --> 35:42.960]  I've heard locally here it's a 104.1 FM the people are fighting back so we're
[35:42.960 --> 35:45.400]  just here ladies and gentlemen on the edge of Dealey Plaza and they're and
[35:45.400 --> 35:48.000]  they're setting up the big theater with the prostitute media here let's go down
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.320]  here see if somebody else see if somebody else will see if somebody else will
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.880]  talk to us again it is a very very nice day out here very foggy keeping our
[35:56.880 --> 36:00.640]  aircraft the barnstormers we had from being able to come in right now with
[36:00.640 --> 36:08.000]  the banners or JFK truth and we're just here walking around talking to folks
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.560]  with our signs and our free speech and again last night everything went well
[36:12.560 --> 36:18.240]  at the Federal Reserve hey brother yeah everything went well at that everything
[36:18.240 --> 36:24.800]  was great until until more of the riot police showed up and then they basically
[36:24.800 --> 36:28.360]  told us it was illegal to have signs or to be handing out flyers anywhere in
[36:28.360 --> 36:33.640]  Dallas 75 feet from basically any street because the government and the state
[36:33.640 --> 36:37.720]  are God but but here we are reporters came in here yesterday and we're and
[36:37.720 --> 36:43.240]  we're run off you got stand beside me with a thought crime and here we are we
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.160]  have walked directly into the Wizard of Oz's main theater gallery and we look
[36:48.160 --> 36:51.920]  enough like like mainstream media that were camouflaged right now we're not
[36:51.920 --> 36:57.000]  camouflaged that they have not pirated yet they have not pirated yet but we're
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.320]  not for stew than anything and then you've got the the the the workers here
[37:01.320 --> 37:05.440]  that are working for the establishment taping us they're the real media those
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.560]  guys with their cameras are more important than these known certified
[37:09.560 --> 37:15.560]  globalist prostitutes and so again we ask the police officer to talk to us no
[37:15.560 --> 37:20.960]  one is talking to us hi we're from m4s info wars dot com hi hi everyone we're
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.080]  looking for the police or anybody else would like to speak to us and well
[37:25.080 --> 37:28.560]  there's the stage ladies and gentlemen there you can see it on I guess that's
[37:28.560 --> 37:31.680]  the chairs they've got stacked up for the select people that agree with the
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.320]  official story and this guy saying he's to fix it hi we're here we try to talk
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.600]  to policemen he just let us in we're just here to talk to everybody hi how's
[37:40.600 --> 37:46.840]  it going we're the real media we're not we're not the prostitute media or the
[37:46.840 --> 37:51.680]  state-run media we have bigger audiences and you guys too as well so that
[37:51.680 --> 37:55.600]  kind of makes it but we're not well I guess we are fancier too as well nowadays
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.160]  but again ladies and gentlemen we're transmitting broadcasting worldwide to
[37:59.160 --> 38:02.360]  three million people here and then of course it'll be millions after this we're
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.040]  just looking for someone to speak to us we just asked to speak to the police
[38:06.040 --> 38:09.960]  or ever there you've got the the big cameras that are gonna broadcast the
[38:09.960 --> 38:13.640]  world the official story that one guy did all this and that Easter bunnies are
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.880]  real and that Santa Claus is real and it is because look they're all here and
[38:17.880 --> 38:20.880]  only if you believe that Santa Claus is real and that one guy killed Kennedy are

[38:35.240 --> 38:39.520]  threaten us and stuff but you know now we're just here trying to cover what's
[38:39.520 --> 38:45.000]  happening and again they're gonna try to shut even more of this more of this down
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.080]  as things unfold so again we're just here getting a tour I guess they know
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.440]  we're broadcasting live and I see folks freaking out saying stopping stopping
[38:54.440 --> 38:59.360]  but but you know we're just here we asked the cops we said we're going in on
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.680]  record and he didn't he wouldn't talk to us he just bugged his eyes out at us so
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.680]  we're just here waiting to talk to whoever so this is this is this is where
[39:08.680 --> 39:12.200]  no one's allowed to be and they're gonna cordon off even more so that they can
[39:12.200 --> 39:17.120]  tell everybody everyone knows Oswald acted alone everyone knows Jack Ruby
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.320]  acted alone everyone knows Obamacare is free everyone knows the government

[42:36.320 --> 42:39.400]  folks out there last night I don't want like doing rallies and events though
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.640]  because it's so humbling to see these families with their kids with a lot of
[42:43.640 --> 42:46.640]  liberty in their eyes looking up to me and I know that even though I'm a good
[42:46.640 --> 42:51.160]  guy at heart I'm kind of a little bit goblin-ish and you know it's just at the
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.480]  same time it's it's it's the opposite of getting on a power trip but what I do
[42:55.480 --> 42:59.640]  get is energized when we have these type of victories so here we are
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.520]  retaking the Neely Plaza where they're gonna have their little event let's go
[43:05.520 --> 43:09.280]  now walk around and go over to that area where it looks like they put up
[43:09.280 --> 43:12.880]  barricades only media and police are over there they've they've also blocked
[43:12.880 --> 43:16.880]  that off let's see if we can waddle on over there but but but first Macadam
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.760]  come on over here as general Jack T. River would say get away from there and
[43:22.760 --> 43:28.840]  feed me that belt I was there helping you that you there me with the gun and me
[43:28.840 --> 43:31.960]  they're feeding you anyway so that's a dr. Strangelove quote have you seen that
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.880]  movie you know that movie was made about coup d'etats of the military industrial
[43:35.880 --> 43:39.040]  complex about a year after Kennedy was killed and they were gonna have slim
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.080]  pick and say shoot a guy can have a pretty good time in Dallas with all
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.440]  that when he's up in the beaches do but instead they change it to Vegas because
[43:46.440 --> 43:49.040]  it was right after the Kennedy assassination back into you've been in
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.400]  four wars about eight nine months and now you you've been to England you've
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.560]  been here you've been all over the place Kansas City with Josh doing a great
[43:56.560 --> 43:59.120]  report up there on the attacks on free speech where they wouldn't let people
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.080]  rally against Obamacare on the sidewalk and we're like choke people until we
[44:03.080 --> 44:05.960]  came back then they backed off then the legislature told the state police to
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.960]  stop another example of standing up well there you got a comment for Macadam
[44:09.960 --> 44:13.920]  now seriously Leigh Ann Macadam when we pulled up in the truck last night people
[44:13.920 --> 44:16.960]  were saying where's Macadam where is Macadam so they want to know where
[44:16.960 --> 44:22.840]  McBreen is too so eat the silent reporter anyways here here is Macadam
[44:22.840 --> 44:26.800]  Macadam give us your take well I can't believe I'm committing a thought
[44:26.800 --> 44:30.000]  crime just by standing here with this sign and I see a lot of people that are
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.920]  driving by tuning in to 104.1 as they're curious what are they doing what are
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.760]  they committing thought crime I don't mean to be so frightened that we've
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.680]  busted through the barricades but I like I like my natural teeth I don't want
[44:43.680 --> 44:49.320]  them to get kicked in by the police here just for my first amendment you see me
[44:49.320 --> 44:52.680]  nicely ask the cop and he would just look to the pure hate oh yeah they don't
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.760]  they they know about you they know that Jones is in town that's like the top
[44:56.760 --> 45:04.680]  story on the news right now we have infiltrated Tiananmen Square well it's
[45:04.680 --> 45:08.760]  very exciting I can't believe that this whole hoopla is here and nobody even
[45:08.760 --> 45:14.560]  wants to say the word assassination it's just a thought crime to even think that
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.960]  that is what everyone is here for and they want to remember his legacy but it
[45:18.960 --> 45:22.680]  was his legacy and his character in his story that is what got him killed in the
[45:22.680 --> 45:28.760]  first place also as I was researching on the way to come here it turns out that
[45:28.760 --> 45:33.320]  weaponizing the words conspiracy theory by the government the government really
[45:33.320 --> 45:36.800]  started to try and weaponize that word conspiracy theory and turn that into like
[45:36.800 --> 45:41.160]  a terrorist thing because of the JFK assassination because it was just this
[45:41.160 --> 45:46.640]  huge light bulb across the globe that lit everyone up and it had the power to
[45:46.640 --> 45:52.040]  to turn the government to to turn it sour and to cause everyone to say wait a
[45:52.040 --> 45:55.520]  minute did they assassinate him what's going on over there in America and they
[45:55.520 --> 45:58.760]  were like we need to shut that down what about the term conspiracy theories how
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.920]  it is the new heritage not to debate it just like now TSA if you don't like
[46:02.920 --> 46:05.480]  them groping you they go don't be a conspiracy theorist like if you like
[46:05.480 --> 46:09.840]  strawberry ice cream and they want to sell you vanilla they go no eat eat the
[46:09.840 --> 46:13.680]  vanilla conspiracy theorist it's like the new thing calling you racist or
[46:13.680 --> 46:18.360]  whatever but but it's a flip it's like it's all it's like racism against
[46:18.360 --> 46:22.040]  thinkers and people that are informed it's like oh you don't mind the official
[46:22.040 --> 46:25.800]  story you're a thought criminal that's what it is conspiracy theorists means
[46:25.800 --> 46:29.880]  thought criminal right and the thing is that we're not the minority the
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.480]  conspiracy theorists are not the minority so people need to stop being
[46:33.480 --> 46:37.840]  scared to question the official narrative or saying wait a minute what's so
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.720]  wrong with questioning the official story I mean people have been people have
[46:41.720 --> 46:45.640]  been you know put to death on death row and then turns out later that DNA
[46:45.640 --> 46:49.600]  exonerated them I mean people make mistakes so what's the big deal with
[46:49.600 --> 46:54.040]  going in and checking the facts and you never question government you they
[46:54.040 --> 47:00.000]  never lie it's bizarre to not believe known wires it's bizarre a hundred
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.560]  million signed up for Obamacare it cut the cost in half it's cheaper than a
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.320]  phone bill liar don't you ever question them let me tell you there's a lot of
[47:09.320 --> 47:13.520]  racists out there like Oprah said to you heard her she said if you question
[47:13.520 --> 47:19.960]  Obama and say he's a liar you need to die so and again she's totally in the
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.840]  know totally smart hangs out at the very top of the new order folks this lady is
[47:23.840 --> 47:28.360]  a monster but she plays all these parts where she's the savior and they care
[47:28.360 --> 47:31.720]  about everybody they want everybody hating each other they want everybody
[47:31.720 --> 47:35.840]  divided it's bottom line manipulation ladies and gentlemen all right Mac
[47:35.840 --> 47:38.360]  anything else you want to say is we're gonna talk to Darren McBreen let's go
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.740]  commit some thought crime yeah thought crime all right my fellow thought
[47:42.740 --> 47:45.800]  criminal come on in here a Darren McBreen reporter for info or soundly news
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.440]  on our star graphics man well the thing that amazes me is they're telling us
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.520]  that we we're not allowed to film here we're not allowed to hold up signs that's
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.040]  right we cannot hang up banners that unless there's some pre-determined
[48:01.040 --> 48:05.280]  pre-approved areas wherever the hell that is that you're allowed to hang up
[48:05.280 --> 48:09.720]  signs definitely not in daily Plaza which is about to go in total lockdown
[48:09.720 --> 48:13.840]  right now so if you're in the Dallas-Fort Worth area by all means please
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.960]  join us let's take back our first amendment you know 50 years ago they
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.280]  silenced JFK but they're not gonna silence us tomorrow during the 50th
[48:24.280 --> 48:28.160]  anniversary it's time to retake our first amendment that is incredibly
[48:28.160 --> 48:31.080]  anti-american to talk about freedom do you want to apologize for your racism
[48:31.080 --> 48:34.160]  I'll think about it seriously I want you to get on your knees right now
[48:34.160 --> 48:38.360]  apologize I can't do it man what do you think so far of last night where they
[48:38.360 --> 48:41.960]  were saying when they came back and wanted to arrest me that was amazing
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.960]  because I was the getaway driver and so I basically dropped you off and then I
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.520]  come back we get in the in the truck and drive off and then all help broke loose
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.000]  I mean we I guess we missed them by that much because the cops showed up what
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.760]  like five minutes later they got mad because I rebuked them I was like
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.520]  you're gonna arrest us or give us tickets $500 tickets and then she goes
[49:04.520 --> 49:07.920]  mm-hmm with this fake cheerleader face and it made me just blow up and I could
[49:07.920 --> 49:11.000]  have handled it better but maybe I should have handled it that way because I
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.760]  was happy hey cops have a good night I'm leaving all of a sudden hold on more
[49:14.760 --> 49:18.480]  police are here we could arrest you and we're gonna people are coming a larger
[49:18.480 --> 49:21.280]  group are coming to give you tickets they already had the the riot police
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.880]  coming and then they never came so we left it was like you know 915 the thing
[49:25.880 --> 49:29.960]  was over then they showed up right after where's all the shows and then we're like
[49:29.960 --> 49:32.960]  seen and heard by doing others going we can't let him stand up to us like that
[49:32.960 --> 49:36.960]  if one aunt stands up they might all stand up I mean it was literally do get
[49:36.960 --> 49:39.840]  over here dude I know there's video taping right now doing a great job
[49:39.840 --> 49:42.640]  Rob do you give a sure take on what you've seen or they'll get good to you
[49:42.640 --> 49:46.600]  already take anybody else wants to talk here go ahead okay so as we were
[49:46.600 --> 49:50.520]  leaving there was a group of four of us leaving we see a bunch of cops coming the
[49:50.520 --> 49:53.960]  other direction towards the Federal Reserve and then a fan stopped and said
[49:53.960 --> 49:56.840]  hey I was just listening to their conversation they were saying we can't
[49:56.840 --> 49:59.880]  let them stand up like this we have to go after we have to show them that we're
[49:59.880 --> 50:03.080]  in charge so it was that type of mentality that they were broadcasting on
[50:03.080 --> 50:05.600]  he was eavesdropping on their conversation I went over and asked him a
[50:05.600 --> 50:08.560]  question I said hey are you guys planning on stifling the free speech totally
[50:08.560 --> 50:11.600]  ignored me they continued their little chit chat and then they all walked
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.640]  across the street we got video of several cops that had lots of plastic the
[50:15.640 --> 50:18.720]  plastic handcuffs like you know maybe you told me to last now when you were
[50:18.720 --> 50:22.000]  fresh you said you heard him say yeah we can't let him do that right well then
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.360]  we got across the street they were asking for you and they go where's the guy
[50:25.360 --> 50:29.920]  that was here earlier that was talking and and some guy gets on you mean Alex
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.600]  Jones are like yeah yeah and he goes he's gone he left and so then they kind
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.120]  of chitchat a little more well he's not here we can't get him now and then they
[50:37.120 --> 50:39.680]  just took off back across the street so that was their whole plan was to come
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.400]  after and get you we think they may have split up maybe on levels five and six
[50:43.400 --> 50:46.920]  now all right ladies and gentlemen we'll be back with Anthony you're already on

[54:11.560 --> 54:15.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm live here in the studio
[54:15.640 --> 54:19.360]  and Alex is in Dallas fighting for our first amendment rights now you know we've
[54:19.360 --> 54:23.400]  seen several recent political conventions that they take demonstrators
[54:23.400 --> 54:27.520]  and they cage them in free speech zones and just earlier this year we see that
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.920]  Diane Feinstein wants to have a definition of who the official press is
[54:31.920 --> 54:35.800]  and everybody else can just shut up that's essentially what they're doing in
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.120]  Dallas is that what you're saying there Alex you're absolutely right David Knight
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.520]  I'm here again in front of a dilly plaza right now we're gonna go around to the
[54:44.520 --> 54:48.720]  grassy knoll where we only saw a prostitute media over there but there I
[54:48.720 --> 54:52.400]  guess not even allowed into the area where they're putting up the Orwellian
[54:52.400 --> 54:57.280]  theater they're Orwellian stage so they were all jealously hopping up and down
[54:57.280 --> 55:01.080]  across the street on the grassy knoll literally saying why are they allowed in
[55:01.080 --> 55:05.480]  why can they get video of it and again there's no laws or something here it's
[55:05.480 --> 55:10.640]  just all at the mayor's discretion like he literally I guess the streets closed
[55:10.640 --> 55:15.800]  like he's literally God or something and it just shows the bizarreness of us
[55:15.800 --> 55:19.360]  that's why we're here exercising the first amendment in defiance of tyranny
[55:19.360 --> 55:23.600]  right now we're here wasn't gonna be here everybody knows the government
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.280]  killed Kennedy or criminal elements of it but we're now here to exercise the
[55:27.280 --> 55:30.520]  first amendment and engage in thought crime we're gonna we're handing out
[55:30.520 --> 55:35.800]  30,000 flyers we've got signs and we're gonna defend the first amendment and keep
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.560]  this country free this is this is not North Korea at least not yet they're
[55:40.560 --> 55:44.880]  sure trying hard though it's like North Korea with football teams like kind of
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.640]  an insane asylum type situation but the pilots were right there's all the fog
[55:50.640 --> 55:53.520]  and the bad ceiling but if it blows out soon those aircraft are going to be
[55:53.520 --> 55:57.680]  launching do have you called about that because man I tell you that wouldn't
[55:57.680 --> 56:01.240]  been for the weather that would have been the absolute stroke of genius have
[56:01.240 --> 56:06.320]  like five six airplanes at once circling JFK truth info wars dot com but
[56:06.320 --> 56:09.400]  I almost was gonna try to get a blimp he can get blimps for not too much the
[56:09.400 --> 56:15.640]  smaller ones that have like signs on the side but again there's too much too
[56:15.640 --> 56:22.720]  much wind to engage in the old blimp activity so we're down here and again
[56:22.720 --> 56:26.040]  we're just all in or the first amendment folks know I was involved with the
[56:26.040 --> 56:29.720]  Ron Paul Air Force with Ted Anderson getting hundreds of flights up with
[56:29.720 --> 56:33.440]  aircraft and key battleground states and of course the Ron Paul blimp I was
[56:33.440 --> 56:36.320]  heavily involved in that with our great listeners and please don't forget this
[56:36.320 --> 56:39.800]  is all paid for by you buying the high-quality products and info wars
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.600]  life comm by getting the probe here 20% off promo code water 20 this is a war
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.480]  this is an info war and we're down here in the face of it enjoying fighting
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.760]  tyranny by the way I don't need to be pat on the back but I do I do need fuel
[56:52.760 --> 57:00.240]  major major major major fuel in the info war that is definitely what we need
[57:00.240 --> 57:08.120]  and so we are walking across the street live here towards Houston Street and
[57:08.120 --> 57:13.120]  there is the schoolbook building the supposed window where he shot down
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.720]  through all these trees and hitting and again also Santa Claus was up there
[57:18.720 --> 57:21.840]  helping him and that's true because the official story is they say Santa Claus
[57:21.840 --> 57:27.360]  was helping Lee Harvey Oswald and if you believe that again I got a bridge I
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.640]  want to sell you on the moon we're gonna go across as soon as this yeah as soon
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.080]  as this happens we're gonna go across and they got heavy heavy traffic in
[57:36.080 --> 57:41.480]  here they got cross walker folks in here and I can't figure out exactly what's
[57:41.480 --> 57:44.520]  going on but we're gonna go to break here in a minute come back and have
[57:44.520 --> 57:49.680]  continual coverage and then of course we have you streams for backup security but
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.560]  I tell you the word is definitely gone to the police I knew last night when they
[57:52.560 --> 57:55.440]  were coming to arrest me that I had to get out of video they might try to
[57:55.440 --> 57:59.440]  arrest me but they seem to have backed off for now and that's certainly good
[57:59.440 --> 58:04.400]  thing sir I'm good thank you very much sir what do you think about them saying
[58:04.400 --> 58:07.720]  that only people that agree with the official story can be inside there for
[58:07.720 --> 58:13.080]  the memorial tomorrow oh I think it's ludicrous everybody should have an
[58:13.080 --> 58:17.880]  opportunity to this is the 50th anniversary everyone ought to have an
[58:17.880 --> 58:21.280]  opportunity to be as close as possible but the 80 to 90 percent that don't
[58:21.280 --> 58:24.040]  believe the official story their conspiracy theorists they're bad people
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.400]  if you just call them that name then that discredits them you don't have any
[58:27.400 --> 58:33.040]  information you just say that and then they're bad right I'm I find myself
[58:33.040 --> 58:36.520]  proud to be a heretic just like this man we don't believe a damn word of the
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.040]  official story we'll be right back

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.000]  because we don't want people to look too closely at the details we don't want

[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.840]  lawsuit for our rights to sell freedom of speech that's right and but but it
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.280]  shows of the mayor still trying to lie to everybody else and say that nobody has
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:58.000]  free speech it is outrageous they need to move to North Korea agree all right

[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.040]  said arrest us all then they mean in America the police are like you have
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.480]  signs out that's how much you do in free countries but this is just like the

[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.560]  jfk you're like we already know this i know this too i wouldn't be here
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:44.440]  except that the mayor last year said i've decided no free speech i've decided
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.040]  only if you agree with the fish the story you can read all this quotes no
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.720]  cameras anywhere downtown no signs no handing anything out will arrest you
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.000]  and the cops showed up last night and threatened to arrest us i yelled at them
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.520]  but i really got genuinely mad they left came back with riot police we were
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.160]  already gone but rob do was there so
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:07.480]  we're broadcasting for three days on 104.1 uh which is liberty radio that's on
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.560]  an open frequency we're transmitting the voice of liberty
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.120]  back into america in occupied femur region six here in dallas texas
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.520]  and uh that's why we're doing that to stand up desperate
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.120]  attacks by the globalist on free speech must be met with desperate measures
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.560]  and we'd have five to six aircraft in the air right now it wasn't for this fog
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.040]  that we paid for towing the big banners jfk
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.640]  truth info wars dot com jfk truth on the other half of the banners uh obviously
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.080]  was going to say 104.1 and they may still get up today or tomorrow but
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.280]  regardless everyone in dallas who's listening on the internet we used to
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.000]  have an affiliate 10 000 watt they switched formats
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.120]  so we're not on in dallas right now we're on 590 in austin that you can hear
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.000]  up here but we're not actually on an official station in dallas
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.280]  we're on the internet dominating here in dallas obviously so everybody that's
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.600]  in dallas he says call their friends and family
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:04.760]  tell them about 104.1 truth liberty jfk truth radio if you're listening to

[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.520]  you are the resistance and leon macadoo fellow thought criminal
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.120]  with these illegal they say their ordinance trumps the first amendment
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.280]  uh jfk truth signs the establishment killed me 50 years ago
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.720]  now they're trying to kill free speech is what kennedy's saying here the people
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.560]  are fighting back and leon macadoo you're here with some of the folks

[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.360]  to hold a moment of silence for a president that they beloved and that
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.240]  they wanted to hold a candle and say this is not over
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.080]  we need to keep this open and get to the truth how did you feel when they said
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.160]  you've been coming here for 49 years but this year this most momentous year
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.160]  you can't be here well we felt like uh we were not
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.440]  going to be silenced that's obviously what the effort was the silence
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.040]  conspiracy theorists of the grassy know which is a quote
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.320]  um so in response we are passing out

[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.360]  taken over by john judge and we have a serious conference here
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.720]  for 50 years now that delves into the you know details of the assassination
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.880]  we know like you know that that kennedy was killed by the national security
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.280]  state at the highest level and uh and we're just not going to let
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.120]  them silence us so what did the mayor and the people
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.240]  here with the 50th committee what did they tell you what was their reasoning
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.560]  for having to have the conspiracy theorists silenced
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.640]  well of course they didn't officially give us any reason but we have
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.000]  gotten notes of the official meetings and that kind of thing
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.520]  but at first um they told us that the whole plaza would be blocked off for a
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.480]  week before and a week after that we needed to apply for a permit but we
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.080]  couldn't do it more than a year ahead but then when we did it on the first day
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.480]  of the year they said they'd given the whole
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:24.680]  permit to the book depository quote unquote museum
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.160]  and then later they realized that that wasn't going to fly legally so the
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.120]  museum passed it back off to the city there's a committee in charge of this
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.400]  that the mayor basically claims it's up to the committee and the committee
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.880]  points back to the mayor and um it's ridiculous but it's obvious
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.400]  and there's quotes in our paper and other places about
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.720]  you know the purpose of this is to keep conspiracy theory off the null
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.800]  but you are still planning on holding a moment of silence as you have been
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.480]  doing for 49 years the mayor graciously gave us the
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.000]  opportunity to have a moment of silence at a parking lot over here somewhere
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.920]  at 12 30 and then has promised to let us on the null when their
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.760]  event is over at 2 30 that remains to be seen whether
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.280]  um we'll actually get up there later in the afternoon tomorrow
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.600]  sir i like your shirt it really says it all 50 years in denial is enough
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.800]  free the files find the truth that's something that's important to point out
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.240]  mac do uh is that uh they're still keep holding
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.920]  on to those files what do they have to hide well the there's a lot of files
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.360]  that we'd like to have back but one of them is the georgio needy's
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.240]  files that jefferson moorley's been asking for georgio and eighties was uh
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.960]  we think uh orchestrated the logistics on the ground but more importantly
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.200]  he was the liaison between the cia and the 1979 house select committee on
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.560]  assassinations and nobody knew that at the time nobody
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:53.000]  knew that he was involved here in dalas in 1963 so
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.680]  there's a whole bunch of files relating to him and the cia is not letting them
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.520]  go but uh we think that's uh that's a key now that
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.800]  of course that's not the only files that that they're holding but
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.000]  certainly the files that they're still holding left whether relating to joe
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.520]  needy's or someone else are the important ones
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.800]  all right well listen sir thank you so much great job macadoo we'd like to

[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.080]  biased to the establishment and whatever crap the establishment tells them to
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.760]  repeat we're just common sense real grassroots media

[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.640]  engaging in total thought crime uh with our evil
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.920]  information that they do not want out they've had not you got any uh take on
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.880]  this historic coverage of uh yeah the 50th anniversary of uh
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.080]  john f kennedy by uh santa claus you know right there
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.680]  around where you are they're getting rid of that x that marked the spot where
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.600]  the shooting took place and the preposterous
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.320]  explanation that they were giving for that was that they didn't want anybody to
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.640]  trip over it it's a piece of tape and and that's the kind of preposterous
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.680]  lies that we've been fed over and over again
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.200]  we got things that made absolutely no sense it was clear that they were
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.640]  controlling the narrative it was clear that they were lying to people it was
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.680]  clear that they had documents that they weren't showing to people
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.560]  jim garrison pointed out that they interrogated
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.000]  harley harvey oswald for 12 minutes and you can't see any
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.480]  notes taken of the interrogation that's the kind of silence that they put on
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.320]  50 years ago but now they're doing that everywhere they're doing it at political
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.600]  conventions they contain free speech and demonstration in a box
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.200]  and that's what they're doing right now they're trying to exclude everybody out
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.840]  of the area and have some kind of it looks
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.640]  like when you're walking around alex it looked like they were setting up some
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.080]  kind of a stage to celebrate the hunger games or something i mean it's like
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.080]  some kind of a phony propaganda i was just about to blurp in
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.440]  uh and say it's like it's a hunger games and then you said it because it
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.320]  literally is a big pageant to project their bs that almost no one's buying
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.560]  it is it's preposterous yeah the scientific polls are 80 to 91
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.920]  percent now they've got polls going well the majority 65
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:09.000]  percent don't believe it it's it's like even carry doesn't believe it now
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.920]  it's a total cave in that's right and they're now reversing the polls
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.760]  to try to shovel all this bs down our throats and literally say
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.800]  questioning known liars is a conspiracy theory
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.920]  so that's what this comes down to it's about the free press it's about the
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.120]  war between the new real press and the state-run media
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.160]  everybody out there who has a blog a youtube channel
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.920]  whatever you see whatever you report you are more important than the dinosaur
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.080]  media they have a history of lying and deceit and manipulation and it's the
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.680]  alternative media and citizen journalists that are the cutting
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.240]  edge of liberty it's an info war and it is not a spectator sport
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.360]  everybody's got to get in the game and more people have been getting in the
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.120]  game the old corporate horror media does not want you in the game
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.720]  they want you as a spectator being shoveled bowl from behind the wizards
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.440]  curtain well we're pulling that curtain back
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.960]  that's what we're doing here today and we're restoring this republic
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.680]  so america can again be an example of liberty
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.840]  not that we've ever been perfect but now we become an example of stinking
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.080]  tyranny a giant evil citadel of world corruption
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.080]  used by private corporations to establish planetary fraud

[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.800]  david night here in austin alex is in dallas and he's there because
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.080]  they're preparing for the celebration or i should say the
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.440]  commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the jfk
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.960]  assassination and alex is just walking around looking at the sets they're
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.400]  preparing and it just struck me we talked about this in the last segment
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.320]  it struck me about the irony that this looks exactly like something from the
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.760]  hunger games is carefully controlled propaganda exercise
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:48.040]  and it was just this week that donald suddendon was promoting
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.240]  the movie and he said he wanted to start a revolution he wanted the
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.520]  younger generation to understand how they're being lied to how they're being
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.040]  manipulated well go there if you're in dallas take a look
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.520]  and see what they're doing and and we've got an fm
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.440]  104.1 you can use that as kind of a distributed megaphone system
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.120]  take to the streets shout out tell them what you are seeing there tell them
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.680]  that you don't want to be controlled you don't want to be throttled you don't
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:14.760]  want to be shoved into the side and alex is there right now and and that's
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.200]  exactly what you're seeing there isn't alex absolutely i'm about to walk up
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.440]  on the top of the grass you know and interview some of the folks up there
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.520]  but you're absolutely right it's key for people today tomorrow you name it
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.200]  to drive around with their cars turned up all the way
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.880]  around crowds of people with 104.1 where we have a 10 minute loop report that
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.680]  goes when we're not live but we'll be live
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.760]  this evening from about four to six o'clock with the march
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.440]  that's listed up on info wars dot com in the live jfk free speech
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:51.800]  page uh where we're going to be uh on uh this evening at four o'clock and then
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.920]  marching at five down here for free speech that looks like the
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.320]  establishment's backed off from now because they realize they don't want
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.800]  another tenement score on their hands they don't want to show the world what
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.040]  tyrants they are they don't want cameras seeing it
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:05.480]  they tried it they failed so far they tried last night they failed
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.560]  and i'm not saying all the police are evil but they're being they're being
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.800]  given evil orders and then we've got another demonstration of mara
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.600]  11 a.m and again that park is only about five blocks away and it's listed on
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.600]  info wars dot com and there's also a video on info wars dot com that has the
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.480]  10 minute recording on it that breaks all of that down
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.200]  that's called jfk truth radio 104.1 so that's what's happening here and again
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.440]  this is all about free speech this is all about the attack
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.280]  that's taking place on the uh first amendment
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.760]  and so we had to come here i mean just like when they're trying to restrict
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.160]  guns i do open carry marches in at the alamo with other patriots first
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.920]  amendment uh we've also got the second amendment tenth
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.600]  amendment fourth amendment it's all under massive attack
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.120]  and so that's why we're here to let them know that we're not going to put up with
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.480]  there's always a battle back and forth between those that love liberty
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.040]  and those that want to oppress and love tyranny they tried to say it was
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.400]  illegal to have these signs out here we're doing it so let's go ahead now
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.400]  and let's go on up here uh towards the grassy knoll and memorial that they
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.160]  built here and they've blocked it off so that you can't get behind the picket
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.880]  fence where the real shots uh were taken and they've got uh i think that's
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.880]  russian tv we ought to get some video with that turn
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.200]  around and just show this right here go ahead and get a shot of this i wonder
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.520]  what the foreign press is saying it'd be interesting to talk to them
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.720]  in fact when they're done we ought to talk some of the foreign press and see if
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.720]  they're as controlled uh as the uh level of media we have here where are you
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.800]  from bro belgium you got 10 seconds to talk to me alex

[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:58.440]  but i'm i i do not have to decide something exactly so as a researcher and

[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.800]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the

[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.840]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table

[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:29.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in austin we've got
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.960]  alex is in dallas this is the day before the anniversary of the 50th
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.000]  shooting of the 50th anniversary of the shooting of jfk
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.440]  and alex was just talking to a journalist from belgium
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:44.040]  and the guy really didn't want to have an opinion he didn't really want to know
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.000]  he said i'm a journalist i'm not supposed to know these things well
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.440]  i wonder if he thinks it's a story when the government
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.280]  censors information when the government hides information does he think
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.720]  that's a story alex what do you think
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.200]  well he finally admitted that he knows it's impossible for lee harvey oswald to
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.040]  do that and that the whole thing's basically a fraud but but as a quote
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.400]  journalist he wasn't going to say that in that capacity right uh he made the
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.720]  joke first he believed in santa claus but i have major breaking news and i'm
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.280]  not going to give away who it was it was a major of the big global three wires
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.800]  there's only three upi used to be one of those four but
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:27.800]  there's only three reuters ap and afp french news agency
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.880]  which is as big as ap worldwide they got reporters all over the place
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.320]  uh and i guess bbc is kind of a global wire that's big as well so there's only
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.760]  five or six minutes total i'm not going to say which one
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.320]  we've been interviewed by the dallas morning news the four we start telegram
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.240]  there's a whole bunch of newspapers talking to us
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.960]  during breaks and stuff and mainly gets you already doing the interviews
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:52.360]  i guess i'm alive on air and he spent some time with one of these
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:55.960]  reporters and this person we're gonna say male or female
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.920]  really spilt the means to him about what's going on
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.040]  and i've been told similar things like this years ago by ap reporters and
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.480]  folks that oh my gosh they really did kill this story
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.240]  oh my gosh they really did stop it oh my gosh this has never happened to me
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:12.520]  because they usually aren't doing politics or key
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.600]  events like we're seeing right here today and for the listeners we're gonna
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:19.560]  stop at the uh next hour david night will take over and take
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.760]  your calls and cover other global news and obama care and all the police
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.800]  state and the nsa things and even mainstream media admitting obama's
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.880]  acting as a dictator on so many fronts people are getting out of their denial
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.800]  folks it's not that obama is even the cause of all this even though i don't
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.960]  like obama the person i didn't like george w bush
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:42.120]  it's that it's just getting worse and worse the establishment is more naked
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:45.320]  when it comes to all this and is getting away with more but at the same time
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.640]  folks are waking up more so they just don't even care

[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.040]  constitution for holding a sign and daring to speak out
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.640]  but we're standing around i was speaking to a few individuals from the press
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.200]  but this one guy is one individual i should say
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.560]  was watching me for a while and he came up and he's kind of

[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:10.040]  and they wanted me to talk about how you guys are crazy conspiracy theorists
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.160]  for denying the official story and all of that stuff
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.120]  and he's like but i know that you did that protest yesterday with the signs
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.040]  and he's like is that really true that you could be arrested for having a sign
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:23.240]  and i said well yeah it is the actual police person told him in the dallas
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.040]  morning news in the dallas morning news and he says well yeah and he said well
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.760]  you know i'm not from dallas this is so amazing to me he's like
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.840]  did you see they're paving over the x where jfk was shot and i said yeah and

[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.640]  protect him because he's actually a good journalist
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.200]  he said i'm going to write a good piece about you guys
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.840]  said i'm going to do the best i can because they want me to come and just
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:46.200]  talk about how crazy you are for denying it talk about how the facts are on
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.000]  their side and how we're denying the government story he said i've never
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.360]  seen anything like this he said even just questioning the government now
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.960]  it's like you're supposed to be some type of lunatic he was sent out to defame us
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.640]  tell folks about it yeah exactly he was sent out
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.080]  to talk about how insane we were for questioning what 90 percent of the
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.280]  nation already questions but then his whole thing was wait a minute
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.240]  they're not even here about that they're here for the free speech issue
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.080]  he sees them covering up the x marks the spot on the assassination attempts
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:17.000]  he saw the police come like a phalanx troops from
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.080]  from ancient greek just marching up to arrest alex for daring to speak out
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.080]  yesterday we have that video we're gonna get up tonight look there they are
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.200]  covering it right now they keep talking but show the x look they're covering
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.320]  it they're covering the x and he can't he came over to me and he said you know
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.440]  i've been in this country for a while and i gotta tell you i've never seen
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.400]  anything like this he was absolutely blown away
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.080]  scared even and he was just telling me yeah they want me to go and make a big
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.160]  deal out of this say you're conspiracy theorist
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.360]  but i've been talking to you i've been following your stuff you guys are right
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.760]  on and i said you know you're actually a real
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.200]  journalist and he said well thank you the problem is being a real journalist is
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.920]  hard now because if i submit this story and actually talk
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.640]  you know about the reality of it they might not approve it
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.800]  so i hope to god that actual story gets out and hope he's not squelch because
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.600]  it's a major war here's a big secret i've been told by
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.040]  huge national writers they go look i like you i know it's true
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.200]  they're so evil above me that i'm going to write a super sarcastic nasty hate
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:14.360]  piece about you that'll actually backfire how's that sound i go i get it
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.480]  so the writers are smart and sophisticated and they're
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.080]  idiot bosses let them do it and then all the comments are against it
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.880]  so people are rebelling against this chelchescu kim jong-un crap
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.880]  on every front well they also know that gallup poll show less than 20 percent
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.240]  actually trust the mainstream media so they're also looking at it in a way i
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.000]  think he was also angling at the fact that he knows his career is dying
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.440]  and he's kind of angling he's damned if he does damned if he does or doesn't and
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:43.480]  he wants to really join in with us because this is the emerging new real
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.600]  media and he sees that he's a smart guy means a lot of these press individuals
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:49.480]  all of them filming us right now are pretty smart and they understand
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.280]  that their major corporations are working for the government funded are
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.880]  tanking and they're going under
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.680]  mean there's a reason they're also filming us because this is the reality
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:57.640]  of what's going on
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.520]  they're talking you know they're sitting around waiting around for the
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.720]  official story people to come out and tout their nonsense when we're actually
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.880]  making their waiting for the great and powerful
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.120]  laws to announce that
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:12.200]  lee harvey oswald did it and obama cares free and it works great and
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.840]  everything's fine the dollar's not being devalued and
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.800]  banker bailouts aren't a scam and everything's wonderful don't listen to the bad conspiracy
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:24.120]  theorists don't think for yourself i am the great and powerful
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:29.000]  odds of below cooperation in dollars and we've been covering this up for 50 years
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.080]  and you will get in line and do what we say
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.600]  but everyone's deserting them in mass mainstream media has got 16 percent
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:41.640]  approval rating in gallup 16 percent alternative media over 70
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.520]  and again they can't stop us internet censorship nothing
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.440]  i want more media i want freedom for my children i'm not in competition
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.640]  i'm in competition against tyranny to bring it down that's the mission
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.720]  that's the goal and it's exciting david night your take on this leon mackey
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.600]  whoever wants to pop in here leon we're gonna talk to david night in a moment
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.560]  great job holding that sign up get you already take over for
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:04.760]  uh... leon what is your take being here
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.840]  i can't believe we infiltrated that that was amazing and all the the
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.920]  mainstream media back here is that we got to go on public property
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:15.960]  oh my god the police let us on public property i'm not i'm not bashing you
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:18.840]  i'm just saying we should be able to go in there and do anything we want we
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.040]  should be able to go to the event i mean they shouldn't gate off the whole
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.120]  we should be able to shoot them out yeah we should be able to shoot them out
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:29.480]  i mean why do they only want dallas residents
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.680]  inside the gate it well yeah and i'm amazed that they just said well wow
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:37.400]  when the mainstream media they all kind of looked and pointed their cameras and
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.480]  went hey why didn't we get to get inside of it
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.560]  yeah they were all going why why are they in there my god
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.040]  because we don't follow orders no here's why they don't want to arrest us and
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.000]  give us the attention in fact i wish i wouldn't have left last night because
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.600]  that was a lowest level order to get me arrested
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.160]  and and that that was a lower level order uh... and i'm sure that they put the
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.120]  kibosh on it later but anyways uh... how long do we have till we got a
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.000]  break night we got about nine minutes alex you know
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.480]  let's go over here go ahead i'm gonna walk over some place but you have to make
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.040]  your point make it work a moment because they see me
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.680]  hi officers how you doing hi ma'am how you doing
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.760]  hi how you doing sir hey how's it going
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.240]  hi i'm alex jones can we shake hands what's your name
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.800]  hey chris we're broadcasting worldwide how you doing today wonderful
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:29.240]  you don't do interviews well we're we're just here hanging out because i heard
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:31.240]  there's an ordinance that we can't hang out
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.760]  or hand out flyers or or have signs is that true
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.560]  nope that's not true but the mayor the mayor said so
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:43.160]  talk to the mayor then wouldn't you oh he he oh he doesn't like what the mayor
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.360]  did he see the police are not enforcing what the mayor is doing
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:49.720]  that cop just gave me the look like yes we're not gonna arrest people
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.800]  for handing out flyers and that's why you gotta push tyrants folks
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:58.280]  is to make the police have a debate about following kim jong-un north korean
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.520]  level garbage you have to force them and push them
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.720]  so then in their own system and government corporations everywhere
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:08.760]  our own families we have to push for what's right
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.040]  so there's an internal debate about it and so that
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.160]  justice can then come out with a moral high ground but if you never take the
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.720]  field all you do is lose and that's what we're
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.840]  doing here let's talk to some more folks come on with me
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.600]  hello ladies and gentlemen good to see you hey officer how you doing i'm alex

[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:08.040]  there's some of the mainstream media um there is a statue of kim jong-un the
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.080]  grandson of the immortal founder of north korea
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.200]  and we are here at north korea on the trinity river
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:18.200]  in northeast texas ladies and gentlemen with all these thought criminals

[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.280]  something you know alex i have absolutely no doubt that if you were
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.640]  standing there by yourself without all those cameras around you
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.000]  they would have you on the ground beating and tasing you right now
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.360]  the show shows the importance of the first and the second amendment we saw
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.040]  that when we went down to the alamo we saw people rallying for the
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.920]  open carry down there and we saw the police leaving them alone and they
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.400]  had previously arrested several people for lawful open carry but when they had
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.080]  a thousand people down there doing open carry they left everybody alone as a
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.880]  crowd began to thin out that's right they came after
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.240]  individuals there's strength in numbers that's why people need to stand up and
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.920]  they need to come out and they need to protest the suppression of the first
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.920]  amendment now i agree folks elvis is here let's go talk to him
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:10.600]  absolutely you use it or you lose it a free people will be free

[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:03.640]  well it's just amazing and and this is nothing new we've seen that they've
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:07.640]  weaponized the term conspiracy theorist that was done in reaction to people

[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:13.000]  talking about the assassination and it's been three years now we still haven't
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.120]  gotten into court on it yet but the case is alive
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:19.640]  and you're one of the leading jfk researchers in the world
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.200]  that's what i've been told i'm just introducing you to the folks out there
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.640]  thanks alex get folks your website the website is jfkmurder.com
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.400]  okay now break down the essence of what's happened on the 50th anniversary
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.240]  coming up tomorrow i mean you're on national transmission tell folks what
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.160]  the the essence of it well very simply the city of
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.720]  dallas wants to keep people with our viewpoint out of delhi blaza
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.520]  they have taken a federal landmark and illegally closed it off to the public
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.760]  they're only allowing people in who they think ought to be here their own people
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:56.360]  and uh... they've allowed a total of five thousand people in
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.360]  they've had over fifteen thousand requests so there's gonna be at least
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.480]  ten thousand people that are gonna be disappointed
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.760]  it's amazing but they were threatening to arrest me last night now they've
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:10.600]  backed off handing out flyers what do you think's happened
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.200]  well i think that the bad publicity is finally getting to me realizing that
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.200]  they're living up to their stereotype and it's not a good thing for the city
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.920]  and uh... it's not a good thing for those who care about what happened to
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:25.560]  president kennedy what is their stereotype the stereotype is uh...
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.320]  back then in nineteen sixty three sixty four the city of hate
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.280]  well that's pretty much the way it is now they're
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:35.400]  they're trying to keep people out of here we've been dealing with this
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.600]  for the last forty nine years what is this bizarre
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.680]  patching up where they shot him and it and it makes it look worse it's bizarre
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.680]  it's like mental illness well nineteen years ago when i moved to dallas i put
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:50.840]  x's down in the street showing where the bullets struck first and last
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.280]  uh... and they've been down here in the for nineteen years now all of a sudden
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.800]  for the uh... event here they get they get they dug up the those parts of the
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.920]  street but before all it was was i guess paint or
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:04.200]  something why cut the whole street up make it look horrible it's like crazy
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:08.680]  well it gives them an excuse i suppose uh... what the sum what i represented
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.440]  the city said is they didn't want people tripping over the x
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:15.880]  which is about a millimeter deep what it was was tape
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.360]  was never a never uh... paint it was tape
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.560]  that's right tape but kind of like it's cooked down by the sun
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.160]  that's correct man i'll tell you uh... i'm still working on that film you're in
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.040]  it's gonna come out someday you're doing such great work with everything
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.720]  but i tell you i mean we've talked to international media major
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.720]  wires who've been told to demonize us for questioning the official liars
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.640]  and it's even freaking mainstream media out how controlled this is
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.840]  well you know that's what i've been dealing with out here in the plaza for
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.680]  the last nineteen years
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.800]  uh...
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.000]  the point is that the people you see all the people around here
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.120]  hundreds thousands of them they know the truth they know there was a
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.200]  conspiracy and they're here because of that
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.760]  the average poll shows eighty to ninety percent as you know don't believe the
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:59.960]  official story even the secretary of states come out and say he doesn't buy it
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.640]  because he knows how asinine it is to
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:04.600]  you know to say it does it they've lost the war to cover this up
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:08.040]  but we've talked to people here in the last few decades working with oliver
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.160]  stone here on the film
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.680]  jfk what percentage don't believe the official story
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.280]  well as far as i understand it is eighty five to ninety percent
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.040]  and they'd be greater than that that's what we see in the index of hundreds of
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:20.680]  polls
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.080]  that's true you know sometimes after the movie jfk was released it was much
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.280]  greater than that it was
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.360]  ninety five percent or greater
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:31.640]  uh... the same percentage of uh... of proof of conspiracy
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.760]  we're a top consultant on that well mister grudmer about out here tomorrow
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.040]  interviewing you live

[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.640]  the more it will rise
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.000]  operation liberty rising from jillie plaza

[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.640]  I'm David Knight I'm here in Austin and Alex
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.040]  is in Dallas and he's
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.160]  walking around reporting on the suspension of free speech the control
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.920]  of speech in Dallas
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.160]  Alex you there?
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.760]  absolutely but it didn't work it totally backfired almost everyone I've talked to
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.600]  does not buy into the official story
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.360]  and look you have the mainstream
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.240]  state-run media here give me shots of this Josh
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:42.600]  come on in here my friend
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:45.840]  a lot of the media following us you've got the state-run media all waiting to
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:48.240]  get their corporate talking points let's go down here
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:52.520]  you've got them all ready behind the grassy knoll behind the famous
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:53.560]  picket fence
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.880]  to fire their propaganda out worldwide
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.000]  against the people
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.240]  of the world I guess that bird right there didn't know that he had a permit
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:04.040]  to be back there and of course they won't give you a permit
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:06.440]  this is absolutely incredible
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.400]  this is absolutely amazing
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.600]  and so what I'm gonna do now is
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.960]  tell the corporate mainstream media that we are awake
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:19.000]  to their activities and that we are done with them and the people are
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.640]  aware of them reading off scripts
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:26.160]  and only putting out the official lie that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.360]  we are awake
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:31.200]  and we are here to tell you that the mainstream media is dying
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.520]  because the people know you are state-run corporate media
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.800]  bottom line you're a fraud
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:38.920]  and you're a joke
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.400]  and you're collapsing
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.000]  and you and the government will never shut down the true alternative media
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.320]  you're done
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.520]  and all your fraud is coming down like Humpty Dumpty
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.800]  the people are waking up
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.760]  to the corporate government-funded state-run media

[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:25.320]  that's great Alex
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.800]  I'm sure the mayor said he would clap anybody in orange did that
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:30.560]  that's right
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:34.680]  they put people in boxes at political conventions now and whenever they have
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.160]  a commemoration of the assassination they don't want anybody talking about
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.600]  anything other than their controlled media that's just amazing
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.360]  absolutely
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:45.280]  hey let me see if I can interview with this officer hey how you doing sir
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:48.800]  how's the weather today
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.840]  oh well I'm just an average slave
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.120]  who paces
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:55.360]  salary but actually writes me tickets to get that but
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.880]  we're here and the godlike police are here
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:00.040]  and though they're not talking to us
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:03.920]  hey how you doing today sir?
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.800]  good well here you are we're absolutely taking free speech back

[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:13.000]  we are absolutely with the fliers and everything else
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.880]  taking everything back
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:18.600]  and we are here the mayor said there's no free spaces in North Korea
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.120]  that it's the capital of North Korea and it's not it's Texas
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:24.880]  and there are a lot of good people in this town
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.680]  who don't want to be slaves so the police just act so upset I'm trying to talk to them
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.560]  because it's so abnormal
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.760]  so I actually want to talk to a god
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.520]  someone can ghostbusters when she says
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:38.400]  are you a god they go no
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.640]  then die
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:43.280]  because that's basically what's going on here

[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:19.880]  so far a lot of people are on the fence they're not sure if Oswald acted alone so
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:20.600]  to speak
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:23.280]  but now they're wondering why the censorship they're wondering why the
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:24.120]  barricades
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.680]  they're wondering what the government has to hide
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.880]  well the government has nothing to hide
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:31.480]  the government literally
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.880]  well the government goes to bathroom and creates gold coins
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:38.880]  I mean they made it to earth

[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.480]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm here in the studio in Austin
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.200]  Alex is in Dallas
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:29.000]  and he's got some information about what's going to be happening later today

[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.080]  well if you go to Infowars.com or PrismBlood.com you see the live JFK
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.000]  defensive
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.120]  First Amendment section that's got all the live U-Stream feeds
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:45.920]  we're not just here on the radio slash TV show it's got the backup feeds it's got
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:48.200]  the maps of where we met last night
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:50.520]  where we're meeting this afternoon and where we're marching
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:53.680]  at about eleven thirty to twelve thirty the moment of silence
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:55.280]  down to Dealey Plaza
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:58.200]  to basically dominate the corporate whore media
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:00.200]  and make them cover
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.160]  that people disagree with the official story
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:04.240]  because we have the facts and we have the evidence
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:06.680]  so that's why we're here to defend the First Amendment
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.760]  and to make sure that real history gets looked at
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.640]  and so again I know you and Jacarie Jackson are coming up in the next hour
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.920]  you got a lot of news
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:17.640]  open the phones up cover a lot of special reports we haven't gotten to
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:21.320]  and then tomorrow I'm gonna be down here live again and I'll be taking calls
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.880]  tomorrow really important we do that
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.760]  but again they were going to try to
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:29.720]  make us
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.280]  you know basically back off they were threatening to arrest us we left they
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:33.400]  came to arrest me
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.840]  today it's a different story because they understand
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.080]  that that will then backfire on them and we're not going to try to provocateur
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.840]  anything or be provocative so they do arrest us
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:44.120]  believe me I don't want to go to Lusterick it's a horrible jail
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.400]  but at the same time I will exercise the First Amendment
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.880]  and that's just the way it is
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.400]  and if they want to try to push us around well then they're gonna have another
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:52.240]  thing coming
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:55.840]  because we are not slaves we're not turning over our birthright a basic
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:59.720]  freedom of assembly and holding up signs in places like Dallas Texas I mean
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:01.080]  give me a break
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.080]  we have police on video saying you'll be arrested if you have signs anywhere in
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:04.800]  Dallas
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:08.200]  and now they're backing off and we handed out thirty thousand flyers
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.800]  and folks are listening everywhere
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:13.360]  to 104.1
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:16.560]  which will be up the next two days will be off by
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.960]  by Saturday afternoon
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.280]  when we pull up stakes and then go back south down to Austin
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:24.880]  but great job there writing shotgun
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:27.080]  for us David Knight
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.760]  and we've got a ton of news
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:32.000]  that is coming up but I'm here right now
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.760]  up on the grassy knoll right above where Kennedy
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.360]  got shot and there is the ultra bizarre let's walk down here
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.120]  there is the ultra bizarre
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.400]  scene of a steamroller
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.600]  of a roller
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.280]  they're literally
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.400]  uh... now paving over
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.240]  uh... the spots where they had access
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:52.480]  uh... where Kennedy got shot I mean look at that down there this is the
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.760]  bizarreness of when they put on one of these events
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:57.760]  they'll even plant trees behind the president or whatever they'll
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.000]  you know change things it's all about what suit they're wearing what they're
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  saying to make it look credible even though they're lying to you
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.480]  so this is the ultra
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.920]  bizarre scene
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:09.040]  with the big set with the big lights
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.600]  so the mayor can get up there and try to put himself
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.360]  on the national scene
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:17.320]  uh... it is just absolutely beyond asinine
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:20.480]  but this is going on they have a texas flag an american flag how it's
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:24.400]  patriotic to believe the official baloney story it is asinine
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.600]  this is also costing us a lot of money to put the team up here and do this
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.720]  we sell great products and info or store dot com books videos t-shirts

[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:24.000]  welcome back to the alex show show i'm david night here live in austin
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:28.880]  and we've just been talking to alex and dalis about the censorship that's going
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:35.200]  on there the control of the press the all alternative press only official
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:38.800]  press that are going to stick to the story only people that know the mayor
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.400]  the insiders only they're going to be allowed to go to this carefully
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:46.320]  orchestrated carefully prepared pageant there and i don't know if we still have
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.400]  that shot of what they're doing to the
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.000]  road there do we still have that shot guys they are look at that this is live
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:57.280]  there they're in the rain and they're paving over the road where the spot was
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:01.760]  we have activists who have put an x on the road where kennedy was shot
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:04.960]  now they were telling people and then and this is typical of the way they do
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.800]  this they have a preposterous explanation as
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.680]  to why they've got to do this i say that they don't want people to trip over
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.800]  the x well the x is a piece of tape on the road
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.640]  and that's typical of the kind of nonsense that people have been fed
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:23.440]  since this happened 50 years ago this is why there is a huge movement
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:27.040]  to find out what really happened this is why so many people don't believe the
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:30.720]  official story it was really a seminal moment when
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.160]  people saw live on television the president shot dead
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:37.360]  everybody that was alive knows what they were doing when that happened
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:40.800]  we also saw oswald get shot but we saw
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:45.040]  and a cover-up we saw lies we saw ridiculous stories being
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.760]  foisted on us by the mainstream media and they weren't really even aware
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.520]  of how ridiculous their stories were nobody believed them
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:56.640]  nobody's believed them and the more we look the less we believe them
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.800]  but they think that they can lie to us and as long as all three of the major
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:03.600]  networks would do it that everybody would believe them and there wouldn't be
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:06.880]  any issue but people can see through the lies just like we're seeing through the
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:10.560]  lies that obama is feeding us today just like we see behind the scandals
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.680]  of Benghazi we understand what's going on with obama care
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:16.480]  you can tell us that it works you can tell us that people are
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.960]  signing up and inflated numbers that tens of thousands of people are getting
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:23.920]  insurance we don't believe that even if it were true
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:27.520]  millions of people are having their insurance cancelled
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:31.760]  because it's not the kind of cat-like policy that the insurance companies want
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:34.560]  the corporate insurance companies are dictating this thing
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:38.880]  from the get-go people can now see that if you're a male and you're forced to buy
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:42.880]  maternity insurance for you and you're single and you don't have a wife you're
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:45.440]  forced to buy pediatric care and you don't have children
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:48.640]  people understand that that's a fraud being perpetrated on them by the
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:52.400]  insurance companies with the help of the government that's why
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.880]  the insurance premiums are doubling tripling in some cases going up by
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:01.040]  a factor of 500 percent and that's why the deductibles are going up
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:05.920]  so you got people that are seeing their insurance plans go up to be the price
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.520]  of a new car payment or maybe the price of their
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:13.120]  home payment and so they can't afford their mortgages they can't afford a new
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:16.960]  car it's taking down the economy it is a massive transfer wealth now there's a
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.640]  huge socialism aspect of this the transference of wealth
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:24.240]  and that was by design from a lot of people from the middle class
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:29.360]  to the lower class but that's not as much of a wealth transfer as a transfer
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:32.880]  from the middle class to the one percent of the one percent
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:36.720]  giant mega corporations insurance companies that are dictating this
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:40.960]  but alex is up in dallas because we're not going to take this
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.240]  this suspension of the first amendment we've seen this happen over and over
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:47.760]  again at political conventions they heard everybody into these pens they
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.840]  don't let anybody actually do any protesting the first amendment says
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:56.240]  so we have a right to peacefully assemble and redress the government for
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:59.360]  grievances well people in dallas have a grievance
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:03.920]  we're very much aggrieved about the fact that we've been lied to for 50 years
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:07.120]  and so he's up there taking it back and it's very interesting that
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:11.440]  after the encounter last night the police have now pulled back
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:15.280]  we publicized what they did last night when they came back they
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.440]  threatened to arrest alex they came back to find him he had already left
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:22.000]  they were telling people that they couldn't carry signs that they couldn't
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.760]  get within 75 feet of the road and so that was publicized quite a bit we put
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:31.520]  that over the website it's kind of gone viral and so today they took a very
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.160]  different approach today what they kind of did was
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.520]  the way they acted in san Antonio when we had the open carry rally they kind of
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.520]  pulled back they stayed cool until everybody started to leave and the
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.560]  last few people that were there really got hassled didn't they jacari i'm
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:48.000]  joined here by jacari jackson yes they did david and i'm
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.040]  glad you brought that point up because whether it's the current situation in
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  dallas or the situation we had in san Antonio or even the situation here in
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:58.880]  austin that south by southwest when our street team was told that they couldn't
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:02.000]  hand out flyers and so forth and bumper stickers free magazines
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.680]  lo and behold in the land of the free you know when people stood up against
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:08.400]  that and came out against it the police backed off
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.360]  yeah you know even even with a bumper sticker there oh okay okay alex we don't
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:14.240]  want to get sued you go out to san Antonio you know the police chief sitting
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.200]  right there he didn't like it you know he's standing right there in front of
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:21.120]  kit with his arms folded and you know but the with the fed standing next to him
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.240]  he didn't like it but he went through it we see the same situation right now
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:28.080]  going on in dallas they will take targets of opportunity
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.840]  if you do not stand up for your rights they assume that you're just a passive
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.600]  sheep and they will treat you like that and you're talking about sheep now
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.680]  this we reported on the story last night about the police chief in fort worth
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:42.560]  you know they were pulling people over drawing blood and saliva and all that
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:46.320]  stuff and a lot of people weren't aware that this was a voluntary thing well
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:50.240]  today the police chief may forget to get a doc him he came out and apologizes for
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.840]  the roadblocks you know just because it gets they denied that there were any
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:57.280]  roadblocks they had nothing to do with it there weren't any going on to begin
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:00.800]  with but then when it got enough press attention people came out said hey man
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.840]  this isn't right he had to come out and issue a public statement and just doing
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:07.440]  that just standing up against these people sometimes is enough that's right
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.480]  you know one of the first reports i did when i came here to info wars was
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.560]  drawing the analogy to a wild animal to a bear i was struck when we were back in
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:18.080]  north carolina we went to the mountains the pamphlet that they handed out said
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:22.000]  you know do not act passively to the bears you know if you if you try it
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.280]  certainly if you try to run but even if you are kind of passive and you kind of
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:29.120]  try to walk away and be quiet they might attack you so if you see a bear you
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  wave your arms you scream at him you act aggressive you throw stuff at him
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:36.320]  that's the way the government is the government is a predator
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.680]  the government will take targets of opportunity
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.440]  and it will we just saw this this week when we try to get information from the
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:46.720]  tsa they give you the runaround we saw it with uh
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.680]  with alex when he's trying to talk to the police they just stand there and
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.280]  won't even talk to him it's just amazing they talk all the time
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.760]  about how they're public servants they're not public servants
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:58.720]  yeah they take the day off and don't have anybody to replace
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:02.560]  absolutely yeah to fill you in on this story so uh so jacari and i were trying
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:06.160]  to get some information from the tsa and we're talking to we're trying to call
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:09.520]  them we're trying to talk to the tsa public information officer
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:12.960]  that's his job he's there to provide information to the public
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.320]  that's what he does he wouldn't answer the phone wouldn't return our calls so
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:19.040]  it's like let's take the camera we'll go down there we'll talk to him in person
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:22.240]  of course we get the run around several different levels finally they turn us
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:25.760]  over to the austin airport authority we get two or three different people
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.680]  there finally one guy takes it upon himself to come down and
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:32.320]  talk to us and he was really put out that he had to come down and he's a
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:35.760]  public information officer too he was what an inconvenience that he had to
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:40.800]  come down and talk to people like us and he just he would not get on camera
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:45.200]  demanded that we turn the camera off and dressed us down for having the audacity
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:48.560]  to ask questions of our lords and masters
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:52.160]  to ask the public information officer to give us some information we want to
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:55.280]  know are you going to be putting in these detention pods in austin have you
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:58.080]  got any plans to do this now he told us some stuff but i'm not going to go on
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:00.960]  the record i'm not going to say that he's fearful
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:05.280]  he needs to get this stuff approved by his masters at a higher level somebody
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:08.160]  that's high enough that they've got political connections that no matter
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.240]  what they say i guess they're not going to get fired so
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:14.320]  he wants our questions in advance and then he will
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:17.440]  pass his answers up to somebody get approved and talk to us give that guy the
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.280]  credit that he uh he did email me after we spoke that day
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:24.960]  and he said he passed our information on to the uh the regional director of tsa
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.760]  whoever that may be haven't heard anything back from them that's right you know
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:30.400]  because that's right that's how the cycle works
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:33.840]  he did his due diligence in the end but still you know the the circle keeps
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:36.720]  spinning well and it was amazing too because he said it was
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:40.480]  one of the busiest days of the year because f1 was uh formula one was ending
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:42.720]  here in austin and everybody was leaving at once
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:46.160]  i've been the airport when it's been busy and it didn't look that busy to me
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:49.200]  it didn't look like thanksgiving remember uh he said like yeah this is our
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:52.240]  busiest day of the year i was like more than thanksgiving more than christmas
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:55.360]  maybe it was busy that morning but by the time we got there it seemed like normal
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:58.880]  airport traffic nothing i'd never seen before well and of course lie that
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:02.880]  often the very first thanksgiving after they put in the naked body scanners and
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:05.680]  everybody's going to have the opt-out protest to shut everything down they
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:09.040]  just turned off all their procedures they didn't pad anybody down they turned
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:12.080]  everything on the busiest day of the year worldwide
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:16.000]  nationwide that's right so they knew that there was no threat
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.360]  they knew it at that time they knew it at the time that they were threatening
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:26.000]  texas we had a bill in mid 2011 to bring criminal charges against any tsa who
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.440]  were sexually abusing people at the checkpoints
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:32.720]  and that passed unanimously in the house as it was coming up in the senate they
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.320]  got a hold of but david do hearse who was uh got a lot of connections to the
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.000]  cia he's our lieutenant governor he worked for them for years for the cia
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.920]  before he became lieutenant governor and so they
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:47.440]  intimidated him and the people in the senate and they said
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:51.440]  basically we're going to enact a no fly zone over texas we're going to shut
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:56.000]  down your airports if you if you mess with the tsa if you restrict them in
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.280]  any way whatsoever at the same time they were doing that an internal memo said
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:05.120]  that the tsa knew that there were no terrorist threats
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:08.400]  against airports or airplanes being planned that the terrorists were pulling
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:12.400]  back and they were propagandizing recruiting and fundraising
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.440]  and so they were lying to the public telling us that they're having to do
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.680]  this this very dangerous thing to keep us safe they've got to
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:23.040]  destroy our liberties they've got to fondle and handle us they've got to
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:26.880]  treat us like slaves but it was all a bluff it's it's all
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:31.600]  security theater you know i'm sure the average tsa worker is a you know good
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:34.320]  hearted person who believes that they're you know really
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:37.520]  team america world police you know trying to keep the world safe but it's
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:41.120]  such i mean it's exactly security theater they get the plastic bags i'm not
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:44.960]  knocking because i wear a plastic bag but they don't they have very minimal if
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:48.080]  at all training they think they can read people's minds i'm not making this
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.720]  stuff up they have these naked body scanners they
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.080]  they're padding people down these guys aren't you know trained
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:58.000]  i don't know well it's the people at the top it's just like what we heard from
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.840]  this uh this reporter who came up and talked to anthony gucciardi and said
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:05.440]  i was told by my editors to come down and do a hit piece on you guys and then he
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.080]  came down he saw that what we were saying was really true
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.680]  that the city of dallas had actually enacted and was trying to enforce this
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:14.720]  ordinance saying that if you get within 75 feet
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:18.240]  of the road then you can be arrested you can't hold signs
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.840]  it was absolutely insane and he realized that that is and i want to i'm
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:25.920]  glad you brought that up talking about the distance between a zone
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.440]  right now in in the city of austin well i guess we can talk about this more in
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:32.080]  the other side but right now in the city of austin they're trying to have a
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:35.920]  fast food ban which bans any new restaurants or fast food
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.040]  restaurants and i'm not a gmo guy but from building
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:42.080]  near a school or public area where children may
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:45.840]  loiter oh there we go everywhere yeah don't worry they're going to protect us
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:50.000]  they're going to take away our liberties so they can make us secure
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.360]  you're not free if they control you if they control you
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:57.840]  you're a slave we'll be right back in the last 50 years
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:02.480]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:06.480]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:09.120]  world guess what else is in the halogen family
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:13.040]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:17.280]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:21.040]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:26.320]  table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:29.760]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:33.680]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean

[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:31.920]  but due to toxicity and aging it does not could glutathione be a missing factor

[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:25.200]  that's 800-259-9231 call in and tell us what you
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:28.160]  think about the censorship that's going on in dallas
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:31.760]  tell us what you think about the jfk assassination but primarily we're
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:35.200]  focused on this censorship the suppression of the first
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:38.240]  amendment the suppression of the right of people to peacefully
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:42.400]  assemble to talk about what their government is doing it's absolutely amazing
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:47.760]  now one of the key figures of the jfk assassination investigation was jim
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:53.760]  morrison and in 1967 he was allowed remarkably allowed to have a rebuttal
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:57.200]  on mbc for about a half hour talking about
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:01.120]  the ways that they had slandered his investigation trying to get to the bottom
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:06.240]  of of the shooting and so uh we've got a tape here of
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.200]  jim garrison and i want you to listen to what he says
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.720]  about this and see how this applies think about this in terms of what's going
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:17.440]  on today in dallas the people of this country
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:22.480]  don't have to be protected from the truth this country was not built on the
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:25.840]  idea that a handful of nobles whether
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:29.520]  located in our federal agencies in washington dc
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:33.360]  or in the news agencies in new york should decide what was good for the
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:36.560]  people to know and what they should not know
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:41.520]  this is a totalitarian concept which presumes that the leaders of our federal
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:44.800]  government and the men in control of the powerful press
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.760]  media constitute a special elite which by virtue of their
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:55.280]  nobility and their brilliance empower them to think for the people
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:58.560]  personally i would rather put my confidence
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:04.480]  in a common sense of the people of this country the truth about the assassination
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:08.720]  of the president has been concealed from you long enough
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:12.560]  those forces which are fighting so hard today
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:15.840]  to tell you that they have examined the war and report
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:21.520]  and that everything is fine and that our investigation has uncovered nothing
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:27.360]  are not merely going to lose this fight they have already lost it
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:30.640]  what do you think about that jacari have things changed much
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:33.760]  you know he made some very poignant points he said you know if they continue to
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:36.800]  perpetrate this lie they're going to lose and that's what you see going on
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:39.040]  exactly right now in the city of dallas and it
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:41.920]  reminds me of the interview you had like last night with gerald salente
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:45.760]  we talked to who was it uh mr connor connelly yes and he is telling his side
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:49.200]  of the story you know from his point of view and you know nobody believes this
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.920]  the polls are out nobody believes this official story
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:55.360]  they may not believe you know the crazy wild conspiracy theories but they don't
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.680]  believe the government's versions either but what it is is also a kind of
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:04.080]  totalitarianism kind of authoritarianism this is very frightening actually
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:07.520]  when i was looking at alex trying to just interact with the police there
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:11.680]  and the way they stonewalled him and just the it's just
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:15.600]  to me that that just smacks of an authoritarian totalitarian regime
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.600]  the fact that last night if anybody if you watch that video of when this
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:25.280]  smiling officer from the mayor's office comes up and you know is all smiles
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:27.440]  and time well you've got to go we're going to arrest you
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.720]  that was just incredible just incredible to say that you can't get within 75
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:35.360]  feet of the street that means that you can't go anywhere
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.720]  you know that it's like saying you have to have a permit to be here but oh i
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:42.080]  won't give you a permit you have to have a ticket to be here but you can't get a
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:45.280]  ticket that's what they did to copa was talking yeah talking to go but he said
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:50.800]  we tried to uh file our file our permit a year in advance and they wouldn't
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:53.760]  give it to us so then we started on the day of and then they said they were all
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:56.880]  gone it's straight out of a kafka novel
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:00.640]  okay it's just like kafka going to the castle and trying to fight with this
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.880]  bureaucracy it truly is a totalitarianism that is
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:07.920]  descending upon this country and we see it over and over again
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:12.080]  you know 50 years ago we saw our president assassinated
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:15.520]  and because we haven't pulled this in now we've got a president
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:20.560]  who is doing the assassinations they were ashamed of what they had done they
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:24.640]  knew it was wrong they knew they could go to jail 50 years ago so they tried to
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:29.360]  cover it up today obama the assassinator in chief
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.280]  can kill people anywhere in the world that he wants to buy remote control
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:36.800]  and he brags about it he talks about yeah we kill a lot of people yeah i'm
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:40.960]  great at killing people so this is the way that it degenerates
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:44.640]  and now we see that this is all coming home we've tolerated this
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:48.320]  in foreign countries we've allowed them to attack people
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:53.040]  without a reason they play the same kind of information control games the same
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:55.600]  kind of tricks when they want to start a war we
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:58.880]  say this oh we got weapons of mass destruction that's all these lies
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:02.480]  they keep going back to the same playbook they keep playing us
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:05.760]  the same way we keep letting them do that and now
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:09.680]  they are moving the tools of tyranny home and you know the thing about that
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:12.720]  david because you'll you'll bring up these things about how obama kills
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:15.920]  people and say well bush did this or clinton did that i'm not saying it's
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:18.480]  right for anybody to be doing this stuff i don't want any of these guys to have
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:21.360]  this power because let's say the next guy is a republican or
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.480]  whoever gets to and gets in office do you want him to have these same powers
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:27.280]  since you granted obama that's right that's right but we're

[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:06.640]  it's so much like we were just talking about what happened at the Austin
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:10.320]  airport but also what happens a lot of places
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:14.320]  absolutely but they just released a secretive
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.840]  FISA court document now do the words secretive and court decisions belong in
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:23.840]  the same sentence I mean with this uh transparent
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:27.840]  administration we have going on whenever I hear that it just makes me want to
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:31.360]  pound the desk secretive FISA court this is a court
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:34.880]  that operates without any oversight it operates without any
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:38.560]  argument back and forth as a single judge no jury
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:42.080]  no attorney representing the other side they make these secretive decisions we
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:44.640]  just had a a shot up there for people who are watching
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:48.080]  put that back up again this is the secretive court decision now you notice
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:52.000]  at the top it says top secret scratched out and then
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:56.160]  the litigants up in the top block there are blocked out
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:59.600]  go down to about page five and take a look at this this is what this
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:02.960]  court decision actually looks like this is nothing
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:06.880]  but giant black boxes redacted out of this now
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:10.800]  deep quote-unquote declassified decision it's not declassified it's still secret
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.720]  they still redacted everything a listener what this is is a document
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:19.600]  that has one sentence on an entire page the rest of it is just one big black
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:24.080]  block this is not even a complete sentence it says the government proposed
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:27.040]  to collect these categories of metadata from
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:31.040]  end of story end of story you can't see it so this is the theoretically
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:34.720]  released court decision and what they say this is
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:38.720]  if you look down through the decision you can see some of the information there
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.320]  and what the judge is saying is that all those that's been portrayed
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.640]  previously as technical violations and inverted errors the judge says the nsa's
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.440]  records of compliance with these rules has been poor
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:52.800]  has been poor in addition to improperly permitting access to email and internet
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:57.360]  data intended to include information such as to from the bcc lines of email
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:01.600]  the judge found that the nsa engaged in systemic over collection well that is
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.680]  understatement that is bureaucratic speech if there ever was any see we've
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.760]  got a situation where when you allow the government to censor information
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.440]  when you allow the government to openly lie to us to feed us improbable
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:17.040]  stories to tell us that they've got to in this case that's going on right now
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:20.880]  in dallas they're they're paving over the road where there's a little literally
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:25.600]  x in a they are literally steamrolling the truth about jfk that's right
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:29.440]  there's an x in tape and they don't want people to trip over this tape
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:32.400]  x is what they're saying the police last night they're so concerned about people
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:35.280]  stepping into the streets i don't think anybody's going to be standing
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.680]  in the street tripping over this x in the first place
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:40.400]  yeah they don't even want you there you're not even allowed to be there so
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:43.680]  why are they why are they covering this up i mean the bottom line is is that
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:46.320]  what they tell us the justifications that they tell us
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:49.840]  people look at this and say are you serious you've got an agenda
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:53.120]  you're not being honest with us it's an insult to our intelligence
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:56.560]  it's an insult to the bill of rights to their legal authority they don't have
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:38:00.720]  any authority to do this you know we we had 50 years ago we had the magic bullet
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:05.840]  okay theory of of jfk being shot now we've got billions of bullets and even
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.200]  though we'd link to the documents and we got documentary proof
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:13.120]  they pretend that those don't exist we were pushed back by the operation
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:16.640]  mockingbird people in both sides of the media realize that people weren't buying
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:19.200]  their version so okay so we do have the bullets even
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.840]  though we said we didn't but now they're just for target practice
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.720]  and what targets are they shooting they're shooting targets of pregnant
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:27.840]  women and little children and old men that's right you look like your grandpa
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.400]  that's right and the quantity of ammunition of course as we've pointed
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:35.920]  out many times is 20 years worth of the iraq war at its peak but let's talk to
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:38.800]  some of the callers that we've got here we've got jim in illinois we want to
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:43.040]  find out what you guys think about this jim are you there
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:47.840]  hello jim there yes yes jim oh yeah our pleasure to talk to you guys we've
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.440]  talked a couple of times well i'm i'm set up with it
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:56.320]  um i see it and uh try to tell people as much as i can
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:00.560]  you know that you have to say something even if it's just to your friends
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:03.920]  your families i can't stress it enough sometimes
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:07.920]  even myself who's been aware of all the stuff going on for a long time
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:11.360]  but a bunch of books on you just you're afraid sometimes of
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:14.240]  people looking at you're like you're some sort of lunatic but all they really
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.240]  have to do is go out the street and you know take a look at what's
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:22.640]  going on last night i was coming home from a open jam session and
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:26.720]  surprisingly i wasn't drinking i'm trying to lose weight
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.720]  and uh you know i saw right the center in mount prospect
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:34.240]  illinois and the reason i'm mentioning that is so people out in
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:37.920]  mount prospect can call the village and say hey we're spending a lot of money
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:40.640]  for these guys standing around at these checkpoints and
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.440]  you know they're supposed aren't they supposed to be fighting crime
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:47.040]  and yet we're the criminals i i see it so you know
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:50.880]  all i can do is tell you i'm with you guys i support you 100 percent
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:55.280]  and keep spreading the word thank you very much you know it's very important
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:59.280]  not to let them intimidate intimidate you not to let them
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:03.120]  get you fearful of being labeled as a kook as an extremist
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:07.840]  that has been the open technique the open secret of what the cia has tried to do
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:10.640]  with this from the very beginning they want you to think that you're alone
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:13.520]  you're the only person who thinks the way you do but i'll tell you even before
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:16.960]  i worked here at info wars i had a couple info wars t-shirts and i go
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:19.440]  out and oh you know alex jones you listen to alex jones
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:22.560]  oh yeah if you just go out there you'll meet like-minded people
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:25.600]  like they want you to think it's a minority of people you saw the crowds
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:28.560]  if you're watching on prince and planet dot tv that are out there with alex
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:32.000]  the crowds are the out there when we went to the alamo the crowds are out there
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.440]  we went to south by southwest bill de berg anywhere you go you meet people
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:38.960]  like-minded people so just don't be afraid that's the positive side of it but
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.360]  do not let them get away with this that the document has been declassified we
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:46.640]  can actually see what the cia was doing they were deliberately telling
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:50.560]  people to use these pejorative terms like conspiracy
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:54.960]  theorists to shut down the truth you know to argue from authority to say
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:58.560]  i'm an authority on this i've seen this you can't know just like we saw with the
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:01.440]  boston bombing and we see the governor coming out and saying well we saw these
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:04.880]  guys put the bombs down somebody oh you actually saw them well no i actually
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:07.680]  didn't see the videotape to me but the yeah it was
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:10.720]  described to me but i'm an authority figure so believe me let's go the next
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:14.160]  person uh mike and new hampshire mike are you there
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:17.360]  yes i am how you doing guys doing good what's on your mind
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:20.400]  thank you so much for taking my call i want to talk to you about a couple
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:23.360]  quick things you know they won't be pleasing over that
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:26.800]  that spot in the road there i hope somebody has a good sense to get the
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.320]  gps and and and go right back out and put tape over that's what the guy said
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:33.280]  yesterday i i can't remember guy's name but alex talked to him today and john
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:37.600]  ballon talked to him yesterday and he said he's been updating the spot with
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.880]  the tape he says as soon as those guys yeah wrote in as soon as growed in
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:43.280]  as soon as they're done with the row construction he's gonna go right back
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:46.160]  out there and put the x in the exact same spot that's right
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:49.840]  and you know that's a that's a great picture of what we need to do
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:54.000]  because they're constantly coming out and removing our freedoms taking away
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:57.040]  our legal rights and we have to keep reasserting them
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.000]  and that's what he's done he's kind of been the watchman on the wall taking
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:04.480]  care of this for decades are we going to collectively pick this up
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:07.360]  for people in dallas other people in dallas are they going to show up are
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:10.720]  they going to stand up for their rights or are they going to let the police
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.120]  intimidate them or the media intimidate them shout them down ridicule them
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:19.520]  don't be afraid of that stand up for that uh jeff in texas thanks for calling
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:23.920]  mike jeff in texas are you there yeah i'm here how you guys doing today
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:27.360]  doing good which part of texas you in are you uh close enough to say well you
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:30.800]  don't have to tell us are you close enough to uh get to dallas for the
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:34.480]  events today and tomorrow i really wanted to go there um i'm a disabled
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.400]  vet and i i take a lot of morphine so i can't drive but i work the guys and
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:41.200]  what you're doing and i wanted to go to the gun rally
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:45.360]  at the alamo but i i missed that and uh you know i saw an interesting
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.280]  documentary uh the other night with uh ruso the guy who
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:53.520]  directed the trading places on the irs and ruso yes
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:57.360]  yeah and he had that documented on the irs and this is kind of off topic but
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:01.440]  uh it's crazy that there is no law that says you have to pay taxes on your
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:05.440]  income but for some reason everybody does it
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:08.400]  just makes no sense after watching that documentary
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:11.920]  enough i've heard of people who are more adept in those situations they
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:14.320]  actually don't pay taxes and you know they're
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:18.240]  very uh proficient in fighting the laws the laws actually come after them
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:20.960]  yeah yeah and we actually saw that documentary i don't for wars i believe i
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:23.360]  know we've got some iran ruso documentaries i've seen them in the
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.920]  warehouse and that's an important thing you know a lot of
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:28.960]  people won't even if something is available on the internet you can give
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:31.920]  them a link you can tell them about it if you actually physically hand them a
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:34.640]  dvd a lot of times they'll watch it so that's an
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:37.920]  important way to wake up your friends and neighbors and that's
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:41.440]  that's what you have to do you have to go out there talk to people one on one
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:44.320]  and tell them that uh what's really going on tell them that you're not going to
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:47.440]  take this anymore and like jacari was saying you meet like-minded people
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:51.360]  that helps to reinforce the idea that you're not alone that was a difficult
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:55.120]  thing in the early years of the kennedy assassination
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:59.200]  we realized that we were being lied to on television i'm older than you so i was
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:02.640]  around when this was happening okay we realized that we were being lied to but
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:05.520]  there wasn't the internet there wasn't any way for people to connect with other
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:09.200]  like-minded individuals to say yeah that i think that's bs2
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:12.240]  and so it was that was even more intimidating we had the
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:16.800]  three networks who are reading off of the same script with Operation Mockingbird
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:20.080]  they're all reading off the same script telling the same official government
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:23.440]  story whatever the press releases are from the government they would pair it
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:26.160]  that back and give you the same information and so everybody's like
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.080]  well all of the news sources all three of them are saying the same thing
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:34.160]  so it must be true right that's the theory that you meet
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.120]  that's right you meet with people today rick and utah hey rick what you got
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:42.240]  hey yeah how are you guys doing today doing good really good that's on your
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:45.840]  mind yeah actually i had a comment i used to be a
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.520]  general contractor in ballast uh for ten years
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:53.840]  and uh one saturday afternoon we took our laser
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:57.600]  went out there to the x and actually shot up towards the
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:01.440]  theoretically the library window where the shot came from
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:04.720]  and for just an everyday guy that's absolutely
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:08.080]  physically impossible you'd have to be a world-class
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:12.960]  sniper to be able to pull a shot off of of actually the angle that that's at so
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.720]  exactly um you know i mean that's absolutely
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.360]  wrong so uh yeah many people have done that many people have done that they've
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:25.040]  gone out and shot lasers and uh i believe it's jesse vinter on conspiracy
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:28.800]  theory did a mock-up of the situation he's like nobody could do that
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:32.080]  yeah and there was actually there was somebody that i heard alex interview and
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:34.400]  i can't remember the guy's name but he was actually
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:38.560]  an assassin or assassin a sniper okay and
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:41.680]  he went to the texas book depository and of course they marked off that corner
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:43.600]  where you can't actually look out the window
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:46.320]  right but he could see enough of it that it's like
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:50.000]  he knew as a sniper where he would pick his shot and he said that would be the
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.360]  last place that you want to pick your shot because of the trees because he's
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:56.720]  driving away from me because there's a curve there he said where you'd want to
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:59.520]  shoot is where everybody says there was a shooting which was
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:03.120]  in the front as they're coming towards you where you've got more control uh
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:05.520]  was there something else you wanted to tell us rick
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:11.040]  yeah actually i did being from utah we actually started a petition here
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:16.160]  uh the our fusion center up here utah data center uses a million and a half
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:21.760]  gallons of water a day to cool that so we're trying to
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:27.440]  do a petition to shut down their water uh for that because
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:31.200]  you know i mean we need the water vagus needs water southern california needs
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:34.480]  the water and a million and a half gallons of water a day
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:38.720]  is a lot of water and so i'm just asking anybody that's in
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:42.000]  utah or anybody that's in you know lost
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.320]  vagus southern california um to to look up on the
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.320]  internet and sign our petition to shut down that water
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:54.160]  do you have a website do you have a actual website they can find that on
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:59.120]  uh you know what we do but i can't remember exactly what it is but if you
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.480]  just google in their petition to stop in and say
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:06.480]  water uh in utah it'll pop straight up you know that that's uh
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:10.400]  that's a great analogy rick because it's the way the government
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:14.000]  wastes all of our vital resources you know that people can get their head
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.960]  around that they can understand that they're in utah you need the water in
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:20.720]  california you need the water a million and a half gallons a day
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:24.480]  that's a tremendous amount that's the amount of electricity that they use
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:28.560]  is enough to power thousands of homes that's what our out of control
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:32.400]  government is doing to us everywhere they're impoverishing us all they're
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:35.920]  sucking up all of the resources whether it's financial resources whether it's
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:38.800]  electrical power whether it's water they're sucking
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:43.200]  everything into washington it's this gigantic black hole that's making
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:47.040]  what all power you know there's a real terrace that you know sitting around in some business
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:50.400]  suits and in the official government buildings well they're probably having
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:52.640]  to take a little bit more than a million and a half gallons of water right now
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:56.080]  because when it supposedly opened up they had all the servers caught fire
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:57.920]  yeah i don't know if we can believe that story
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:01.440]  all we can't verify that independently and all we have is the government's
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:04.640]  ward on it so it could be a total headache to make people think that it's
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.640]  not operational when it is operational but thank you rick for calling and uh
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:12.000]  people look that up and try to take action against that because it is
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.280]  it is an offense to us in so many different ways
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:18.960]  and and they're spying on everybody's information not even just americans it's
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:22.480]  everybody worldwide that they're recording our information and it's not
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:25.840]  just our metadata even if it were just our metadata
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:30.080]  that is not allowed under the fourth amendment exactly there isn't any
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:32.720]  exception there you know when you look at the first amendment it didn't say you
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:36.960]  have the right to peacefully assemble and redress the government for grievances
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:41.120]  except when you're within 75 feet of the street except when the mayor rules that
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:44.320]  it's a safety issue there's no there's nothing
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:48.480]  there's no exception to that they made it very plain and very straightforward
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.320]  because they were doing this broadly construing our rights
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:55.760]  and that's what the bill of rights are about it's constraining the government
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:59.680]  professors coming out like the professor who uh the school at kid went to
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.040]  recently came out and said we need to rewrite the constitution we don't need
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:05.840]  that second amendment anymore yeah yeah absolutely amazing
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:09.440]  yes he teaches a constitutional law class from what i understand
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:12.640]  yeah well there's a lot of them out there you know uh obama was a constitutional
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:15.520]  law professor no yeah okay so we know how that goes
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:19.040]  that makes it all okay okay frank and nebraska frank have you got some
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:23.040]  information for us our opinion well i don't know if it's
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:27.760]  information or not but well i'll take your opinion how's that
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:34.080]  all right well i'll give you a real stable datum that i found to be true
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:38.000]  the purpose of a president is not to wield power
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:43.920]  but to attract attention oh yeah i agree with oh yeah oh yeah 100% good point
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:47.920]  so you know now the other thing is is you know
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:51.440]  for a long time i've it's been a rule of thumb for me that
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:56.160]  you know when you hear the official story they're automatically lying to you
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:59.200]  you know and so you can pretty much say that
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:04.720]  anything the government or the news media tries to slam or slander
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:08.880]  is got to be good that's true you know but it's also
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:12.400]  when they feed you information that doesn't make any sense
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.280]  you ought to be able to push back against it and say that it doesn't make any
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:19.920]  sense i mean there's just this recent case in the uk about this spy in a bag
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.240]  you know they found this spy padlocked from the outside in a bag in his bathtub
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:29.280]  now this happened like three years ago and the coroner said a year ago that
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:32.480]  she thought it was foul play obviously but then the
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:36.560]  metropolitan police and the scotland yard just came out and said oh i think he
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:40.160]  did it himself but there were no who goes through that just to kill you

[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:50.240]  of the bag and that's exactly what happened in this particular case so when

[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:13.520]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:17.920]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:21.920]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:26.320]  are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase

[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:24.560]  do for your family you there's certain things that we can't get the government
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:27.120]  to do it seems like we can't get them to take the floor right out of the water
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:31.360]  we can't get them to tell us exactly what's going on with
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:35.200]  radiations exactly gmo's i mean we're fighting on that now there was just a
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:39.120]  story in hawaii they have enacted some legislation there to prohibit
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:42.320]  gmo there so we do have some bright spots here and there but
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:45.440]  overall the large companies there's not a lot that we can do
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:49.920]  on our own except to take these things into our own hands right jacarian and
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:53.360]  exactly what we need to do for our own families you know filter out some of
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:57.440]  the garbage and that's really what info wars is about here filtering out the
[02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:00.080]  garbage as far as info information war goes
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:02.960]  and we're taking your calls here in the last few minutes so we've got to the
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:05.920]  show we want to try to get through as many colors as we can and we've got
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:10.400]  james in florida james are you there on about
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:15.520]  freedom hey how are you doing good what you got i'm calling call about freedom of speech
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.520]  issues um yesterday on a radio show dr james
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:23.440]  garrow was on i know you guys have had him on the show over there
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:27.520]  his facebook and social media posts were taken down
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:32.160]  because he reported that let me just read you a quick line from it
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:36.160]  three individuals just saved 300 million lives in the past two weeks
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:38.880]  they saved 90 of the population that would have been dead
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.560]  if bathhouse bathhouse berry had been stopped had been stopped
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:46.320]  from using three nuclear devices against the american populace
[02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:50.720]  two army generals and one navy admiral whose duties included safeguarding
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:56.080]  oversight of nuclear arsenal obama ordered three nukes to be transported
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:59.680]  in a major breach of protocol and safety regulations
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:05.520]  of longstanding he wanted it now that's interesting because that's uh you know
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.920]  we did report that there were nuclear weapons yeah out of dais air force base
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:13.040]  we had inside source there that called us and we tried to get that out
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:16.640]  that's why it's important to have a free press whether or not you know we can
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:20.160]  we're certain of our sources i don't know about jim garrow sources i can't
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:24.800]  speak to the veracity of that story but we are absolutely certain of our source
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:28.320]  and when we put that information out there if they're planning something that
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:30.720]  is a false flag and we know that governments have historically done this
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:33.440]  over and over and over again before he died
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.960]  robert magnum arrow did what it did a documentary with
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:41.440]  a filmmaker the fog of war and he basically confessed to war crimes he
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:44.400]  said we if we'd lost we would have been tried as war criminals
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:48.240]  and he confessed to the fact that the uh gulf attack in was a staged event and
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:50.480]  we know over and over again that they stage events
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:54.000]  the way to stop it is to get the information out there and when we
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.640]  blow this information out there if it doesn't happen
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:00.480]  we're willing to take the hit and be called paranoid conspiracy theorists
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:03.840]  if we can stop something that we've got information on we are not going to hold
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:07.120]  it back we're not going to censor it and it's a it's a shame that they've taken
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:09.280]  his blog down thanks for telling us before we go

[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:35.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in austin and i'm joined
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:39.280]  in the studio with jacari jackson and we're going to go into overdrive here a little bit
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:43.920]  we've got a couple more callers here we've got bill rob and tony we want to clear out the
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:47.520]  caller queue because they've been waiting for a while and we want to know what they think about
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:53.760]  the jfk commemoration that's going to be happening tomorrow in dalis and about the censorship that
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:02:01.200]  is surrounding that you know it seems like jacari the more they censor us uh and are speaking out
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:07.120]  the more they want to know about us at the same time we see these articles uh on info wars today
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:13.760]  we have the nt nh tsa national highway traffic safety administration may mandate that new cars
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:20.160]  broadcast their location the number of passengers their direction and their speed right there we
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:24.560]  go for all the people who don't have navigation and other things in their car we want to be able
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:28.720]  to track what you're doing like tom tom does right now of course you know if you got if you
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:33.520]  look at google the way they know that they've got uh google maps has has uh information there that
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:37.840]  shows you when there's traffic congestion and slowdowns in different places well the way they
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:42.880]  know that is that they're constantly looking at the information from everybody's cell phones from
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:48.000]  everybody's tom tom's and gps navigation that's somewhat anonymous but they want to know even
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:52.960]  the number of passengers and there they want to know the speed they want to know everything
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:58.240]  about you because you are their slaves and we see this happening they're mandating these black boxes
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:02.720]  that may be perhaps the method by which they're doing this but we already see in another article
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:08.240]  from russia today that it's called privacy's worst nightmare it says company advertises that they
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:14.320]  have over a billion license plate records and they have these license plate readers all over the place
[03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:19.760]  and they are collecting the information correlating the information saving the information and just
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:26.080]  creating a total surveillance web this is an infrastructure for total tyranny haven't these
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:30.240]  people ever heard of the fourth amendment well you know i i got to say this just before we go to the
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:36.960]  call i back in the 90s when all of these license plate readers began and they started they said
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:40.080]  this is going to be a very efficient way to get people through the tolls they won't have to stop
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:45.200]  they won't have to handle money they'll just be able to drive through and we'll send them a bill well
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:49.680]  one of the first places that they did it because they have a very compliant population was in the
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:56.480]  netherlands and the people there fought against it because they remembered when the nazis had come
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:04:01.200]  through they kept dossiers they like to keep records on people just like the the germans did
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.440]  you know there's there's certain societies certain cultures whether they just love to keep all this
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:09.680]  information about everybody just because they can do it i guess but they had all this information
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:14.400]  about citizens they had done little three by five cards and they were packed so tightly
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:19.840]  together they had so many cards packed so tightly when the german nazis invaded into the netherlands
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:24.800]  they tried to burn those files and they couldn't get them to catch fire because they were packed too
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:30.080]  tightly well so the nazis got them and they had dossiers on all the all this information political
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:34.880]  affiliations you know who was jewish who wasn't what anything that they could use and the nazis
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:39.120]  got that and rounded people up so when they started this license plate reading thing they said no
[03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:43.600]  you're not going to do it mandated that it be anonymized now of course you know governments lie
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:47.520]  about that we've been told over and over again that things are anonymous when they aren't really
[03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:52.960]  but they were very very very concerned about that and this is what we see this is the kind of
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:58.160]  information that they were keeping at that time on those three by five cards is so incredibly
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:02.480]  primitive compared to what our governments have on us now they have dossiers on everything
[03:05:02.480 --> 03:05:08.080]  they've got biometric information on all of us and it's just the worst kind of nightmare we can imagine
[03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:14.400]  to wed a totalitarian paranoid government with this kind of technology and we've got to get
[03:05:14.400 --> 03:05:20.160]  together and we've got to stop this yeah exactly well let's go to let's go to phil in ohio phil
[03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:27.840]  you have some information for us an opinion like to share no maybe just an addendum uh
[03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:35.040]  given jacari we're talking about communicating with people and you guys do a good job but i got
[03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:43.280]  three that uh i think would counteract what the american people been dumbed down and brainwashed to

[03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:23.840]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[03:06:23.840 --> 03:06:30.320]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[03:06:30.320 --> 03:06:37.040]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:32.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david i fill in for alex i'm joined here in the studio
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:37.120]  with jacari jackson and we have some callers on the line we wanted to finish out those callers
[03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:41.840]  this is going to be our last segment of the show we have robin main tony and michigan
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:46.080]  and we were just talking to phil and he had three points that we was about to make and i was really
[03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:50.160]  anxious to hear those points but we had to go to commercial break and he dropped off so we're
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:58.080]  going to go to robin main robby there yeah hi i hope i don't cut out on you but uh the signal is
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:04.560]  bad here so uh do you guys know of the theory about the greer the driver greer shooting the
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:09.120]  president there are many theories i've heard that one but why don't you tell us more about it
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:17.520]  have you seen the videos uh the brooder film and seeing that happen oh yeah yeah we've seen that
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:24.800]  yeah uh drive to that or well you know i i've heard people say that they thought that uh
[03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:30.320]  the driver shot him or even that jackie shot him there there's some out there that i i really
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:36.480]  don't find credible but that's the point is that we should have a free and open investigation of
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:42.240]  this and just as i was pointing out at one segment we talked about the spy in the bag that uh they
[03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:46.160]  claim scotland yard claims after a three-year investigation that this guy they found dead in
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:51.600]  a bag had locked from the outside where there's no fingerprints or dna of his on the outside of the
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:58.160]  bag no fingerprints or dna on the hadlock they claimed that he locked himself in and died
[03:10:58.160 --> 03:11:03.040]  accidentally that's just not credible so when you're doing a murder investigation there are
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:06.960]  going to be a lot of theories that come up people can brainstorm about a lot of things no matter how
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:12.400]  absurd they sound but you have to start ruling out the things that don't make any sense and i would
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:17.440]  not i i don't see any evidence looking at the brooder film that he was shot by somebody in the
[03:11:17.440 --> 03:11:22.480]  car whether it was a secret service guy or whether it was jackie i also don't see any evidence that
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:29.360]  he was shot from the by a loan shooter out of the bank depository i or the uh book the bank
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:33.440]  deposit the bank depository i don't see any evidence of that either i don't find that to
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:39.120]  be a credible story so of all of the conspiracy theories i find that to be not credible there
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:44.880]  are credible stories and jim garrison and others have investigated this and and uh you know there's
[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:49.120]  a lot of different theories out there i encourage people to do their investigation but the central
[03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:56.080]  point the central point is that the government has tried to control this with an absurd narrative
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:01.200]  from the very beginning trying to shut down any other theories from the very beginning and they're
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:07.600]  still doing it in dallas today they're still trying to shut down any free speech any investigation
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:12.800]  any questioning of this official story no matter how absurd and that's what we're there about that's
[03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:18.240]  why alex is there with a crew that's why he's speaking out against this because we need to have
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:22.960]  an open and transparent society and in order to do that we need to be able to have openness and
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:28.240]  transparency and murder investigations of presidents no way definitely uh well thank you
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:33.920]  for calling rob uh tony and michigan tony are you there hey i appreciate you guys going over time
[03:12:33.920 --> 03:12:40.400]  taking my call that's fine what you got um well a couple things you know a few people have called
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:46.080]  in and they bring up you know we harby oswald couldn't make that shot and i understand that some of
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:50.560]  the people were saying you know they have experiences uh sharpshooters and the military
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:55.840]  themselves were now but i think you know as a group maybe stay away from stuff like that because
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:13:00.080]  it's kind of subjective and they can put you know somebody up there that could make the shot
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:05.920]  50 years later the trees might be different all that stuff is so subjective and takes you down
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:11.040]  like the rabbit hole of like well could he when you can look at things like i believe it was the
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:18.320]  new zeal and new service that actually reportedly harby oswald's name as the assassin before he was
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:23.840]  arrested which is the equivalent of the world trade center southern building being reported
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:29.440]  as falling down by the bbc lady while it was still there behind her in a live shot and when
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:35.280]  they tried to cover that up saying it was a loop the bbc producer blew it and said no that was a
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:40.880]  live shot so you know i think it was new zealand it might have been australia alex could probably
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:45.760]  talk about that tomorrow but that's a fact you can look at the time it was put out and say how
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:52.080]  is that possible right there there's no debate it may lead you to questions but there's no debate
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:56.000]  that if his name was put out on the other side of the world before he was even arrested in that
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:14:01.600]  theater for shooting the police officer then clearly there was a conspiracy and then the other
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:07.360]  thing is uh one of the great documentaries i saw which was kind of put i don't know who put it
[03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:13.040]  together it's called bush jfk2 and it shows you all the connections between the bush family
[03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:17.760]  and the jfk assassination and what went on years later with jerald ford and bush being appointed
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:23.440]  to the head of the cia and i found it interesting and maybe if st john hunt never comes out again
[03:14:23.440 --> 03:14:28.640]  the one person that his father didn't mention and all the people he did mention was george bush
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:34.240]  which is very interesting because as you know it was in jadger hoover's declassified papers that
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:42.320]  george bush and e hollard hunt flew from dallas on the evening of november 22nd 1963 after the
[03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:47.680]  assassination and met with jadger hoover and private george bush denied that it was him
[03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:52.560]  saying well that must have been some other george bush i was never in the cia and then of course
[03:14:52.560 --> 03:14:58.080]  years later warren commission member jerald r ford appoints him the head of the cia which is just
[03:14:58.080 --> 03:15:03.840]  all a big coincidence of course again facts you can look at rather than subjective and i think
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:08.720]  there's plenty of facts they may lead you to questions where theories might have to come in
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:13.680]  because we don't have the answers but whether or not oswald can make the shot to me you know
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:17.520]  there's a plenty of evidence that oswald wasn't even the shooter in that building and there was
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:21.280]  one in there so i believe there's somewhere in the warren commission where they actually talk
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:26.240]  about the assassin another person how he escaped from the building it's in the warren commission
[03:15:26.240 --> 03:15:32.160]  it's 26 volumes uh the gentleman that was shot in the face by the fragment that alex interviewed
[03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:37.840]  the other day talked about that so i mean people do know these things but i just you know it kind
[03:15:37.840 --> 03:15:43.680]  of frustrates me sometimes when things get focused on it just allow them you know i think
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:49.440]  you know the dalis mare kind of looks at this as like a super bowl news event and yeah it comes out
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:53.840]  as tyranny but he's like well you know i got to control this because here i am on the stage i'm
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:58.480]  i'm the controller of this event and i don't want to be embarrassed whereas the people that
[03:15:58.480 --> 03:16:02.480]  actually committed it i think they kind of get off on people talking about it because then they
[03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:08.640]  can use that like you said weaponized term conspiracy theorist and there's so many out there and one
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:14.160]  other quick thing i want to mention um another uh book that's very interesting and factual is
[03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:21.600]  dr mary's monkey about the brilliant young teenage scientist who they attempted to assassinate who
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:27.520]  worked on putting uh cancer and viruses under the guise of killing fidel castrow and they actually
[03:16:27.520 --> 03:16:32.800]  used lee harvey oswald to pretend to be her boyfriend which he was very young in new ireland
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:38.320]  and that's all true and that's hardly ever discussed yeah i believe uh darin mcbreen covered that book
[03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:43.600]  dr mary's um dr mary's monkey yeah like you said there's a lot of information and i i do agree
[03:16:43.600 --> 03:16:48.240]  that sometimes you should expand beyond just you know can can this guy make this shot from this
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:52.720]  angle but you know you don't want to discredit anything without you know really looking into it
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:56.160]  but i do agree with what you said there collar one of the things that jim garrison pointed out when
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:00.800]  he had that uh when he defended his investigation one of the things that reasons he was doing the
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:07.280]  investigation when he said that they interrogated lee harvey oswald for 12 hours and yet there was
[03:17:07.280 --> 03:17:15.600]  no record of any of the interrogation really i mean that just that is things okay and exactly
[03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:20.880]  that is not credible you know that something is being covered up that wants if you understand
[03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:25.760]  things like that and he also mentioned the fact that they had so many fires on documents they even
[03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:32.160]  went to the absurd extreme of saying that one of the documents caught fire and burned up when they
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:38.480]  were faxing it you know i mean i mean yeah they accidentally set fire to all these different papers
[03:17:38.480 --> 03:17:43.280]  they had classified documents which at the time you could say okay well maybe there was uh you know
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:47.840]  maybe we should uh let these things remain secret but the cia had all these classified
[03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:53.520]  documents about their their interactions with lee harvey oswald now they could have at least
[03:17:53.520 --> 03:18:00.400]  put out a redacted version of that but here we are 50 years later 50 years later and we're still
[03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:06.640]  not allowed to see those documents that's the kind of thing that stinks basically we know
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:10.400]  that there's something here that is they're not being honest with us they're not being transparent
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:16.320]  to us and we see them again as we mentioned before they lie openly about all the current
[03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:20.720]  events that are happening and ben gazi and elsewhere with the seal team six with the
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:26.400]  boston bombing we've caught them in so many if fasten furious i mean we can't think of all the
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:31.040]  different ways that they've lied to us on a short amount of time because we couldn't make an exhaustive
[03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:37.120]  list is so uh so many times that they're they're just outright lying to us about the obama care
[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:41.680]  situation for example that is one where the credibility of the administration or as i like
[03:18:41.680 --> 03:18:47.040]  to call them the regime is just in free fall over that and they realize that oh yeah absolutely
