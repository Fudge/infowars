[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say,
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:37.000 --> 00:57.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  The document begins by promising to restrict the WHO's authority just to pandemics.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  Calm down, it's just pandemics.
[01:05.000 --> 01:14.000]  WHO Secretary to play the leading, convening and coordinating role in operational aspects of emergency response to a pandemic.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  So don't get paranoid.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  Someone seems to coordinate the pandemic response globally because it's a global problem.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  Got it? Settle down, conspiracy nut.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  But here's the catch.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  The World Health Organization gets to define what a pandemic is,
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  when a pandemic is in progress, and how long a pandemic lasts.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  Then you read the fine print and you realize WHO will have total authority over emergency operations in the United States
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  if there is ever a, quote, public health emergency.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  What qualifies exactly as a public health emergency?
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Well, they don't define that.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  But they get to, they get to decide what a public health emergency is.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  The White House eliminated a provision that would have required the World Health Organization to, quote,
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  consult with an attempt to obtain verification from the state party in whose territory the event is allegedly occurring in.
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  So as originally written, they couldn't do anything without the permission of their member country's governments.
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  But thanks to the change that the Biden administration put, pushed, effectively there is no limit at all on WHO's power.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  It provides that every member country in the WHO must, quote,
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  inform WHO about the establishment of its national competent authority responsible for overall implementation of the HR
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  that will be recognized and held accountable.
[02:34.000 --> 02:44.000]  So they're going to get to censor anybody who doesn't agree with what they do as they control the intimate details of your life.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  And they will control those details.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  Under this treaty, the World Health Organization will get to establish vaccine passports and regulate travel.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.000]  World Health Organization will, quote, develop standards for producing a digital version of the international certificate of vaccination in prophylaxis.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  Okay.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  So you may be thinking, well, it's just about COVID and I went along with mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports at the time.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  How bad could it be?
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  First off, if you went along with that, you should be repenting right about now.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  You've got so many people talking about it.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  They are going to come in and tell you, not ask you, but tell you when your pandemic starts.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  What does that mean?
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  Does that mean and people obviously have a lot of questions about this?
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  What's going on?
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  For countries that don't abide by obligations set out in the pandemic treaty,
[03:35.000 --> 03:46.000]  Dr. Tedros has suggested that the WHO may need the authority to direct other countries to sanction non-compliant countries that don't want to impose restrictions.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  They could dictate how our doctors can respond, which drugs can and can't be used, or which vaccines are approved.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  We would end up with a one-sized-fits-all approach for the entire world in a pandemic.
[03:59.000 --> 04:07.000]  One-sized-fits-all response to a health crisis does not work across a single country and certainly not across the entire globe.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  This has been the issue of this thing.
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  You can dig even deeper into it, but what it comes down to is lockdowns, border crossings, vaccine mandates.
[04:18.000 --> 04:28.000]  All of this could potentially be controlled under the international health regulations, under an international treaty, not up to the countries themselves.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  The critical attack is imminent, imminent. It's going to happen.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem,
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[04:47.000 --> 05:01.000]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[05:01.000 --> 05:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra-12, the highest quality B-12 you're going to find on the market, has been sold off for many months,
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  but now it's back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[05:10.000 --> 05:19.000]  Now, in the next 45 seconds, I don't have time to get into vitamin B-12, but do your own research and realize when it is organic, high quality vitamin B-12,
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  it energizes every other vitamin mineral in your body and all of your hormones and so much more.

[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  infowarstore.com has Ultra-12 back in stock, and despite the fact it's back in stock, despite the fact it's sold off very quickly,
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  it is 40% off for a limited time.

[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:43.000]  All right, my friends, it is Friday, May 20th. The year is 2022, and we are going to break here today, starting now,
[06:43.000 --> 06:53.000]  the biggest news of my 28-year history, and we saw this coming months ago. We can have the archivist, which haven't directed him to do yet,
[06:53.000 --> 07:01.000]  go back to the dates. This was announced last year, and then at the start of 2022, and show when Bill Gates said it,
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  and then show when I made the warning. But now it's happened.
[07:06.000 --> 07:16.000]  And the nakedness of this, the openness of this, when it all crystallized for me yesterday morning,
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  and I started going in and pulling out the research we'd already done and already covered in hundreds of shows,
[07:21.000 --> 07:29.000]  I, for the first time in my life, could not do the first 20 minutes of the show, as you saw.
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  I mean, I could not even come on air with it, because I knew I needed to pull all the documents and even more articles
[07:36.000 --> 07:44.000]  and then spend a lot of time looking at it again, and then thinking about how do I come on air and eloquently really cut through all the clutter
[07:44.000 --> 07:52.000]  and all the BS for all of the general public that's listening and for some of the very important people that listen to this show as well.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  Leaders of governments, heads of intelligence agencies, billionaires, heads of major companies, members of Congress.
[07:58.000 --> 08:06.000]  But most importantly, you, this giant audience of activists that can get through the sensors and get this information out.
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  Now, this is so big that if you just mention it or talk about it, it doesn't do it justice.
[08:13.000 --> 08:20.000]  And so the best way to start with this is this way.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  If you remember three years ago, we said the UN is going to release some type of bio weapon, probably a SARS COVID type, that's what they're cooking up.
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  We already had the documents then. They were up there bragging on C-SPAN, Peter Dazik and Fauci that a big imminent thing was about to happen.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  It would change the whole world and blow up the FDA system and other systems and allow them to just get things approved instantly.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  And it would be mRNA. We played all those clips.
[08:45.000 --> 08:54.000]  And then later clips came out that I didn't know about that they'd said in 2019 about, yeah, we spliced all these viruses together and they described COVID-19 perfectly.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  And then we got the documents the last year and a half from people that had worked with them that released the emails and it came out in court.
[09:02.000 --> 09:13.000]  That they specifically made COVID-19 a bunch of other even worse viruses and tried to get the Pentagon to sign on to them releasing it into the open air in China.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  And the Pentagon, this is in the London Telegraph folks, this is in the Associated Press now.
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  The Telegraph covered it in great detail, said that'll be war with China if you do that.
[09:24.000 --> 09:34.000]  So the reason I'm raising all that and the emails we showed and the articles and the video clips of them bragging beforehand is huge.
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  And that all came out and gained a function and Fauci lying and it all just kind of blew away and people went back to sleep.
[09:41.000 --> 09:56.000]  Now, what they've done this time, the very same damn people is so transparent, so pre-planned, so absolutely admitted that it is staggering.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  And again, if you're a radio listener, we're putting articles on here documenting everything I'm saying.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  So be sure you go to the archive later if you're not watching this live, if you're driving a truck or at work or whatever,
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  tonight you'll find the archive of this live show at Bandai Video and watch it for yourself, research it for yourself, because this is life and death.
[10:14.000 --> 10:23.000]  They're not just releasing new deadly viruses, they're not just going to have new lockdowns and global social credit scores and global IDs and global carbon taxes.
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  They're not just going to shut the economy down and make you go bankrupt onto a universal income so they can control you and dictate your life.
[10:32.000 --> 10:42.000]  They have used our bodies as the engines to create the spike protein and infect others with a nanotech virus on record they made.
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  We just put the London Telegraph article up about it, the synthetic spike protein that replicates the body that can spray on you.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  And it doesn't act like a regular virus, it doesn't mutate, it just keeps replicating the poison and they released a bunch of other viruses as well.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  So we have that backdrop. Now let's move into what's currently happening.
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.000]  The UN starts their meetings on the 23rd of the 28th in Switzerland in Geneva.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  They signed a deal two weeks ago that the World Economic Forum will direct them, so private corporations are now in direct control of the UN.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  They say the treaty is secret, but Tedros and Gates, we played the clips all over the news, have said yes,
[11:24.000 --> 11:34.000]  Biden has gone in and gotten a copy of the treaty and has demanded that the UN be given power over nation states to sanction, even with military operations,
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  anyone that doesn't follow the UN's orders.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  So this is a world government treaty putting the UN in control of the major western militaries to enforce the new lockdown that will make the last one look like,
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  walk in the park even compared to what you saw in places like Australia and New Zealand and Canada.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  So you have that going on and what is their pretext going to be?
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  And that's the new big story.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  And this has been going on for a few weeks and back last year and earlier this year, I said it over and over again,
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.000]  I said these criminals always telegraph what they're going to do to hide it in plain view and to be confident to their criminal armies
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  who are involved in this that they're going to get away with it.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  This is what psychos do. They love to brag.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  So that's basic criminology.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  That's why in all the supervillain cartoons and Marvel cartoons and James Bond movies, the villain always monologues.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  And you think, why do they monologue?
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  Well, because that's actually what villains do.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  When Lex Luthor has got Superman tied up with Kryptonite, he walks around and brags about it.
[12:41.000 --> 12:49.000]  They put that in fiction because that's how real criminology works.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  That's why Dr. Evil looks like Dr. Evil.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  That's why Dr. Evil looks like Klaus Schwab.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  That's what they look like.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  That's how they talk.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  That's who they are.
[13:03.000 --> 13:11.000]  Literal James Bond archetype specter supervillain.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  So let me make the announcement and it's already all over the place.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  Everybody's already figured it out.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  I wasn't ready to hit it yesterday because I wanted to spend hours last night and hours today going over it.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  And I've overdone it as usual.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  I've got hundreds of documents, studies, all the damn proof here.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  And when I'm sitting here reading this in private, I mean, I'm not even angry at these people anymore.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  My cells, my guts, my brain, my soul is, you're going to stop these people, Jones, or you're to blame.
[13:37.000 --> 13:46.000]  I'm pissed at myself when I'm reading this because I've got clips of Gates bragging last year that they'll soon be smallpox and monkeypox
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  and giggling and laughing and say, the next pandemic will be far worse.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  Then they put in all the orders for the new monkeypox vaccine.
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  Biden just bought tens of millions of doses yesterday and then magically right on time, right as the vaccines delivered,
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  monkeypox pops up in more than 20 countries all over Europe, all over the U.S., all over everywhere,
[14:10.000 --> 14:17.000]  where you have people taking AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca, and J&J.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, because what is AstraZeneca and J&J?
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  They're virus vectors that inject the genome of a chimpanzee into your cells
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  and then orders your cells to replicate under those orders using a virus to deliver the package.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, did you hear what I just said?
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  And we saw this last year, I said Gates is preparing to release smallpox and or monkeypox.
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  Then the FBI in some storage facility at a lab that was shut down finds smallpox in a refrigerator.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  They're just putting that out there.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  Then a truck crashes in Pennsylvania with a bunch of monkeys that have monkeypox and then the woman gets it, but it all gets shut down.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  Do you believe any of this?
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  Oh, a truck dumped over.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  Yeah, that's where, so they're laying the groundwork. Gates says smallpox, monkeypox is coming.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  They start making the vaccine.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  He says terrorists are going to release it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  He's right. He's the terrorist leader, James Bond villain.
[15:22.000 --> 15:32.000]  And then all hell breaks loose right as the UN Global Treaty is about to be signed on to by the countries that puts us under UN control.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  I mean, it's all premeditated.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  It's all pre-packaged.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  It's all in your face and it's all right here.
[15:40.000 --> 15:50.000]  Unbelievable because the virus they use to inject the chimpanzee ape DNA is what causes smallpox.
[15:50.000 --> 15:59.000]  They're injecting people with a damn smallpox knowing it would cause smallpox.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there that turbocharge and boost our stamina, our energy, our libido that are also amazing pre or post workouts.

[18:25.000 --> 18:34.000]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root and more.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  This product is incredible.
[18:36.000 --> 18:44.000]  The info wars immune support exclusively available at infowarstore.com is funding the tip of the spear, the info wars operation.
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  It is a 360 win. The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action. Take action now infowarstore.com.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[19:05.000 --> 19:17.000]  If you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function, deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS viruses.
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  There's nothing about SARS like viruses and if the research funding pause, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stops sign, you stop, you look both ways and then you proceed.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[19:38.000 --> 19:44.000]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[19:59.000 --> 20:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:08.000 --> 20:23.000]  Music
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.000]  Dr. Peter McCullough will be here at 1230 Central for an hour and a half with a special guest with him.
[20:29.000 --> 20:42.000]  The layout, huge breaking news and information about what's really going on with COVID-19 and the new UN global government planetary lockdown digital ID market to be system that is being launched.
[20:42.000 --> 20:52.000]  Now, next segment, I'm going to crawl through and just show you these studies and these mainline headlines and the documents of what I'm about to lay out right now.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  And I'll start getting to some of it in a moment.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  But if you just tuned in, you need to call your friends, your family, your neighbors, everybody you know.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  Because Gates has said in the next pandemic, which they've already launched, ahead of the midterms, it's building now.
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  And just like you didn't hear much at first in China, then it got huge. It's already begun. It's monkeypox.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  And they told you it would be smallpox, monkeypox.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  They knew that their so-called vaccines would cause this.
[21:19.000 --> 21:30.000]  And they preordered the monkeypox vaccine. Biden just got delivery of a bunch of it yesterday. It is going down.
[21:30.000 --> 21:38.000]  Now, here's Bill Gates last year talking about terrorists that are going to release smallpox.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  And I'll show you the dates and the articles in a moment.
[21:40.000 --> 21:48.000]  And we'll go to another clip here of Gates in 2020 saying the next pandemic will get attention this time.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  And here he is, the guy involved in masterminding all of it and quarterbacking it.
[21:54.000 --> 22:01.000]  The man that says he wants to depopulate you and your family, who's sworn that his own life, going back to his grandfather in Planned Parenthood.
[22:01.000 --> 22:10.000]  Here he is, letting you know what's coming next.
[22:10.000 --> 22:23.000]  And so I'm hoping in five years I can write a book called We Are Ready for the Next Pandemic. But it'll take tens of billions in R&D that the U.S. and the U.K. will be part of that.
[22:23.000 --> 22:35.000]  It'll take probably about a billion a year for a pandemic task force at the WHO level, which is doing the surveillance and actually doing what I call germ games, where you practice.
[22:35.000 --> 22:45.000]  You say, okay, what if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports? How would the world respond to that?
[22:45.000 --> 22:54.000]  There's nothing to really cause epidemics and bioterrorism to cause epidemics that could even be way worse than what we experienced today.
[22:54.000 --> 23:01.000]  And yet the advances in medical science should give us tools that we could do dramatically better.
[23:01.000 --> 23:14.000]  So you'd think this would be a priority. The next year will be where those allocations have to get made, including this global pandemic task force.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  Which is the UN Global Treaty that takes over all the nation's sovereignty on record. That's mainstream news.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  Biden had it officially changed, but they won't show you the full text.
[23:23.000 --> 23:32.000]  Wow, incredible. There he is, predicting last year exactly what's unfolding.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  Oh, and they put the order in for the monkeypox vaccine, and lo and behold, monkeypox is here.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  And he directed, with Peter Dadsik, to AstraZeneca and J&J, the type of vaccine they would design.
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.000]  They gave them the blueprint and said, make this, and then they made the mRNA for Pfizer and Moderna, and gave them the blueprint of what to make and what to do.
[23:52.000 --> 24:04.000]  And then magically, lo and behold, surprise, surprise, it's upon us right as they're bringing in the World Government Treaty and right ahead of the midterms.
[24:04.000 --> 24:13.000]  Here is Gates. Again, the year before that in 2020 threatens the next pandemic will get the attention this time.
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  And he also said on other programs that terrorists would also release smallpox or monkeypox.
[24:19.000 --> 24:28.000]  That was a clip on NBC, the same clip where he admitted that 80% of those in their test of the vaccine had serious side effects with just the Pfizer and Moderna alone.
[24:28.000 --> 24:41.000]  He just knows everything before it happens, kind of like the CDC in October of 2020, before the vaccine was even being given out, the so-called vaccine, said they're going to be heart attacks, microcarditis, infertility, the whole damn list.
[24:41.000 --> 24:55.000]  And they put it on their website. Wow. Isn't that nice of them? Rubbing it in the whole time while blocking therapeutics and saying, oh, you don't need any, you know, antibiotics or steroids or you don't need anything.
[24:55.000 --> 25:03.000]  You can just go home and then you come back and they put you on a ventilator and you die. And some people say, why are you saying antibiotics?
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  Well, because bacteria can carry the viruses. That's why you do that as well with a viral attack like this. But here is Bill Gates.
[25:10.000 --> 25:21.000]  We didn't actually do the simulation to think about, okay, what about nursing homes? What about getting factories ready? What about the testing regime?
[25:21.000 --> 25:34.000]  In fact, the testing could have been ramped up very quickly in a few countries that have almost avoided the epidemic entirely, like Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia.
[25:34.000 --> 25:45.000]  They took their experience and actually prepared, and so they moved a lot faster. So we will have to prepare for the next one.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  That, I'd say, will get attention this time.
[25:51.000 --> 26:04.000]  Oh, he's so happy. We talked about endless lockdowns at masturbation. He giggle and laugh on the shows as well while he hides it in plain view that he's your doctor and Ted Rose said yesterday, the head of the WHO.
[26:04.000 --> 26:13.000]  He does what Bill Gates says. He trusts Bill Gates. Aren't these some really nice, nice people?
[26:13.000 --> 26:33.000]  Well, the next one will really get your attention. And now, right on time, like a German train pulling into the station in countries all over the western world,
[26:33.000 --> 26:44.000]  the monkeypox has showed up in who the vaccinated who took the virus vector vaccine that isn't a vaccine either to gene therapy.
[26:44.000 --> 26:54.000]  But instead of programming the outside of the cell to program a nuclei, it fires a virus carrying a DNA payload of a chimpanzee.
[26:54.000 --> 27:07.000]  You can send one to your cell with a whole package of God knows what our good little friends did for us.
[27:07.000 --> 27:14.000]  And, oh, rare monkeypox outbreak. And people that hadn't been to Africa, people that hadn't been any other, and they hadn't been around.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  They just, but they all had the shot. And I have scientists and health heads even saying we think it's the shot.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  We have deputy heads of major countries health departments right here.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  Madrid's deputy minister of public health claims cases of hepatitis of young kids are related to COVID-19 vaccine.
[27:29.000 --> 27:41.000]  Funny, I've got the studies right here. Oh, isn't it nice? And, oh, it's also AstraZeneca and J&J, the ones linked to that.
[27:41.000 --> 27:53.000]  So they go after your liver and give you smallpox. And then the mRNA goes after your blood and your cardiac system, your respiratory system.
[27:53.000 --> 28:00.000]  There's studies right there. Multi-country acute surreptitus of unknown origin in children, but it turns out, I've got the studies right here.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  I'll show them to you when we come back. They took the AstraZeneca or the J&J.
[28:05.000 --> 28:14.000]  And I had Dr. Fleming on last week, or was it this week? It all runs together now. Was it last Friday?
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  And he showed the studies about that. And I'm going to show them all to you when we come back.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  And you can write down the headline. You can look every damn one of them up yourself like I do.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  And then you can sit back and ask yourself, man, that Bill Gates is smart.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  He just knew monkeypox was coming. And it's just spreading all over the world to people that hadn't even been traveling.
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.000]  And they've all had the shot, but now they've got to have the treaty and take all your rights and make you take more shots.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  They do all sorts of good things for you down the road.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  But Bill Gates has always said he cares about humanity and wants to save people.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  Actually, he says he wants to kill everybody, but that's okay. Just trust him.
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  Here at InfoWars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health or spirituality.

[33:28.000 --> 33:39.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[33:39.000 --> 34:02.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  You are living in the beginning of world war.
[34:09.000 --> 34:19.000]  The United Nations directed planetary takeover, economic warfare, cultural warfare, biological warfare, and the threat of nuclear warfare.
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  So Bill Gates tells you last year that monkeypox, smallpox, it's all going to be coming soon.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  And now suddenly it starts popping up in western nations from Europe and the United States.
[34:30.000 --> 34:37.000]  And right on time, us buys millions of vaccine doses for new virus.
[34:37.000 --> 34:48.000]  119 million in vaccine doses over 10 million doses, just to begin with for monkeypox.
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.000]  Why did the Biden administration just purchase 13 million doses of monkeypox?
[34:53.000 --> 35:02.000]  Bill Gates back in November of last year, Bill Gates warns of smallpox terror attacks in bid for pandemic prevention funds.
[35:02.000 --> 35:12.000]  Bill Gates warns of smallpox terror attacks and urges leaders to use germ games run by the UN to prepare.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  Bill Gates warns of smallpox terror attacks as he seeks research funds, but more importantly,
[35:16.000 --> 35:27.000]  UN control with the treaty now happening now. Oh, and then right on time, two months after that, monkeypox escapes after truck crashes on Pennsylvania Highway.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  Oh, with the connected grips to Gates research labs.
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  Oh, isn't that interesting? A plausible story of where it came from.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  Pennsylvania woman being treated for rabies, countering monkeys and aftermath of crash.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  She falls ill. Right after Bill Gates says it's all coming.
[35:50.000 --> 36:04.000]  Oh, and look at this monkeypox vax to monkeypox. Here's the AstraZeneca contains the replication chimpanzee adenovirus.
[36:04.000 --> 36:12.000]  And we've had Dr. Fleming on. We'll ask Dr. McCullough about this, but I went and found the studies that the AstraZeneca and J&J that use similar systems from a chimpanzee.
[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  Directly linked to the acute hepatitis and children that have been injected and in what they call monkeypox.
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.000]  Isn't that interesting? Severe hepatitis cases and kids continue to rise as WHO calls for investigation.
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.000]  Yes, of themselves. What parents need to know.
[36:34.000 --> 36:45.000]  I've got a whole stack of news on that subject right here. Madrid's deputy minister for public health claims cases of hepatitis of young kids are related to COVID-19 vaccine funny.
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.000]  We've got the study multi country acute severe hepatitis of unknown origin in children.
[36:52.000 --> 37:01.000]  And we've got the studies here linking it to the so called injections.
[37:01.000 --> 37:10.000]  And we'll get more into those coming up. But this is just absolutely insane.
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  What is monkeypox? Where is it spreading and warning signs?
[37:15.000 --> 37:32.000]  As it just magically starts popping up around the world and the UN health agency says they need more power to stop it as G7 ministers are already practicing for the next pandemic.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  There are heroes.
[37:34.000 --> 37:50.000]  Major leaders in Canada say that the public wants forced vaccines and vaccine passports. All as the treaty is being rammed through right now.
[37:50.000 --> 38:04.000]  And as all the heart attacks and bizarre deaths expand and the UN calls for a climate Marshall plan and UN control over all energy supplies as well.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  There's a monkeypox outbreak. What is it and should Bay Area residents be worried?
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  They're all getting us ready now for the next big thing.
[38:14.000 --> 38:22.000]  We've got to shut down and follow the UN's directives over.
[38:22.000 --> 38:33.000]  We have the very UN connections, the very corporations that are doing this hyping up all of this fear.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  But don't worry. The UN can save you. Bill Gates can save you.
[38:37.000 --> 38:53.000]  Look at all this other COVID-19 news. mRNA vaccine significantly associated with deadly blood clots. Major study finds in the leading medical journal vaccines has found.
[38:53.000 --> 39:02.000]  And now we've got this little clip. This is Obama. It's not really Biden's Obama's third term right now.
[39:02.000 --> 39:15.000]  Obama's COVID czar says we now can dispense with the misinformation that if you get infected once you have immunity for life or you've had the so-called vaccine, you have immunity.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  Well, most vaccines that we said was for life for a decade or longer.
[39:20.000 --> 39:31.000]  But now it isn't a vaccine. I take it over and over and over again in the German Supreme Court rules, compulsory facts for health workers,
[39:31.000 --> 39:54.000]  constitutional. What a time to be alive right now in this country, in this world, knowing that they have launched the next phase of the massive power grab.
[39:54.000 --> 40:02.000]  Bill Gates says the monkeypox is coming. Bill Gates says the terrorists are going to release it. He says that the UN needs more power.
[40:02.000 --> 40:15.000]  And a year later, right when the treaty is coming out, that signs over to authority of nation states to the UN where they can be sanctioned even militarily right on time.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  What they need, the fear, unfolds and happens.
[40:20.000 --> 40:32.000]  Biden seeks new unilateral powers for World Health Organization chief to declare public health emergencies putting us under a UN medical dictatorship worldwide.
[40:32.000 --> 40:39.000]  It's an excellent zero-hedge article. We've had it posted to infowars.com and under the live show feed, but it's all over the news now.
[40:39.000 --> 40:51.000]  And the memes are everywhere. Dr. Ebel says meeting to sign the World Health Organization Pandemic Treaty, release the monkeypox. Release the monkeypox.
[40:51.000 --> 41:01.000]  What a time to be alive. And right as the monkeypox breaks out, we learn a year ago they put in orders for it all over the world and they've got the new vaccine.
[41:01.000 --> 41:13.000]  God knows what that is going to do. God only knows. God doesn't just know. People that designed this garbage know.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  Dr. McCullough will be joining us coming up in about 40 minutes in studio with his co-author. They're going to break a lot of big news.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  I'll ask him about all this as well.
[41:22.000 --> 41:38.000]  And guys, going through my stack of what I see, you only saw one of the studies on links to smallpox and the shots, so print me some of those as well.
[41:38.000 --> 41:50.000]  And a few more of the studies on scientists saying that it's a direct link with these two different types of shots, virus vector shots, and people having this acute meningitis as well.
[41:50.000 --> 41:56.000]  And we'll go into that in more detail, but I showed you that information. It's unbelievable.
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.000]  Either Bill Gates is completely clairvoyant or obviously they've engineered this entire thing.
[42:03.000 --> 42:16.000]  Now, constitutional lawyer, one of the smartest people I know, Robert Barnes, will be joining us for the next 45 minutes ahead of Dr. McCullough in studio with us here today in his new book.
[42:16.000 --> 42:28.000]  And so that is all coming up, but I cannot impress upon all of you enough to understand that just like in January of 2020, I said, this is going to be a lockdown.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  This is going to be big. They're going to take over.
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.000]  They're going to use this for global vaccine passports that are then carbon passports and social credit score passports and then be like, that's crazy.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  And then it all happened. It's because it's in the battle plan.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  And I'm telling you, this is the next big move, this monkey pot, and probably something else on top of it, a new deadly variant that's lab made or something along those lines.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  This is the big global government move. It's happening now.
[42:51.000 --> 42:59.000]  And we've got to contact our governors, our legislators in Congress to get ahead of this because the same terrorists that launched COVID are launching this.
[42:59.000 --> 43:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12, the highest quality B-12 you're going to find on the market, has been sold off for many months, but now it's back in stock at infowarstore.com.

[44:25.000 --> 44:38.000]  It's just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[44:38.000 --> 44:53.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[44:59.000 --> 45:07.000]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[45:07.000 --> 45:17.000]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go, then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[45:17.000 --> 45:26.000]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[45:26.000 --> 45:39.000]  This is nothing less than martial law, and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  Bill Gates says smallpox, monkeypox is imminent.
[47:32.000 --> 47:39.000]  Then they order the vaccine last year and then it's delivered this week and then the monkeypox is everywhere.
[47:39.000 --> 47:47.000]  And I've got the studies that I mentioned that I didn't get to with the meningitis and the monkeypox linked to the AstraZeneca and J&J shots.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[47:49.000 --> 48:00.000]  But since I mentioned it, here is Obama slash Biden's COVID czar saying, oh, we can dispense with this information that immunity works now when you get this virus.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  Well, that means the vaccine doesn't work either, which they admit isn't even a vaccine.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  So it's just an incredible moment to be alive. Here he is.
[48:09.000 --> 48:20.000]  One of the things that we are seeing now, Dr. Shaw, is people being infected for a second, third, in some cases, fourth time as we are two plus years into this pandemic.
[48:20.000 --> 48:28.000]  What are you learning about these repeat infections in terms of what it means for immunity and also the severity of these infections?
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Yeah, it's a really good question.
[48:30.000 --> 48:40.000]  First and foremost, I think we can now dispense with the misinformation that if you get infected once you have immunity for life. A lot of people have argued that we knew always that that was not the case.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  The second thing we're learning is that this virus is evolving.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  I mean, the virus is evolving relatively quickly, trying to escape our immunity.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  But when people do get that breakthrough infection after vaccines or they get that reinfection, generally it is less severe.
[48:55.000 --> 49:02.000]  And that's obviously a very, very good thing. But we've got to keep working on building up the wall of immunity against this virus.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  So what does that mean? Does that mean that we're going to be getting shots every six months?
[49:05.000 --> 49:11.000]  My wife just got her fourth shot, right? She had her two initial doses, plus a booster, plus another booster.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Are we talking two shots a year?
[49:13.000 --> 49:22.000]  Right now, look, here's where we are. Right now, we are going to have to update our vaccines in the fall and winter because of what we have out there.
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.000]  I do believe that right now, people who are 15 above should go out and get that second booster because we have so much infections.
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.000]  And in the short run, yeah, like we've had to boost people about every six months.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  Over the long run, I am confident we're going to develop more durable vaccines.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  The virus is also going to settle down.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  And so my hope is over the long run is going to sound to maybe be a one-year shot.
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  But right now, we're having to boost people a little bit more frequently because of how quickly the virus has continued to evolve.
[49:49.000 --> 49:59.000]  Now, there's several different syndromes. I'm not a scientist, but I've had them on on Reddit that when they give poultry, mainly chickens, these anti-bird flu vaccines over and over again,
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  they develop a disorder where they just mutate and grow all these tumors, but still stay alive.
[50:05.000 --> 50:12.000]  And then they give them a special, durable vaccine that basically keeps them alive, but they're these horrible mutants.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on here. This is a big long-term strategic plan.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  It's unbelievable. Here's some of those studies I mentioned earlier.
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  And this is meningitis after COVID-19 vaccination, a case report.
[50:25.000 --> 50:33.000]  You can go read that at the NCBI and the NIH.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  And we've got other ones here.
[50:35.000 --> 50:43.000]  We've got aseptic meningitis following the second dose of vaccination in adolescent patient.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  Is it true that the AstraZeneca vaccine contains animal DNA of a chimpanzee?
[50:48.000 --> 50:55.000]  Yes. Safety and those on to lay all this out and what it's doing.
[50:55.000 --> 51:02.000]  It's just unbelievable to be in the middle of this and them telling you one shot, you're handled, you're taken care of.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  Now the studies are out. What scientists predicted has happened.
[51:05.000 --> 51:14.000]  People have erased immunity after three or four of these shots to not just the COVID line of garbage, but a bunch of other things.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  And it's what they call vades basically.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  So Robert Barnes, you've really been on this.
[51:18.000 --> 51:24.000]  You've been involved following the big cases for Pfizer, whistleblowers in Texas that helped expose all this.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  So you've really got an inside track on this.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  We've got about seven minutes to break.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  What is your view on what's currently happening?
[51:30.000 --> 51:45.000]  For me, it's pretty obvious the next big lockdown, the next big rollout and the way to get this power grabbing sovereignty destroying U.N. biomedical tyranny and is currently with the smallpox hysteria that I'm predicting is going to go ahead and escalate out of control.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  Just like COVID. What do you think?
[51:47.000 --> 52:01.000]  Well, I mean, no doubt, I mean, I was in court on Tuesday in front of a federal judge in Waco with Bobby Kennedy on Children's Health Defense trying to stop the booster authorization and the vaccine authorization for kindergartners and elementary school
[52:01.000 --> 52:15.000]  aged children and the federal judge to his credit listener argument and said that he would give us permission to amend to detail and provide more evidence about how this vaccine is harming kindergartners and elementary school children.
[52:15.000 --> 52:25.000]  So if anybody's out in the Waco area in the Waco region and they've seen schools be issuing these vaccines are making them freely available without full parental involvement.
[52:25.000 --> 52:31.000]  If they're seeing advertising in a local area, we've seen it from Big Bird, Elmo, everybody else.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  But if they've seen local advertising that's promoting this vaccine, as we detailed in court, this vaccine is not safe.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  This vaccine is not effective.
[52:38.000 --> 52:44.000]  This vaccine is not a vaccine, not legally, not medically, not historically, not in the definition of the ordinary public.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  And the key question is, can the FDA be held liable and held responsible?
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.000]  Because if we could stop this at the source, which is the FDA, then it stops it everywhere else.
[52:53.000 --> 53:03.000]  And so the court laid out that additional facts need to be alleged to satisfy his willingness to let the case go forward, but he was willing to entertain what those facts might be.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  So if there's anybody in the Waco area that has facts that may be relevant, reach out, let us know.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  But you're right.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  I mean, this is what we talked about two years ago.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  We said what this is going to do, you look at Bill Gates' agenda.
[53:15.000 --> 53:24.000]  What they're going to do is they're going to try to require us to take drugs for the rest of our lives, for a disease that is not an imminent risk to most human beings, most Americans,
[53:24.000 --> 53:37.000]  and for a drug that is not a vaccine and that instead is conditioning us like we walk through the airport and we've grown conditioned to have our body inspected as a condition of traveling within the United States domestically.
[53:37.000 --> 53:45.000]  We got to show our papers, we got to let them spy on our stuff, we got to let them look at an effective x-ray of our body just to get on a plane.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  They're conditioning us in the same way to accept all kinds of drugs right in the arm.
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  And these are drugs we know are dangerous, we know are not effective.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  I mean, listen to that White House guy for the just lie repeatedly.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  Oh, well, you know, now the vaccine, what does he praise about the vaccine?
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  He says, well, maybe your symptoms might be worse.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  That that's not a vaccine.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  That's a bad drug.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  That's a weak drug.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  That's an ineffective drug.
[54:09.000 --> 54:16.000]  And this is a gene editing drug, as they've admitted and conceded in other places, but failed to do the proper legal requirements to meet it.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  So now they're going to give it to us at least once a year, at least once a year.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  I don't know if you're going to be getting in line, Alex, but I think I'll skip that line.
[54:23.000 --> 54:34.000]  This is nothing more than a Bill Gates mandated process for us to be locked in to taking whatever the government tells us to, whenever the White Lab coats show up and say, stick this in your kid,
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  stick this in your grandma, stick this in yourself for the rest of your natural born life.
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.000]  And we know from the what happened in Kenya, we know from what happened in India that what happens when you line up for a Bill Gates shot.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  Suddenly weird things start happening.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  All of a sudden women are sterilized.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  All of a sudden people are experiencing diseases they hadn't experienced before.
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.000]  Often they experienced diseases that they that they didn't previously think they could get.
[54:58.000 --> 55:06.000]  And so we're seeing the same thing already with this so so called drug with this so called vaccine with this fake vaccine.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  And now they want to force us to take it for the rest of our lives.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  And it's a great.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Absolutely.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  It's so transparent that Gates says smallpox monkeypox is coming.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  And then they roll out a vaccine is delivered right as it pops up around the world.
[55:24.000 --> 55:33.000]  Right as they're trying to ram through this treaty that they admit hands over sovereignty of the nation states the UN and gives them military power for sanctions over nations that don't submit.
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  This is world government based on a biomedical dictatorship.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  Yeah, it's concentrating power.
[55:41.000 --> 55:48.000]  So right now what they're trying to do is is pass internal rules that would only govern the World Health Organization internally.
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  And but there are parallel to it proposing a treaty that ultimately still has to come back to the United States Senate.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  The United States Senate two thirds of them have to pass it.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  And what they're doing is a bifurcated approach.
[56:00.000 --> 56:08.000]  The first approach isn't the treaty itself, but they're misleading some people in the thinking it's the treaty so that people will voice concern now.
[56:08.000 --> 56:17.000]  And then when that treaty doesn't come into place because it's not actually legally a US treaty US binding treaty, then when they try to sneak it in a year from now, people aren't paying attention.
[56:17.000 --> 56:28.000]  Because they got but let's expand on their claiming though because Harry Truman in 47 signed on the WHO that that's a blanket treaty to follow that and that Obama's executive order.
[56:28.000 --> 56:43.000]  Right before he left office five and a half years ago, basically put into place similar martial law provisions and so the bureaucracies, even if they don't officially sign on are still going to follow the directives.
[56:43.000 --> 56:50.000]  Constitutionally, it's not and that's an important point for everyone to know there's major risk with them trying to do these internal rules.
[56:50.000 --> 56:58.000]  But some people are getting caught up in the idea that that acts as a treaty and you're seeing some misleading legal interpretations out there.
[56:58.000 --> 57:06.000]  No World Health Organization treaty has ever passed and under the Constitution, nothing is binding law as a treaty unless two thirds of the Senate approved.
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.000]  And we've seen good things like federal and state judges saying they can't close churches during these lockdowns that lockdowns are unconstitutional.
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  So it's taken people a few years to wake up, but there does seem to be a major backlash.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  Absolutely and people need to be alert.
[57:20.000 --> 57:29.000]  Be aware of what this is, but don't get too caught up such that you're not alert when they're actually they plan on proposing an actual binding constitutional treaty.
[57:29.000 --> 57:36.000]  They just plan on doing it about a year from now where they're hoping people aren't paying it. That would be superior law of the land.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  That would be binding on the U.S. That's what we have to be the most alert.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  All right, Robert Barnes, stay there. Stay there.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  I want to get into all the other big issues, the Ministry of Truth.
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.000]  It hasn't been canceled and so much more for 30 minutes with you then Dr. McCullough and others.
[57:48.000 --> 58:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there that turbocharge and boost our stamina, our energy, our libido that are also amazing pre or post workouts.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  And we went out and looked at the top brands, the top reviews and came out with alpha power.
[58:05.000 --> 58:11.000]  Now it's so hard to source good, clean herbs like we have in this that it's been sold out for more than six months.

[58:49.000 --> 58:55.000]  Info wars has made history. You have made history in your support of info wars.
[58:55.000 --> 59:01.000]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot apparel
[59:01.000 --> 59:07.000]  so we can identify each other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  Now ladies and gentlemen two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  some of which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition.
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.000]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer or your wardrobe.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.

[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.000]  infowarstore.com
[59:50.000 --> 59:57.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  All right, this short segment of the Alex Jones Show, we're going to talk more about the vaccines, the tyranny
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  and their plans, all these different ministers have meant to bring back more lockdowns
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  when Robert Barnes thinks it's going to be.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  And then next segment we're going to get into the Ministry of Truth,
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Biden, Ukraine, the whole waterfront of where the world is geopolitically today
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  and what he expects in the midterms coming up in 172 days.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  But Robert Barnes, for the next five minutes, you're at the heart of the resistance of this biomedical tyranny.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  What are the facts, what else do people need to be made aware of?
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  No doubt.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  So on one aspect is the DHD, the Children's Health Defense case against the FDA is marching forward.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Anybody that has use for thinking about what's happening in the Waco area as to young children,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  as to vaccines are orphans being forced to take it or people in foster homes or juvenile facilities being forced to take it
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  against their will, that's relevant pertinent evidence.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  If you have any other relevant pertinent evidence as to children facing imminent risk from taking this vaccine without informed consent,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  that's one of the target areas of the court's concern that would allow the case to move forward because our goal is to stop them from lying.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  The FDA is engaging in a massive deception campaign.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  The CDC is engaging in a massive deception campaign.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  They're telling people there's a safe, effective vaccine for an emergency for children related to COVID.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  It's this drug is not safe.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  This drug is not effective.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  This drug is not a vaccine.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  This drug does not successfully treat or prevent infection or transmission or disease or disability.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  And there is no COVID emergency for young children.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  One of the things that we are challenging in that case is the right to petition the government that's been denied by the fact that they're using their emergency
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  powers to claim they don't have to abide by the Administrative Procedures Act.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  They don't have the FDA is claiming they are beyond and above the law.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  This case goes beyond just children's vaccines in the COVID context.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  This case goes to the heart and soul of the administrative state and a bunch of unelected clerical bureaucrats dictate and determine your entire medical care without
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  even going through the democratized process of citizen petitions, which again is preserved under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  It's one of the rights people forget about.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  It's the right to petition your government for redress of grievances.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  That right is statutorily codified against the FDA as to what's called citizen petitions.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  It requires that the FDA permit a time period where you can petition them about anything, any agency action or decision that they are making of consequence to the people in the public.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  It requires that they respond to that and that they respond to the citizen petition with a meaningful answer.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  If they're proposing certain rules, they have to go through what's called notice and comment.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  In other words, they put out the notice to everybody and they let people with scientific, technical, medical knowledge, community and others comment on that so that that information from the public
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  is crowd sourced and any dissident or dissenting information is made clear and then they have to answer that.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And then when they make a decision, they have to show that they considered every complaint raised, that they considered every fact brought to their attention by the outside community, by the ordinary person.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  In the context of all these emergency, quote, unquote, emergency use authorized drugs, the FDA has completely failed to do any citizen petition process, any notice and comment process.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Not only that, they claim that they can assert emergency powers anytime they want, that it's magic dust.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And all they got to do is say emergency and they can open Pandora's box and do anything they want with anything inside Pandora's box.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  But not just that, they can also take powers that are not in Pandora's box and just relabel them emergency powers and suddenly mismarketing a drug is now an emergency power.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Mispromoting a drug is suddenly a emergency power.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Changing the definition of medical terms like vaccine now is magically an emergency power such that all of those things were not subject to citizen petitions, notice and comment or democratic control
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  or the plain language of Congress when they issued the emergency use authorization status.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And Robert, isn't that what this is all about?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  I remember that clip from four years ago on C-SPAN with all the big bureaucrats and Fauci and they said, we're going to have a new virus come out of China, a new bird flu.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  We'll use that to blow up the old FDA system and other systems worldwide where we can just directly do whatever we want.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  That's what this whole thing is the corporate power grab over our bodies.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Absolutely. What they're doing with the FDA is what they want the WHO to have power to do for everybody.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Ultimately, which is unchecked, unelected clerical bureaucrats dictating and controlling our entire medical care.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  This is so important.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  If they own our body, they own our soul.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  That's right. They own our body, own our souls.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, back in 60 seconds to shift gears into politics. Stay with us.

[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply and it's been sold off for months because supply chain right downs.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week than it goes back to full price.

[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  The U.N., the Bank of England, now Putin's top aide, predict global famine of Armageddon-like and apocalyptic, these are quote,
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  proportions all based on the two plus year lockdown where in many third world countries, the IMF and World Bank
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  ordered them to have up to two years of lockdown, devastating them, collapsing them, 40 plus million starved to death.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Now the refugees are flooding the west as part of the replacement migration operation.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  We've got the Ministry of Truth, its head, Jacqueline's having to step down because of all of her fascistic statements about
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  I hate free speech, I want to be able to censor everybody.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Now she's tried to walk that back.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  Spectacular mashups are out there showing her previous comments with her new ones just in the last year and six months.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  There's so much to tackle.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  What's happening with Elon Musk?
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  He said, look, every time somebody bucks the globalist, they're going to do the me too thing.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  And he's challenging this sturdist on a private jet who's a failed actress he's saying and saying, tell me this very identifiable thing
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  on my genitals if I supposedly showed you my genitals.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  And this is again all being done to punish him because he says he's going to vote Republican.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  We've got all that and so much more.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  What's going to happen to Biden?
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  The inflation is taking place.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Robert Barnes is predictions for the midterms and will they try the 2000 mule tactic again that he was working with Trump exposing at the time
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  and exposing that the voting machines were the red herring that the mules bring in the ballots was the key.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  All of that.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Those are huge subjects in the next 25 minutes to cover.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Robert Barnes, what do you want to tackle first?
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  Well, first, I mean, no big surprise on the Elon Musk front.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  I mean, I think there's he will now face retaliatory action by the Biden administration for the public statements he's made.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  So not only will you have the media coming after him trying to out him, try to meet to him, all of that jazz, but you will likely see Justice Department SEC other inquiries
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  because his businesses receive a lot of as a message, not only to him, but to anybody else because Jeff Bezos started saying some things hostile about the Biden administration.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  So I think they'll try to make an example out of Musk, just as they try to make an example out of Trump.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  I mean, we're seeing that in a case that the media is not covering this week.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  The Sussman trial, which is about the spy gate and detailing all of the different ways they the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  Laundered information disguised it as attorney client privilege disguised as attorney legal fees.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And instead, what it really was was just spy gate on steroids that created the first fake Russia gate story.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  They're going to do to Musk what they did to Trump in the 2016 campaign.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  And they're going to try because not only the goal, they said explicitly, our goal is not just to stop Trump.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Our goal is to stop anyone else from wanting to be like Trump.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  They're going to do the same thing to Elon Musk.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  They're going to not just to go after Musk for trying to bring free speech back to Twitter, but also in for exposing that almost all of these big tech
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  organizations have been making all their money and profits off of fraud, massive fraud.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  What he's exposing with the bots at Twitter is that all of these big tech companies according to a range of reports are littered with bots.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  What does that mean?
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  It means all their advertising prices have been false.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  It means they've been falsely inducing companies and individuals to advertise to thinking they were advertising to people when those companies
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  knew, like Twitter, like Facebook, like YouTube, like others, that actually it was just bots watching, just bots participating.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  And what does that mean?
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  That means that all of these businesses could go bankrupt overnight.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And what he details about Twitter is correct.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Twitter could go bankrupt.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  So the fact that he's exposing big tech for the fraud that it is already exposed over half of President Biden's followers.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  He exposed the vaccine over a year and a half ago.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  He exposed depopulation.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  And really, this guy's becoming a superstar.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  I know he's done some things that are globalist in the past, but why do you think he's breaking with the power structure and getting so hard core?
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  I know a few people are in Austin.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  They're close friends of him and some other people.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And let's just say this.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  I was told and said over a year ago that he was about to go hardcore.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  And I'm not writing myself into the story.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  We warned of this when I was getting the platform four years ago.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  I warned Trump personally that he would be next.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  So first it was Alex Jones, then it was Trump, and again, they're just developing the formula to destroy somebody.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Now they've moved to Elon Musk.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  Yes, the same pattern over and over and over and over again.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  And I think, I mean, one, by the way, I can give why the timing.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Why was it this week they finally decided to pull back publicly on the Disinformation Governance Board?
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Well, because on Tuesday morning, Bobby Kennedy, who is suing Facebook for colluding with the government to censor children's health defense,
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  was before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on his lawsuit against Zuckerberg and Facebook.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  And the argument was government collusion.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Well, what was the best evidence of government collusion?
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  That Disinformation Governance Board.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So the government knew and Facebook knew they needed that board to be gone.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And by the way, you're not just saying that.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Jackowitz, as our defense said, oh, we were just going to coordinate.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Exactly coordinate Big Tech and the other companies in Microsoft and dinosaur media together in wolf packs to censor and control and bully and dominate.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  Absolutely. Everything Bobby Kennedy and Jones Health Defense said about this vaccine has been proven true over and over and over and over again.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  And that's what they were being censored for, trying to prevent them from being able to raise money, prevent them from adding new members.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  And if we let that happen to them, it happens to everybody.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  So let's just stop there.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  What you said is so important.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  It is on record that you can have an argument about Section 230 and say these groups can do what they want.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  But when you have the government coordinating with private corporations, that is fascism, that is racketeering.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Explain in the law why that's so criminal.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  What makes it illegal is that once the private actors can suppress speech because they're not governed by the First Amendment.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  Now, my view is when they have a monopoly on the public square that they should be held so accountable.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And there's court decisions that said that, but the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to embrace that.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  What is undisputed is that once the government is colluding.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  So years ago, for example, there was a Connecticut agency that didn't want to book publish.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  So it put pressure on a book publisher not to publish the book.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  The publisher didn't publish it.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  The U.S. Supreme Court said, that's illegal.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  That's a First Amendment violation.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  The moment you have government involvement in any suppression or censorship of speech or press or the right to petition your government,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  you then have a constitutional violation.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  You then have collusion that violates the law that is outside of the limits of Section 230 immunity.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  And that's the suit that Bobby Kennedy brought because they had Fauci himself saying, please shut up Bobby Kennedy and similar organization.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Bobby Kennedy was specifically named by the government to target.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And they dodged it at the lower court level because they said it wasn't real collusion.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  It was only kind of collusion.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  Well, the problem is you can't have a disinformation governance board being present and being publicly known at the time the case.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  And here's where she's in trouble now.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  She's on record as of last week running her stupid mouth admitting that she was secretly working for a year with Homeland Security already.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Exactly.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  And there's no question that one of their primary targets was Bobby Kennedy and Children's Health Defense.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  So that's why they had to try to get rid of it and claim that they're not going to do that anymore.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  When in fact they're going to continue to do it, they're just going to try to do it a little quieter than they were publicly doing it.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  So the but it was only because it's what I tell people why you should file suits that are even maybe tough to win in court.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  You might have judicial bias you have to deal with.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  It's still fighting for your civil rights and your civil liberties still matters because because of Bobby Kennedy's suit, they couldn't continue to publicly allow that organization.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And let's be clear whether it was the CDC saying they controlled all rents in America or so many other things by fighting.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  We've been beating them.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  We have turned the tide here, not in other countries.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  People say, why do you love America so much? Well, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  We are still the best and we're an example of the world.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's why it's so important we fight harder now than ever.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  Absolutely.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  And it's thanks to the audience at Infowars that Infowars is still alive.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  And now people are seeing what we said from the get go.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  People were going to come after Infowars with the goal being to prevent the audience from wanting to support Infowars so that they wouldn't go to Infowars store.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  They wouldn't support it with purchasing products. They wouldn't support it by sharing links.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  They wouldn't continue to try to get outside the matrix and share rent bills with everybody possible.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And it's thanks to ordinary people continuing to buy products that make them better anyway.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  They make them healthier.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  They make them better off that are more affordable than what's on the private marketplace.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  So it's all win, win, win, but they didn't think that would happen.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  They thought they would be able to suppress it and they had to because their goal was to go after more and more people after that.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  It was start with Alex Jones, then it goes to Donald Trump.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Now it goes to anybody who dissents if it's Robert Kennedy, if it's Elon Musk, if it's even Jeff Bezos.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  I mean, Bezos is next if he keeps talking out against the Biden ministry.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Well, that's right. I knew I wasn't that important five years ago when they started thousands of articles a week, hundreds of shows a week.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  I knew it was for everybody else.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  And then the documents came out in the Wall Street Journal.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  They were planning it for everybody.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  They even had a NATO intelligence summit with them naming us by name and saying we're going to get everybody after we get WikiLeaks and Info Wars.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And the left and right doesn't stand up for these people. We will get them all.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  They said that.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Exactly. They set the precedent.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  They set the table to do this to everybody.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  And it's why it's so important and so valuable that people keep programs like Info Wars alive.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Robert Barnes, stay there, my friend.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  I want to come back and talk about inflation, Ukraine, the election coming up and so much more.

[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Final segment with my good friend Robert Barnes at the Alice Jones show.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And then two different special guests, Dr. Peter McCullough and his colleague John Leake will be joining us in studio the next hour and a half with bombshell information
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  because this is their world government takeover using COVID-19.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  It is their wedge, their tip of the spear and we must know the new lockdowns are planned.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  We've got to keep hammering getting people ready to stop it.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  This is the world government system. This is the biomedical tyranny.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  Robert Barnes shifting into any other comments on the Ministry of Truth and then the inflation, how things are going for Biden, the puppet,
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  what you're expecting for the midterms, Ukraine, all of that ties together, Robert Barnes.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  Yeah, I mean, the amount of fake news coming out about Ukraine is striking.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  I mean, they actually apparently Zelensky ordered those neo-Nazis at the Assoff Italian that were in that steel factory in Mariupol to stay put until the Eurovision Song Contest could end
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  because they were hopeful that apparently had been rigged to make sure Ukrainian won.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And of course, when the Ukrainian won, they couldn't help themselves.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  They're like Dr. Strangelove and at the end, which is, you know, can't stop the arm from coming up.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  They actually did a Nazi salute, an actual live Nazi salute on Eurovision Song in the name of Ukraine with Slava Ukraine,
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  which is what the Nazi aligned Ukrainians used to use when they were killing Poles and Jews in during World War Two.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  And what's really happening is the Russians are dominating on the ground.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  You're getting fake news from the whole Kagan family.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  They have Institute for Study of War and a lot of these fake accounts.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  People are discovering that a lot of the so-called military experts on Fox News and on social media and everywhere else,
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  that they're as reliable as all the public health experts were during the pandemic.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  They're just complete frauds.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  They just spread propaganda lies.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  And what's really happening is that Russia's winning the war on the ground.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  But they're not just winning the war on the ground.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  There were probably about a month away from that Russians completely taking control of the eastern region,
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Donbas region and the Harrison region of Ukraine.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  They'll probably go into Odessa.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  They'll take where all the gas is, where all the industry is, where all the Russian population is,
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  where all the seaside land is.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  So that Ukraine will end up a landlocked piece of property that will just continue to be a great reset colony,
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  but with a much smaller share of the population.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  While Zelensky will hop out to Hollywood and start doing TV deals and reality shows with Sean Penn and Angelina Jolie.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  And we live in a very interesting world where we can wage war on scale on that kind of size.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  I mean, Zelensky makes a volunteer appearance at Khan Film Festival and all of them are up there cheering, clapping like seals for this complete corrupt grifter.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  So that's basically what's happening with Ukraine.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  On the economic front, you're right.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  I mean, basically inflation continues unabated.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  The Fed is in a catch-22 position.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  They want to break inflation.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  In order to do so, they have to raise interest rates.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  The more they raise interest rates, the more they sink the stock market and the housing market.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  So we're looking at gas of $10 a gallon in the United States already above that, certain parts of the world.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  And then it's a totally, as you were pointing out at the top of the show, it's an unnecessary famine that they're inducing.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  This is part of the whole great reset agenda.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  And it's an artificial famine between all the lockdowns that happened over the last two years, plus what they're doing with Russia.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Russia's going to have a boom wheat crop this year.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  And they've said so, but they're not being allowed to transport that wheat to the areas that need it.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  This is insanity.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I mean, I get, you know, and again, it's all part of the same thing.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Why do we have some of this war agenda?
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Why do we have some of the pandemic agenda?
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  Why do we have some of the what's happening on the economy and inflation and food and fuel?
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  It's because they want to shrink the population.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  I mean, Bill Gates has been clear about this.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  He wants a lot of us to be dead.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  He wants fewer so that they can hoard what's left of the resources.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  It's a bad Malthusian math, but they're doing it all over again.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  And the consequences of it is we are being put at risk.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And they want to take what the FDA has done with unelected complete control over the medical health of our country under the guise of emergency powers that are being misused and abused in order to do so.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Even though they've been exposed by the whistleblower that I represent in the case in Beaumont, Texas.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  In fact, we'll have a hearing next week in Beaumont, Texas, because Pfizer and all the corporate lawyers are coming in and they're saying, well, no discovery, judge.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Well, we need to stay that for a little while.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  We can't allow Mr. Barnes or anyone else to be poking into what we got buried back there.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And so we have as a Bill Gates driven agenda.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  And we got this guy that his family comes up within the eugenics movement, within the Planned Parenthood movement, within all that.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  I mean, notice one of the few times the guys ever said anything publicly about a specific political issue was Roe v. Wade.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  And they're trying to stop Roe v. Wade from getting reversed by these threats on justices.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Now, six Supreme Court justices are having to get special security protocols because their lives have been threatened with a credible threat.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  I mean, both of us have dealt with credible threats in order for a threat to reach that level.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  That means it's so serious, so significant, someone who can execute it, that they're having to assign special security above and beyond the norm.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  And why? Because they need abortion as part of this broader global population control agenda.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  It's all about control at the end of the day. They're trying to do, but now they're losing control politically because the ordinary everyday person rejects it.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  The ordinary everyday person doesn't want wokeness, doesn't want these lockdowns, doesn't want pandemic policies like we've had.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  That was my next question here in the three minutes we have left.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  The entire globalist program is falling apart. They admit that the more they double down the Star Wars line, the tighter you squeeze, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  That's happening. So where do you see these trajectories of a public that's waking up and won't give up, but an establishment that won't back down?
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  What do you see unfolding there?
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Well, we're going to see more conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  In other words, with Russia, we're seeing that it ended up resulting in military war between, you know, you have Putin in Russia who's anti-globalist in their agenda, their goals.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  He only cares about Russia. He doesn't care about anything else.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  And when globalists became, in his mind, an imminent threat to the well-being of Russia, he decided that their project, their anti-Russia project in Ukraine, he was willing to wage war over.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  And so I think you're going to see more, hopefully it stays nonviolent, political conflict in the rest of the world, but that political conflict is only going to escalate.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  It's not going to de-escalate because you're right. They're going to get more and more desperate.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  I mean, is it a coincidence? We suddenly see another monkey pox pandemic supposedly coming.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  I mean, that's not a coincidence. They're going to keep rolling these out one after the other after the other.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  One bad sequel to the next bad sequel because they are desperate because they are losing.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  They're losing control of the economy. It turns out you can't just print all the cash in the world you want and have no economic consequence.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  They're losing control over large parts of the world.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Most of the world hasn't gone along with the request by the UN to issue economic sanctions against Russia.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  They're losing control of the domestic populace in the West. Le Pen surge didn't win, but did better than any Le Pen had ever done in the history of France.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Orban won big in Hungary. Serbia won. There's Palestine in Pakistan.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  There's political rallies almost every week in favor of the opposed president there.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  And here in the United States, people like J.D. Vance are winning in Ohio.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Pennsylvania had a very competitive. Kathy Barnett did well, did surprising for no money, managed to get almost a quarter of the vote.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  So Trump is resurging. He's going to be reelected or elected again in 2024 at the pace we're at.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  Republicans are going to sweep the House. They're going to sweep the Senate.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  They're going to add four to five seats in the Senate. They're going to add probably 50 to 60 seats in the House.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Except the globalists are going to stage false flags in my view, maybe even a mass power out of, say, blame them on Russia.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Robert Barnes, thank you for spending time with us. Next time you're in Texas, I know you're busy.

[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action. Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  That the family, as we know it, is a bad thing and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four natural daughter, and my wife makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions are coming together. They really are.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  They are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth. They want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  Infowars. Tomorrow's News. Today.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  The same World Health Organization who praised Communist China's extreme authoritarian lockdown against the Chinese people, who suggested forcibly separating families to quarantine them.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  In most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level. In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  And who was caught faking the H1N1 pandemic in 2010. The same World Health Organization run by Tadros Adonam Gibrasis, who's been working with the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation since 2007, who said that the lockdowns will never end.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  I repeat, there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  That the war in Ukraine was getting massive attention as a result of bias against black lives.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  The U.S. government is in full support of this new UN treaty with the WHO and has submitted 13 amendments, which will be voted on next week, that will give the WHO international authority on lockdowns, forced quarantines and forced vaccinations.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  According to constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, none of this is legally binding until a treaty is approved by the U.S. Senate.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  But the law hasn't been stopping these criminals from committing crimes against humanity so far.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  And if they plan on staying in power, they're going to have to bring back the lockdowns and the ballot harvesting mules.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  So we know it's coming, and it will soon be climate lockdowns to go with their climate migration.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  People are waking up, but the UN's agenda is aggressively pressing forward.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  The United Nations is meeting this week with members of the Mayor's Migration Council, which is comprised of nine mayors from nine different cities throughout the world, including Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, California.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  The Mayor's Migration Council is funded by George Soros' Open Society Foundations, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation and partnered with the United Nations.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  And their stated goal is pretty clear.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  They want to grant mayors the ability to bypass state and federal government when it comes to what they call climate migration and go straight to international organizations for resources.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  They are inviting all interested mayors or senior city staff members to contact them at contactatmayorsmigrationcouncil.org to learn how to engage with the international system and learn how to get funding and boots on the ground support.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  This all sounds completely illegal, but who's going to stop them?
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  There is no longer any justice in America, so expect more lockdowns as the food supply diminishes and the population around you surges with hungry foreign migrants.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  All right, for the next hour and 22 minutes, I am very honored to have Dr. Peter McCullough and John Leake, who have written a powerful new book, The Courage to Face COVID-19,
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  already number one in many categories, and it just came out, Preventing Hospitalization and Death while battling the biopharmaceutical complex.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  And we are very, very excited to talk about this with John Leake and Peter A. McCullough, MD, MPH.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Wow, and I haven't read the book yet. I've heard all about it. I've seen some interviews you guys have done. I know you're doing big speaking tours.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Congratulations on fighting this whole thing so tirelessly.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  There's a lot to cover here. Organized crime, the massive PSIOP, the propaganda campaign, the intrigue, the historic efforts to fight back against it, the historic efforts to block it, the malfeasance, again, all of it.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  We've got five minutes to break, so you guys just give people a synopsis of what's coming up in the next hour and 20 minutes, please.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Thanks so much for having us on the program. And it was absolutely an honor to work over the last year with bestselling author John Leake on telling the story,
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  really the battle that I was facing in that of my colleagues as we attempted to take care of patients who were sick with COVID-19,
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  and we started to run into clear efforts to suppress early treatment in order to promote fear, hospitalization, and death.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  And I'll let John kind of lay the groundwork for how we put this together.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Thank you, Alex. I came at this as a true crime author. Early 2020, SARS-CoV-2 arrives in our nation,
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  and I began to perceive that the official public policy response was just not plausible with federal health agencies and what the mainstream media was telling us.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And it seemed to me there were two elements of what seemed like a crime taking shape.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  One of them was something like mass fraud, huge fraudulent misrepresentations of what we were actually up against.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  And then secondly, as it became evident that some of these repurposed drugs, supplements, anything that could be used to counter and to treat SARS-CoV-2 were being suppressed.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  A sort of a propaganda campaign was being waged both by federal health agencies and by the mainstream media.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  And it began to feel like for higher risk people over the age of 65, people with diabetes, some of these metabolic illnesses,
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  it felt like there's a deliberate suppression, even impeding these people from getting something that could help them,
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  which to me began to take an element of something like mass negligent homicide.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  I mean, if you withhold medications from a sick man who could wind up in hospital, how is that any different from guy falls overboard in a boat and high seas?
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  How is it any different from saying, well, we're not going to throw him a life ring?
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  I mean, that was sort of my starting point from my inquiry.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  And it was globally managed and directed, which is so incredible.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  I can't wait to read the book because when I'm reading the synopsis here, I'm not a historian or criminologist like you that writes famous, powerful, true crime books.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  But just studying criminology, and I have read some of your books now that I remember and think about it because I like true crime, you're one of the top guys,
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  that when you study crime, you just see it jumping out.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  And I wonder how the FBI and Justice Department doesn't see this when they were busy basically cooking it up at the Wuhan lab.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Absolutely. You know, as a practicing doctor, I didn't see it either.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  I saw patients falling sick.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  I was relying on my instincts, the best information at hand, communicating across the world.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  What could we do to help patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, the illness?
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  And it took several months, Alex, but we were able to put it together.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  The medicines weren't perfect, and we didn't ask that they be perfect, but we simply wanted to reduce the intensity and duration of symptoms.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  And by that mechanism, reduce the risks of hospitalization and death.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  And when we started seeing a sequence of events unfold, it was clear that people all over the world were being intentionally denied and then blocked access to early therapy.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  All right. We've got an 11-minute segment coming up in a whole other hour after that.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  I'm going to try my best to just let you guys roll through the book.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  And then I think everybody out there needs to get the book, even if you think you know everything about COVID.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  Read the book. I'm going to read it this weekend.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And then share it with judges and law enforcement.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  Another talk show host, because magnifying something like this with thought leaders is how we're going to win this fight.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  We're going to go to break. Where is the best place?
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  You've got quite a few websites, quite a few places.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Obviously, people go to Amazon and get it, but then that won't fund you guys and your tour as much as it should.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Where's the best place to get the courage to face COVID-19?
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  We have a website. It's actually courage2facecovid.com.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And that will be a launching point.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Amazon and then we plan to open up other avenues for purchase.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  Well, I'm going to definitely buy a bunch for our store.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  So very, very excited about what you're doing.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  The courage to face COVID-19.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  Get the book now and spread the word.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  We'll be right back. This is a war.

[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  And every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Soros. I have bad joints. Thanks mom.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.

[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  All right, welcome back to the final segment of hour number two.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  Our guests will be with us throughout the entire next hour.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  We may have pushed the next guest back a little bit if they need more time,
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  because we're going to get into monkey pox and the next lockdowns.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  And looking over the horizon with Dr. Peter McCullough and his co-author, John Leek, the new book, The Courage to Face COVID-19.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  But I want to say something here out of the game.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  What I think, Tim, for what he's been doing for my family and my future, that's genuine 100% because this isn't a popularity contest between us.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  But it's about who's the most effective and who's reaching out and helping the people the most.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  And I tell you, I don't hear about Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or Dr. Malone, or, you know,
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Alex Jones or Dale Bigtree who are all, you know, great people working hard.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  I hear three to one Dr. Peter McCullough everywhere I go, every day on the street if I walk around or, you know, out for a hike.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  It's insane how many people you've reached.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  It is amazing and it's exciting.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  Before we get back on the book, and it's so prolific what you're doing, how did you do this?
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  I mean, you have really scorched dirt on these people with the truth.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  You have kicked their ass.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  You know what people tell me, Alex, as I go out and really do what I think my job is.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  My job as a doctor is not only to take care of the patients in my immediate circles, but also educate others on what's going on.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  What I hear, Alex, is they tell me, Dr. McCullough, for the first time, someone in a position of authority is making sense.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  That what I say fits into the cognitive framework of what they understand what's going on.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Everything from how the viral pandemic started, its communicability, and then on to our abilities to prevent and treat the illness.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Well, so just help people in for a minute or two. Your TERS, everything you're doing, how are you reaching so many people?
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  Because it's really amazing and others, I think, can learn from your effect.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  It's not just that you're a well-known doctor, a scientist, done high-level FDA research projects.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  You're very articulate, but you've really worked hard, too, and so it's very exciting.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  You know, I've been blessed from the very beginning.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  I've been invited contributor to The Hill, a right-leaning journal in Washington for the first year.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  The second year I was invited to have my own podcast on America Out Loud Talk Radio, the McCullough Report, which I issue a report to the country each week.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  I'm a frequent contributor on Fox News. I was on Laura Ingram last night, and frequently on Newsmax and Victory Channel and OAN.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  But I've also been on ABC and Joe Rogan and all these other shows.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  All I want to say is, you're the MVP and your co-authors amazing. I just wanted to recognize the hard work you've done and the attacks you've been under.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  So congratulations. Gentlemen, take over and let's get into the book.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  You know, I think it is a true crime story. It falls squarely in the category of true crime.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  As I mentioned before the break, I began to feel almost immediately March of 2020.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  It looks like something very strange, mysterious, even perfidious is a foot in this thing.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  So I began to research it, and a couple of months in I began to realize I need someone with top medical authority to sort of work with and help me work through the technical medical aspects of this.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  I saw you mentioned like, why are people so responsive to Dr. McCullough? And I remember the first time I saw him. It was Halloween 2020.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  And somebody sent me a link and the friend that sent it to me said, you know, all this BS that we've been hearing for the last six months.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Finally, there's a real ranking academic medical guy who seems to be talking something sensible.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  And you know what I was doing? I had just had COVID-19 myself with some pulmonary involvement.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  And I had just shown the world that I was in an FDA approved protocol. I took medicines and a sequence combination.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  And on illness day eight treatment day six, I went and ran two miles to show people I could do it.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I was short of breath, Alex, but I was able to go two miles to the park and back and shot that video in Dallas.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  And what I was surprised with is how it was zapped off of YouTube. This isn't 2020. It was zapped off YouTube very quickly.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  No one wanted to see a doctor who had been in an FDA multi-drug treatment protocol recover from COVID-19.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  Unbelievable. And so that's when the investigation really starts. Why are they trying to suppress people and suppress questioning?
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  That's the basis of science. Not don't question. That's the new science. And then everything they told us has turned out to be a lie.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  It's true. I'll let John under.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  Well, you know, I, my kind of point of understanding or the way I, the metaphor that I worked with was SARS COVID-2 is like a military invasion.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  I mean, it's, but it's not human beings with weapons. It's even more sort of strange and insidious. It's this invisible virus.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  And, you know, our health authorities and our mainstream media, you know, the message straight away from the outset was this is unassailable.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  I mean, even though it was a novel virus by their own assertion, it was, there's no treatment. There's nothing we can do about this.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  Not, not even fractional treatment.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  Don't even try.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  Don't even try. And so that, that I found immediately highly suspect.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And so, you know, imagine a foreign army invades and instead of our federal authorities saying, well, we're organizing some kind of, you know, a military resistance.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  If they just said, you know, there's absolutely nothing we can do about this. It's a completely unassailable army.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Resistance is futile. Everybody just shelter in place, which is what our Dallas County judge told us to do.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  And so fast forward a few months later, and I see Dr. McCullough and he's not, he's not an obscure doctor.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  I mean, he's a major public figure in our medical establishment in Dallas.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  And he's saying, no, actually, this is an, an assailable opponent. We can actually treat this thing.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  So that's when I contacted him shortly thereafter.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  I invited him to a studio interview in Dallas. It was great. The producer was electrified.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  He said, this is such a great interview. We should just post it uncut to the world.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  I put it on YouTube and then I'd say an hour later, YouTube took it down.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  Now, this was a completely sober medical academic conversation for YouTube to take that down an hour later.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  My first personal taste of there is a major censorship campaign afoot, which is another element of the book.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  How did censorship creep into the public forum in the United States with our First Amendment?
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  This is a big subject in the book.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  And so we have an organized corporate UN run policy upfront that nothing can save you except a shot that's coming.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  And then we have an organized global corporate mainstream media and big tech operation to unify censor scientists and medical doctors,
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  former chief scientist at Pfizer, inventor of mRNA, Dr. Malone, some of the others,
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  a unified blocking of the real credential professionals.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  That's where you really started seeing the organized crime.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Yes. I mean, it seems that you would want to, you know, listen to these people.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  You would actually solicit their expertise and their commentary.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  And so that was the other thing.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Like, why is there a gagging and a suppression of anyone who could actually shed some light on this?
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  But I'll go even one step further.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  You know, we're all impressed, and naturally so, medicine is a very technical thing.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  So we're impressed by academic authority, but what I was thinking again to go back to the military metaphor is,
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  you know, imagine you're a commanding general in the Pentagon,
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  and you have a Marine Second Lieutenant, you know, in Fallujah in 2004,
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  and you say, well, I understand that you're sending me situation reports from the field, but I'm not interested.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  You know, here in Washington, we don't, observational data that's coming from treating physicians in the field,
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  we're not interested in hearing that.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  And that was...
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  That's a perfect analogy, and that's, in fact, we're not just interested in hearing it.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Now we're going to silence you and target you.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  Correct, correct.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  So Vladimir Zelenko was a family doctor in New York, an independent family doctor in New York,
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  and he called the NIH.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  Stephen Hahn at the FDA, through kind of a very odd twist and turn that I document in the book,
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  told Dr. Zelenko, well, call the NIH to report your observational data about your treatment protocol.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  So he calls the NIH, and according to Dr. Zelenko, the person with whom he spoke said,
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  well, we have no channel, no means of taking an observational report from the field.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  That's what the agency's supposed to do, right?
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  You know, it was clear that from our federal agencies, CDC, NIH, FDA,
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  that there was going to be a willful blindness to any innovation in the field,
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  and there was going to be complicity in the academic institutions.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Here we are more than two years into it.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  Do you know there's not a single hospital in the United States that claims to be a center of excellence
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  for treating this illness, one of the most common reasons for hospitalization?
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  They are being paid a premium for these admissions.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  No hospital claims to be excellent at taking care of COVID-19.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  U.S. News and World Report doesn't have a ranking on who's the best.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Hospitals are not disclosing their mortality statistics,
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  and none of them have opened up outpatient treatment centers as we begin another rise in cases.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  So all of the original set Western medicine defaults that made it so great are turned off from the beginning.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  Right.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  We're going to go to Bright.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  We're going to come back in the second hour.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  This is going to be powerful information straight ahead of the book,
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  The Courage to Face COVID-19 with Dr. Peter McCullough and John Leake.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones.

[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  because a lot of people are tuned in to be on the internet.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  So I wanted you guys to just give us a prelude of some of the things we're going to cover
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  when we come back and join the rest of the audience in the book,
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  but also just their promotion of new lockdowns, monkeypox.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Give us a little prelude of what you both think.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  We're going to talk about who is behind the suppression of early therapy.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  We're going to examine how there is an abundance of evidence
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  that this was carefully organized, orchestrated and planned in advance,
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  at least as early as 2017, their motives and their methods.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  And we're going to give some historic examples in the pharmaceutical complex
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  of how it hasn't been done at the scale, at this level organization and capital,
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  but there are four runners of this that are very illustrative.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Powerful.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  Yeah, I can tell you as cases of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 are rising again in the United States,
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  the country has been injected with fear over a handful of cases of monkeypox.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  Monkeypox is related to smallpox, and this is a threat that the United States has been ready for.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Wow.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  And I read the news.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  Bill Gates says it's coming soon.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  They already buy the vaccine.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  It's delivered this week, and now it's popping up around the country and the world.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  We already have a therapy approved for this, far more important than the vaccine.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  We have Ticoviromat or T-pox.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  We have a stockpile of two million doses of this product that treats this illness.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  It's a postural-like illness.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  It doesn't spread like SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  And we'll tackle that in the next segment.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  All right.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  Let's talk more about some of the tours you've been on as well.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  And are you going to do some more tours or we'll come see you speak?
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  I was just on the Better Way conference being televised from Bath, England.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  It's actually chaired by Del Bigtree.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  But Majid Nawaz, many others on faculty there, terrific meeting.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  I've been working through a whole variety of health, freedom groups all over the country,
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  now coming up on nearly 50 large programs, going to major cities,
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  meetings with doctors, lawmakers, and then big public programs.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  America is undergoing a scientific reawakening as doctors such as myself
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  and those in my circle bring the truth to the country.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  What other observations are you going to be covering coming up, John?
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Well, you mentioned that Bill Gates is already back in business.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  I mean, with this monkeypox thing.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  We're going to talk about, he is a central figure in this.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  I mean, that's not exactly an original observation.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  What's notable is that even though it's clearly ascertainable,
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  his role in all of the malfeasance that we describe in our book,
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  it's not really in any way diminished his bully pulpit.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  The Windows guy that the U.S. Department of Justice went after in 1998
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act,
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  he's kind of back to his monopolistic ways in the biopharmaceutical calm.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  And this time, instead of giving us computers that are overpriced and crashed
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  all the time and bugs and spy tools, now he wants to control our bodies.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  Well, I mean, he was obsessed with viruses because they kept penetrating his software.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  So now he's going after them in a different arena.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  All right. In fact, we've got some clips of Bill Gates coming up.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  I'm going to read this book this weekend.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  I know it's going to be powerful.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  I'm going to order some at m4store.com,
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  but people can just type in the courage to face COVID
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  or they can go to the website, get it there, or get it at Amazon.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  Whatever you do, get it.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  And remember, folks, just because you're pretty much aware of a lot of this stuff,
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  the general public knows they're being lied to,
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  but they don't understand the organized crime nature of this.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  And a book like this will really take people to the next level.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  And again, we'll put it on screen when we come back, Dr. McCullough.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  But is the website TheCourageToFaceCOVID.com?
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  Yeah, courage tofacecovid.com.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  So just courage tofacecovid.com.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  All right, folks, start your engines.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  We're going to go to break and we're going to come back
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  and get fully into the book and then we'll get into monkeypox.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  And they're talking about more lockdowns and where all that is going.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Just in 30 seconds, Doc, I mean, I'm pretty convinced
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  that they're going to bring back more lockdowns if they can.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  Well, I reviewed it last night with Laura Ingram.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  The top states for increasing cases of COVID-19
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  are the most heavily vaccinated states.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Interesting, they're all blue states.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  Unbelievable.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  All right, we're going to be back in 60 seconds to join stations.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  We're going to plunge directly into the book.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is just like 2,000 mules
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  conclusively proving that the election was stolen.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  I can tell you from the material that Dr. McCullough has put out,
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  the same thing when it comes to COVID.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  We're going to be back in 30 seconds to join stations.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  We're going to be back in 30 seconds to join stations.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  What's happening here?
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  And so I'm asking listeners to realize that we're going to stop the next lockdown.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  We're going to stop the next force inoculations, the global ID,
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  which is all being rolled out right now.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  We need to get this book out to everybody.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  The Courage to Face COVID-19, Dr. Peter McCullough and John Leake.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Gentlemen, let's get into the book.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  I'm going to try to just sit back and shut up and just let you guys roll
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  through the different chapters and what's happening.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  Well, John kind of set the stage.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  I think since we just rolled off of Bill Gates
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  and the desire for world dominance through vaccination,
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  have John help us understand what CEPI is and how important it is?
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Yes.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  So when I began to look at what on earth is going on here,
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  this shelter in place, and what I began to observe is that the assertion,
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  okay, the virus is unassailable.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  All we can do is stay at home.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  This was oftentimes combined with a second assertion,
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  the only way we can go back to normal.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  I mean, Bill Gates himself wrote an editorial in the Washington Post
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  in early April of 2020.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Then he had a long conversation with Trevor Noah,
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  and then on his Gates blog, his Gates Notes blog,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  he kept repeating this like a mantra.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  The only thing that will enable us to go back to normal is a vaccine,
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  and it's only when every man, woman, and child on earth has taken it.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  So again, there's that monopolistic spirit.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  Like every single person on earth needs to get this vaccine,
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  and then we'll go back to normal.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  So it almost feels like a prison keeper saying,
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  you know, I have a key, and it's only when you scale this impossible height
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  can you reach the key, can you get out of here.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  It really felt like a sort of bargain that was being imposed on us from on high.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  And so I began to think, okay, this fanatical suppression of anything
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  that could treat the disease, that could provide a prophylaxis
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  or help us to get better, so it's not such a severe thing is being suppressed.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  It began to sort of take shape that it is in order,
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  it's a sigh-op in order to prepare us for mass vaccination.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  Rapidly developed, not a lot of testing.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  Gates himself said with Trevor Know, we don't even have time to test
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  to wait for the trial data to emerge.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  We need to ramp up production immediately.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  But it's safe and it's going to work, and then they admit it doesn't work
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  and erases your immune system after four or five shots.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Wow.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  It's true.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  There have been recent breaking studies showing clinically the most vaccinated people
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  are the ones who end up in the hospital sick and, heaven forbid,
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  there are still a few deaths.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  Data from Ontario show that.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  There's been a recent analysis showing those who have been previously vaccinated,
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  they get less of an antibody and immune response when they do get COVID.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  So there is an impairment of the antibody response,
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  for instance, against the nucleocapsid.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  That's been demonstrated.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  So in fact, those who have been previously vaccinated when they get COVID,
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  they are not getting a full, thrusted immune response
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  in order to defend them against the next viral attack.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  You know, what's amazing is anytime that we detect and report the truth of something
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  that organized interests don't like us detecting and reporting,
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  there is this kind of blanket all, you know, categorical bludgeon
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  that's used across the board while you're being a conspiracy theorist.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  What I think is notable about this particular massive public policy operation
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  was that they published their plan.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  They had pandemic planning simulations in 2017 and 2019,
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  and CEPI, the Center for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations,
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  which was founded by the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum in 2017,
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  CEPI actually published a business plan in which they stated,
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  another pandemic is coming, it's imminent, it's inevitable,
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  and when it comes, our partnership, it's an elaborate partnership
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  between public and private pharmaceutical industry, national treasuries,
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  when it comes, here is going to be our response.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  And it was couched in the terminology of an opportunity.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  The next pandemic will be an opportunity for our partnership.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Well, what is the opportunity?
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  The rapid development and deployment of vaccine.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  They're not in the public health business, they're in the vaccine business.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  And no mention of treatment.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  No, not one. In the 65-page business plan.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  No therapeutics.
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  No therapeutics.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  A one-pronged approach, mass vaccination, no consideration of therapeutics.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  One of the things we've seen across the entire portrayal of the pandemic
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  is a woeful blindness to treatment of acutely ill patients with this infection.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  It's not in the business plan.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  I mean, treatment is not part of the opportunity.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  So, Alex, your listeners can look at it themselves.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  It's CEPI, the Preliminary Business Plan 2017.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  Google it, it's right there, they can read it themselves.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  Absolutely, we've covered it, but it's important to bring it back up
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  because you're the famous criminologist, you know, historian best-selling author, True Crime.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  I just as a layperson looking at it, when it's all organized, it's all centralized,
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  they stand again, their fingerprints are all over making it, controlling it,
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  blocking therapeutics, silencing anybody that speaks up about it, or tries to help people.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  I mean, there's the open public conspiracy right there,
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  and everything they said five years ago and three years ago and two years ago,
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  they're following exactly as a blueprint.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  I mean, this is horrifying.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  So, in March, on March the 16th, 2020, the NIAID, Anthony Fauci's outfit at the NIH,
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  they published a press release saying Moderna and the NIAID has a new messenger RNA vaccine in development.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  We've just started our human trials, and you get about halfway down the press release,
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  and it says, you know, manufactured courtesy of CEPI.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  So, the business plan was activated immediately.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  It's like, here it is, we knew it was coming, we predicted it was coming, it's upon us,
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  the opportunity the game is on, let's go for it.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  And again, they're building the business plan years before describing exactly what would unfold.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  That's pretty open and shut.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  I mean, if I call the fire department and said, I think this house is going to burn down tomorrow,
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  and then it did, I'd be the chief suspect from the fire inspector and the police.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  Well, here they are predicting everything, and other than, again, with mouse pox or monkey pox,
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  it just seems pretty ridiculous.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  So, I'm glad that you used the fire metaphor.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  We have a chapter in our book.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  It's taking a leaf from the play in 1953 play called Biedermann and the Arsonist,
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  and it's about just this, that there's an arsonist who's a foot in this town,
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  he's burning everything down, but it's so obvious, he's out in the open.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  He looks very, they're two of them, they look very normal, they're sort of charming,
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  they're sort of funny.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  So, even though everyone knows that there are arsonists foot, they still manage to do this.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  And there's some psychology that seems to affect all of us.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  If it's out in the open, it's like people don't see it, it's hiding in plain sight.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  I think people maybe assume that an elaborate conspiracy is clandestine.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  The most dangerous ones are hiding in plain view, and that's why they do it.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  That's it.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  So, that's the behavioral psychology, which we know they had Yale and Harvard and Princeton
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  and a bunch of other psychology departments test before COVID and after how to make the
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  public shut up, how to make them stay in place, how to make them take shots.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  So, this has all been war game.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  And how to harness, manipulate and use social media to drive this campaign of mass vaccination
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  with no attention to safety or efficacy.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  We're going to break, what are we going to cover when we come back?
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  Because that was already riveting information.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  Propaganda, I think the public needs to understand just how much the public mind is being shaped
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  by propaganda, I think.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  I totally agree because what you said earlier is so profound that when they hide it in plain
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  view, we kind of buy into it because it couldn't be real.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  It doesn't look scary.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  It's a smiling guy, you know, on TV.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  But when you pull back, people are caught in it only by becoming aware of that.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  Can you shift out of it?
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  Correct.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  Correct.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  Wow.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  Okay, we're going to break the courage to face COVID.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  The website's courage to face COVID.com.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  Get the book now, folks.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  They're not advertising me.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  I want to get this book out.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  I'm going to buy a bunch of the book.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  I'm going to buy like 10,000 of them today.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  But everybody needs to get this book.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  Stay with us.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  word of mouth and prayer.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  That's what I want to thank you all for buying products like books and supplements and water
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost

[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  on the donate button and giving today.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  Please take action.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  Thank you.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  Thank you.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  Thank you.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  Thank you.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  Thank you.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  Thank you.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar.
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  You had two vaccinations and then two booster shots, is that right?
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  That's right.
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  And for people over 50 or 60, they'll probably have to be boosted every six months until
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  we get even better vaccines.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  So, I've been trying to figure this out for myself.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  I assume you know the answer to this, so I'll just ask you, when do you get boosted again?
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  Now that you've had it, I've had it around the same time.
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  I've only gotten three shots total, only been boosted once.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  I guess we have immunity for a little while, but when do you decide to get boosted again?
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  Yeah, so an infection where you'll get a high viral load would be like vaccination.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  But you know, to be safe every six months, you're probably going to be vaccinated.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  As we get more data, they might even make that shorter for people who are, you know,
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  say 60 or over 70, where the duration seems to be a bit lower.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  So we're in for ongoing vaccination to stay absolutely safe.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  So one shot will make you absolutely safe.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  Two years ago now, we just got to keep doing it.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  He sells it to you.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  He's such a philanthropist.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  You brought that clip up and the crew was able to grab it during the break, Dr. McCullough.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  The vaccines have completely failed.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  Natural immunity is infinitely more powerful and protective than vaccine immunity.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  Gates is not a doctor.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  He's wrong.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  He's pushing every six months vaccinations forever.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  And John Leak, during the break, you had a great way of putting it.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  Yeah, Cooper and Gates are acting out Einstein's definition of insanity.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  Continue to do the same thing that doesn't work while expecting a different result.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  How did they think they could do this and get away with it?
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  Because the studies were there.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  You were talking about two years ago that they would stop working, that it wouldn't work,
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  that if you gave people these shots, it would make the viruses mutate worse.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  They've both, Anderson's had three shots.
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  Gates has had four shots.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  They've just had SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 infection.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  The idea that they're going to continue to load their body with messenger RNA
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  continued deposition of spike protein, they are basically leading themselves
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  into chronic disease and misery.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  Well, I was just going to say that assumes they're being sincere.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  I mean, the point is that these guys committed to this.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  I mean, I like military history.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  I think there's an analog here with, for example, the First World War.
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  After the Franco-Prussian War, there was this prediction,
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  it's going to come to blows between Germany and France again, it's just a matter of when.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  It's probably going to happen in Belgium.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  The railroad guys, the finance guys, the weapons manufacturing,
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  the bond guys that were going to do the financing, they all agreed this is going to happen.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  It's just a matter of when.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  And then the Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  That sets the train out of the station.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  And once the train has left the station and gained a big head of steam,
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  they're not going to then throw on the brakes and say, you know,
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  something, this was a bad idea.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  It's like a massive thing that these people have committed to.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  They've got their own mass psychosis.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  Well, I mean, how do you then say, you know, we spent a gazillion dollars
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  we've been planning on this, we've been talking about how effective this is going to be.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  We're going to be the same years.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  Right.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  And then to say, oh, you know, something, it didn't work so well.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  I don't think there will ever be an admission of that.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  And on the contrary, they're going to keep saying, let's just keep doing it.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  It's like the vaccines.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  You take two and then you get a triple.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  So you're tripled down quadrupled down.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  It's going to keep going just like doubling down and tripling down on an opinion.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  Once people dig themselves in and they're wrong, they rarely,
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  rarely capitulate and say.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  And that's what they were betting on with the public is now we see, oh,
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  the unvaccinated, you're the reason we're sick.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  Well, with a real inoculation, if you have it, you're protected.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  It doesn't matter what I do.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  It's true.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  You know, health security in Scotland in the UK show the unvaccinated have the
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  greatest freedom from serious COVID-19 outcomes largely because they've already
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  had the respiratory illness.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  It's those who are vaccinated who end up in the hospital or worse.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  By the way, these, these images that you're showing of people sort of,
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  you know, celebrating their, their injections, it's very,
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  it's very reminds me very much of documentaries you see of Mao's cultural
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  revolution in China.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Get on.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  There's this kind of crazy neurotic lunacy that is then being celebrated in a mass,
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  almost quasi-religious way.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  That's what I was going to say.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  It's a cult.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  The cultural revolution.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  And then, you know, what's fascinating about the cultural revolution is we now
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  have documents of people who participate in it in a very fervent way,
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  who then kind of snapped out of the trance and have now come forward with,
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  with the testimonial.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  I don't understand why I participated in it.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  And then there's those like Xi Xi Ping who helped round up his own family and
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  let them kill his sister and help publicly shame his father.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  And he just went ahead and adapted by becoming the predator himself.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  If, if you, if you could, well, precisely, well, well put.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  So how do we counter this?
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  I mean, I think it starts with being aware that you're swimming in this sea of
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  propaganda.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  I mean, that, you know, this may seem like normalcy because of the messaging has
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  been so relentless.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  But once you realize a normal is being created when you turn on the television,
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  quit, quit accepting that that television is an accurate representation of reality.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  You need to start, you need to start listening to Alex Jones.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  And I mean, all I say is they should question everything we're saying.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  We try to give articles and documents.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  I make mistakes.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  I'm not perfect, but I'm not trying to lie.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  But what is the corporate meeting going to do?
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  Because the polls show all time, no support, Biden, all time, no support,
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  all time, low support for just vaccines in general, even real ones that work.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  This is discrediting the entire medical system.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  I remember a year and a half ago, the British Ministry of Health warned,
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  if this hurts people, this is going to set back vaccines a hundred years.
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  No one's going to believe us.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  Well, what they've done is really discredit themselves in my view.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  It certainly is true.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  And one of the things that we've done, we've presented so much information, Alex,
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  you and I together in so many different ways.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  One of the things we've done that's unique in this book is that we've told a story.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  We've actually told it in a narrative format where there's a beginning,
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  there's a middle, and the end.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  And as John will tell you, that's how the human mind understands complex realities.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  Yeah, well, I think we're accustomed to seeing figures of public authority,
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  and they're sort of talking in these somber academic tones about the data.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  What our book shows, I think when I ask readers for their feedback,
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  they really like the chapters about ordinary guys and their families who get sick.
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  And some of the stories we tell are the success stories.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  They found doctors like McCullough and his colleagues who were very proactive in treating.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  And a lot of these people were really pulled back from a terrible emergency.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  Then I tell the other side, the tragic side, where in spite of the desperate pleadings
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  of their family members, treatment is denied to the end.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  And this isn't fiction. This really happened.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  It really happened.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  And what a lot of people, including attorneys with whom I've spoken,
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  advocates for families, is that even seasoned attorneys,
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  there is a lady named Beth Parlato who was a criminal court judge in New York State.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  She said, you know, as a matter of fact and law, it's impenetrable to me
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  that some of these treatment modalities that seem to work,
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  that the hospitals have fought tooth and nail.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  Finish that story when we come back. The break's stuck up on us. Stay there.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  that turbocharge and boost our stamina, our energy, our libido
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  are also amazing pre or post workouts.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  And we went out and looked at the top brands, the top reviews,
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  and came out with alpha power.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  Now, it's so hard to source good, clean herbs like we have in this
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  that it's been sold out for more than six months,
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  but now alpha power is back in stock at infowarstore.com at 40% off.

[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years

[2:31:57.280 --> 2:32:00.480]  There is very little contemporary study
[2:32:00.480 --> 2:32:04.200]  in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[2:32:04.200 --> 2:32:07.280]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico,
[2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:09.880]  not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:13.440]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:32:13.440 --> 2:32:15.320]  And that's done by design.
[2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:18.280]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:21.400]  will penalize and target any academics
[2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:24.560]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment
[2:32:24.560 --> 2:32:25.760]  that founded the Bilderberg Group,
[2:32:25.760 --> 2:32:27.960]  the Trilateral Commission of the United Nations,
[2:32:27.960 --> 2:32:31.200]  a whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:33.640]  Until 10 years ago, the media said
[2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:35.440]  the control corporate media of the Bilderberg Group
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:37.000]  didn't exist.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:38.680]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public,
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:41.760]  its former head, still on the steering committee,
[2:32:41.760 --> 2:32:43.960]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:45.960]  the great reset in global government.
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:48.400]  If, as a liberty movement worldwide,
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:50.760]  we don't address the globalist head on
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:52.200]  about the fact that they are a worldwide
[2:32:52.200 --> 2:32:54.040]  authoritarian corporate takeover,
[2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:54.880]  we don't have a shot.
[2:32:54.880 --> 2:32:57.040]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:32:59.320 --> 2:33:02.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:33:02.160 --> 2:33:05.720]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:09.880 --> 2:33:14.880]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:17.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:20.720]  And Dr. Peter McCullough and John Leake,
[2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:23.280]  he's a best-selling true crime author
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:26.600]  that has reverse engineered their operations
[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:28.160]  and that you guys are knocking out of the park
[2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:29.920]  describing what really went on.
[2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:31.400]  You want to get more into the propaganda,
[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:33.080]  we're also gonna talk some about Bill Gates
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:36.960]  predicting the smallpox, monkeypox, and so much more.
[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:40.040]  You know, I can tell you that we've never had
[2:33:40.040 --> 2:33:43.440]  so much news regarding microbial threats
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:47.040]  to the human population and one can only
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:50.480]  surmise that so much of this is contrived.
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:53.680]  There's a lot of hype, and as you said earlier, John,
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:55.880]  it's a PR sales campaign, so when you see
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:33:58.200]  a PR sales campaign for like the new Mustang,
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:00.440]  you know the new Mustang's coming out or the new Tesla,
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:02.000]  and they're just telling you the new thing's coming,
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.240]  we're gonna take all your rides, we're gonna save you.
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:07.840]  Yeah, you know, they call it a funny friend of ours
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:11.240]  out in Utah, said the other day,
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:13.920]  they call it Operation Warp Speed,
[2:34:13.920 --> 2:34:18.200]  it's actually Operation Warp Spend, it's Warp Spend.
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:23.200]  So public health crisis, mass fear, everybody's terrified,
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:27.520]  oh my goodness, you know, we'll do anything we can
[2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:31.000]  to, you know, any kind of, no matter how much it costs,
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.400]  get out the checkbook, start printing.
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:37.520]  So it triggers, like the financial crisis in OA,
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:41.720]  it triggers a flood of money purportedly
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:45.080]  to deal with the emergencies, so that what happens,
[2:34:45.080 --> 2:34:45.920]  is it because-
[2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:47.000]  How many trillions extra got issued
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:48.480]  by the major governments?
[2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:50.360]  Has anybody, if you quantify, I haven't done it.
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:51.920]  How many trillions got issued worldwide
[2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:53.040]  by different governments?
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:58.040]  So the CARES Act of March 26, 2020 created,
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:03.680]  overnight, 10% of the US GDP, just like that.
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:05.680]  Just with a click of a-
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:07.480]  I wonder why we have inflation.
[2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:10.320]  Right, and then so, but just think of the bonanza, though.
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:13.680]  If you are positioned, as these guys were,
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:18.240]  because they'd been working on the planning of this,
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:20.200]  publishing their prospectus-
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:22.680]  They're in control of the World Medical Response.
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:25.120]  Correct, so all of this money,
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:28.080]  you have then positioned your nets,
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.800]  you're like a fisherman who's ready for the school
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:32.280]  to swim right in your nets.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:34.840]  So they got away with this,
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:37.920]  and here we have the same guys,
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:42.840]  the usual suspects, they're at it again with monkeypox.
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:46.120]  Here we go, the news just popped.
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:49.600]  Monkeypox, an orthopox virus
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.520]  that is in the same family as smallpox,
[2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:56.440]  causes a postular type of illness,
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:57.920]  a skin-based illness,
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:35:59.880]  and a very little respiratory component,
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:02.080]  and it's from animals to humans.
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:04.640]  There's been, over the last half century,
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:06.680]  several hundred cases, listen to this out,
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:10.400]  700 cases, since there's a case in the United States,
[2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:15.400]  the announcement was 13 million doses
[2:36:15.920 --> 2:36:18.920]  of a pre-manufactured live-attenuated vaccine
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:19.880]  for monkeypox.
[2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:23.560]  Boy, they sure guessed right on that.
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:26.760]  That's a hyperbolic response.
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:30.640]  Can you imagine the company that hasn't had any sales
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:32.400]  on their monkeypox vaccine,
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:35.120]  getting in infusion of millions of dollars of cash?
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:36.160]  And it's interesting,
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:37.840]  in a paper in New England Journal of Medicine
[2:36:37.840 --> 2:36:39.400]  by Grossenbeck and colleagues,
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:42.440]  when they studied an oral drug
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:44.360]  that we also have for monkeypox,
[2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:48.640]  called a tizovizumac, virumac, or also known as t-pox,
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:52.080]  when t-pox was studied in the introduction to that paper,
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:55.360]  it was stated a single case of smallpox
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:58.160]  would be a worldwide crisis
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:01.320]  because of this charged fear
[2:37:01.320 --> 2:37:04.720]  that the poxviruses were gonna be specifically used
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:06.080]  for bioterrorism.
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:07.360]  And there's Gates hyping it.
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:10.000]  In fact, let's play the clip of Bill Gates
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:11.840]  last year saying, this is coming,
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:13.120]  there's gonna be a bigger attack,
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:15.800]  something like the poxvirus, and now it's happened.
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:18.960]  And so I'm hoping in five years,
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:20.600]  I can write a book called,
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:22.320]  We Are Ready for the Next Pandemic,
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:25.720]  but it'll take tens of billions in R&D
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:30.400]  that the US and the UK will be part of that.
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:33.280]  It'll take probably about a billion a year
[2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:37.400]  for a pandemic task force at the WHO level,
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:38.840]  which is doing the surveillance
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:40.760]  and actually doing what I call germ games,
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:42.600]  where you practice, you say, okay,
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:47.600]  what if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports?
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:50.680]  How would the world respond to that?
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:54.200]  There's now to really caused epidemics
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:56.120]  and bioterrorism caused epidemics
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:01.080]  that could even be way worse than what we experienced today.
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:03.400]  And yet the advances in medical science
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:08.160]  should give us tools that we could do dramatically better.
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:10.680]  So you'd think this would be a priority.
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:15.440]  The next year will be where those allocations
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:20.240]  have to get made, including this global pandemic task force.
[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:24.520]  So he tells us the next big thing in November of last year,
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:26.160]  and now, like clockwork, it's here
[2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:27.240]  and they've got the vaccine ready.
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:29.360]  Wow, that doesn't look suspicious.
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:31.880]  Fortunately, there's an oral medication.
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:35.800]  We have a stockpile of two million doses.
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:39.440]  Almost all these cases come out of the Congo Basin.
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:42.400]  And there was an outbreak in 2003 in the United States,
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:44.280]  70 cases where there was some mixing
[2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:46.720]  of some different animals in pet stores,
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:48.680]  actually from that part of Africa,
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:50.280]  and it did spread to humans.
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:52.080]  But it's self-limited, Alex.
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:54.240]  It's easily treated with these drugs.
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:38:56.320]  It's mainly a cutaneous skin lesion.
[2:38:56.320 --> 2:38:59.000]  The only mortality that occurs is in regions
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.760]  where there is no general medical care support
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:05.920]  when patients do get more ill, get dehydrated, et cetera.
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:09.360]  But people should really examine this very closely though.
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:14.360]  I mean, suddenly he's talking about this monkeypox.
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:17.400]  I mean, I remember looking in a tropical disease book
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:19.760]  years ago, I used to hang out in Africa,
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:21.960]  and those same pictures of those children
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.120]  that were infected with it,
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:25.040]  those are 30 years old.
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:29.960]  And then suddenly he's talking about the next bonanza
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:30.960]  that's headed our way.
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:32.960]  And then just what prescience?
[2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:35.520]  What, and then, so I don't know if you guys remember,
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:38.920]  it was 2003, there were guinea pigs
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:42.200]  that were housed with Ghana paltrats.
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:45.160]  I mean, what kind of bizarre pets that people have.
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:48.400]  The guinea pigs got it from the Ghana paltrats
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:49.800]  that were brought in from Africa.
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:51.920]  And then it spread to about 70 people
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:53.720]  in the United States.
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:39:56.560]  There was no hysteria and talk of we need
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:39:59.400]  to buy 32 million doses of vaccines.
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:03.480]  We have now been conditioned to be hypervigilant
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:06.240]  and hyperalert to this kind of thing.
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:08.240]  We're being turned into hysterical...
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:09.080]  Nenies.
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:12.720]  Exactly, what's the word, hypochondriacs?
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:14.920]  It's true, I have to tell ya.
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:18.240]  You have such a lead time on this illness.
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:20.880]  There should be absolutely no panic.
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:23.000]  It's almost analogous to chickenpox
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:26.360]  and someone having lots of a postular vesicular lesions.
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:27.840]  It's readily identified.
[2:40:27.840 --> 2:40:29.600]  We can manage this.
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:31.400]  The treatment is actually very well tolerated.
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:34.000]  Teapox drug taken twice a day is perfectly fine.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.080]  We don't need 13 million doses of a vaccine
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:37.920]  and have people start to...
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:38.960]  Clearly, it's more hysteria.
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:43.960]  What about the studies and links that we've seen?
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:45.640]  And I was talking to Dr. Fleming last week
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:48.840]  and he was saying that the type of virus that they use
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:53.840]  in the virus vector J and J and others is linked to...
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  And I've got some of the studies,
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.600]  but I'm not a scientist like you, doctor,
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:02.320]  that that's causing these weird, acute types of hepatitis
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:03.400]  and children's livers.
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:04.840]  It's related, but not causative.
[2:41:04.840 --> 2:41:06.360]  And I'd look at it this way.
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:11.840]  In a recent paper in Lancet, hepatology from the UK
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:13.880]  and actually from Cedars-Sinai and LA,
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:16.720]  the authors describe that virtually all of these cases
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:19.560]  are hepatitis, the children are exposed in some way
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:22.080]  to SARS-CoV-2, either they've had the infection,
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:23.680]  people in their family have had the infection
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:24.760]  or have taken a vaccine
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:26.440]  or the children have taken the vaccine.
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:29.600]  That's actually setting up the childhood liver
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:32.000]  with a Wuhan spike protein.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.280]  And then there's a superimposed exposure
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:37.920]  from adenovirus 41, which is typically very mild.
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:41.200]  Now, adenoviral vectors are used in Johnson, Johnson
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:44.880]  and J and J, but it's probably not related to these cases.
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:46.560]  What we need to do in each and every case
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:49.880]  is we need to understand what is the SARS-CoV-2 exposure
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:52.280]  to the children in order to find a path forward.
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:53.720]  Some of these cases have resulted
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:55.520]  in transplants, some have been fatal.
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:41:59.360]  The other thing that before we get too far away from it
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:01.920]  that I wanted to talk about was
[2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:06.160]  there are clear precedents for what we're seeing.
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:09.680]  In 2001, about three weeks before Dr. McCullough
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:12.200]  was interviewed by Tucker Carlson,
[2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:15.080]  there was a huge book that was published
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:17.960]  here in the United States called Empire of Pain.
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:21.160]  It was a publishing sensation.
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:23.280]  It's about the Sackler family of New York
[2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:25.800]  that started Purdue Pharma.
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:26.640]  And it-
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:27.480]  Oxycontin.
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:29.840]  Oxycontin, and it's a marvelous book.
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:32.200]  I mean, hats off to the writer.
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:36.080]  He describes how this very clever family-
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:38.040]  Hold on, John Lee, let's talk about the parallels
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:39.360]  with this when we come back.
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:41.080]  We've got two more seconds for our amazing guests.
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:44.240]  Then the amazing Mike Adams is gonna be taking over
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:45.280]  in the fourth hour.
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:47.480]  Owen Schreuer, The War Room, 3 p.m. Central,

[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:52.800]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:57.440]  Now take action and get your bottle of Ultra 12.
[2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:00.520]  The globalist social engineers always intended
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:04.920]  to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:08.080]  until the populations rebelled.
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:10.480]  They would then use that as the pretext
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:13.640]  for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:44:13.640 --> 2:44:17.040]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:19.280]  But because of so many scientists and engineers
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:21.800]  and researchers and others coming public
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:24.880]  and whistleblowers, now their whole project
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:27.760]  is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:31.920]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:35.280]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.400]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:39.520]  are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:43.480]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:46.960]  in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:48.720]  are following suit like Australia.
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:50.640]  So pray for these folks big time.
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:52.520]  It's a very serious situation.
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:54.600]  And stay tuned into nFoWars.com
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:56.520]  because truth is absolutely bare-mount.

[2:45:00.920 --> 2:45:03.640]  You have made history in your support of nFoWars.
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:06.680]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:09.920]  and override the censors has been patriot apparel
[2:45:09.920 --> 2:45:12.440]  so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[2:45:12.440 --> 2:45:15.680]  and so we can push people to websites like nFoWars.com
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:17.720]  so they can understand the globalist plan
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:18.840]  and how to stop it.
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:20.720]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:23.160]  we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:25.480]  some of which go back more than 25 years.
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:26.800]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:28.080]  They are about to be history.
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:30.840]  And will only exist in your closet, your drawer,
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:31.880]  or your wardrobe.
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:35.560]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:37.200]  In a couple of weeks, they'll all be gone
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:38.200]  and they'll be history.
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:42.920]  We're selling them all at cost at nFoWarsStore.com.
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:44.680]  So thank you all for your support.

[2:46:56.920 --> 2:46:59.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:46:59.920 --> 2:47:03.920]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:14.920 --> 2:47:18.920]  The precedent with Purdue Pharma and OxyCotton
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:22.920]  co-author, John Leek, of the powerful new book The COVID,
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:24.920]  The Courage to Face COVID-19,
[2:47:24.920 --> 2:47:28.920]  you were getting into a parallel if this has happened before.
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:32.920]  Yeah, so in the midst of all this madness in 2021,
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:36.920]  this big book is published called Empire of Pain
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:39.920]  about the Sackler family of New York,
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:42.920]  which acquired a small pharmaceutical company
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:44.920]  back in the 50s.
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:48.920]  Arthur Sackler was the sort of founder of the family
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:51.920]  and he started off in the advertising business
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:54.920]  doing ads for Pfizer.
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:47:57.920]  He had a real knack for medical propaganda,
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:00.920]  for biopharmaceutical propaganda.
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:03.920]  I mean, pretty much all of the bag of tricks
[2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:08.920]  of marketing drugs now was invented,
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:10.920]  pioneered by Arthur Sackler.
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:13.920]  He then realized, you know, I shouldn't be advertising this stuff.
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:15.920]  I ought to get in on the action myself.
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:18.920]  So he purchased this company, Purdue,
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:21.920]  and then they discovered this molecule
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:24.920]  that had actually been invented back in Germany in the 20s,
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:27.920]  was deemed to have at a high addiction risk
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:29.920]  by the lab that invented it.
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:31.920]  They said this isn't going to work.
[2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:34.920]  So Sackler and it was actually his brothers,
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:36.920]  they said, well, you know, this is great,
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:40.920]  let's market this and let's downplay the addiction risk.
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:44.920]  Let's obscure the potential harm of this.
[2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:46.920]  And it's a fascinating book
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:49.920]  because you see how through academics,
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:54.920]  through FDA approval guys who were captured,
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:57.920]  how they were able to introduce this dangerous molecule,
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:01.920]  which then became an enormous scourge of American society.
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:03.920]  And it was actually marketed through nursing.
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:05.920]  I remember as a young doctor,
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:07.920]  where nurses started these initiatives
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:09.920]  as paying as the fifth vital sign
[2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:12.920]  and actually trying to grade pain on each and every patient,
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:14.920]  even in non-painful conditions,
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:19.920]  we were somewhat pushed and forced to prescribe narcotics
[2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:21.920]  actually to patients post-procedure.
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:22.920]  This really took off.
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:24.920]  Oh yeah, I mean, I've had five or six surgeries
[2:49:24.920 --> 2:49:26.920]  and every time they're like, do you want painkillers
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:28.920]  or you're in pain, I'm like, no, I don't want them.
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:30.920]  I was in a minor surfing accident,
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:34.920]  which I got cut by the surfboard fan.
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:37.920]  It was very easy laceration to treat.
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:38.920]  They stuck some staples in it.
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:41.920]  And as I was walking out of the ER,
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:44.920]  this nurse says, you want anything for the pain?
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:46.920]  And I said, well, what do you have in mind?
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:47.920]  They're drug dealers.
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:49.920]  I mean, for all she knew, I was an addict
[2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:52.920]  that was intentionally cut myself in order.
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:55.920]  So, I mean, but the point is this,
[2:49:55.920 --> 2:49:59.920]  an extremely harmful molecule
[2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:02.920]  that is then spread on a mass scale
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:04.920]  throughout our entire society,
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:08.920]  creating a true public health emergency.
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:13.920]  I mean, by the declaration of the CDC in 2017,
[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:16.920]  a public, and you think, well, how did this
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:19.920]  over all of these years, how is it obscured?
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:22.920]  How come the mainstream media wasn't reporting on this?
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:26.920]  It was sort of a silent scourge.
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:28.920]  And that's because they are owned by Big Pharma
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:29.920]  and they're just going along.
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:31.920]  Correct.
[2:50:31.920 --> 2:50:34.920]  I guess you're familiar with Dr. Peter Bragan.
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:36.920]  I mean, he told me something that I just thought
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:38.920]  was so illuminating.
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:41.920]  He said, you know, I used to get invited to go
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:44.920]  onto, you know, the Oprah Winfrey show,
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:47.920]  all of these shows to talk about my work.
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:48.920]  This is Peter Bragan.
[2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:51.920]  He's a psychiatrist who's delved deeply
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:55.920]  into the abusive practices of the pharmaceutical industry
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:50:58.920]  and the psychiatric industry.
[2:50:58.920 --> 2:51:00.920]  And he said, I used to get invited all the time
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:03.920]  to talk about my alternative viewpoint
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:05.920]  on the practice of medicine.
[2:51:05.920 --> 2:51:09.920]  And I believe it was the year 1997,
[2:51:09.920 --> 2:51:12.920]  the FDA loosened the regulatory language
[2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:15.920]  with direct marketing on television
[2:51:15.920 --> 2:51:17.920]  for pharmaceutical products.
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:19.920]  And he said, I never got an invitation to appear
[2:51:19.920 --> 2:51:21.920]  on television ever again.
[2:51:21.920 --> 2:51:22.920]  That's right.
[2:51:22.920 --> 2:51:25.920]  Everybody's got stories of a wife or family
[2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:27.920]  that has a baby, never had problems.
[2:51:27.920 --> 2:51:29.920]  They go, oh, you want some psychotropics in this
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:31.920]  and then they've got big problems after.
[2:51:31.920 --> 2:51:34.920]  And it's just, it's incredible what's going on.
[2:51:34.920 --> 2:51:35.920]  It's true.
[2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:38.920]  And unfortunately with the COVID-19 vaccines,
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:40.920]  so many Americans have been injured.
[2:51:40.920 --> 2:51:42.920]  And sadly, they've seen loved ones die,
[2:51:42.920 --> 2:51:47.920]  that there's been trust lost in the entire vaccine program.
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:49.920]  And there are very safe and effective vaccines
[2:51:49.920 --> 2:51:51.920]  that doctors in my circles,
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:53.920]  we've relied on these for our entire career,
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:55.920]  but the public is now losing trust.
[2:51:55.920 --> 2:51:57.920]  We'll do five more minutes to the next hour,
[2:51:57.920 --> 2:51:58.920]  but some stations don't carry that
[2:51:58.920 --> 2:51:59.920]  and my condom sticks over.
[2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:02.920]  So in the six minutes we have left the amazing book,
[2:52:02.920 --> 2:52:04.920]  The Courage to Face COVID-19,
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:06.920]  John Lee, Dr. Peter A. McCullough,
[2:52:06.920 --> 2:52:08.920]  closing comments, both of you,
[2:52:08.920 --> 2:52:10.920]  like three minutes apiece.
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:13.920]  I would say that as we look to the future,
[2:52:13.920 --> 2:52:16.920]  we are going to have more cases of COVID-19.
[2:52:16.920 --> 2:52:18.920]  There's no doubt about it.
[2:52:18.920 --> 2:52:20.920]  Cases are on the rise.
[2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:22.920]  For those of you who have already had the infection,
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:25.920]  your natural protection you have now,
[2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:27.920]  you're protected against severe outcomes.
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:30.920]  Can you have another case that is like a mild,
[2:52:30.920 --> 2:52:33.920]  like a common cold, that's certainly true.
[2:52:33.920 --> 2:52:35.920]  Those of you who've taken the vaccine,
[2:52:35.920 --> 2:52:37.920]  one shot, two shots, or even more,
[2:52:37.920 --> 2:52:40.920]  you are still susceptible to COVID-19
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:42.920]  and in fact, you could have potentially
[2:52:42.920 --> 2:52:44.920]  more severe outcomes.
[2:52:44.920 --> 2:52:48.920]  My practice experience is that both high-risk patients,
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:52.920]  older, those with diabetes, obesity, heart and lung disease,
[2:52:52.920 --> 2:52:54.920]  those who are presenting with severe symptoms,
[2:52:54.920 --> 2:52:57.920]  early treatment is needed starting with
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:53:00.920]  virus-side or nasal washes with hydrogen peroxide
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:02.920]  or pavadone iodine.
[2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:05.920]  There's commercial products that work well there as well.
[2:53:05.920 --> 2:53:08.920]  Use of nutraceuticals and supplements
[2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:10.920]  that are used in a combination.
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:12.920]  We have monoclonal antibodies.
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:15.920]  I had two patients yesterday to get monoclonal antibodies
[2:53:15.920 --> 2:53:18.920]  brought to Libimab from Lillie.
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:20.920]  Works perfectly fine at 2CC injection.
[2:53:20.920 --> 2:53:22.920]  Then we move into the oral drugs, hydroxychloroquine,
[2:53:22.920 --> 2:53:23.920]  ivermectin.
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:25.920]  We have pexilvoid, monopiravir,
[2:53:25.920 --> 2:53:28.920]  oral corticosteroids, aspirin, and then anticoagulants.
[2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:31.920]  Sequence multi-drug therapy at home
[2:53:31.920 --> 2:53:34.920]  prevents hospitalization and death with COVID.
[2:53:34.920 --> 2:53:35.920]  Don't get burned.
[2:53:35.920 --> 2:53:37.920]  Don't be a hospital statistic.
[2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:40.920]  Or even worse, we can get through this together.
[2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:42.920]  So people should study this, look it up themselves,
[2:53:42.920 --> 2:53:44.920]  and create a diary of the facts.
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:47.920]  And if they can, legally stockpile some of the therapeutics
[2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:48.920]  ahead of time.
[2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:50.920]  And as soon as you have symptoms,
[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:53.920]  take care of yourself then instead of waiting later.
[2:53:53.920 --> 2:53:56.920]  And make sure your doctor is ready to treat you.
[2:53:56.920 --> 2:53:59.920]  And if your doctor is not, make sure you get a referral.
[2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:00.920]  That's the key.
[2:54:00.920 --> 2:54:01.920]  Find the doctors.
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:03.920]  They're having to pass state laws
[2:54:03.920 --> 2:54:05.920]  that doctors are allowed to prescribe ivermectin
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:07.920]  and things they're totally known to be safe.
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:08.920]  That's right.
[2:54:08.920 --> 2:54:10.920]  Now, New Hampshire and Tennessee are nearly over the finish line
[2:54:10.920 --> 2:54:12.920]  for over-the-counter ivermectin.
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:15.920]  But there's been such a broad support now for early treatment.
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:16.920]  Let's push hard.
[2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:18.920]  If the patients push hard and push their doctors,
[2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:20.920]  we'll get back to some degree of normalcy.
[2:54:20.920 --> 2:54:22.920]  Well, I haven't read the book yet.
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:23.920]  I read the synopsis in it.
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:25.920]  It just tells you real-world stories, how they did it,
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:28.920]  how they're suppressing it, and then you better get ready.
[2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:32.920]  So in these pandemic preparation simulations,
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:34.920]  there was one that was done at Johns Hopkins
[2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:37.920]  in October of 2019.
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:41.920]  If you go deep into this incredibly boring video,
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:43.920]  one of the things that they talk about is,
[2:54:43.920 --> 2:54:45.920]  okay, it's coming.
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:47.920]  How are we going to control information?
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:51.920]  And they actually talk about tried and true methods
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:52.920]  of propaganda.
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:57.920]  One of them that they discuss and endorse is called flooding.
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:55:01.920]  So this is what we want the populists to believe,
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:04.920]  and we're going to flood all of the channels
[2:55:04.920 --> 2:55:09.920]  with the same messaging, rapidly broadcast over all media.
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:10.920]  That's a military tactic.
[2:55:10.920 --> 2:55:11.920]  Flood the zone.
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:12.920]  Flood the zone.
[2:55:12.920 --> 2:55:15.920]  So you see, for example, with ivermectin,
[2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:18.920]  the guys who discovered it and developed it,
[2:55:18.920 --> 2:55:20.920]  they won the Nobel Prize in 2015.
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:24.920]  It is a WHO essential medication.
[2:55:24.920 --> 2:55:27.920]  It has solved one of the largest scourges
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:29.920]  that has ever affected the problem.
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:30.920]  It's not just horse paste.
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:34.920]  Across the zone, they flooded the zone,
[2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:38.920]  all of the late night comedy guys on the same night,
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:40.920]  horse paste, horse goo.
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:47.920]  And you think, do we live in a country with a first amendment
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:50.920]  and with a free exchange of ideas?
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:54.920]  Or are we living in a propaganda?
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:55:58.920]  And I think it's clear that the public needs to be aware
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:00.920]  that they are being propagandized.
[2:56:00.920 --> 2:56:02.920]  And I'll conclude with this, if I may.
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:05.920]  The public should familiarize themselves
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:09.920]  with President Eisenhower's 1961 farewell address
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:11.920]  in which he talked about the danger
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:14.920]  of the military-industrial complex.
[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:17.920]  These things get so big with so much money
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:21.920]  and so many interests that are gaining
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:24.920]  from sustaining this threat level.
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:26.920]  And he was a military man himself.
[2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:28.920]  He was the supreme allied commander.
[2:56:28.920 --> 2:56:29.920]  He'd been a commander.
[2:56:29.920 --> 2:56:30.920]  Right.
[2:56:30.920 --> 2:56:34.920]  So when he says, these things, these complexes
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:38.920]  can become so powerful and have such vast entrenched interests
[2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:41.920]  that they can become disconnected from the interest
[2:56:41.920 --> 2:56:43.920]  of the citizenry.
[2:56:43.920 --> 2:56:47.920]  I think we need to think of Eisenhower's warning
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:51.920]  but apply it to the analog of this biopharmaceutical complex.
[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:55.920]  We actually took that concept from Eisenhower's concept
[2:56:55.920 --> 2:56:57.920]  of the military-industrial.
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:00.920]  And the biopharmaceutical complex is very wired in
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:02.920]  with the Department of Defense.
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:07.920]  A lot of these emergency countermeasure activities
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:10.920]  and financing is part of the Department of Defense.
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:13.920]  Well, John Lee, I'm really impressed with your work.
[2:57:13.920 --> 2:57:15.920]  I've actually read some of your books years ago
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:17.920]  that collect one of what you were here.
[2:57:17.920 --> 2:57:19.920]  Congratulations on the courage to face COVID-19.
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:22.920]  And he also went on before he said military-industrial complex.
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:26.920]  He said a technological scientific elite that's in control of it.
[2:57:26.920 --> 2:57:29.920]  And that full speech, 21 Minutes Long, is so powerful.
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:31.920]  We'll do five more minutes on the other side.
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:33.920]  And then Mike Adams takes over.
[2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:36.920]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:38.920]  It's all you, the great listeners, and your support
[2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:40.920]  about the prayer that keeps us on air.

[2:58:17.920 --> 2:58:21.920]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:25.920]  and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:27.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply
[2:58:27.920 --> 2:58:30.920]  and it's been sold out for months because the supply chain right downs.
[2:58:30.920 --> 2:58:34.920]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week
[2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:36.920]  than it goes back to full price.
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:38.920]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[2:58:54.920 --> 2:58:56.920]  and the fact that we're not caught flat footed
[2:58:56.920 --> 2:58:59.920]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:02.920]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[3:00:07.920 --> 3:00:13.920]  The courage to face COVID-19, John Leake and Dr. Peter McCullough.
[3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:17.920]  We were going in the break there and you were talking about just all these different angles
[3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:19.920]  and the things that are going on.
[3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:24.920]  But the ivermectin propaganda where Rolling Stone and then thousands of other publications
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:29.920]  showed people lined up in the winter, not even wearing masks.
[3:00:29.920 --> 3:00:31.920]  It was some stock photo.
[3:00:31.920 --> 3:00:33.920]  Hospitals seeing hundreds had died.
[3:00:33.920 --> 3:00:35.920]  Thousands were there overdosing in Oklahoma.
[3:00:35.920 --> 3:00:37.920]  There was a doctor on that hadn't worked in the hospital in years.
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:39.920]  We called the hospital.
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:41.920]  Nobody had been sick. Nobody died.
[3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:43.920]  It was just completely made up.
[3:00:43.920 --> 3:00:45.920]  It was Joe Rogan who told me about it when it first sent me an image.
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:47.920]  He goes, what do you see wrong with this?
[3:00:47.920 --> 3:00:51.920]  I called him and I said, well, it's like July and they're wearing coats and stuff
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:53.920]  and they're not wearing masks.
[3:00:53.920 --> 3:00:56.920]  He goes, yeah, nobody believes there's thousands dying or whatever
[3:00:56.920 --> 3:00:58.920]  and thousands lined up.
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:00.920]  And of course they had to admit later it was fake.
[3:01:00.920 --> 3:01:02.920]  I mean, this is insane.
[3:01:02.920 --> 3:01:09.920]  Well, and then there was this, it's like people don't realize how far
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:12.920]  they've under the influence of propaganda.
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:16.920]  They don't realize how far they've diverged from just decency and normalcy.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:20.920]  Jimmy Kimmel joked in September of last year,
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:23.920]  you know, if you go to a hospital and you're unvaccinated
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:27.920]  and you've been eating horse goo, just let them die.
[3:01:27.920 --> 3:01:30.920]  I mean, he tried to couch this in humor.
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:33.920]  I mean, maybe if his delivery had been better, but it just wasn't.
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:36.920]  They're saying you're a subhuman if you seek therapeutics.
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:37.920]  Howard Stern said that.
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:41.920]  He said, if an unvaccinated person comes to the hospital with any condition,
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:44.920]  they should be denied treatment and die.
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:45.920]  So does Schwarzenegger.
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:51.920]  I can tell you as a doctor, I take care of drug abusers, alcoholics,
[3:01:51.920 --> 3:01:55.920]  obese people with diabetes, people haven't taken care of themselves.
[3:01:55.920 --> 3:02:00.920]  Whether they're vaccinated or unvaccinated, they get equal and high quality care
[3:02:00.920 --> 3:02:04.920]  under my direction in any good doctor in America.
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:08.920]  We will not tolerate any forms of discrimination.
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:11.920]  And so how bad is it that they're not just introducing on a late night comedy?
[3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:13.920]  In Europe, they're introducing.
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:16.920]  If you don't do what we say and take these shots, you're barred healthcare.
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:22.920]  You know, we are at a stage where if people don't stand up for their rights,
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:27.920]  everyone has the right to high quality healthcare, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:36.920]  And they have a right to abolish propaganda out of their spheres of viewing.
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:42.920]  We have to call it Ivermectin over 80 supportive clinical studies, over 35 clinical trials.
[3:02:42.920 --> 3:02:47.920]  And even the studies that are stopped early and declared to be, quote, neutral,
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:49.920]  there's always an advantage to Ivermectin.
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:51.920]  It's safer than Tylenol.
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:02:54.920]  We relied upon worldwide, and we should stick with it.
[3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:57.920]  It's quite a valuable drug, particularly in the Omicron variant.
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:01.920]  Well, we now know that the White House, and that's something Trump was involved in,
[3:03:01.920 --> 3:03:07.920]  and Biden got worse, writing the scripts for the media and the comedy in Hollywood
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:11.920]  to create the flooding of the zone to just put out ridiculing anybody that wanted to try to...
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:18.920]  I mean, they had FBI raid medical clinics in Michigan that were giving people IVs of vitamin D3 and vitamin C.
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:24.920]  Yeah, they had a video up in the Dakotas where a man was trying to get Ivermectin into his loved one in the hospital,
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:26.920]  and they actually frisked him.
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:29.920]  They actually tried to see if he had the Ivermectin on him.
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:31.920]  And there are heroic stories, there's some in our book about this,
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:35.920]  about how people are shuttling Ivermectin in the hospital, how the courts are trying to block it.
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:42.920]  Do you know the American Medical Association has an official campaign to abolish the use of Ivermectin?
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:52.920]  Now, since when does this medical political action committee, essentially, take on a goal to abolish the use of a drug that's safe and effective?
[3:03:52.920 --> 3:03:54.920]  This is big pharma completely out of control.
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:59.920]  You guys are going to take an hour break, the war rooms at 3 p.m. after Mike Adams takes over.
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:00.920]  You're going to cover a lot of this.
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:04.920]  What else are you going to be covering on the war room today without an destroyer at 3 p.m.?
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:12.920]  Well, I would like to go further into some of these methods of propaganda.
[3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:21.920]  And then the other thing that I would like to go into is more of some of the historical precedents for how science,
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:26.920]  or what masquerades of science or proclaims itself to be scientists,
[3:04:26.920 --> 3:04:32.920]  has undertaken some of these major public health initiatives that we now look back at in horror.
[3:04:32.920 --> 3:04:33.920]  Like eugenics.
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:36.920]  Like eugenics or lobotomies.
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:37.920]  Electroshock.
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:38.920]  Electroshock.
[3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:44.920]  So things that, you know, the head of Harvard Neurology in 1970 was publicly advocating,
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:46.920]  we now look back at with horror.
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:47.920]  Incredible.
[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:48.920]  I'm impressed.
[3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:50.920]  The courage to face COVID-19, John Leigh.
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:04:51.920]  Peter McCullough, thank you so much.
[3:04:51.920 --> 3:04:53.920]  We'll see you on the war room in one hour.
[3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:56.920]  Mike Adams, coming up.
[3:04:56.920 --> 3:04:57.920]  You see this?
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:05.920]  It's an Info Wars Republic Defense Card with original Info Wars art designed by yours truly with a little gold bar implanted in it.
[3:05:05.920 --> 3:05:07.920]  And on the back, it's got a hologram.
[3:05:07.920 --> 3:05:12.920]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence, and they'll never be made again.
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:22.920]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:27.920]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Info War.
[3:05:27.920 --> 3:05:32.920]  Please visit InfoWarsTour.com and check out this amazing new art slash gold product.
[3:05:32.920 --> 3:05:38.920]  It's a collector's item, and you'll know you help fund the Second American Revolution against the globalist at such a critical point.

[3:05:42.920 --> 3:05:49.920]  And I want to thank you for your support over the years, because without you, all of the great success we have had together would not have happened.
[3:05:49.920 --> 3:05:50.920]  We are the tip of the spear.
[3:05:50.920 --> 3:05:51.920]  You are the tip of the spear.
[3:05:51.920 --> 3:05:52.920]  And I salute you and thank you.
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:06:21.920]  Visit InfoWarsTour.com today.
[3:06:22.920 --> 3:06:26.920]  We're going to have to go listen to that all of it and absorb it and understand what's going on.
[3:06:26.920 --> 3:06:28.920]  This is also bombshell.
[3:06:28.920 --> 3:06:39.920]  We're going to be bringing in a guest, a JR Nyquist, an expert in, of course, Chinese communism, war posture, as well as Soviet war posturing from the USSR days.
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:41.920]  He's going to be joining us here in just a minute.
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:55.920]  We're going to be going through the ramifications of leaked audio that appears to be from top war generals or military leaders in China who, according to the translation and transcripts that have been published,
[3:06:55.920 --> 3:07:02.920]  and I have been able to confirm that the transcription is correct because my wife is from Taiwan and speaks Chinese.
[3:07:02.920 --> 3:07:03.920]  So we've gone through it.
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:06.920]  We've done a lot of due diligence on this.
[3:07:06.920 --> 3:07:20.920]  But according to the information in that leaked audio, it appears that China is preparing for an invasion, a naval invasion of something bigger than just Taiwan.
[3:07:20.920 --> 3:07:40.920]  And the analysis points to an impending invasion of the United States as the U.S. is weakened because the U.S. has been sending so much of its military equipment and anti-tank missile systems, artillery, and so on over to Ukraine for the Ukrainian Theater of War.
[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:43.920]  So we're going to cover that in great detail here today.
[3:07:43.920 --> 3:07:49.920]  As soon as I bring in our guests for this hour, JR Nyquist, and believe me, one hour is not enough to cover this.
[3:07:49.920 --> 3:07:52.920]  There are some major a-has in this that I've got to bring you.
[3:07:52.920 --> 3:07:55.920]  But first, real quick, two very important points.
[3:07:55.920 --> 3:08:05.920]  The United States domestic economy is being turned into communism overnight, command and control, centralized planned economies.
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:19.920]  Understand that two days ago, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act in order to seize control over food resources and redirect them to Abbott laboratories in order to produce infant formula.
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:22.920]  The Defense Production Act is administered by FEMA.
[3:08:22.920 --> 3:08:26.920]  It is a 1950 Korean War era law.
[3:08:26.920 --> 3:08:43.920]  Basically, it means that there is a semi-nationalization of domestic food supplies, and while the Defense Production Act was supposed to be used in wartime for critical infrastructure, for getting nuked or, you know, having massive earthquake wipeouts of cities,
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:45.920]  we're using it now for infant formula.
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:55.920]  It's a very dangerous precedent, and it means that as food scarcity increases in the months ahead, we're going to see the federal government decide who gets the food and who doesn't.
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:09:10.920]  And then secondly, yesterday the U.S. House passed the anti-gouging law that's going to control fuel prices in the United States, which means that any time that Joe Biden decides fuel prices are too high,
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:24.920]  they can declare that the oil companies are, quote, price-gouging the American people, and they can force prices lower, which will, of course, force scarcity and rationing of fuel across America.
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:38.920]  So in just two days this week, folks, we've seen the Biden regime's for domestic food supplies and begin fixing, which will mean rationing and scarcity of domestic fuel supplies.
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:10:02.920]  These are wartime efforts, wartime overreaches of power that Biden is engaged in at the same time that China, as you'll hear shortly from our guest, J.R. Nyquist, stockpiling crops, microchips, raw materials, ammunition, and other supplies in preparation for the economy.
[3:10:02.920 --> 3:10:06.920]  So all the signs are pointing towards World War III.
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:12.920]  Now we bring in our guest, J.R. Nyquist, and Jeffrey, thank you so much for joining us today.
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:14.920]  Can you just chime in?
[3:10:14.920 --> 3:10:16.920]  Let's make sure your auto and video are all good here.
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:17.920]  Welcome to the show.
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:19.920]  Thank you for having me.
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:30.920]  Yeah, according to Dr. Li Meng Yan, the Central Military Commission of China held meetings during the first two weeks of this month.
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:38.920]  And on the 14th, someone recorded a 56-minute segment from a meeting and smuggled it out.
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:42.920]  And this is the information you referred to.
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:48.920]  The meeting was about a war that is planned to begin before November 1, 2022.
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:51.920]  They call it the Final War.
[3:10:51.920 --> 3:10:58.920]  This meeting was about the Chinese generals for one province, Guangdong.
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:04.920]  They've been instructed to load 957 merchant ships with weapons and war supplies.
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:09.920]  Many of the ships have to be reconfigured for military hardware.
[3:11:09.920 --> 3:11:17.920]  They're giving the generals 30 to 45 days to complete the process of loading the ships.
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:23.920]  They are also going to be seizing 19 to 20 civilian airports in Guangdong.
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:32.920]  The mobilization process is, of course, occurring in all of China's coastal provinces and almost certainly in all of China's provinces.
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:45.920]  Regarding the Taiwan Strategic Direction that they refer to, the CCP has 160 to 193 party branches in Taiwan.
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:11:55.920]  And they are going to begin an intensive propaganda and agitation in Taiwan to, of course, encourage the island to surrender.
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:01.920]  China has also been using Huawei to steal data for some kind of cyber attack.
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:05.920]  They're going to probably try to turn off the electricity in Taiwan.
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:12.920]  This map that you're showing now is the illustration of the first and second island chains.
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:17.920]  These are conceived as the defensive barriers that the Chinese Navy must break through.
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:25.920]  They discuss using DF-41 strategic rockets against the United States against the mainland.
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:28.920]  Those are strategic nuclear rockets.
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:33.920]  They also discuss using rockets to break the first island chain and go beyond.
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:38.920]  So we're not just talking about a war against Taiwan.
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  We're talking about a world war in which the United States is the real main target.
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:51.920]  Jeffrey, let's back up just a little bit before we get into all the details of this.
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:54.920]  I mean, you're absolutely correct in what you just stated.
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:13:04.920]  However, let's set the big picture for this because it appears that Russia and China have planned together to take out their common enemy, which is the United States.
[3:13:04.920 --> 3:13:12.920]  I'd like you to speak to that, but also before that, I just want to mention that Russia's operation in Ukraine, in the context of a larger global theater of war,
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:23.920]  appears to be a fixing operation to cause Western nations, including Canada, the United States, and NATO nations, to over-commit their military resources to the Ukrainian theater of war,
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:32.920]  thereby leaving their domestic situation very vulnerable to an attack in the United States, from the West Coast via China.
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:40.920]  Because we've sent, for example, most of our anti-take weapons into Ukraine, and we do not have the ability to manufacture javelins at any real pace.
[3:13:40.920 --> 3:13:45.920]  I think 1,000 a year is all that Raytheon and Lockheed Martin can currently manufacture, and we have a supply chain problem.
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:49.920]  So go ahead and speak to that, Russia and China, working together on this, please.
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:57.920]  I mean, the defense contractors are saying on a lot of these weapons systems we're sending to Ukraine that it's going to take them two years to double their production.
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:05.920]  Well, they've already used, they've already sent the Ukrainian theater four years' worth of production, you know, is what I've been told.
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:09.920]  I may have the numbers, you know, depends on the weapons system you're talking about.
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:15.920]  Canada has stripped a lot of its military units of certain capabilities because they've sent things to Ukraine.
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:21.920]  We've also got 110,000 troops positioned in Eastern Europe.
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:37.920]  So we're in an East European facing situation, and here the Chinese are preparing this blindside attack, which, and to me, the idea that they're going to send Dia 41, that's their strategic rockets against America,
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:45.920]  means they're going to strike us, and the only weapons, if they hit the right targets, the only weapons we're going to have to fight this war, the weapons we already have.
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:52.920]  And if we've shipped a lot of those overseas to Eastern Europe, we're not going to have them for ourselves.
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:54.920]  Now, I've, you're exactly right.
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:15:00.920]  For those listening, I've just published a story with some of the highlights of this on naturalnews.com. It just went live right before the show.
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:06.920]  So I'm pulling out highlights and also citing the documents, the translation from this leaked audio.
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:15.920]  One of the things that really struck me about this, Jeffrey, I'd like to get your comments on this, is the mention of cyber warfare, as well as satellite space weapons warfare,
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:26.920]  and then also the activation of civilians who, CCP civilians who are embedded in governments and corporations around the world that China says must be recruited to aid the war effort at that time.
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:29.920]  We've only got a few seconds, Jeffrey, go ahead.
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:35.920]  Yeah, massive spying, massive infiltration all over our systems, and they're going to be engaged in this too.
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:37.920]  We've got a fifth column going on.
[3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:43.920]  And as far as Russia goes, yeah, Russia's bragging they're going to own all of Europe all the way up to Portugal and Spain.
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:47.920]  So this can only happen given the conventional failure of the Russian military.
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:16:16.920]  Jeffrey, we're going to go to break. Stay with us, folks. We'll be right back with JR Nyquist right after this break. Much more straight ahead.

[3:20:25.920 --> 3:20:29.920]  All right, welcome back folks to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show today.
[3:20:29.920 --> 3:20:40.920]  I'm Mike Adams, filling in here with my special guest, JR Nyquist, who is an expert on the military posturing of communist nations such as modern day China and also the former Soviet Union.
[3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:44.920]  He keeps well informed of what's happening with Russia as well.
[3:20:44.920 --> 3:20:52.920]  As we just mentioned right before we went to break, it looks like Russia and China have teamed up to try to take out their common enemy, the United States.
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:21:09.920]  Russia believes it's going to be able to push successfully westward to attack Poland and continue its expansion of the former Soviet Union beyond the old borders of the USSR and actually conquer much of Western Europe while China conquers the United States of America.
[3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:32.920]  Essentially, their posture has been to exterminate every last North American citizen and then to seize America's farmland in order to grow crops more successfully to feed the expanding global Chinese will CCP regime because they're having so many crop failures due to flooding and simply just a lack of available farmland that is reliable season after season in mainland China.
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:42.920]  So, Jeffrey, thank you again. Welcome back to show. Can you give out your your website by the way your blog site where people can find you to.
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:49.920]  Yeah, it's JR nyquist.blog. That's JR nyqist.blog.
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:59.920]  Okay, great. JR nyquist.blog. So go ahead with your analysis of what I just said the global war to eliminate Western Europe and also the United States.
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:08.920]  Yeah, let me give people a data point they can all check out. You notice that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is given the designation Z.
[3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:18.920]  Note that Z is the final letter in the alphabet and the Chinese are calling their operation the final war.
[3:22:18.920 --> 3:22:26.920]  So there is a correlation here between the concept of final letter Z. I just want people to note that.
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:45.920]  Yes, and one other thing is that in that leaked audio from the transcript, Chinese war leaders specifically referred to the way that NATO in the United States committed economic sanctions or acts of war against Russia and that China was taking specific steps to shore up their domestic supply
[3:22:45.920 --> 3:22:55.920]  chains in anticipation of the United States trying to economically isolate them. So isn't that another data point that proves China is anticipating a war with the West?
[3:22:55.920 --> 3:23:10.920]  Yeah, and China and Russia have both been stockpiling strategic resources, not just gold in terms of currency, but also China's been stockpiling food, massive amounts of food like 67% of the global food storage.
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:29.920]  You also have in terms of China's reason for going to war, what Dr. Li Meng has said is that their reason for going to war is that they entered into their collaboration and their trade relationship with the United States based on the one China policy
[3:23:29.920 --> 3:23:47.920]  that we recognize as only one China and they're claiming that because we want to defend Taiwan, we're going against that and we're basically committing, we're violating the relationship and we're committing in effect a sort of an act of aggression by leveraging Taiwan against China.
[3:23:47.920 --> 3:24:01.920]  Do you believe that the United States State Department will officially declare that it's shifting recognition to Taiwan from China or that it will declare that Taiwan is an independent nation that the US recognizes?
[3:24:01.920 --> 3:24:04.920]  Is that kind of announcement imminent in your view?
[3:24:04.920 --> 3:24:20.920]  I don't think so, although it could happen, I think that the Chinese are just regarding our military support, what we're doing to make Taiwan into a porcupine, we're trying to make Taiwan defensible, we're trying to protect it.
[3:24:20.920 --> 3:24:35.920]  The Japanese have declared that Taiwan is a vital interest of Japan, if only to help our Japanese allies, we have to help Taiwan.
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:52.920]  So there's this, all this talk in the United States, especially over the last year about how do we defend Taiwan against China as China started to make moves in 2020 military buildup opposite the Taiwan Straits as if they're going to invade Taiwan.
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:25:14.920]  But Taiwan, of course, is just one of many factors there, we also have Japan, which is getting very nervous anytime China talks about expansionist activity, Japan facing its own financial catastrophe due to the massive money printing of the Japanese Central Bank there and the potential collapse of the yen.
[3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:32.920]  But we've also got India, we've got the Philippines, we've got South Korea, how does China think in your view that they're going to get away with such an aggressive assault against the United States without suffering the retaliation of nations closer to China's own shores?
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:51.920]  I think that if you've noticed how the energy constriction of energy supplies that the Russians with their allies in Venezuela and Iran have conducted, the Houthi missile strikes against the Ramco facilities in Saudi Arabia and the impending war between Israel and Iran,
[3:25:51.920 --> 3:26:05.920]  you're going to find the Persian Gulf is going to be shut down shortly. And Japan has stated that it cannot withstand even the minor shut off of buying energy supplies like diesel fuel from Russia and so on.
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:13.920]  Japan's economy, Japan is just too energy dependent. Japan does not produce a lick of oil and all of her island she has to import 100%.
[3:26:13.920 --> 3:26:26.920]  And that is very difficult. And if there's a war in the South China Sea, almost all of China's shipping, especially her shipping of oil, most of it comes through the South China Sea.
[3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:35.920]  If that sea is interdicted by a war, how is Japan going to get its oil? How is Japan going to even continue to run?
[3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:46.920]  So it seems like what you're hinting at here is that we are now entering the commodities based New World Order, so to speak, where Russia and China have a very key advantage in that area.
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:56.920]  Russia producing so much oil and also having a bumper crop of wheat this year, reportedly Russia producing minerals and exporting a fertilizer, for example.
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:13.920]  China now serving as the industrial hub of the world, a role that the United States played in World War II, which allowed the U.S. to out produce the Axis forces of the Third Reich, so that the Allied forces could have enough equipment to go ahead and defeat the Third Reich.
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:18.920]  But now China has that advantage while the U.S. manufactures relatively little.
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:30.920]  So it seems like, I mean, in your assessment, I know you're not in favor of them winning, but doesn't it seem like they have real strategic advantages right now in terms of commodities and industrial output?
[3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:50.920]  They have so conceived their policies that they have set this situation up that we have transferred much of our industrial base to China because their labor was cheaper, and we didn't want the environmental cost of producing many of those things here.
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:28:01.920]  The Chinese were willing to bear that cost, and so China got the benefit of that, and they used the money to build up their military. They have the largest navy in the world right now.
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:04.920]  They have the largest industrial base in the world right now.
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:09.920]  Russia has a huge raw material base, a huge military technical base.
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:18.920]  Russia has the precision nuclear missile forces. Whatever we think of their land forces and their obsolete doctrine and tactics, their missile forces are state of the art.
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:26.920]  They're 30 years ahead of us, the Russians, in missile nuclear weapon and missile technology. The Chinese have been helped by the Russians.
[3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:37.920]  So you got China, North Korea, and Russia. They are using food and oil as weapons. They're using their fifth columns here in the U.S. and the West as weapons.
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:44.920]  And they will, when they unleash this war, it will be nuclear, and it's already, I believe, biological.
[3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:46.920]  We know where the COVID-19 came from.
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:54.920]  Stay with us. Stand by. We've got to go to a break again. We'll be back with more with JR Nyquist and Global Warfare that's coming. Stay tuned.

[3:32:46.920 --> 3:32:51.920]  You are really missing out if you don't experience what Alpha Power does.
[3:32:51.920 --> 3:33:17.920]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:24.920]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[3:33:24.920 --> 3:33:39.920]  Alright, we're back with JR Nyquist talking about the leaked audio out of China that appears to indicate the preparations for a large scale land invasion of the United States that could be taking place this year unless it is stopped.
[3:33:39.920 --> 3:33:50.920]  We're going to bring in Jeffrey here for more details about that, including the staging of equipment, caches, uniforms, and RPGs and artillery across the United States.
[3:33:50.920 --> 3:33:56.920]  Just want to let you know, I've just released a new free audio book that I think will help save lives.
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:33:58.920]  It's called Resilient Prepping.
[3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:00.920]  You can download it for free.
[3:34:00.920 --> 3:34:04.920]  I think it will help a lot of info wars listeners and just download the MP3 files.
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:06.920]  Just go to resilientprepping.com.
[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:07.920]  You can get that audio book.
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:08.920]  It's about 12 hours.
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:17.920]  If you want to listen to me for 12 hours, talk about how to survive without electricity, how to survive without combustion engines, how to survive the total collapse of Western civilization.
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:22.920]  Because that may be indeed where things are headed if we don't get saner people in charge.
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:26.920]  Hey, why don't we put the real president back in the Oval Office, which would be Trump?
[3:34:26.920 --> 3:34:28.920]  And I think China would back off, by the way.
[3:34:28.920 --> 3:34:29.920]  That's just my opinion.
[3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:48.920]  But Jeffrey, talk to us about the staging of equipment that's taken place across the United States by both Russia and China, sort of pre-staging the battlefield in preparation for activation of domestic units that are already in the United States.
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:50.920]  Jeffrey, you might be muted.
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:34:52.920]  At least, I'm not getting audio.
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:53.920]  Sorry, sorry about that.
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:34:54.920]  Okay.
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:55.920]  Go ahead.
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:03.920]  In late March 2020, we saw the United States put its nuclear war command staff deep underground.
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:11.920]  This was the first sign that the United States may have understood the releasing of the virus as part of the beginning of the war.
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:19.920]  There's been a lot of very interesting changes and adaptations and notices in the U.S. military.
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:28.920]  My guess is, and you talk about the food situation, about what the U.S. government is doing, these are things you do in advance of a nuclear war.
[3:35:28.920 --> 3:35:32.920]  I just wanted to point out, and it's pretty serious.
[3:35:32.920 --> 3:35:39.920]  If DF-41 warheads, missiles are coming towards us, this country is going to get hit pretty hard.
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:50.920]  The government's got to try to do the best it can to defend, and of course, I don't trust the Biden administration or one IOTA.
[3:35:50.920 --> 3:35:58.920]  The Marxism of some of those people in the Justice Department and Administration, I see no difference between that and the Marxists who rule China.
[3:35:58.920 --> 3:36:05.920]  Marxism is a toxic, poisonous, totalitarian ideology, and we've let it go very far in our own country.
[3:36:05.920 --> 3:36:12.920]  This is a very bad position when you have a potential fifth column in your country to be involved in a world war. Very dangerous.
[3:36:12.920 --> 3:36:19.920]  I've never mentioned this here on the Alex Jones show before I brought it up, I'll go ahead.
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:31.920]  I know with certainty, because I'm in the food industry business, that the State Department has forced major storeable food manufacturers in America
[3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:39.920]  to divert 100% of their output to the State Department while signing agreements that mean they cannot disclose this fact to their own customers.
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:47.920]  So it's not just the Defense Production Act that's been used for infant formula, it's being used right now for preparedness and long-term storeable food
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:52.920]  that is going into the underground bunkers and underground tunnels and military bases all across America.
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:56.920]  That's been going on for more than six months, by the way.
[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:05.920]  You can imagine if we have this intelligence now from Chinese sources, Chinese people who are openly leaking it to us now,
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.920]  you can imagine how much sooner the US government would be on to this.
[3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:20.920]  Look, you cannot, a country with 1.4 billion people preparing for wars like turning the Titanic. Everybody's seeing this turn.
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:28.920]  They shut their ports, they locked their population down, they're turning their factories from making the stuff at Walmart to making more materials.
[3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:36.920]  Look, Walmart in the Southeast, I heard from another researcher that Walmart is preparing to close a lot of its stores.
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:39.920]  Why? Nothing's going to be coming from China.
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:44.920]  Don't expect your orders from China to come through. Look at the baby formula from China.
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:50.920]  Yeah, but you just mentioned something really important that the lockdowns of Shanghai especially,
[3:37:50.920 --> 3:37:56.920]  that those, the shutdowns which were blamed on COVID, which I never believed that excuse, that was insane,
[3:37:56.920 --> 3:38:02.920]  you don't lock down 26 million people because 20 people test positive on a PCR test.
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:04.920]  That was a cover story.
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:10.920]  They've locked down 280 million people, it's not just Shanghai, it's many places in China.
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:22.920]  That's right, but the lockdowns are a cover story for their wartime preparations and use of the ports to load ships and seafaring vessels with military supplies, correct?
[3:38:22.920 --> 3:38:24.920]  Would you agree with that assessment?
[3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:32.920]  It is partly that, but it is they're moving to war footing and they've got so many people, they have to sift their population.
[3:38:32.920 --> 3:38:38.920]  They're executing people, they're liquidating people, they're looking at people who are unreliable
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:41.920]  and they're saying, we don't need these people.
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:48.920]  They're sending people to labor camps, they're figuring out who's loyal, who's naughty and nice, so to speak, as they go to war.
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:54.920]  And they're making sure that the whole country is under very strict military control.
[3:38:54.920 --> 3:39:00.920]  So it's about establishing military-type control over the country. That's what it's really about.
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:07.920]  You're exactly right. I saw in the transcript of the leaked audio, they specifically mentioned special operations, Chinese military forces,
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:13.920]  to be able to put down the uprisings that they expect to take place in Guangzhou and Shenzhen,
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:19.920]  two of the mega cities in China that are fairly close to Hong Kong in that area.
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:27.920]  But even China is expecting massive civil unrest in their own country as they wage war against the rest of the world.
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:34.920]  Yeah, China is extremely vulnerable to that. One of the reasons is they've just shut off their economy.
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:39.920]  They have shut off, look at all the money that they've made selling things abroad.
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:45.920]  They're closing their ports. Why? Because they can't conduct normal trade with the rest of the world
[3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:50.920]  when there's a war in the ocean right outside their country. They can't do that.
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:54.920]  So they are shutting down their economy. That means no money. That means no salaries.
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:40:00.920]  What do they tell people? You have no money. Here's your food ration. Here you have to go to work here.
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:07.920]  They have to establish extremely strict control to get people to work basically as slaves because it's a war emergency.
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:11.920]  You have to obey the Communist Party. We're going to war against America.
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:19.920]  The Communist Party is the only thing that can save us. By the way, we've even heard policemen on the streets of Shanghai saying this to people.
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:26.920]  You must obey. Don't you know we're going to war with America? The Communist Party, you have to obey their rules.
[3:40:26.920 --> 3:40:31.920]  This is all part of the transition to a wartime China.
[3:40:31.920 --> 3:40:38.920]  Yeah, the creepy little robot dogs walking around saying, you know, give up all your dreams of freedom and things like that.
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:46.920]  I mean, pure China. But, you know, we've also seen that in addition to converting over to wartime preparations,
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:52.920]  China is engaging currency wars. They appear to be dumping the dollar and stocking up on other global currencies.
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:40:58.920]  They appear to be ditching anything related to treasuries or things that would be affected by the collapse of the dollar.
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:09.920]  And from other sources I've interviewed, it is believed that China and Russia and some other nations are going to launch a digital currency backed by commodities
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:20.920]  in order to take down the dollar and weaken the United States in preparation for the invasion, thereby depriving the US of the ability to print its way to more manufacturing of more military defense equipment.
[3:41:20.920 --> 3:41:22.920]  What would you think of that?
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:31.920]  Yeah, of course. They want to prevent us from reorganizing our industrial base of rebuilding and reconstituting our production.
[3:41:31.920 --> 3:41:40.920]  After all, if you're going to bomb and invade North America, you have to prevent North America from having the wherewithal to defend itself.
[3:41:40.920 --> 3:41:45.920]  So the nuclear bombs, you know, are not enough. They can destroy a lot of things.
[3:41:45.920 --> 3:41:51.920]  But there's tremendous potential. You have hundreds of millions of people in a huge continental area with large resources.
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:54.920]  They're going to be able to reconstitute forces.
[3:41:54.920 --> 3:42:06.920]  You look at tiny Ukraine, you know, tiny in terms of economic resources, what they were able to do, the devastating loss of Russian forces to repel an attack.
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:09.920]  Imagine trying to invade North America, even with nuclear strikes.
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:14.920]  I was told by a Russian military defector, this is not an easy thing.
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:19.920]  But just to jump in, Ukraine had the benefit of all of this free money coming from the West.
[3:42:19.920 --> 3:42:24.920]  Whereas when the West is attacked, where is the money going to come from to bail out America?
[3:42:24.920 --> 3:42:32.920]  And if the money printing machine no longer functions because, well, we printed too many trillions, and then the world repudiates the petrodollar status,
[3:42:32.920 --> 3:42:36.920]  the US collapses almost even without an invasion, it seems.
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:44.920]  We've got to go to a break, Jeffrey, sorry to stump you with that right before the break, but we're going to do one more break and then we'll come back.
[3:42:44.920 --> 3:42:47.920]  I'd like your answer to that, or you could bring in something else.
[3:42:47.920 --> 3:43:06.920]  You're watching the Alex Jones show fourth hour here on Infowars.com. We'll be right back with JR Nyquist after this break.
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:23.920]  But now Alpha Power is back in stock at Infowars.com at 40% off.

[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:50.920]  You are really missing out if you don't experience what Alpha Power does.

[3:43:57.920 --> 3:43:59.920]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:04.920]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:11.920]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:16.920]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[3:44:16.920 --> 3:44:19.920]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[3:44:19.920 --> 3:44:21.920]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:26.920]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[3:44:26.920 --> 3:44:30.920]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:32.920]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:44:32.920 --> 3:44:36.920]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:42.920]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[3:44:42.920 --> 3:44:44.920]  I'm not sure if you want to believe it.
[3:44:44.920 --> 3:44:48.920]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.

[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:18.920]  When you wake up in the morning.
[3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:21.920]  All right, and we're back for the final segment here today on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:21.920 --> 3:47:24.920]  I'm Mike Adams joined by JR Nyquist.
[3:47:24.920 --> 3:47:31.920]  And I also want to give credit to Jennifer Dung, who published the full transcript of this leaked audio that we're talking about today.
[3:47:31.920 --> 3:47:35.920]  Her website is Jennifer Dung, which is Z-E-N-G.
[3:47:35.920 --> 3:47:43.920]  So just Jennifer Z-E-N-G blog.com brings up her website and the full transcript so you can read it yourself.
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:49.920]  The English translation is a little clunky, but it's extremely useful nonetheless.
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:55.920]  Also, Jeffrey, I understand you are talking with Dr. Yan Li-Mong.
[3:47:55.920 --> 3:47:59.920]  I'm slated to interview both of you next week with more details about this.
[3:47:59.920 --> 3:48:06.920]  In your opinion, does Dr. Yan, does she believe in the authenticity of this recording?
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:08.920]  I mean, I guess we can ask her next week.
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:18.920]  How is this being authenticated, or is there some outlier possibility that this audio is some kind of a wargame simulation of some kind?
[3:48:18.920 --> 3:48:20.920]  No, it's not a simulation.
[3:48:20.920 --> 3:48:23.920]  I mean, I'm working with other people.
[3:48:23.920 --> 3:48:30.920]  One of the main speakers in it is a Commissar, a Wang Shu Jin.
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:35.920]  Hopefully, we'll have a voice recognition on that person.
[3:48:35.920 --> 3:48:45.920]  But one analyst who speaks Mandarin, who's familiar with these kind of meetings, said that they recognize some of the voices.
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:53.920]  So I think this is all things that I've expected to see.
[3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:59.920]  I mean, I think I've told you Colonel Stanislav Lunev I knew for many years he passed away in 2020.
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:01.920]  He was the highest ranking defector from the GRU.
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:03.920]  He spoke fluent Mandarin.
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:10.920]  And he told me about this long-range plan between Russia and China to invade North America, to bomb us, to take us over.
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:18.920]  And when you look at some of the Chinese documents, like the secret speech of Qi Hao Chen, you see this is confirmed again and again, year after year.
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:23.920]  And now we're getting these sources out of China saying, yeah, they're doing it, and they're doing it now.
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:25.920]  So this is not a surprise to me.
[3:49:25.920 --> 3:49:29.920]  I've been trying to warn people and tell people about this for quite a while.
[3:49:29.920 --> 3:49:35.920]  So why the timing of, I've heard you mentioned some time around November 1st.
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:43.920]  Now, obviously it's convenient for Democrats if they don't have to face midterm elections because we're in battle with China, right?
[3:49:43.920 --> 3:49:47.920]  Because the Democrats are going to get politically wiped out probably in the midterms.
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:52.920]  But where does this date come from, by the way?
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:50:03.920]  Well, this is Dr. Li Meng sources that this is the latest date that they want to start the war.
[3:50:03.920 --> 3:50:12.920]  They probably have a window, like from late June all the way up to November 1st.
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:15.920]  But they want to get it to happen sometime in there.
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:20.920]  I suspect it has to do with economic military factors and their allies, Iran.
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:24.920]  And China, remember, Iran is about to get nuclear weapons.
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:33.920]  A lot of people think that Israel is going to strike Iran maybe in a few days or a few weeks because Iran is that close to getting nuclear weapons.
[3:50:33.920 --> 3:50:37.920]  And the Israelis have said that they will strike to prevent that.
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:39.920]  So that's a war that lights up the Middle East.
[3:50:39.920 --> 3:50:42.920]  We've got a war in Ukraine already started.
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:49.920]  Some of Putin's friends have been hinting that they think Putin might use nuclear weapons at any time.
[3:50:49.920 --> 3:50:52.920]  I don't think we've ever seen anything like this in our lifetimes.
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:50:56.920]  I mean, this is really serious.
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:50:57.920]  Absolutely it is.
[3:50:57.920 --> 3:50:59.920]  And that's why I appreciate you coming on today.
[3:50:59.920 --> 3:51:02.920]  And we need to continue this conversation as well.
[3:51:02.920 --> 3:51:08.920]  But isn't China committing its own economic suicide, though, if it declares war on the West,
[3:51:08.920 --> 3:51:14.920]  because the U.S. is the primary buyer of manufactured goods from China,
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:20.920]  as well as Western Europe is, I think, the second largest buyer from China or roughly thereabouts.
[3:51:20.920 --> 3:51:25.920]  So is this part of why China is preparing to convert its economy over to wartime?
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:35.920]  So I notice in the transcript, they are citing their success during the COVID lockdowns of being able to effectively enforce a police state over the people of China.
[3:51:35.920 --> 3:51:37.920]  Like they say, oh, we did such a great job there.
[3:51:37.920 --> 3:51:40.920]  Now we can do it during the war.
[3:51:40.920 --> 3:51:44.920]  Yeah, of course, you could look at it as a test.
[3:51:44.920 --> 3:51:46.920]  Look, they have an enormous population.
[3:51:46.920 --> 3:51:48.920]  They have an enormous problem.
[3:51:48.920 --> 3:51:52.920]  And you know that their economy was going to take a head.
[3:51:52.920 --> 3:51:58.920]  I've talked to Wall Street bankers, economists, and people of that sorts over the last several months.
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:05.920]  And I've been told that the Chinese economy was expected to collapse this year.
[3:52:05.920 --> 3:52:13.920]  I mean, one Wall Street banker said by the end of June 2022, expect the Chinese economy to flatline.
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:18.920]  Well, if they turn their economy over to a war economy, they don't.
[3:52:18.920 --> 3:52:21.920]  They are not operating a normal consumer, you know, normal economy.
[3:52:21.920 --> 3:52:24.920]  They're in war communism and their people aren't receiving salaries.
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:26.920]  They're just working for food.
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:32.920]  And so that's the kind of emergency state that China is now moving into.
[3:52:32.920 --> 3:52:36.920]  Now, one of the key questions that people will be asking and hearing this,
[3:52:36.920 --> 3:52:39.920]  and I spoke with you privately yesterday, I asked you the same question.
[3:52:39.920 --> 3:52:46.920]  Why wouldn't the United States Navy just start striking all of these cargo ships and vessels
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:50.920]  as they're steaming towards the West Coast of the United States?
[3:52:50.920 --> 3:52:54.920]  You explained that to me yesterday, but can you share it with the audience?
[3:52:54.920 --> 3:52:59.920]  Well, of course, we would be then guilty of launching a surprise attack on China.
[3:52:59.920 --> 3:53:01.920]  We'd be attacking civilian ships.
[3:53:01.920 --> 3:53:04.920]  The other thing is that there's just too darn many ships.
[3:53:04.920 --> 3:53:11.920]  Look, if they're loading 957 ships in Guangdong and their seven coastal provinces,
[3:53:11.920 --> 3:53:14.920]  we could be looking at 5,000 ships.
[3:53:14.920 --> 3:53:20.920]  There's not enough torpedoes and missiles in the American fleet to sink that many merchant ships.
[3:53:20.920 --> 3:53:27.920]  Besides, we've got to save our ordinance for the 350-60 Chinese warships.
[3:53:27.920 --> 3:53:30.920]  We can't be using all our ordinance on those things.
[3:53:30.920 --> 3:53:38.920]  Right, so you're saying the initial plan is to bring in troops and equipment disguised as merchant ships?
[3:53:38.920 --> 3:53:40.920]  Well, yeah, of course.
[3:53:40.920 --> 3:53:46.920]  Colonel Luna have emphasized this, that all the planning about World War III with invading North America
[3:53:46.920 --> 3:53:51.920]  is based on Operation Veserabong, which is the German invasion of Norway in World War II,
[3:53:51.920 --> 3:53:55.920]  and the Germans, while they were at peace with Norway, sent merchant ships,
[3:53:55.920 --> 3:54:02.920]  not in a giant fleet, but one by one, singly, and they got right past the British Navy, actually,
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:07.920]  and they docked right in the Norwegian ports and the troops and the equipment got out,
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:11.920]  and they seized the ports and they did the same thing with airfields and air transport planes,
[3:54:11.920 --> 3:54:16.920]  brought in mountain troops, paratroopers, and they invaded the country directly.
[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:22.920]  So the very first, you know, we've got Chinese ships coming and docking in our ports all the time.
[3:54:22.920 --> 3:54:27.920]  What, are we going to open fire on a ship that's loaded with stuff for, you know, your local store?
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:30.920]  No, nobody's going to do that.
[3:54:30.920 --> 3:54:36.920]  So some fraction of the ships will be forwarded to, well, even Mexico.
[3:54:36.920 --> 3:54:39.920]  Incinada Mexico is a port controlled by the Chinese.
[3:54:39.920 --> 3:54:42.920]  They could start offloading things in Incinada Mexico.
[3:54:42.920 --> 3:54:45.920]  They could be offloading things right now in Incinada Mexico.
[3:54:45.920 --> 3:54:49.920]  They could be offloading in Vancouver, Canada, or be prepared.
[3:54:49.920 --> 3:54:54.920]  If they get those initial people in there, they can fly more people,
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:55:00.920]  and after they sweep the Navy with missile attacks using hypersonic missiles, using nuclear warheads,
[3:55:00.920 --> 3:55:07.920]  they can clear the first and second island chain, they can break through and send the rest of the ships on to the west coast.
[3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:16.920]  So when you say nuclear warheads, are you talking about tactical battlefield nukes on short range rockets or ICBM?
[3:55:16.920 --> 3:55:22.920]  Both. You would be using both.
[3:55:22.920 --> 3:55:27.920]  Okay, so that's pretty frightening, because it seems like the likely targets would be, for example,
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:30.920]  National Guard bases in California, Oregon, and Washington.
[3:55:30.920 --> 3:55:35.920]  Would they not? I mean, that seems like the most obvious targets to start with.
[3:55:35.920 --> 3:55:44.920]  The first and primary targets command and control, strategic nuclear missile silos,
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:55:48.920]  strategic SAC bases, strategic command bases.
[3:55:48.920 --> 3:55:55.920]  Like Bremerton, Washington, you have the, for the boomer, the boomer bases, the submarine bunkers,
[3:55:55.920 --> 3:55:59.920]  there's some under the Oakland Bay Bridge in the San Francisco Bay.
[3:55:59.920 --> 3:56:05.920]  You've got San Diego Harbor, where they usually have a carrier or two laid up.
[3:56:05.920 --> 3:56:11.920]  So Pearl Harbor, you know, so it's Pearl Harbor on a massive scale,
[3:56:11.920 --> 3:56:16.920]  because look, you have a submarine submerged off the coast of California.
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:19.920]  It could send cruise missiles with tactical nuclear warheads.
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:21.920]  They could send a strategic nuclear warhead.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:26.920]  I mean, the DF-41, I think it has a speed of Mach 25.
[3:56:26.920 --> 3:56:29.920]  So what's going to stop that?
[3:56:29.920 --> 3:56:34.920]  ICBMs can't be stopped by any of our ballistic and ballistic missiles.
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:38.920]  I mean, maybe a slow North Korean missile, but we're not going to stop this.
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:41.920]  You know, I mean, that's, you're done.
[3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:43.920]  Jeffrey, we've only scratched the surface here.
[3:56:43.920 --> 3:56:49.920]  I want to make sure people follow up on your work, jrnyquist.blog is your website.
