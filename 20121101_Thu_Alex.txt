[00:37.880 --> 00:44.640]  six days out from the biggest public show on earth and no it isn't P.T. Barnum
[00:44.640 --> 00:52.600]  in Bailey Circus it is election 2012 with the star of Fast and Furious and
[00:52.600 --> 00:58.440]  Government health care and banker bailouts Barack Obama against Mr.

[01:23.680 --> 01:29.560]  personally am gonna vote for Emperor Palpatine right now here in Texas I'm
[01:29.560 --> 01:31.840]  gonna go out and vote for him today because I think you know I just want
[01:31.840 --> 01:36.080]  pure open evil out in the open better than evil disguising itself much less
[01:36.080 --> 01:40.800]  puppets disguising themselves here's the deal I never successfully have done it
[01:40.800 --> 01:47.800]  not in 17 years on radio I've gotten close a few times and taken like 20 30
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.400]  calls an hour but I really do I think part of the reason is that we don't
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.280]  screen calls which makes them really interesting and makes the show really
[01:56.280 --> 02:01.320]  powerful and live but at the same time you also get a lot of folks that are you
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.960]  know sitting back having a brew sitting there for 30 minutes on hold when you
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.600]  go to him sometimes they're in a coma we always have the best callers out there
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.040]  and we say I want to hear from engineers on this subject or I want to hear from
[02:13.040 --> 02:17.040]  police or I want to hear from nurses being forced to take inoculations or I
[02:17.040 --> 02:21.360]  want to hear from school teachers if we ask for demographics we got it all but
[02:21.360 --> 02:25.640]  we're not gonna screen the calls today and it could be a free-for-all but I'm
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.280]  gonna have John Harmon up there at Genesis working his butt off he always
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.880]  does a great job because we're gonna try to take five calls every five minutes
[02:34.880 --> 02:41.120]  in this first hour and that means I will just come back briefly mentioned some
[02:41.120 --> 02:45.040]  of the headlines and then get to all those headlines in detail in the second
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.440]  and third hour with Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers who's gonna be riding a
[02:49.440 --> 02:52.840]  shotgun with us at him off about 45 minutes Sunday and there's just so much
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.240]  talk about his constitutional lawyer scholar award-winning constitutional
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.720]  lawyer author and Army veteran and he will be joining us about the fact that
[03:02.720 --> 03:07.920]  we are basically simply filling out the future battle space now we're gonna
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.160]  cover more on the hurricane we're going to get more into the economy that I
[03:11.160 --> 03:13.920]  covered some yesterday but I've got to get more into because there's a lot of
[03:13.920 --> 03:16.720]  things that are being distracted by the hurricane the election and that's what's
[03:16.720 --> 03:20.840]  happening militarily geopolitically we will get to the key points on that
[03:20.840 --> 03:26.040]  today they now admit looting over a five-state area very intense in New
[03:26.040 --> 03:32.680]  Jersey in different cities like Atlantic City and other areas like Manhattan
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.680]  and the surrounding areas that Coney Island just absolutely pilfered at will
[03:37.680 --> 03:43.920]  and a lot of arrests there and I will we see a retraction out of the Atlantic
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.560]  monthly online will we see a retraction out of the daily daily communist I mean
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.560]  the Daily Beast and what the Newsweek front saying we were insane Monday for
[03:54.560 --> 03:57.400]  saying that there'd be looting and people were tweeting they were planning to
[03:57.400 --> 04:03.400]  loot see nowadays you're bad if you're right so that is going to be coming up
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.240]  and they've had to deploy troopers in New Jersey and New York and other areas
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.040]  over a frustration fights and things breaking out they're out of gas and I
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.520]  guess I'm bad again in strategic relocation the new film with Joel
[04:18.520 --> 04:22.440]  Scalzen where it's not about running out and living in the countryside that's of

[09:42.800 --> 09:49.120]  info wars news.com where we are streaming video of the radio show we also
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.680]  have the nightly news transmission seven o'clock central every night info wars

[10:07.160 --> 10:13.080]  veteran founder of Oath Keepers will be joining us in the next hour to cover the
[10:13.080 --> 10:17.320]  waterfront the FEMA camps the government documents submitting the
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.640]  reeducation centers the legislation the civilian inmate labor camp programs the
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.080]  facts and what his intel is giving him with all the police and military
[10:27.080 --> 10:33.520]  contacts he has because he heads up the only and also obviously the largest
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.320]  serious anti-new-world order pro-america veteran and police group where they
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.040]  simply say they will defend the republic from enemies foreign and domestic and
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.760]  follow their oaths of course that sounds very simple doesn't it but that is
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.280]  treason to the foreign banks that brag in hundreds of publications and on
[10:52.280 --> 10:56.480]  television that they have conquered the United States through financial espionage
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.880]  and fraud we have been infiltrated we have to get in the globalist face and
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.400]  expose them as the criminals they are and bring them to justice you know I was
[11:05.400 --> 11:09.280]  thinking about fast and furious today and I saw this CNET news article court
[11:09.280 --> 11:14.200]  okay's warrantless use of hidden surveillance cameras on your property
[11:14.200 --> 11:20.200]  without a warrant big brother putting cameras on your property and filming you
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.000]  without a warrant and they're announcing they're watching you over your cell
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.920]  phones the NSA is listening to you without a warrant illegally and they
[11:28.920 --> 11:33.480]  say they're doing this to stop drugs I thought it was al Qaeda they run but it's
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.520]  just so amazing to know that government and megabanks on record have been caught
[11:37.520 --> 11:40.880]  not hundreds but thousands of times there have been congressional hearings in
[11:40.880 --> 11:45.880]  the 60s 70s 80s 90s the CIA's inspector general had to certify that they did
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.120]  bring narcotics in during the 80s and to destabilize things and fund Iran
[11:50.120 --> 11:57.400]  Contra and and the troops are on Fox CNN you name it growing opium and and
[11:57.400 --> 12:01.760]  admitting they grow the opium and saying that's how they fight al Qaeda ten
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.080]  years ago less than 10% of the opium in the world came out of Afghanistan now
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.440]  it's 93% last US number I saw I mean the government is run by foreign banks that
[12:12.440 --> 12:16.080]  run the child kidnapping rings the narcotics trafficking the illegal
[12:16.080 --> 12:20.600]  weapons trafficking organized crime runs the world now and and and organized
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.520]  crime wants to shut down the final free speech organized crime wants to be able
[12:24.520 --> 12:28.720]  to secretly arrest you and have no due process and is hiring criminals in the
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.080]  law enforcement to wage war against we the people I mean that's it in a nutshell
[12:34.080 --> 12:39.720]  another floor in a court is set to rule that and a judge is saying that they
[12:39.720 --> 12:43.760]  think it's great to have dogs just randomly out of the blue come to your
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.080]  house and smell for drugs and then come in without warrants I haven't covered
[12:49.080 --> 12:53.520]  this yet because I'm so busy I think I'm gonna do a story on it because I
[12:53.520 --> 12:56.480]  almost said a story on this last year once we're hearing these radio ads and
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.280]  sing TV ads saying you know the software Association of America forget its exact
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.200]  name because that's Tim for J to give me that letter please you know call and
[13:06.200 --> 13:12.280]  tattle if someone's pirating software well we buy every piece of software we
[13:12.280 --> 13:18.280]  use in here unless it's genu or Linux you know open source we do have a lot of
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.960]  open source stuff because it's sometimes there isn't even a off-the-shelf system
[13:22.960 --> 13:28.200]  to use we have to customize it but you know we use some big companies as well
[13:28.200 --> 13:33.960]  and we are neurotic about following every little stupid thing I don't let
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.720]  people do their private business here on their computers at my offices because
[13:38.720 --> 13:41.600]  they could be connecting into things on the internet I don't want going over our
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.000]  network I mean it's all work related when you're here at this office if you
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.960]  want to do something on your lunch break go out and do it on your iPhone or iPad
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.680]  outside of gonna go pay your bills or whatever don't do it on my system but I
[13:54.680 --> 13:57.640]  found out that thousands of people a month are getting this letter they send
[13:57.640 --> 14:00.960]  you a letter they say we have proof that you're pirating all this software and
[14:00.960 --> 14:03.560]  they listed and they say you're gonna pay us money or we're gonna sue you it's
[14:03.560 --> 14:06.720]  like a basically an extortion letter in my opinion in view and I've got lawyers
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.800]  on it but most people just freak out I mean they say we're pirating medical
[14:10.800 --> 14:16.040]  software up yeah because we're a hospital just all sorts of stuff that we
[14:16.040 --> 14:22.440]  don't use wouldn't use and is obsolete but our IT guys looked into it none of
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.400]  what they list is on our system but we did find other stuff where people are
[14:26.400 --> 14:31.200]  surfing the news and it installs you're trying to get it off just little crud
[14:31.200 --> 14:35.200]  programs that says oh here's your free trial but you've got to uninstall it in
[14:35.200 --> 14:40.760]  30 days or its theft and you know my issue is I'm too busy fighting the new
[14:40.760 --> 14:44.840]  world order but but someone needs to litigate against all these groups but
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.360]  but but the reason I mentioned that before I get to some of the news then
[14:47.360 --> 14:56.560]  and then open the phones up here is that when you sit there and you deal with all
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.480]  of this yeah here go ahead and bring it on him here yeah I'm gonna get to this
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.400]  later though I'm gonna do a report on this later and you get this lawyer letter
[15:04.400 --> 15:11.440]  and it says litigation hold notice and then it goes into just all of these
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.760]  programs we don't even use just absolutely amazing you know Final Cut
[15:16.760 --> 15:23.360]  Pro premiered Adobe all the stuff we use it's all here you know we have those
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.080]  big group licenses you name it of course none of that's even listed here just
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.280]  just total you're gonna give us a bunch of money we're gonna sue you and a lot
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.880]  of people don't they just get scared and roll over but but but side issue the
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.960]  reason I just thought of that mentioned that is it's so easy for your
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.520]  neighbor to call and say yeah I saw the kids play in the front yard and the
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.800]  police come and arrest you for child endangerment because your 11 year old
[15:48.800 --> 15:52.360]  was playing the front yard it's not even legal but they call it endangerment they
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.480]  just define it it's so easy to go to jail for a garden now they say well the
[15:56.480 --> 16:01.440]  city finds it objectionable we just say objectionable in our little local law
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.240]  that's obviously if it was challenged would be overthrown but even when it's
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.520]  overthrown no one gets in trouble this is just the bureaucratic criminal class
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.080]  run by foreign corporations teaching us we're absolute slaves but now they're
[16:14.080 --> 16:20.360]  saying well your neighbor will just say yeah I smelled marijuana boom you get
[16:20.360 --> 16:26.560]  swat teamed I know a lot of people we've done news reports on this who get swat
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.160]  teamed over bloodweeds they look a little bit like marijuana they grow in
[16:31.160 --> 16:34.880]  pretty much every yard if you've got like an acre piece of property you let
[16:34.880 --> 16:37.880]  weeds grow up you're gonna get blood weed it looks a little bit like marijuana
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.040]  and they say well we flew over with a helicopter and we saw it and and in one
[16:42.040 --> 16:45.120]  story I did about what 12 years ago with my hands and we had to dig that up and
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.680]  put it online and I know we've got the tape around here somewhere we put it on
[16:48.680 --> 16:52.640]  local access TV you know pretty much pre-internet revolution when it was
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.720]  really widespread and and operable to really use internet online pre-youtube
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.840]  basically when we couldn't afford to put it online ourselves and to make a long
[17:02.840 --> 17:07.720]  story short they went into this area and swat teamed like seven houses and they
[17:07.720 --> 17:13.640]  just flew over with a helicopter and and videotape to go get a warrant because
[17:13.640 --> 17:17.800]  they got a warrant in this case blood weed growing on the green belt behind
[17:17.800 --> 17:21.440]  the houses and the cops were laughing they knew it was Travis County they knew
[17:21.440 --> 17:24.700]  it wasn't marijuana and they went into one guy's house and pulled out his play
[17:24.700 --> 17:28.680]  boys and made fun of him in front of his kids and you know I said what's this to
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.680]  BB guns and you know I mean it's just a mindlessness and most narcotics police
[17:33.680 --> 17:38.440]  are dealing drugs themselves I mean that's come out everywhere most big
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.320]  police departments even Dallas has been caught a few years ago planting drugs on

[17:45.680 --> 17:51.280]  syndicates by and large the drug war must be ended or it's over but this is a
[17:51.280 --> 17:56.240]  new economy hey somebody told us you've got pirated software software for

[25:25.840 --> 25:29.520]  but don't worry mommy and daddy can't pack lunches in many Chicago school
[25:29.520 --> 25:32.160]  districts and now that's spreading nationwide

[25:41.200 --> 25:48.160]  if you said you know in 2012 and the next century the president's wife will
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.520]  tell kids what to eat and parents won't be able to pack

[26:46.800 --> 26:51.280]  I mean what's the source ma'am Hoover Dam Halo 4

[27:00.880 --> 27:05.520]  they're saying that the Hoover Dam has something to do with Barack Obama
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.160]  and some type of flood that's supposed to happen and kill millions of people
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.560]  and Halo 4 has some connection to it well ma'am ma'am
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.200]  listen government could pull false flags and I appreciate your call
[27:19.200 --> 27:23.440]  but part of something government does on purpose not just individuals

[27:28.560 --> 27:31.760]  month and they give the day and everybody's out there waiting for it
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.120]  or they say there's going to be a nuclear attack on this day and that
[27:35.120 --> 27:38.080]  doesn't happen and then we get on air and say they're
[27:38.080 --> 27:40.320]  going to launch a war in the Middle East last year
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.680]  and they've since launched a hot war against Iran
[27:43.680 --> 27:47.200]  which they admit on c-span they're doing that they've launched a hot war in Libya
[27:47.200 --> 27:50.480]  and Syria those are wars but people say Alex

[33:35.120 --> 33:38.240]  finishing up with the lady calling in sound very nice
[33:38.960 --> 33:42.960]  i looked up what she was talking about people see things in video games
[33:43.520 --> 33:47.760]  and because there's been tv programs on before that show exactly
[33:47.760 --> 33:52.960]  what later happens like 9-eleven uh fox tv put out a lone gunman episode where
[33:52.960 --> 33:56.560]  the government hijacked the jet to fly to the world trade center to blame it on afghan
[33:56.560 --> 33:59.840]  terrorists to bring in martial law and take americans liberties
[34:01.680 --> 34:04.240]  and they remote control the aircraft again and blame it on afghans
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.040]  that's called throwing it in your face uh but uh you know in the case of most of these
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.840]  nine nine percent of the time okay there's a video game saying the hoover dam is going to get
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.960]  blown up that doesn't mean that's going to happen uh but i two weeks ago i covered the
[34:20.960 --> 34:26.160]  article where actors in these tv shows that play the part of american patriot terrorist
[34:26.160 --> 34:31.280]  part of the branding people start fights with them on the street thinking they're really that person
[34:31.280 --> 34:36.480]  and that's because the public is a bunch of zombies raised on television from birth
[34:36.480 --> 34:43.840]  who cannot differentiate reality from unreality i remember seeing a documentary uh on uh many
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.120]  years ago it's probably like 20 years ago on a and e i think it was it was fascinating we should
[34:49.120 --> 34:56.960]  dig that up where what was documentary about gilligan's island and how people would see the
[34:56.960 --> 35:04.640]  stars for decades who were typecast from the 1960s program and they would say i where is that island
[35:04.640 --> 35:10.160]  i want to visit that island and charter companies would have people come for decades and say we
[35:10.160 --> 35:16.400]  want to go to that island and they're like no no that's a tv show that's not real and you've got
[35:17.920 --> 35:24.000]  people that are worse than children i mean they have no idea i'm sitting there once
[35:25.520 --> 35:34.480]  and a young woman we were eating meat and the young woman was a teenager uh and uh she said well
[35:34.480 --> 35:41.280]  how do they get the meat from the cows do they have surgeries and i made the joke yeah they
[35:41.280 --> 35:47.840]  they have a surgery all right you see how freddy krueger does surgery yeah i mean these people
[35:47.840 --> 35:53.040]  don't know where electricity comes from they don't know how their bodies work they don't know anything
[35:53.600 --> 35:58.480]  and and the and the criminals that run things folks are going wild bloomberg the control freak
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.520]  that wants to tell you what to drink what to eat what to do i mean he is out of control makes his
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.920]  money out of you know all sorts of you know inside deals bloomberg ordered people because
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.960]  they're already the london's already done this german cities have already done this he says okay
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.760]  now everything's carpooling and it just shut the whole city down total gridlock they don't care
[36:21.200 --> 36:26.720]  it's it's all about the raw exercise of power with these people you're not going to pack your
[36:26.720 --> 36:34.800]  kid at school lunch we're going to feed him crap michelle obama says so okay i'm going to go to your

[37:02.800 --> 37:09.440]  stomping the person and this is a big hot thing that's done in chicago new york uh even dallas uh
[37:10.240 --> 37:16.560]  it's done in la where the funnest thing is to sucker punch an old man and then have their head
[37:16.560 --> 37:20.960]  hit the ground and kill him in a big pool of blood we've all seen those videos they're they're very
[37:20.960 --> 37:28.400]  popular entertainment uh on the gangbanger sites uh and uh you know beating someone who's old and
[37:28.400 --> 37:34.720]  weak is the big big price of course um wouldn't be nice to see an old man like it be in texas
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.120]  pull out a revolver and kill the thugs but see no no no no no this is the happy hunting ground
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.120]  of new york city where if the thugs don't get you the cops probably will

[38:32.480 --> 38:38.320]  i've seen mothers beat up with their little kids this is what america is this is what america
[38:38.320 --> 38:43.440]  has become and they take little kids for minor offenses and throw them in juvie where they get
[38:43.440 --> 38:48.240]  raped and everything they get inducted and the worst criminals in the juvenile halls become their

[44:04.400 --> 44:09.920]  mafia and they've now destroyed the country and they're going to fully rob it now uh and we are
[44:09.920 --> 44:15.200]  in grave danger everyone must non comply as much as you can and speak out against the enemy occupation
[44:15.200 --> 44:20.880]  force god bless you ma'am yes we did not really i mentioned that a few weeks ago but never uh or
[44:20.880 --> 44:25.920]  a week ago or so never even got into it properly they have the rural council over the 10 regions

[44:38.480 --> 44:43.840]  switches and announcing that and when they stage a big terror attack whether it's obama or romney
[44:43.840 --> 44:49.120]  or whatever puppet comes uh they'll try to then drop the hammer on us so uh we've got to get the
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.240]  word out now while we still got communication capabilities uh joe in pennsylvania you're on the
[44:54.240 --> 45:01.280]  air yeah how you doing there mr jones good sir good to hear your voice welcome um yeah um you know
[45:01.840 --> 45:08.160]  i want to know what happened to the backbone and the spirits and the pride of the people um i went
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.240]  on and i looked at the twitters where the people were saying they were gonna loot and then when
[45:12.240 --> 45:18.080]  they uh went when they went up there and they put on the pictures of them looting and there's no
[45:18.080 --> 45:24.000]  mention of it in the media anywhere i called a bunch of the news programs left messages
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.600]  hoping to get something on there and it's just so disheartening now all the gang attacks you know on
[45:29.600 --> 45:36.400]  the east coast are only on local community feed uh local cable systems the national news will not
[45:36.400 --> 45:40.880]  pick up the violent attacks because then people would say and by the way they're calling in new
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.600]  york for concealed carry that everybody else is getting because they want to protect themselves
[45:45.600 --> 45:50.160]  and the answer by the mob boss bloomberg is i'm going to tell you what to eat i'm going to tell
[45:50.160 --> 45:56.320]  you who can ride your car i'm your boss is that clear or i'm going to smack you i i think too you
[45:56.320 --> 46:02.480]  know i think too a part of it is a racial element because it's predominantly you know minorities that
[46:02.480 --> 46:08.720]  are doing it well that's right a little bit but again that's being done show that uh the worst
[46:08.720 --> 46:13.760]  elements can then become the dominant element within the minority groups show that there will be
[46:13.760 --> 46:19.200]  division yes it's very cold blooded and then it's it's so sad i mean where i mean people got to stand
[46:19.200 --> 46:22.880]  up i'm trying to wake people up one at a time because you get in a group and people look at you
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.040]  like you're crazy but when you can talk to somebody in and you sit down and you show them
[46:27.680 --> 46:32.560]  individually then that you know the light bulb kind of goes on um well sir i mean i mean here's
[46:32.560 --> 46:39.360]  an example here's my fox dc batter new jersey agonizes over whether to rebuild shore environmentalists
[46:39.360 --> 46:44.480]  say new jersey should consider not rebuilding everything lost to superstorm see agenda 21
[46:44.480 --> 46:51.440]  smart growth means we the mafia the government we decide who can build and who can you can't build
[46:51.440 --> 46:57.520]  we can i mean it's it's literally a takeover sir and if we keep complying we're just going to be
[46:57.520 --> 47:02.960]  total slaves well you know the other thing that hit me too was you know when they had that Haiti
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.600]  earthquake they were quick to have a you know a fundraiser they're not even talking about having
[47:07.600 --> 47:13.040]  one for the people of our own country um because the obama phone you know obama phone lady she's
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.720]  out there she's got a free phone she's comfortable and content and she's uh you know people like

[54:23.360 --> 54:31.360]  on screen for TV viewers here's the info wars.com article where we link to the daily caller
[54:31.360 --> 54:37.360]  two and a half days ago on October 30th I do miss some things that are on info wars.com
[54:38.080 --> 54:42.400]  and I did miss it and I went and watched it during the break it is officially Michael Moore
[54:42.960 --> 54:49.360]  and they call for burning down cities and sexually assaulting Mitt Romney if he wins
[54:49.360 --> 54:57.360]  at the Rosebud nursing home with real old people and it says a message from the greatest generation
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.640]  calling to burn cities and sexually assault Mitt Romney and I can't play it on air again I'm
[55:04.640 --> 55:08.800]  usually ahead of the curve sometimes I miss stuff because I'm so busy you know covering the hurricane
[55:08.800 --> 55:16.880]  and things like that they simultaneously though have the different George Soros outlets saying
[55:16.880 --> 55:29.040]  that I'm making it up that there are calls to riot if Obama loses so it's amazing how these
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.280]  guys operate it's like they control reality because they're speaking to a zombified public
[55:33.280 --> 55:38.800]  that they pretty much do and so they say there is no world government but there is and we're
[55:38.800 --> 55:42.560]  going to take over and if you don't like it you're crazy because there's no world government
[55:42.560 --> 55:49.520]  and they go yeah we're going to riot and burn things down if if Obama loses but you're bad
[55:49.520 --> 55:53.680]  and racist because no one said that we're going to burn anything down but we're going to burn
[55:53.680 --> 55:58.960]  stuff down if he loses but you're bad if you say we just said that and people go yes sir
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.240]  that's right burn everything down to be losers but it doesn't exist and and those of us that live
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.880]  in reality are just like what's going on the public is in a dreamlike state they think movies
[56:10.880 --> 56:17.600]  are real they think Gilligan's Island is a real place they thought that in the 60s they think
[56:18.400 --> 56:26.320]  that video games are real people live in fantasy video game land now they have all
[56:26.320 --> 56:35.760]  these virtual realities this is the matrix and it's so scary to see the public this dumb down
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.360]  and I can't even keep track of it anymore because they were like you didn't know about
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.400]  these other videos where they're threatening to kill people or attack people or burn things down
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.240]  and I guess Michael Moore's putting out and and and move on's putting out a bunch of these now
[56:52.080 --> 56:56.160]  and I guess the Justice Department runs the Secret Service I guess they're allowed to
[56:56.720 --> 57:02.480]  they've been told remember Obama told Odinga when he was a U.S. Senator told his cousin over in
[57:02.480 --> 57:09.840]  Kenyon he said it came out in the letterhead I covered in the Obama deception that if you
[57:10.880 --> 57:17.280]  lose against the Christian majority with your Muslim minority riot and then they'll get they'll
[57:17.280 --> 57:21.040]  they'll give you a spot in the government and and they gave them the prime ministership they
[57:21.040 --> 57:28.720]  created that that position next to the presidency in kind of a split government and so because the
[57:28.720 --> 57:34.960]  people are awake to this it may not happen but I mean pretty clearly now this is some type of ace
[57:34.960 --> 57:43.920]  in the hole that the system is thinking about using if Mitt Romney actually wins and it's not
[57:43.920 --> 57:47.760]  that Mitt Romney's even a good guy it's that there's different mafias behind these guys
[57:48.640 --> 57:53.360]  and the group that wants Obama in is really enjoying the billions of dollars and no bid
[57:53.360 --> 57:59.040]  contracts and the billions of dollars and of deals that they're getting shutting down their
[57:59.040 --> 58:06.080]  competition shutting down car dealerships that they don't own the energy deals the salandra
[58:06.080 --> 58:14.000]  cylindra type stuff so they just intend to keep this thing rolling and man I mean if I made a video
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.440]  and said physically attack Mitt Romney or Obama I'd get arrested if I did a video and even acted
[58:19.440 --> 58:24.160]  like it was a spoof and said because it comes off as real it's like old ladies going I'm gonna burn
[58:24.160 --> 58:28.640]  I'm gonna burn stuff down I'm gonna I'm gonna attack and rip the testicles off basically
[58:28.640 --> 58:36.160]  it's what they say of uh but Mitt Romney I mean it's just like what what we posted the video two

[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.480]  uh you know i got an affiliate list with like 110 stations last week and i said i know it's

[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.160]  enforcing the law and arresting their dealers so i mean i mean the the federal government
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:32.560]  is a murdering mafia period absolutely they're protecting these agent provocateurs as in a
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.880]  of course an excuse to divide and conquer us and an excuse to take away our rights in case somebody
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:43.600]  they're letting michael more put out a video saying let's burn things down if romney lose if
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:50.320]  romney wins i think we have we now have with the cussing bleep and saying they're going to sexually
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:55.760]  assault romney and the and the old woman simulates ripping his testicles off i mean folks we would
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:02.240]  be arrested in hours for that i'm sorry go ahead absolutely and then we have here in our local
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:08.080]  community sponsored station of fake liberal progressive station that is having the new
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.080]  black panther party chief of staff michelle williams on prior to of course her arrest two weeks ago
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.000]  for trying to sell a house that never belonged to her and she's trying to capitalize not only on
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.840]  the trayvon martin shooting you know she's the one who was calling for george zimmerman's head
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.680]  daryl uh you know daryl live in and then she didn't get in trouble for that no she didn't
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:35.040]  and uh then she's trying to capitalize on javon neal shooting by police where finally when the
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:41.280]  police footage was was released it showed that yes he was carrying a shotgun and uh he was trying
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.800]  to loot police for about five seconds in front of them and the police uh shot him because they
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.520]  uh legend it wasn't shot on the video but it's pretty clear that they pulled they had to defend
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.800]  them let's just like trayvon martin they showed a five-year-old photo of him and and then the
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.520]  black neighbor said that he was bouncing zimmerman's head off the concrete then the photos got released
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.440]  of zimmerman's bloody head and everything else and it turned out the and it's a tragic thing
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:12.320]  that happened but it turns out that the justice department this came out remember msnbc editing
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.640]  the tape aren't they being sued over that didn't have it sound like zimmerman was saying you know
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.680]  like oh he's a black guy he must be bad but was totally edited they asking what color is he and
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.040]  but they cut that part out and turned out the justice department had provocateurs in there
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:36.720]  trying to get riots going i mean it is unbelievable the stuff they get away with they've been caught
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.960]  with fast and furious and no one's gotten in trouble oh yes and then either the issues that are local
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.480]  wmf community sponsored station says nobody cares about fast and furious and we have three of the
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.920]  personalities on the station who are trying to use michelle williams as a proxy to capitalize on these
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:29:01.360]  deaths of the unfortunate black teens and then you know and then of wtsp local channel 10 station
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.200]  does show this picture of the george zimmerman with his head cut up and they say that they don't
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.840]  care how the jury trial is going to is going to end they keep on accusing him of using the
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.640]  racial slur koon but never mind that michelle williams is using a racial epic that's all over
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.200]  the place look look look look here's the deal and i appreciate your call we're going to go
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:26.080]  break and come back with stewart rhodes and more calls but listen here's the issue the globalists

[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:35.760]  then they give a gangster culture to the kids and then they try to basically play us all off
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:41.360]  against each other it's absolutely disgusting the liberals just want blacks to think they're
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:47.280]  their friends so they can make sure 52 of them get aborted that's what it's all about the liberals

[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.680]  in it they went to the teacher and said call the police he doesn't like obama i mean i'm telling you
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:09.600]  these are authoritarians and again it's not that i like republicans it's just that democrats are so
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:15.680]  bad you've got some people that are democrats that mean well who aren't into all the weird democratic
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:20.960]  party stuff but it's a weird gang folks we're gonna play uh this little clip of this little girl
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.560]  crying since she's sick of the election because because kids understand at a tribal level there's
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:33.040]  two groups fighting it goes on and on and on and then kids bring it up and people get sick of it
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.240]  this is how they divide us between republican and democrat and people get real tribal as republicans
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:43.760]  or democrats and get real mean i remember covering um with speed election results in 2000
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.080]  because right downtown is the governor's mansion here in austin and governor bush had supposedly won
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.640]  but while that week-long fight went on the supreme court i would just go down there and cover it
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:58.560]  and i would have democrats hitting me with signs uh i'd have republicans doing it and the cops would
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.560]  just let them do it as long as you just kind of henpeck somebody didn't hurt him too bad they leave
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:09.360]  you alone an abc cameraman attacked me because i was uh getting video and getting he didn't want me
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.120]  out across the street you wanted a shot of the governor's mansion and he was he was telling me
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.360]  that you know i tell you go out to a big event with reporters they'll step on your feet they'll get
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.400]  in front of you you're like good i'm i'm gonna have to punch you in the nose i mean you're like
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.320]  stepping on my feet uh this is happening to my crew they think they're god because they're mainstream
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:30.080]  god media but the point is it just gets so crazy meanwhile the globalist on both sides to a great
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.200]  extent but yes the democrats are their open communist movement and then republicans act like
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.360]  they're opposing it and make you think you have a choice it's kind of like republicans of this little
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:43.760]  life jacket but they're tied to a big chain ball that pulls you under the water as well
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:50.480]  you know that you know that it would take 50 life jackets to you know uh make buoyant but but
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.000]  since there's a life jacket you think they're keeping you safe and the democrats there is no
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.560]  life jacket it's just a big ball and chain but let's go to this little clip of tired of bronco
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:19.600]  bomba and mit romney here it is that's why you're crying oh it'll be over soon abby okay the election
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:32.800]  will be over soon okay uh again everybody is sick of the election and i quite frankly can't
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.480]  wait for it to be over but if there if it is disputed move on and george soros and that crew
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:46.880]  is now pushing this now now i've edited out or my crew has edited out the the serious profanity
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:54.400]  and things but but they basically call for violence call for fires call for ripping
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:00.000]  romney's genitals off and she says i'm going to rip his genitals off uh yeah i'm gonna i'm
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.200]  gonna punch him in the genitals and she shows the ripping motion and this is cute and funny and
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.000]  it's like oh it's just a joke but if you or i did this i mean constantly in the media they're
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.160]  saying i'm calling for violence i'm gonna cause violence and if there is any violence it's my
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.680]  fault when we're when we're the opposite if i did something like this folks i would be crucified
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:26.800]  here it is a message from the greatest generation produced by the self-propelled stomach michael
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:37.120]  morn i was born in 1915 during world war one my first vote was in 1940 for franklin d roosevelt
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:45.280]  and i have not missed an election since and i want the republican party to know if your voter
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:57.440]  suppression throughout this beautiful country enables romney to oust barack obama we will burn
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:06.480]  this down she said boy they i have four generations of family on this earth and my life has been
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.880]  very blessed and if the republicans steal this and back it up to her saying we'll burn this
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.840]  effort down and then they cut to a guy in spanish saying yes we can and and let me tell you got
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:24.160]  30 million illegals who've already rioted and pulled down american flags and kids in san francisco
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.680]  hispanic kids can't wear american flag shirts okay because it's it's it's it's a pro mexico
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.160]  nationalism game we're not allowed to have our nationalism i saw an article criticizing the
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.040]  star spangled banner i've heard all these countries national anthems we definitely got the best the
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:45.120]  russians got one that sounds really good but ours is the best i mean the words it's it's it's good
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:51.920]  stuff and i'm just sick of it i mean this listen they're creating a moral authority that that if
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.440]  obama loses this is this is election tampering that that that there's the moral authority to burn
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:03.440]  things down and there's the message hey illegals burn it and you can see once they get enough
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.600]  dependence in this country on the government you know what they're gonna bring in democracy
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:13.040]  which is 51 telling the other 49 their slaves two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:17.120]  we've i mean it's just that's why they're so arrogant and don't care that's why the federal
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.560]  courts are ruling they're gonna put cameras in your house and without warrants and they're gonna
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.400]  bring police dogs in your house without warrants they're doing whatever they want we got a crook
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:34.640]  government period we're going the way of the soviet union and nazi germany if we don't really get
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.600]  these people's face right now that doesn't even it doesn't even mean within the controlled fake
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.920]  left-right paradigm they're bringing the country down now now again it goes and then and we're
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.840]  going to stewart roads but i want to take on this when we come back but i mean calls for
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.240]  violence calls for killing on twitter calls for looting all of it happens we're criticized for
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:59.920]  saying they're beluding i mean this is they are encouraging this in the culture this has been out
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.000]  now three days and i just learned about this morning our guys posted their credit two and a half days
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:12.960]  ago here it is we will burn this down see say boy they yes we can i have four generations of family
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:19.760]  on this earth and my life has been very blessed and if the republicans steal this election i'm
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:26.160]  going to track down that romney and give him the world's biggest punch what's the matter sonny you
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:37.920]  never heard that phrase punch right in the the motion of ripping test i served during world war
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:47.600]  two i'm the last of my buddy still here and i've got a message for our kids for democrats for anyone
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:55.040]  who cares about honest elections if you let the republicans do this to you again after we die
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:02.000]  we're gonna look down on you from heaven and we're gonna make a point of watching you have sex
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:11.360]  every time no matter how kinky especially if we are related the best way to stop the gop
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:19.520]  from stealing the election is to make sure it isn't even close go to voters rising dot org
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:34.080]  unbelievable that's enough just turn it off i mean these are people
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.280]  and again i've been around these type of leftist they're really when you get around them they're
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:44.240]  for eugenics they think the school should take your kid and make them have an abortion they
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.680]  they're just sick freaks and they love government that they've all worked for the government they've
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.160]  been in the government and it's there what does big sis call it maybe we should ever come out on
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:43:01.600]  stage for tv viewers big sis calls it the federal family the which is a foreign banking cartel that
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:08.640]  runs the federal family and um they're not going to stop ladies and gentlemen they are not going
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.520]  to stop they want to take over they want to take your houses your cars they want to conscript you
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:22.320]  the democrats want the draft back they are the scum of the earth let's go ahead and go to stewart
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:29.200]  roads and then we're going to get to philip uh and we're going to get to uh julius and jeff and maggie
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:35.760]  and so many others uh just totally and completely disgusting and then we've got on the other side
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:43.840]  mit romney uh just another flavor of the same sign i'd lace koolaid um but again the the the
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:50.240]  democrats play the part of the radicals stewart roads is the founder and president of oath keeper
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.560]  stewart graduated summa cum laude from the university in nevada los vegas they work as a

[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:51.200]  materials and that the proof of his extremism was he listened to the alex jones show then the adl
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.960]  went on to see how dangerous i am so uh the frame up uh continues uh stewart i want to get into all
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:07.120]  the points and topics uh that uh that you want to cover which i think are very very uh important
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:14.240]  here today uh but first off stewart what do you make of the democrats clearly it's not just that
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:19.600]  in announcements in videos advisors to obama saying stage something you're not going to get
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.640]  elected that's in the financial times of london newsweek time they they act like we don't see
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:30.000]  them full view it's not that we're even for romney but clearly uh they ran fast and furious another
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.680]  criminal false flag stage provocateur terrorist events uh is there nothing they won't do and
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.000]  what do you make because it turns out there's a bunch of these videos michael moore's putting out
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.320]  calling for burning us cities uh and and and saying yes we can which is the communist slogan
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:51.360]  in latin america folks don't know that here but that's where obama got it what do you make of this
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:58.640]  this tv ads saying will burn down cities of obama uh isn't reelected yes we can in spanish
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:03.760]  i mean this is there's no doubt they're trying to run a false flag now whether they're successful
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.240]  or not we don't know um but katie bar the door we can see where this is going to go when they've
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.720]  got 60 million illegals not the 30 million i'd rather you know get the illegals and wake them
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.160]  up the second amendment make them great americans but the problem is they're being inducted into
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:23.360]  globalist ideology uh steward uh i mean i just see this i mean you're a military historian i'm a
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:28.720]  novice that studies it quite a bit since i was about 10 years old uh as a hobby and i i know what
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:34.400]  this is this is a foreign banking force bringing in groups to balkanize the country for subjugation
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:39.600]  and subdividing uh the original republic but uh and then merging that republic with a larger
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.000]  globalist order which has all been announced uh steward what do you make of this
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:50.320]  yeah that's exactly what it is is divide and conquer it's setting up the problem and then
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.920]  offering the solution which is just more control um just as they say that independent states and
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.200]  the problem is is like the federal reserve is is a national organization and you know
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:07.200]  international organization the same thing will happen when it comes to uh civil unrest and and
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.600]  political division will say this paradigm isn't working anymore we need to go beyond this get
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:17.360]  beyond politics let's merge into you know something better that's what i think is going to happen and
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:22.320]  so yes balkanization and divide and conquer of american people getting them you know by each
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.080]  other is the is the is part of their program um and the two parties the two major parties are
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:32.960]  really run by the same people as you know there are two birds the two two wings of the same burger
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:39.520]  prey and they're totalitarian so the leftist totalitarians are the counterpart to the neocons
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.280]  on the right you are also totalitarian and so the paradigm really should be seen as freedom
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:51.760]  versus tyranny and which side are you on when it comes to that and too many democrats are obviously
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.120]  on the side of of tyranny but only just their own flavor um but it's really just a shell game and
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:04.400]  it's designed to get you to support one brand of tyranny or another and give you that false choice
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:10.320]  and make you choose tyranny either way you know heads they win tell those you lose again constitutional
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.720]  lawyer steward rhodes will be with us uh for the next hour and 15 minutes or so we appreciate you
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:18.640]  coming on steward and i want to get into issues that you want to focus on then i want to get into
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.360]  larger geopolitical and how you think their takeover plan later in the next hour is going to progress
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.400]  in the battle space that they've developed versus how we're trying to affect that and by the way
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.800]  folks we're in the fight that's what people need to realize there there's millions of us fighting
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:37.920]  thousands of us prominently people need to understand we all of us together are literally
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.960]  holding this back while we're being criticized by co and tell pro and others who act like they're
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.480]  in our ranks within fighting hoping we walk away so the shields fully fall and because believe me
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.560]  folks if we weren't here doing this we would have already been deep into this the globalist
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.440]  admit brzezinski's new book that they're years behind because of the liberty movement seven to
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.400]  ten but now they're accelerating and telescoping and compressing it but i wanted as we go to break
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.640]  here mention this story you just talked about how first they bring it from county to state
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.320]  from state to federal then the federal goes to centralize then the new centralized security
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:21.200]  council is signed over to nato in the un obama's executive order 13228 of october 8th uh goes over
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.880]  this there are there are other executive orders actually i printed the wrong one i i need the new
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:33.280]  obama order this is from 2001 i need the new order that he reissued uh on the uh homeland
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.640]  security national security council but if you look at the rural affairs council if you look at the
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:45.040]  10 fema region governors all of its states it's now under homeland security which is now separate
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:50.320]  from the other agencies claiming it has power when congress before had control to a great
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:58.160]  extent of those agencies so we see it all being transferred obama uh coming out as well uh saying
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:07.840]  that nato is now in charge of our military your comments on that story well it's part of the same
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:15.280]  plan it's this is this is the the relentless drive towards centralization and to supplanting
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:20.560]  our constitutional structure with something entirely foreign with the totalitarian structure
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:26.880]  this is a battle between freedom and tyranny and one or the other is going to win and so as you
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.440]  said they should in the balance space we are too it's it is a fight right now we're kind of in a
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:38.640]  cold war and it's going to be a hot war eventually um unless we can attain a mass consciousness shift
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:43.200]  and have a peaceful restoration it's going to be a hot war so we're just getting ready for it they
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.720]  are telling us they're getting ready for it we should get paid and they've told us they're going
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.840]  to take us to reeducation camps and kill us i mean i mean that's that's that's official that's
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:57.040]  that's their plan the reeducation camps i've got the executive order now will give me the number
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.240]  when we come back after this quick break it's at whitehouse.gov the worst drought in 50 years
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:07.600]  continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:12.800]  midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.160]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.040]  out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.240]  food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.720]  price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:37.280]  your supply i recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.080]  coming you know about their delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat at any

[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:52.880]  presentation the extras and all of it strategic relocation the film start you know I I just
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:57.200]  plugged that because I was already going to plug it but I noticed and some of the points you wanted
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.400]  to talk about you said strategic relocation something you've been advocating over the last
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:07.680]  couple years if people think that that means you're scared no it means you're moving militarily
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:13.840]  to the best areas that have the best people that have the best backups if you can but the film and
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:18.400]  the book strategic relocation also tells you region by region if you have to stay in an area
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:24.480]  the best place even around your city escape routes you name it it's situational awareness
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:29.600]  this is the opposite of being domesticated Stuart Rhodes yeah absolutely why would you
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:35.680]  want to stay in an artificial environment I mean the the powers to be wanting to be maximally
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:43.280]  uh unprepared and dependent upon them and no better place for that than in a city and so
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.560]  why would you want to leave yourself in the the most vulnerable position possible why not get out
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:54.160]  of the city so you said even within states that are not maybe the optimal states there are still
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:56:00.800]  better places to be get out of the cities get into rural communities get back to the foundation
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.560]  of America which is small towns and local communities my Jefferson's ideal was a rural
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.760]  agrarian society of independent farmers own their own land because you're going to be
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.480]  stronger and more independent if you are that notice that's the opposite of what the globalist
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:22.240]  want exactly they want they want to depopulate the rural areas and drive us all into cities
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:29.040]  which is what Stalin did which is what they've done in Mexico every linen now every authoritarian
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.680]  does this yeah absolutely I mean what Stalin did to the Kulaks the independent farmers is
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.720]  a good example they cannot have independent people who can grow their own food they do not
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.680]  want you to be a self-sufficient so the the answer is is don't do what they want do what they
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:47.600]  but they don't want you to do become more self-sufficient move into a place where there's
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.160]  still a real community and for folks grow their own food and strengthen it become again what America
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:00.000]  should be that's right and again for those that have studied military history or history we know
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.400]  this they want us in a siege system within their stockade they want us as prisoners when you look
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:13.600]  at the conversion all over the world of civilization the design is to a prison giant reeducation camp
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:21.920]  grid smart growth is a prison grid we they want us to voluntarily plug in to a prison grid
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:29.840]  yeah exactly which is why we need to do the exact opposite get out of the cities and and become
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:35.120]  strong communities again locally focus on your towns and focus on your counties if you can get
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:39.920]  to a better state by all means do it but you can't get at least away from the cities in your area
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:44.560]  like you've done in the hill country of texas get out where folks still you know live like america
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:49.200]  used to live and and become stronger and that's the place to write out the storm as you said
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.760]  earlier it's not being done out of fear it's being done out of strategy you know that's what
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.640]  I mean you know we we went out to a small town outside austin a few years ago with the children
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  and everybody was saying hi to us and being nice to us and my wife who never really lived in the
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.720]  country she said well in austin they don't talk to her the environmentalists get mad they come up
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:10.880]  to her at Whole Foods if she has three kids and tell her she's evil she said this these people
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.200]  are smiling these are nice and I said yeah we need to move to the country because she didn't want to
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:20.160]  do that before you know they're not under pure programming yet but they are sending imperial
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:26.800]  globalist uh strike teams and I mean that seriously of agenda 21 people are hitting nationwide
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.520]  like empire strikes back imperial probe droids are plopping down everywhere right now at your

[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.520]  head Stuart Rhodes military historian constitutional lawyer Yale graduate worked with Ron Paul founder
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:54.080]  of bothkeepers.org great patriot all around this is a short segment long segment coming up but i want
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:59.360]  to get into this story because i was mentioning it we tend to have a normalcy bias but sending our
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:06.640]  reporters around the hill country but also covering other stuff around the nation going to smart growth
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:13.280]  conferences myself when you get there when you realize the fake environmental movement is the core
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:20.400]  of their takeover it's their friendly front these people use hand signs these people use codes with
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:26.000]  each other uh i mean they'll come into a small town with three million four million dollars
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.080]  just to greece palms they are a i mean it's how the cia would infiltrate and take over a country
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.000]  and that's what it is in fact we go interview some of the professors and you know turns out
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:41.520]  their cia or cia connected they're building smart growth substations where they spy and
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:48.800]  create files on people i mean this is a military system we're facing yeah they're watermelon
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.280]  they're the green on the outside but they're red on the inside and so the environmentalism
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:58.880]  is the latest it's like this one of the tools to be to be used to drive people but i'm saying
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.400]  they actually are using military terminologies when i'm telling you oh yeah yeah i understand yeah i
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.240]  agree and so it's it's it's on the other side of the coin it's national security so both um both
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:15.600]  are just programs to get you to swallow and accept what they have planned for you and they put the
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:20.800]  best-paced forward on it that's right they use national security to get the right wing to bend over
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.800]  and they use environmentalism for the left exactly it's part of the it's just part of the same
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:31.280]  two-party paradigm is driving us to towards totalitarianism well i mean the thing is you know
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:35.680]  debating them and any of this doesn't do that because they're operatives they're there analyzing
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.000]  and literally using you as a data so i mean how do you deal with folks like that you just call them
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.960]  right out exactly you don't try to change their minds you just you focus on exposing them for
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.840]  what they are and your actual audience are the people that they are trying to manipulate it's a
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:56.400]  battle for the hearts and minds of the general population i found though once you show people
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:01.680]  a little data printouts and things that they're operatives and their tricks the the the the crowd
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:08.000]  instantly still has good instincts and joins you that's right and truth will went out and and that's
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.960]  why they want to stop guys like you and guys like me who are exposing what they're doing and speaking
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:17.280]  the truth what do you expect them to trial on us i know you've had some stuff behind the scenes go
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.560]  on it's starting to intensify for us excuse me i can hear you say what do you expect them to do
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:28.480]  to try to shut us down well more demonization and more chaos and an excuse they can use to
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.440]  shut down the internet the internet's most powerful at uh education and outreach to all there is and
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.000]  so they know as we talked about before they know they're running out of time as you said they're
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.840]  behind their schedule we bump things up the liberty movement is growing exponentially they know their
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:48.640]  their time is limited and their days are numbered and so eventually they're going to shut down or
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:54.080]  try to shut down free speech shut down the internet it's what's critical that folks start working now
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:59.120]  on altering communications like ham radio um even going back to carrier pigeons if you have to get
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.760]  ready for for that system you know the internet to come down eventually but while we still have it
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.160]  we need to keep growing the liberty movement and maximizing the number of americans who don't care
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.520]  about left and right don't care about republicans and democrats but care about liberty and so that
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.640]  is happening um we need to keep doing that but while we also do that we need to start focusing on
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:24.240]  getting ready for the fight and getting ready for the economic collapse that is going to come
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:30.400]  i believe that's what we'll use in the end to pull the plug they'll create chaos stay there we're
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.160]  going to break we come back i'm going to give you the floor in this next long segment break down
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.960]  historically as a military historian a constitutional lawyer how authoritarians have done it before
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:44.560]  we're seeing the exact same paradigm with a high-tech integrative uh overlay very wicked
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:49.520]  about truth trumps at all folks if you'll just have courage and realize they're the bad guys they
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.640]  must be met and then i want you to break down how you see this unfolding in their takeover and how

[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:34.160]  we see the earth from here you got it and what do we see we see seven billion two hundred million
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:41.840]  people fathers mothers children and all our ancestors that came before us who live their
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:48.000]  short little lives as well who had hopes and dreams and always we see good people stepping down
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:54.960]  kneeling to tyrants in the name of security and safety and giving up more and more of their hard
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:01.520]  won hard fought freedoms no one can deny that basic freedom is on fire burning down the ground
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:08.080]  but america even though it's basically dead and and freedom worldwide is fading in government
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:14.160]  in the heart and in the mind it is actually becoming brighter because you go through a cycle
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:19.520]  people become decadent because they've had so much freedom they don't appreciate it things fall apart
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:25.040]  then the tyrants come in then things get worse and worse people fight it off then they appreciate
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:33.040]  liberty again then because they've had liberty incredible prosperity comes people become corrupt
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:39.120]  and decadent again and the same cycle repeats itself over and over again the differences
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.520]  we're now in the 21st century and the tyrants have got a lot of sophisticated tools and it
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:48.640]  blows back on them but they can't help it they just have a will to power they want to be the
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:55.760]  uber mention they they want total control well if you were the superman you would know that you
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.360]  want to empower the species because you were so great you you would not want to stunt people so
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:07.680]  you could be the uber mention over a bunch of snails because you're not really a superman and
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:12.080]  that's what the globalists want to become this enlightened creature if you're trying to hurt
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:18.800]  and dumb people down that is not what a superman does let's just get that through your little minds
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:23.440]  now stewart rhodes was talking about internet shutdown and ways they want to try to bring in
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:28.880]  cyber security to take control of the web and there's a major gear up through the pentagon
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:34.560]  setting up nsa centers in every city and even small towns and rural areas to surveil people to
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.080]  target people to control people but once they're identified and you should find these bases in
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.880]  your area i'm about to expose some here in austin even give them a heads up i'm coming uh
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:52.320]  and why well because we want to get your full response don't we like i might even do it today
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:59.280]  i got to get around to that i'm a little busy uh we need to go and confront this and not be afraid
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.680]  our reporters went down and showed the nsa giant complex of san Antonio tv and radio and news
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:12.320]  print they've all had their cameras taken by the police we just got there and i told you carry jackson
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.560]  just hand them a news article about the nsa losing a maryland suit saying people couldn't film it
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.720]  and uh the cops were didn't have to be told we're going to sue you that was next they went oh you
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:29.120]  guys can see you guys got the sunglasses oh well we'll just leave i mean what's it going to do
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:35.280]  videotaping a big illegal criminal nsa base we're not the bad guys stop acting like we're the bad
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.680]  guys you know and again the globalists put up this idea with the militias they tried to take over
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:46.880]  20 years ago 15 16 years ago in that area by by demonizing the idea putting radicalizers in there
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.360]  and then everybody sneaks around at night with their guns and plays secret agent folks we're out
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.160]  in the open we're out in the open buying three to five million guns a month we're out in the open
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:01.040]  calling you murdering criminals we're out in the open exposing you we're we're the good guys okay
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.480]  you understand that and again we're not heroes ladies and gentlemen this is basic survival
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:12.400]  these are really nasty authoritarians if we just had some boss hogs taken over it'd be bad enough
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.360]  but i wouldn't be that worried it'd just be well that's too bad we're corrupt these are nasty control
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:23.360]  freaks that want to run your life who we've had the fb on formats on famous people uh you know who
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:29.440]  testified to congress and got weathermen convicted they were in the meetings with obama's advisors
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.800]  when they said we're going to put 50 million conservatives in camps we're going to kill half
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:38.480]  of them now in the new army manuals it says reeducation camp they use that term i'm going to
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.040]  shut up stewart roads you've got the floor here founder of both keeper's constitutional lawyer
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:48.000]  how how do you see them taking over we see the battle plan what's their battle space versus our
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.120]  battle space how do you see this playing out in general terms as a military historian as well
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:59.280]  well first of all what they're doing is is flipping the constitutional public of the
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:06.000]  founders upside down um under you know for your public we would be self-sufficient in strong
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.280]  communities we would be um self-responsible in the militia taking care of our own defense our own
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:17.200]  domestic security both in our towns county states and as an as a country supposed to be the militia
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:22.240]  who takes care of domestic security not standing on that's just upright men and women everywhere
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:28.640]  with assault rifles like switzerland only and basically no crime right but we should be organized
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.840]  too i mean they expected us to be drilling and training just like you do in switzerland um you
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.200]  know i guess you could say what the national guard was supposed to be but on a larger basis
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:43.680]  everybody who's fit should be in the militia and training under the command of their governor
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:48.800]  that's not what we have we do we have state militias only in in name in the state constitutions but
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:53.440]  they don't really exist and they're no real units it's not supposed to be this atomized
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.000]  individual gun owners it's supposed to be gun owners who have their own weapons but also train
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:04.960]  and organize at the town county and state level that is supposed to be the force in in america
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:10.160]  the military force standing army is supposed to be very small um and then the other side of it is
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:14.640]  and law enforcement side is the sheriff's constancy same thing you're responsible for your own security
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:19.280]  it's why i don't i don't like the meme of the sheep dog a lot of guys in the military police
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:24.320]  and veterans will get into being the sheep dog guarding the sheep and and they look at the sheep
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:29.280]  and they say well you know productive americans who are defenseless are still good citizens
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.600]  but they're just sheep and we're the guardian that's not how it's supposed to be we're all
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:37.680]  supposed to be our own guardians that's the answer to that ancient question of who we should guard
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.480]  the guardians is that you be your own guardian supposed to be a class of you know of citizen
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:48.080]  soldiers across the country and so we should get away from this idea that it's okay to just be a
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:56.000]  helpless um ineffective incapable of defending yourself repeating yourself worker b and then
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.120]  have the warrior class and then have the you know like in the puddles republic where they have
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.560]  the working class the the bronze then the silver is the warrior class the honor people that focus
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:11.920]  on honor and then the highest is supposed to be the the uh philosopher king the gold class
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:19.040]  that's a totalitarian system we're not ants we should be self-sufficient independent uh farmers
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:25.600]  and landowners and businessmen but also warriors who train and are ready to fight to preserve our
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:30.560]  freedom and defend our own country that is what we're supposed to be they replace that by gutting
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:36.560]  that system taking away your personal sense of responsibility and honor be the militia and be the
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:41.600]  posse telling you don't worry about that you just go work and we'll take care of your security for
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.440]  you and and there's no such thing as a free lunch and you know buying into that paradigm has put us
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:53.440]  where we are so now it's easier to get a Katrina going or some kind of chaos during a storm like
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:58.880]  sandy or during an economic collapse is far easier because you have a bunch of people who are they
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:05.120]  have become like a nation of sheep relying on a professional warrior class of sheep dogs um that's
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:09.680]  the problem that makes you very vulnerable and very easy to manipulate through chaos whether
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:15.040]  it's election cycles and and riots after election or an economic and that's why they've gotten rid
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:21.520]  of dodgeball and then even jogging uh at the playground or a kid gets beat up and he fights
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:26.480]  back vague spell him not the kids that even attacked the idea of well look in England where
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:31.680]  they arrest you if you defend yourself these criminal nanny states the greatest crime is being a man
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:38.400]  exactly you want to make exactly right want to machete all the men um and also even women though
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:43.040]  we've been told don't fight back against rapists last thing you want to do is is is try to use
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:48.320]  violence violence never the answer and all this kind of nonsense and so they wind up with a
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:55.520]  society where the only people who are they're competent at using violence or either the government
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:02.560]  or private criminals and so those you know gangbangers or SWAT officers are the only two people
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:08.960]  who have any kind of competency or that like men and those are both perversions of manhood on the
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:14.480]  one side you've got violent criminals who just you know out for themselves might makes right but
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.280]  on the other side you've got the government doing the same thing might makes right they're hyper
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:24.560]  violent and they want that monopoly i mean a true warrior class would would want to make all the
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:30.240]  people under them warriors as well for the greater strength of the society but you notice oh no you
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:35.680]  shouldn't defend yourself you should call us yeah i mean look at the native americans every man
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:41.360]  was a warrior and a hunter and look at the early colonial americans on the frontier you had to go
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:46.160]  out there and defend yourself because there's no one else around and and also look even in the in
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:52.000]  the new england towns you were expected to be in the militia you are not an aunt you're not a
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:56.960]  worker b you're not a worker ant you're supposed to be taking care of all those functions not just
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:03.600]  the one or the other so this is the problem is the paradigm is shifted from independent independent
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:09.200]  self-sufficient but also within a community being strong and being willing to step up and take care
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:15.440]  of business it's gone from that to a society of just consumers as a society of of passive americans
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:20.320]  like the eloy in the in the time travel they're going to sit around and and they're just waiting
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:25.360]  to be eaten and the more locks will ht wells was a topia genesis he admitted that was all an allegory
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.240]  of what they were establishing stewart-roads you're absolutely right but but but they haven't
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:35.920]  domesticated everybody so you got 150 to 170 million gun owners they're getting hyper aware
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:42.000]  hyper ready i mean that's pretty much checkmate if they try it and we resist them because we're
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:48.080]  already our culture is actually so much more inviting than this dead culture of ninning
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:53.440]  that the ninnies are getting more ninny like but i'm seeing actually an acceleration of rediscovery
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.880]  and it's infecting everybody with the fires of liberty i think that's why they're moving so quick
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:04.640]  so how are these two worlds going to collide well you're right and especially rural america
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:09.760]  if you get out of the cities so their dream is already almost fulfilled in the cities
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:13.920]  you know look at chicago or new york everyone thinks it's horrible to own a gun and and and
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:20.080]  they feed into this but you go to rural america and like out here in montana um you can live 15
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:25.760]  miles from a major road and and around you is nobody else but you and your neighbors take
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.920]  care of each other and yourselves when you're out there hiking or hunting in montana you're
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:34.880]  attacked by a grizzly bear there is no cop gonna come save you you have got to take care of it
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:39.840]  and so by default you have to be more self-sufficient and that's the way it is in rural america which
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:45.520]  is why they want to be populated by default i mean we got rattlesnakes out by my house you
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:50.000]  got to have guns i mean you know yeah you live out with grizzly bears you're going to take a gun with
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:54.480]  you when you go to the store because the grizzly bear might come around the corner i mean again
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:20:00.320]  it's so simple we need to go back to being humans stop being domesticated steward road stay with us

[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:19.200]  you know i was told the story by a big musician a famous rock star about how this song
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:27.520]  got made i want to fly away and i looked it up when i got home and no one knows the story
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:30.720]  then i was told i can't tell the story
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:39.600]  oh it's so ridiculous to be told stuff and it's always off record
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:44.880]  uh Stuart Rhodes is our guest listen folks we're not trying to scare you we're trying to say hey
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:50.000]  you smoke two packs of cigarettes day i think you're gonna get lung cancer i mean it's just look
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  look we got tyranny Stuart Rhodes is a constitutional lawyer you know taught history at Yale worked
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.120]  for Ron Paul i've read so many history books it'll make your head spin because i just got into
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:05.440]  it for entertainment purposes started reading my dad's science fiction books when i was you know
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:10.960]  six or seven uh he had like those little science fiction magazines that had the easier to read
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:14.560]  stuff with all the pictures so i started reading that by the time i was ten i was like oh this
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:18.720]  this history thing is even more entertaining so i got all the knowledge and now but i mean
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.000]  certainly need knowledge to know this is tyranny folks the point is it's moving quick now uh
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.720]  Stuart uh short segment here long segment coming up with more news and calls Stuart Rhodes of
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:35.520]  Oathkeepers but uh so how do you see the clash taking place uh because you know Oathkeepers
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:40.000]  are trying to wake up police and military i'm not putting a good face on it i'm being honest
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.800]  i see a lot of police waking up and a lot of military what are you seeing but how do you
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.360]  see this colliding you're seeing economic economic collapse they just turn things off
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.840]  where they want to make you dependent which goes back to while we still have an economy we better
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:26:00.800]  all get somewhat uh self-sufficient yes exactly and this is this is a fight to the death between
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:06.240]  two smaller groups on the one side of the freedom movement on the other side of the
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:11.200]  totalitarian movement and in between is the great mass of the of the average american
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:17.440]  and so it is a battle of the hearts for the hearts and minds on their side they use fear
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:23.920]  their greatest weapon is fear fear and helplessness in the population and on our side our greatest
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:29.040]  weapon is truth and courage and we're thinking wake up the american spirit and remind them of
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:35.120]  their own heritage of being brave first and foremost not being driven by fear and then being
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:41.200]  honorable we can we can shift the average person back towards the ideas of livery as country's
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:47.200]  founded on so truth is a is a is a great inoculator it once you wake somebody up like i said in my
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:53.120]  speech at paul fest once you're woken up to the false left right paradigm is now going back
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:59.760]  they cannot yes exactly right they will never again control your mind and so we've seen exponential
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:05.680]  growth in the freedom movement my big concern is i believe they've given enough time we will win but
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:11.680]  i'm concerned that we are running out of time and that they will attempt to short circuit our our
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:17.360]  ability to grow out there and wake people up that's why i focused on the guys with the guns first
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:22.080]  it's a subset of the liberty movement message i mean the whole liberty movement is about reaching
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:27.680]  out to people teaching them the truth and what's been going on and then you know letting a fire
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:33.040]  of liberty in their mind to do what's right and be strong and not be driven by fear and i'm doing
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.160]  the exact same thing with police and military is focused on them because we're running out of time
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:42.560]  so i hope to buy livery with them more time so that we can keep on doing that with the general
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:47.760]  population but i focus on the guys with the guns sure define what it means to be honorable i mean
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:53.520]  i mean here's the deal when i know criminals are taking over i i don't need to be told to resist
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:28:00.240]  them i in my heart i mean i feel at my heart right now a need to resist them and an absolute
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:05.280]  drive to know they've got to be stopped i mean that's just survival instinct i think we call it
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:11.840]  honor but i really just think honor is being human and following the you know the good sense god gave
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:19.200]  us yeah exactly right and it also goes back to the warrior model too um a warrior but the highest
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:26.000]  calling for a warrior is to defend and not to be an enforcer and it's not just like to cover your own
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:32.640]  rear end and to preserve yourself only it's to defend the weak and so you know if you're going
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.040]  to be if you're going to be a man and you're going to be you know call the man you should be willing
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.920]  not just to defend yourself and your family but also your community and your country and the way
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:48.560]  you defend it is you speak up and you stand out and you step up and you call out the old breakers
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:53.680]  and you confront them like you said you don't cower in fear that's why i don't like the the
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:59.440]  paradigm of the um the secret prepper also i mean yeah i can understand if you're in living
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:03.040]  in inner city new york you wouldn't want your neighbors know you have food storage i guess
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:09.120]  but the real answer is to step out there and build coalitions and community and and help each other
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:14.160]  you cannot just be an isolated prepper an isolated survivors think you're going to be doing anything
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:18.240]  because you're no longer being or you could run a compartmentalization where you do things you
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:25.520]  don't talk about but you have the public persona as well offense defense sure you got your all right
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:30.400]  long segment coming up we're going to get more into this but i'm going to tell a parable an analogy
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:36.240]  of something i i i discovered monday because folks none of us know that much those of us that
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:40.720]  know quite a bit realize how little we do know the fool thinks they know everything i'm learning new

[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:10.640]  second to second uh lexus is getting ready to roll that out folks they mean business they mean
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:15.440]  business the future doesn't need us all these science fiction movies got humans going to foreign
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:20.800]  you know planets and things the globalist plan on just getting rid of humanity and they think
[02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:25.200]  they're gonna evolve and merge with computers hey i'm not the one saying that the new york times
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:29.440]  everybody's always saying alex thinks this alex thinks that no i'm reading the news where the
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:35.840]  globalists are saying this they're a bunch of maniacs and i've had enough of them and they're
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:40.960]  going to drones and combat robots you name it to cut humans out of the equation that's why we've
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:46.160]  got to get the it's like the force of water humans are there's billions of us there's only a few
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:51.200]  thousand top globalists and a few million minions that serve them here in the us it's the same in
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:56.800]  other countries per capita and if you ever got in a stream that's just going a few miles an hour
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:02.720]  how hard it is to stand up in it see if we just push if we decide we want organic food boom they'll
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:06.640]  stop growing the inorganic because there won't be a market that's already starting to happen to a
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:11.440]  great extent that's why they're panicking if we say we want guns and just start buying them and using
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:18.320]  them and and getting somebody into guns literally it's over you take one brainwashed minion who's
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:22.880]  scared and has five locks on their door take them teach them how to shoot teach them safely they're
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:28.960]  like well that's no big deal that's easy you've now de-program them their whole programming will fall
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:34.480]  just like people started saying hey you know slavery's wrong in 1800 very small percentage
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:41.360]  sixty something years later it was outlawed folks big ideas big things start small when
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:44.960]  you're on the right you can't be stopped if you keep moving the ball down the field now I'm going
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:49.440]  back to Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers you know if you just tuned in I'm Alex Jones but I want to
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:57.360]  explain something here to everybody I you know am not a you know super healthy person I used to
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.720]  be a big sports guy got out of it got into being unhealthy eating like a pig and stuff and didn't
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.360]  work out for about 10 years except for going on occasional hike it's now it's a lot harder to get
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:12.160]  back into shape than to grow up in shape let me tell you but I go and I swim a couple miles a day
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:17.920]  most days I go and I go on you know eight mile hikes I go a little three mile jogs go through
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:23.360]  all the little injuries and stuff of being out of shape being fat but I started noticing on the
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:29.440]  hiking bike trail people not wearing shoes on hiking bike trails with limestone cliffs rocks
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:36.640]  gravel you name it and I was always marveling on an eight mile hike last week I was always
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:42.320]  marveling how they did it because you know it hurts to walk over pebbles and rocks so I went
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.000]  for a swim Monday early in the morning and I said I'm going to go down to the hiking bike trail
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:50.480]  and I'm going to take my shoes off and I'm going to walk a half mile and walk a half mile back
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:56.960]  and the first hundred yards I thought I was gonna have to turn around but you know what happened
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:02.160]  after about 400 yards ladies and gentlemen my feet went numb and and when I turned around
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:10.560]  to that last half mile I jogged back to my car with no shoes on and only had a few little cuts
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:19.200]  on my feet it was so easy it was so easy and I'm going to go jog now again I'm this time
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:25.280]  I'm going to jog a mile with no shoes now folks to me it was it was like it was like foreign
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:29.520]  planet to see these people running with no shoes I'm going to talk about a dirt trail folks I'm
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:35.280]  talking about rocks and gullies and everything and now I'll guarantee if I do that 10 times folks
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:40.000]  I'll be able to do what they do and it's the same thing with liberty now it's the converse and the
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.800]  globalist right about this I had a big banking CEO once on a first class flight to New York to go on
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:49.760]  the view you know sit there and go people will put up with anything they will adapt and we use that
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:54.000]  and that's the point is they know they can incrementally get away with evil and will accept
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.080]  incredible things including them killing us with cancer and all the rest of it and not even notice
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:03.120]  they'll use our adaptability to destroy us instead of our adaptability to defeat them
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:09.440]  Stuart do you get the point I'm making of how important this analogy is yeah absolutely I agree
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:14.000]  that's a good analogy you know they want you to believe that you need them that you're dependent
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:20.160]  on that system that there's no other way and and of course the easiest counter is to go back to
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:26.800]  being the natural human being but I mean believe me I I you know had trouble walking across my
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:31.200]  parents got a bunch of gravel at their house I didn't like walking 50 feet without shoes
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:34.960]  but I was thinking like when I was a kid I ran around everywhere without shoes
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:41.760]  through gullies and everything how did I and the weird thing was in one little mile walk I already
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.760]  had gone light years I mean it's just incredible and we could do the same thing politically
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:49.680]  people think it's uncomfortable to speak out and get involved just start doing it
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:56.800]  yeah exactly go back to like I said being being a full human being it's like it's like growing
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:02.880]  your own food or as you said earlier learning how to defend yourself with with a firearm it's
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:08.480]  these are basic human functions we've advocated our own personal responsibility for basic human
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:14.560]  functions used to be women had children my wife said all our kids all five of kids were used to be
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:18.800]  that was the norm in America as it is in most of the rest of the world you don't need a doctor for
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:23.680]  that you know unless you have a serious problem so getting back to being natural and taking
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:29.280]  responsibility for the full spectrum of human life and the full cycle of life is where it's at
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:33.920]  and the powers of being don't want that they don't want you raising your own children in
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.400]  home schooling for example they don't want you doing homework they don't want you deciding
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:42.720]  whether you want to be immunized or not and choosing not to they don't want that they
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:46.720]  want to eliminate choice they want you to feel like you have no choice whatsoever and the same
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:51.840]  goes for your own security they want you to turn over your your your security to professionals
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:58.240]  and to you know be eloy and be defenseless and their answer is is always more more power to
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:03.600]  protect you we must disarm you look at the average airport that is our future if they get
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:09.040]  their way the entire entire country and every square inch will be just like an airport where
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.600]  you could have your you know your beverages checked every now and again make sure that you're not
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:19.600]  not going to poison yourself or somebody else so that's their drive that's their paradigm is that
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:25.200]  you need them you need to be subject to them and they and they need more and more control their
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:29.440]  answer is always more and more control so your response to be that we don't need the don't need
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:36.880]  you and we're going to live as free people now don't wait for a lot of you past don't wait for a
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:42.400]  political party to do this you do it as an individual but also start focusing on community
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:47.520]  you're going to need each other to write out the storm you need to have not just you and your family
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:53.600]  you need to have close friends and allies forming a mutual aid societies and mutual defense societies
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:57.360]  now well here's an example and we'll go to calls with Stuart Rhodes founder wealth gapers
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:02.160]  again i'm alex jones for tuning in for the first time we're now on over 130 am and fm stations
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:08.640]  one of the few true you know diverse areas of media where the opportunity is is talk radio and i
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:14.320]  support you know licensed am and fm stations i think there's a place for that statewide not not
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:19.360]  really federal i don't like the FCC but i get in that limited spectrum you know the factor needs to
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.640]  be a basic process kind of like striking a claim but that said in an emergency situation with tyranny
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:28.880]  and all the spots they have open on the dial now with digital they were supposed to give
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:34.320]  local community stations or local small groups these hundred and three hundred watt stations
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:39.360]  they didn't do that that was supposed to go to micro fm and as long as micro fm known as pirate
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:45.760]  doesn't interfere with commercial stations uh it's such an important thing but i have watched
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.040]  from afar i don't know all of them but i've met some of the people over the years involved
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:56.640]  the local group in austin with 90.1 fm and we're on 99.7 k lbj we're on 590 you know we're on
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:02.720]  some other stations in texas uh but but the issue is 90.1 shows up high in the ratings
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:09.760]  it's a micro that's been there for years uh covers most of the city and the people involved just
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:13.360]  passed it around over the years with different people running that's why i'm not sure he's running
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:16.960]  today i've met him at events and things but i happened to have read the news a while back
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:22.640]  it's going to the supreme court they've been winning in federal court to have this micro fm
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:28.080]  that covers a city of a million people all the way to the supreme court now and and and that's
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:33.440]  people fighting to get the word out and put my show on and i'm not even influencing them or asking
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:39.120]  them going to the supreme court and again it took them years to even come after it or find it
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:44.560]  there's the government so slow they they all operate off of our compliance is my point Stuart
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:52.720]  Stuart yeah and so and also on your laziness too i mean the average person out there just defaults to
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:58.480]  turning on the boob tube and cnn or listening to whatever's on the radio they're they're relying
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:03.680]  on that and so that's why i love the internet and i and i love talk radio these are ways of getting
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:09.840]  around that control grid and so we need we need to encourage that and utilize it ourselves sure
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:14.480]  here's an example they try to block people getting small ams that just go around the neighborhood or
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.640]  little fm's that cover the neighborhood the plug it into an internet site and broadcast your neighborhood
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:23.600]  put up signs everybody starts listening now they try to block domestic groups selling these little
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:28.720]  stations whether it's a tenth of a watt a watt whatever to anybody but but there's government
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:33.600]  so slow you could still order it from foreign countries you know the point is folks be the
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.800]  change you want to see in the world go ahead yeah exactly and everyone in the liberty movement were
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:44.160]  to just go and get one more person looking up then you double the size for the liberty movement
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:50.240]  then you do it again and again and again and we win so you know replicate yourselves don't just
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.200]  speak to the choir and and be in a sound chamber with you and your friends go out there attend
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:00.480]  community events uh join organizations you can work through your church you can work through
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:06.640]  veterans organizations um local you know the Shriners whatever it is maybe not the Shriners
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:11.120]  but it's whatever you want to do just work in your local community no i say i say go into the
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:15.360]  i just say every group i i mean i've thought about marching right into the masonic temple
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:19.840]  and saying you guys all claim you helped found america and fighting tyranny you better get
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:26.000]  out there and do it instead of promoting evil i say i mean i say go to the go to lulac got on
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.880]  to loraza i mean i've i've i've i've over the years gone i'll go to anybody and try to wake them up
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:37.040]  yeah i mean you get bigger battles i i try to focus on people that i think are more receptive
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:42.880]  yeah like second amendment groups ron paul type groups you name it yeah just even this non-political
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:47.040]  groups just get involved in your community and you'll meet people like like with shooting you
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:50.800]  go out to the range and you shoot you become shooting buddies and then you start talking
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:56.000]  to them about what's going on and and once once your friend it's a lot easier to switch them on
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:00.080]  rather than you know running up to them and saying hey this is going on you know they don't know who
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:05.680]  you are so get to know people yeah get the neighbors again i want to go to calls i want to go to
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:09.440]  calls yeah instead of just watching tv all day he drives through neighborhoods that the look the
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:15.040]  reason we sell the info wars magazine it's now 60 pages glossy ladies and gentlemen with a full
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:20.720]  sized poster inside uh you name it the reason we sell these is they're really just color booklets
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:26.400]  but it's not a booklet it's it's the size of the old rolling stone it's huge we sell these
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:31.440]  in bulk in groups of 10 20 up to 100 at cost it comes up to like a dollar 40 something a piece
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:37.840]  to wake people up and it will do it and folks you need to get aggressive because they can
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:44.480]  have internet kill switch but if you have got these magazines these uh again are powerful
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:49.840]  weapons to wake people up these are seeds that you can plant steward i want to go to some calls
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:54.560]  but people can subscribe get 12 issues such as their friends and family at info wars store.com
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:46:00.720]  info wars magazine or they can buy them in bulk and info wars store.com or call 888-253-3139
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:06.320]  but steward just briefly because we got to get the calls as promised uh what do you see as the
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:11.760]  time frame on all this currently right now is them trying to stage a false flag or where all this is
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:17.760]  going oh my concern is is that we i think we should operate under the assumption we only have a
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:22.640]  matter of months and the reason i say that is because they understand they have to do something
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:27.920]  soon liberty movement is growing and so i think it's i think it's better to err on a side of caution
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:32.640]  and prepare yourselves or you know take it three month chunks so assume you only have three months
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:37.280]  and then roll that over again if you get past three months great then do it again but but strengthen
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:42.000]  your position as much as you possibly can for yourself and your family and your friends your
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.400]  local community um operate on the assumption you only have three months of time but while you're
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:51.120]  doing that you're waking up other people and getting ready at the same time do both together
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:56.400]  as a two-prong attack you know why you may be right about it three months i'm not saying that's
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:59.840]  going to happen but they're currently got their finger on the trigger they've got all the new
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:04.880]  tv shows coming out where the militias are going to kill everybody that's a full rollout they've
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:10.880]  got the public news rollout that we're the new terrorist and so it's the pre-hype uh is like
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:15.840]  what we saw before 9-11 introducing al-qaeda and so they definitely got their finger on the trigger
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:21.120]  yeah and also we've been hearing you know and you can look at the economy of course and see
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:26.160]  from that itself if there's a number it cannot stay up much longer but we've also been hearing
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:30.320]  from sources of the government they're preparing for an economic collapse this has been going on
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.080]  for the last couple of years and you've you've heard a lot of that i've heard a lot of that
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.000]  through different channels and so we know they're getting ready for it and so we should expect it
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  to happen you're right let's jam in some calls here julius in pennsylvania patiently holding
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:50.800]  welcome julius hi thank you alex for having me i just started listening to you last week and uh let
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:56.640]  me tell you i've um pretty much since i was a little kid uh i've always questioned all these
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:02.560]  conspiracies and i thought i was nuts and it wasn't just you it was a governor but jessie ventura
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.000]  who confirmed in everything and i just want to say thank you uh for your leadership and with god's
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.560]  help and and your leadership and and my own wisdom with my family i'll be able to prepare as best as
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:18.400]  i can for what i hope is if not true but i guess it is true um and i just want to say thank you from
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:21.520]  the bottom of my heart well thank you i mean people are always saying when's the new world
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:26.480]  are coming we're already in the hot water we're in the tub like bug's bunny when you know the
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:31.840]  pygmies are about to cook him and they're lighting the fire we need to get out of the cook pot and
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:35.440]  people need to understand like where's the war alex that they were gonna have the middle east
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:40.400]  they've got wars going in three countries now on top of iraq and afghanistan it's all they just
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:45.280]  don't call it a war we're already going into marshal law when they have checkpoints on highways
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.880]  and stuff and are suspending stewart roads federal court rules that they can put cameras on your
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:56.720]  property without warrants i mean come on i mean come on that's that you know that's seen at news
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:02.880]  i mean this is outrageous yeah i mean i mean this this is this is the problem is we're running
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:10.240]  we're running on a short timeline towards conflict they're putting in place the not just
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:16.560]  a surveillance structure but the totalitarian enforcement structure of bringing the war paradigm
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:22.720]  home and destroying what's left the ragged treads are left of the constitution they're
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.640]  destroying the fourth amendment they're destroying the fifth and sixth the right to jury trial
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:31.280]  is being thrown out the window all of this is happening and so of course people say then what
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:36.880]  do you do about it well but the answer is is to wake up people to the illegitimacy of it
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:43.520]  and especially among the military police and veterans of critical groups so that fewer enforcers
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:49.040]  will be there to do it to you and more confident people who know how to fight will be ready to
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:54.160]  fight and not disparaging the average private citizen you should also learn don't rely on
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:59.280]  professional warrior class you go become a warrior too go to an apple seed shoot learn how to shoot
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:04.720]  your right exactly none of us none of us are looking for trouble but my my family's not going
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:08.560]  to one of their FEMA camps with a bunch of potbellied communists having their way it just
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:13.440]  didn't happen and we all need to work as hard as we can now so we don't have to do that folks
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:18.480]  because here's the deal these these authoritarians aren't going to give up without a fight we just
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:22.640]  like like Stuart said we've got to affect the battle space now and get as many people as we
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.920]  can awake okay because they want to take you to a torture camp that's they like raping children
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:32.400]  they just arrested another tsa raping little kids reportedly i mean this is what they want you
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:38.400]  understand go ahead Stuart sorry well i mean the other answer is civil disobedience um if you
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:44.160]  have like you said earlier when when you get moving with a large mass of people they can't be stopped
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:49.840]  and so one answer is don't don't comply be willing to be like inner david thorough and be willing to
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:55.040]  get a jail for your non-compliance but spread that meme of non-compliance and it all comes right down
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:51:01.280]  to is being courageous rather than fearful and sabotage the enemy at any level you can
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:06.080]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:11.760]  year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy

[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:44.080]  linked to are m4s.com, prismplanner.com and they have set on record they are listeners of this show
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:49.600]  mr bellamy popped in one time at the show and again i'm not bragging i'm saying look all over the
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:55.680]  world people know the score and and no matter how authoritarian this system gets once we know it's
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:55:03.280]  criminal and bad then we just remove our support and they fall like chelchescu it comes down to that
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:09.840]  so expose the globalists but also get prepared with strategic relocation the film now available

[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:22.080]  philip in california uh you're on the air with steward rhodes go ahead hi thank you steward
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:26.960]  honor to speak with you um question i have uh a couple questions i'll get to them quickly the first
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.320]  one is um for someone who's trying to um prepare themselves and really gain a training that's
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:36.480]  necessary uh is there any kind of recommendation steward you would uh you could provide as far as
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:43.360]  how to approach um uh either former or current members of the military etc in training go take
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:47.680]  apple seed training learn how to use a rifle learn how to shoot at about 200 300 yards
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:51.600]  first and just know how to hike and know how to defend yourself that's what i'd say steward
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:57.840]  yeah that's that's right and and of course you can also just go in and go to your local bfw
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:02.800]  hall and uh you know see what they need maybe you can work with them to to help your community
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:07.120]  get more prepared and within oath keepers we have an operations thicken giant program that's
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.080]  focused on outreach to veterans if you want to jump on board with that contact us through
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:18.160]  oath keepers dot org and you can help us outreach to the veterans um but the best thing to do is
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:23.760]  is to you know they're veterans out there get with them and they can they can plug you in the guys
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:28.560]  they know that have you know these training in the military and they should be out teaching people
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:33.520]  and replicating those those skills the average american should have basic infantry skills that's
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:38.080]  what you're supposed to be doing if you don't know how to move shoot communicate and a fire team
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:44.240]  in a squad then you're not a full american frankly i mean the big deal is here folks
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:51.440]  i i i've just like you know like most people i that are pro liberty just grew up in it and
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:55.920]  know how to have been shooting guns since you're four years old uh you tell people that never shot
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:02.000]  guns they don't understand but um i mean the biggest thing is you need a 308 style rifle
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:10.640]  uh and uh you need to learn how to use it and also you need to decide what your red lines are
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:14.320]  you know when you're going to have to defend yourself against criminals uh does that answer
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:19.840]  your question sir uh yeah that's a part of it definitely and i and i have uh i'm working on
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:24.160]  trying to train myself now and using youtube one thing i was thinking of which would i
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.640]  using uh funded info wars dot com i'm a member of that so thank you for it if there's more
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:32.400]  service members could provide um they're providing some insight on that if they can provide more
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:36.160]  insight that'd be great and then i'm trying to reach out to people from there to develop networks
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:41.200]  and and sure but it's like you said i mean you know uh the main thing is it's not that it's bad
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:44.640]  to go out and try to get military training it's that that if you did it on craigslist it's going
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:48.880]  to be a cop wanting to go meet you and they're going to meet their new let's let's kill people
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:52.720]  and even if you say no they'll just give you plastic explosives and put you in jail and put
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:58.400]  you on the news because they've been told they'll be promoted if they frame somebody um so uh you
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:03.440]  know the uh bigger i'm talking about feds when i say cops uh you know the biggest issue is there's a
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:09.920]  lot of uh military historical associations there's a lot of shooting clubs get into a shooting club
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:17.120]  and then just don't say i want a military train then then then over time you'll meet good people
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:22.160]  and it's not an automatic process do you agree with that statement steward well there are there
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:26.400]  are people out there who provide training and small unit tactics the main thing is is don't get
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:31.920]  involved in discussions of illegal actions you can train and learn the skills without without being
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:37.120]  snared don't let someone talk to you about about many crimes stay there let's take a few more calls

[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:04.400]  and fourth is state sovereignty and local sovereignty we want to focus on those four main
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:10.000]  preparation points so that we can strengthen our our communities we think veterans are
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:15.200]  could be very very powerful leaders in doing that in our local communities that's right the
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:19.760]  globalists have captured washington completely they brag i mean i'm not just saying that as a
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:24.000]  figure of speech we are occupied now they're trying to mop up the states we've got to take the
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.400]  states back to defend them uh from foreign infiltration we've still got those bulkheads the
[03:01:28.400 --> 03:01:34.000]  founders put in place the second amendment the jury the grand jury the state bulkheads the firewalls
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:38.400]  they've breached a lot of them but we still can use these as positions try to restore the republic
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:45.360]  from debora in texas you're on the air welcome hey hello i'd like to say hello to both of you
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:54.560]  thank you my my question is um when they move to a higher scale of threat let's say for example
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:02:00.880]  scientific engineering or social engineering situations um what do you think about the
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:07.920]  possibility that um there were maybe even scientific investments in the harp weapons
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:11.840]  well i mean man they admit major weather modification the white house ordered dhs to
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:16.720]  control hurricanes that's washington post i mean it's definitely going on and that's the problem
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:20.400]  of this national security state they've got trillions of our dollars to do whatever they
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:26.400]  want in secret including shipping narcotics in steward your take on that i'm sorry i couldn't
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:30.000]  hear you just said uh yeah we need to get you headphones when we do this because you got to
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.760]  keep your audio down or it feeds back and you can't hear us while she was talking about harp
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:40.000]  weapons weather modification i'm not really an expert on that unfortunately no i understand
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:46.240]  uh erin in alaska man that was a good point thank you debora uh erin go ahead yeah i would just
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:53.200]  check in uh with you being you know anti globalist anti police state um i got pulled over for a d
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:03:01.520]  way on atb and my girlfriend was in my truck two vehicles behind me the law in alaska is the cops
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:08.160]  have to take all the firearms and any stop and the cop got a call after he put all six firearms
[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:13.920]  over three thousand dollars on a shrunk got a call for backup drove off damaged all of them the police
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:19.600]  state troopers will not give me a report on it and they gave me instructions but those instructions
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:26.000]  they gave me do not fall you know i mean all you have to sue them uh in small claims court get
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:32.080]  their name and drag them in there but that's a law in in alaska that they have to confiscate
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:36.800]  your guns it's it's kind of bizarre yeah i don't think so give me your constitutional lawyers
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:41.280]  we don't know that law there but alaska law is pretty in line with uh the constitution right
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.480]  start well i mean they've got they've got um permanent list open carry which is good but
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:49.760]  but you know i don't know what we know what law he's talking about he could be right i don't know
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:55.120]  if he is then that's ridiculous so he needed to change the law work to change the law in the
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:04:01.680]  state that that's the case i had no firearms on me and they took him from a vehicle two behind me
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:07.440]  and i'd been drinking i did end up getting charged for dui but i didn't get belly misconduct because
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:10.880]  i was not well i mean i would have just told him you're not drinking you know the issue here is
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:16.160]  just none of their business it's all a fraud and and and people need to stop talking don't even
[03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:21.120]  lie to the cops just don't talk and have they know how they know there were guns in the in the car
[03:04:21.120 --> 03:04:28.640]  two two cars behind they walked up to my girlfriend in the car and started asking her and it is a
[03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:33.840]  state law appear that you have to declare firearms but i mean what do they do pull three cars over at
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:39.200]  a time well we were all stopped at a stop sign and they they nailed me to stop sign i wasn't
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:43.760]  even moving the atv so and then decided to grab a bunch of other cars well i'm glad they're stopping
