[00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:15.619]  This is going to be an incredibly jam-packed, historic transmission.
[00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.919]  I know how to defeat the globalists.
[00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.500]  I've done deep research and I've had major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.601]  I'm going to do my best to lay it all out today.
[00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:30.662]  The pastor has now been SWAT teamed, the Polish pastor up in Canada, who said no to their illegal actions.
[00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:31.482]  He's now been SWAT teamed.
[00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.882]  He'll be joining us coming up next hour.
[00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:35.183]  That happened yesterday.
[00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:36.563]  Steve Quill will be joining us and
[00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:40.937]  Another great patriot has been put on a no-fly list.
[00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.839]  Nick Fuentes just gave us this info minutes ago.
[00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.240]  That'll be an exclusive coming up.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.243]  We have Biden, our lord and king and master, telling us he's about to lift some of the mask mandate.
[00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:52.464]  We'll give you the details of that.
[00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:56.426]  But first, a new Gregg Reese report dealing with Big Pharma's enslavement of humanity.
[00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:05.892]  Not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:16.044]  People are finding strange fibers inside their masks and in the COVID-19 test swabs.
[00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:30.351]  Many people are pointing out the similarities between these fibers and Morgellons disease, a mysterious unexplained skin condition characterized by small fibers emerging from skin sores.
[00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:35.114]  But the fibers we are seeing in the mask and test swabs seem to be different.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.301]  Many have suggested that they are normal constructive fibers.
[00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:47.623]  But upon close examination, they do exhibit strange qualities.
[00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:54.265]  In this video, when affected by wind, the fiber behaves exactly how one would expect.
[00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:57.866]  But when breathed upon, it reacts differently.
[00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:01.027]  It appears to come to life.
[00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:05.248]  The fibers look and behave similar to how theragrippers are described.
[00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:13.364]  Inspired by parasitic worms, Theragrippers were created at Johns Hopkins University.
[00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:21.069]  Theragrippers are as small as a speck of dust and designed to deliver time-release medication into the host body.
[00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:31.476]  They operate like small compressed springs with a temperature-triggered coating that releases the stored energy autonomously at body temperature.
[00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:34.598]  Compressed springs with temperature-triggered coating
[00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.031]  The mask fiber's reaction to human breath could easily be described as spring-like.
[00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:48.713]  And while one is wearing the mask, the fibers would be springing in towards their mouths as they breathe.
[00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:58.715]  As if the masks were a delivery system for hidden theragrippers loaded with drugs ready to be released into the host's bloodstream.
[00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:04.857]  The same spring-like fibers can be found in both the masks and the COVID-19 test swabs.
[00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:12.100]  Under magnification, the test swab appears to have glass-like fibers.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:21.447]  In one experiment, the PCR test swab was rubbed against a piece of raw meat to roughly emulate the living tissue inside our nasal cavity.
[00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:27.712]  And several of the glass-like fibers deeply penetrated themselves into the flesh.
[00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:32.996]  Is this happening inside of our nasal cavity when we are being tested?
[00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.177]  Perhaps this is normal.
[00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:42.445]  There was a time in the not-so-distant past when this would all sound crazy, but those days are over.
[00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:50.787]  Millions of people are proudly volunteering to have their DNA permanently experimented on by Big Pharma.
[00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:53.608]  We are living in a new era.
[00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:58.069]  DARPA has been developing BCIs, brain-computer interfaces, since the 1960s.
[00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:05.739]  And now they're ready to inject our military with a technology that will continuously test their blood.
[00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:15.322]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:21.863]  The overwhelming desire of the powers that be seems to be putting something inside of us.
[00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:25.864]  Putting an experimental vaccine inside of us.
[00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:29.205]  Putting the remnants of an aborted child inside of us.
[00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:34.166]  How is that any different than rape?
[00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:40.509]  And how is it that anyone is actually okay with any of this?
[00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.592]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:49.875]  The report just went live at Band.Video, out of the park, important.
[00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:55.698]  Band.Video, left-hand side, click the navigation bar, and Greg Reese is ready for you right there.
[00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.277]  I one trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:03.957]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[00:05:03.957 --> 00:05:04.957]  I'll just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:07.638]  People say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:08.658]  That's embarrassing.
[00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:11.238]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:13.619]  But I'll tell you this right now.
[00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.119]  You're nuts if you don't get storable food.
[00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:21.120]  And I've got the biggest, best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.541]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes even better?
[00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:25.621]  Yeah.
[00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:27.987]  Most of this stuff tastes amazing.
[00:05:27.987 --> 00:05:29.109]  Some of it tastes okay.
[00:05:29.109 --> 00:05:32.674]  The point is it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:35.198]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:48.428]  We've got three months, six months, your supplies right now, and I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10% off again, because you're so conditionally fond of Supercell, we're doing it one more time.
[00:05:48.428 --> 00:05:50.630]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.992]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:56.154]  10% off the entire catalog of my patron supply.
[00:05:56.154 --> 00:05:57.215]  Get ready while you still can.
[00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:15.265]  InfoWars.
[00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:17.189]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:19.273]  It's Tuesday, April 27th.
[00:06:19.273 --> 00:06:21.417]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.450]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:36.754]  Very blessed and honored that you've chosen to join us today.
[00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:37.535]  So here we are.
[00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:50.801]  I'm going to be very calm here because this is so important and so huge and so illegal and so over the top that if we just put this information out there, it'll become normalized.
[00:06:51.613 --> 00:06:53.054]  We must soak this in.
[00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:54.395]  We must cogitate on it.
[00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:58.217]  We must mull around psychologically, spiritually.
[00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:01.338]  We should pray about this.
[00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.580]  Because this is all now revealing itself.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.101]  It's coming out in the open.
[00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.062]  Just in one stack.
[00:07:10.178 --> 00:07:13.100]  One stack of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.083]  One inch tall stack of 24 stacks, this is just today's news, is so mind-blowing, so key, so important that I shudder at even trying to properly
[00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:49.679]  I will just direct you in this segment to what the big stories are in my view, and then I will humbly try to cover it as best I can.
[00:07:49.679 --> 00:08:01.628]  And then we got big guests coming up as well, with SWAT teams attacking churches in Canada now, and just yesterday, and Nick Fuentes put on a no-fly list joining us.
[00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:05.940]  Steve Quayle coming on, and just all hell breaking loose.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.243]  It's just going to get crazier from here on out, but at least it's going to be out in the open.
[00:08:11.243 --> 00:08:17.005]  But let me give you the big news, and all of these are huge, and all of these connect together.
[00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:19.907]  Obviously, Biden doesn't have the power to mandate masks.
[00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:23.008]  He doesn't have the power to say, now you can go outside without a mask.
[00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:24.649]  Now you can go to 4th of July.
[00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:25.289]  I'm your God.
[00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:25.810]  I'm your King.
[00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.370]  I'm your Savior.
[00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:30.414]  That is a gigantor story.
[00:08:30.414 --> 00:08:36.695]  And Tucker Carlson coming out and saying, don't just not wear a mask in public.
[00:08:36.695 --> 00:08:45.558]  Educate people that it doesn't protect them and that it actually hurts children's health psychologically and physically in major studies.
[00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.399]  Well, next year's news today.
[00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:55.161]  I've been out since April of last year every week in an armored vehicle because the left in Austin attacks us with bottles, hatchets and hammers.
[00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.292]  And other devices, it's all on video.
[00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:02.656]  Cue that up later, the guy attacking the armored vehicle with a hammer, please.
[00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:09.421]  It's happened about five times now, but... We go out and tell them, hey, the masks are never coming off until you say no.
[00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:18.148]  That gives you bacterial pneumonia, it psychologically screws up children, and it doesn't protect you.
[00:09:18.148 --> 00:09:23.893]  And Carlson is now saying that you need to go out, and just like you see somebody beating their kid at Walmart,
[00:09:25.054 --> 00:09:29.278]  You need to say, hey, you need to stop that.
[00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:32.481]  Quite frankly, you're their parent, the kid's out of control, maybe they need a good spat.
[00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:33.602]  Maybe he's being too liberal there.
[00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:37.945]  The point is, this is child abuse.
[00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:42.750]  More like you see somebody breaking the skin at Walmart.
[00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.854]  I'm all about reward and punishment with kids, carrot and sticks, banging isn't needed a lot, but sometimes it is needed.
[00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:52.058]  His point is to the left, is that you're abusing children here.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.301]  That's coming up.
[00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.502]  Now, that's not the number one COVID story.
[00:09:55.502 --> 00:09:56.343]  It's very important.
[00:09:56.343 --> 00:10:09.634]  It ties into Biden, that whole discussion of pushing back, of getting on the offense, because they're bullies and say you can't get on an airplane or have a job until you take an experimental vaccine that doesn't protect you.
[00:10:09.634 --> 00:10:10.895]  It's been banned in a bunch of countries.
[00:10:10.895 --> 00:10:12.496]  It's preposterous.
[00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:16.139]  That's an important one story out of this.
[00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:20.220]  We've got three articles on it.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.884]  What Biden said to announce today, the statistics on the mask, and then what Tucker said.
[00:10:24.884 --> 00:10:26.124]  That's my research here.
[00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:29.107]  This isn't props I put out here on the desk to impress you.
[00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:31.589]  I went over all this today and last night.
[00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.111]  All of it.
[00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:39.675]  So, that's one little three-page thing out of this.
[00:10:39.675 --> 00:10:42.317]  Just imagine my frustration every day trying to get to all this.
[00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:43.718]  It's impossible.
[00:10:43.718 --> 00:10:46.240]  Here's the big, super supreme enchilada.
[00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:58.486]  Medical doctors all over the world, from Germany to Canada, that say this, are being arrested by the police.
[00:10:58.486 --> 00:10:59.926]  That's coming up.
[00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:12.011]  German police ransacked the house of doctor after he provides evidence in court that children are endangered in their mental, physical, and spiritual well-being by the obligation to wear face masks.
[00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:16.892]  I know this, they're going to hate leftist control freaks for the rest of their life.
[00:11:16.892 --> 00:11:18.133]  Now, you think that's big?
[00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:26.261]  That is the least important stack of the COVID news, and it's incredibly important.
[00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:28.963]  Get ready for this.
[00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:33.406]  I was sitting there this morning with my iPad, checking out enemy publications.
[00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:43.895]  I went to the New York Times and started choking on my bite of egg, literally coughing it up, because it's just so outrageous.
[00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:48.839]  Not only have they shut India down and they admit starved two million people to death extra,
[00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:53.847]  With the lockdown that's now back in place and will kill millions more.
[00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:57.850]  And so that's why there's more funeral pyres there.
[00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:05.176]  They not only banned the Pfizer shot three months ago because in illegal testing it turned out Pfizer was doing a bunch of people got sick and died.
[00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:07.418]  Hold on to your hat.
[00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:15.404]  The AstraZeneca vaccine now banned in more than 30 countries, 21 in Europe, the Philippines, a bunch of others.
[00:12:15.404 --> 00:12:17.146]  Had the crew print me a big list of those today.
[00:12:19.148 --> 00:12:20.728]  So many countries, I can't even keep track.
[00:12:20.728 --> 00:12:23.349]  Every time I think there's 30-something, it's probably 50-something.
[00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:29.570]  I mean, there's just new ones all the time because of deaths and blood clots and strokes and heart attacks.
[00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.671]  The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most banned vaccine in the world.
[00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:37.152]  And when you say, hey, I don't want it, they go, you're insane, it's totally safe!
[00:12:37.152 --> 00:12:38.852]  Even though it's banned everywhere.
[00:12:38.852 --> 00:12:41.593]  Gaslighting.
[00:12:41.593 --> 00:12:45.294]  It gets more out of control.
[00:12:45.294 --> 00:12:46.194]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:51.671]  Joe Biden announced yesterday he's going to send aid to India.
[00:12:51.671 --> 00:13:01.378]  It's not vitamin C, it's not vitamin D, it's not an end to the lockdown, it's not zinc, it's not even oxygen bottles.
[00:13:01.378 --> 00:13:12.627]  When any medical doctor, the Indians aren't stupid, they're poor because the population is so huge, that you can do inhaled steroid and 100% of the time helps you, knocks it out.
[00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:14.468]  They're not telling them any of that.
[00:13:14.468 --> 00:13:15.369]  They're shipping them
[00:13:17.617 --> 00:13:23.042]  Tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca that's even banned in the U.S.
[00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:24.763]  is not authorized in the U.S.
[00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:29.647]  Biden's gonna dump Europe's banned vaccine on the Indians!
[00:13:29.647 --> 00:13:31.009]  Total war crime!
[00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:35.012]  I mean, there's no end!
[00:13:35.012 --> 00:13:37.114]  Wait, it gets worse!
[00:13:37.114 --> 00:13:39.336]  That's only the fourth article!
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.520]  Now you're starting to get where I'm coming from.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:57.663]  I could talk the whole show, and maybe we should, about just dumping a banned vaccine in 21 countries in Europe, and all total 30-something around the world, because it kills so many people.
[00:13:57.663 --> 00:13:59.363]  Makes your blood basically dissolve.
[00:13:59.363 --> 00:14:05.844]  Makes all your platelets disappear.
[00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:06.764]  And they call it a blood clot.
[00:14:06.764 --> 00:14:07.545]  It's not a blood clot.
[00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:09.265]  Your blood just falls apart.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.041]  Oh, but U.S.
[00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:18.328]  is sending vaccine materials to ravaged, COVID ravaged India, Bloomberg.
[00:14:18.328 --> 00:14:19.809]  It should be U.S.
[00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:29.820]  dumps unapproved vaccine in the U.S., banned across the world, dangerous drug, just like what Bayer did when they got caught in Europe.
[00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:35.324]  Putting HIV and Hepatitis in the Factor VIII with Bill Clinton out of Arkansas.
[00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:38.644]  They would certify all the blood out of Arkansas as tested and safe.
[00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:41.465]  They would not certify it knowing it had HIV and Hepatitis.
[00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:47.426]  They would mix it together in giant vats, purify out the blood clotting factor.
[00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:48.706]  They called it Factor VIII.
[00:14:48.706 --> 00:14:59.228]  And then Bayer, good old Heil Hitler Bayer, their own executives in Australia and Canada and France are on the record saying,
[00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:03.756]  There are too many hemophiliacs.
[00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:07.661]  Dump it on the third world.
[00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:10.846]  That all came out at the time.
[00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:15.972]  And they even had meetings about, there's too many hemophiliacs.
[00:15:15.972 --> 00:15:17.194]  Dump it on them.
[00:15:17.194 --> 00:15:17.715]  That's a quote.
[00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:21.357]  Dump it on them.
[00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:23.397]  Because they're liberal.
[00:15:23.397 --> 00:15:25.018]  Ah, yes.
[00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:27.378]  And now the banned vaccine.
[00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:29.799]  Oh, we're going to give it to the Indians.
[00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:33.319]  And Bloomberg's loving and liberal.
[00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:35.720]  And now he's going to commit a holocaust against the Indians.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.481]  But it's OK, because he's liberal.
[00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.322]  That's just, oh, that's just two of the COVID stories.
[00:15:42.322 --> 00:15:43.802]  I'll tell you about the other ones when we come back.
[00:15:44.474 --> 00:15:50.017]  There's so much, but then there's pushback, and that's really overall probably the most important, isn't it?
[00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:53.439]  Because if we don't start standing up, we're all dead and doornails.
[00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:57.341]  To Indians today, it's all of us tomorrow.
[00:15:57.341 --> 00:15:59.863]  It is a big idea.
[00:15:59.863 --> 00:16:03.785]  A new world order.
[00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:08.428]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:16:08.428 --> 00:16:11.530]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.711]  Put their objective being world domination,
[00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:16.807]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:16:17.692 --> 00:16:25.878]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:16:25.878 --> 00:16:28.520]  The globalists feared this film made 14 years ago.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.741]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:32.202]  It is the blueprint for the Great Reset.
[00:16:32.202 --> 00:16:33.263]  It is, in-game.
[00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:34.504]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.

[00:16:52.316 --> 00:16:56.958]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.520]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.222]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:09.926]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.
[00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:10.887]  We're good to go.

[00:18:00.544 --> 00:18:03.166]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.265]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:18:23.265 --> 00:18:24.966]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:26.628]  Well, so does he.
[00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:37.177]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18:37.177 --> 00:18:42.482]  Well, Tucker Carlson, as usual, knocked it out of the park last night.
[00:18:42.482 --> 00:18:43.043]  And he said, look,
[00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:48.571]  You have MIT, you have all these big studies that masks don't protect you, don't help you.
[00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:53.513]  Having people stand six feet apart is just made up.
[00:18:53.513 --> 00:19:05.597]  It's all crap, but it makes you feel good and it makes the little busybodies who want to enforce it get into the game of spying on their neighbors, tattling as people are having a secret church service.
[00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:12.300]  It gets them into the mode and then vertically integrates the economy for the big banks and big tech, who've all become even more powerful
[00:19:12.998 --> 00:19:19.282]  In the process, it's about global domination, like it always is with these tyrants.
[00:19:19.282 --> 00:19:42.576]  And now medical doctors in Canada, in Germany, in England, I've seen it in the news, more today, are being ransacked, are being arrested for doing video streams online, giving out medical information and telling people that most of the COVID deaths were other things, which even the New York Times admits, but they're the New York Times.
[00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:54.578]  I saw an MSNBC article, I saw an NBC story last week saying, oh, all these people that got arrested that weren't violent at the Capitol, who said they were journalists, they don't work for mainstream news, so they're not protected.
[00:19:54.578 --> 00:20:07.610]  Yes, the CNN reporters, yes, the Wall Street Journal reporters, yes, Nancy Pelosi's nephew, yes, yes, yes, yes, the National Geographic, they were allowed in, but everybody else, you're not journalists.
[00:20:09.168 --> 00:20:10.710]  Here's an InfoWars.com article.
[00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:17.876]  Facebook bans Australian Member of Parliament for anti-lockdown post.
[00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:22.599]  Members of Parliament aren't allowed to have their free speech now.
[00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:22.920]  You see?
[00:20:25.777 --> 00:20:28.218]  Because they're saying we should be not locked down.
[00:20:28.218 --> 00:20:30.859]  You know, they're saying if they have one case in Australia, they're going to lock down.
[00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:32.259]  One case in New Zealand.
[00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:34.840]  And the testing is almost 100% fake.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.781]  It's all based on fraud.
[00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:39.021]  Is there real cold viruses cooked up in labs?
[00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:40.822]  Does Bill Gates own them with Fauci?
[00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:41.382]  Absolutely.
[00:20:41.382 --> 00:20:43.503]  Do they have more deadly versions coming out?
[00:20:43.503 --> 00:20:49.385]  Do all the studies show that taking the vaccine makes you a shedder that breeds real deadly viruses in your body?
[00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:52.226]  That's now, it looks like sterilizing women?
[00:20:54.522 --> 00:20:59.044]  Who haven't even ever had the vaccine but are next to people?
[00:20:59.044 --> 00:21:02.005]  That's in the mainline literature!
[00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:14.909]  That's why schools around the world are banning people working there who've taken the experimental mRNA gene therapy because it can cause the spread of real viruses.
[00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:19.911]  That's even your precious Wall Street Journal and NPR reporting that.
[00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:24.172]  So it's a big, big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:25.137 --> 00:21:33.480]  But let's go ahead and go to this piece from Tucker Carlson last night, saying this is child abuse, and when you see people doing it to children, say something to them.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.501]  I do it.
[00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:36.802]  I lovingly say, hey, you know, they give them bacterial pneumonia.
[00:21:36.802 --> 00:21:40.983]  You know, children can't even get sick from COVID, really.
[00:21:40.983 --> 00:21:44.065]  But again, they feel like the social pressure, they want a virtue signal.
[00:21:44.065 --> 00:21:48.326]  Now, I got photos here in my stack of people putting masks on their dogs.
[00:21:48.326 --> 00:21:53.288]  It's real, folks.
[00:21:53.288 --> 00:21:54.869]  So here is Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.413]  Masks prevent intimacy and human contact.
[00:21:59.413 --> 00:22:02.593]  If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[00:22:02.593 --> 00:22:04.154]  Masks are for the guilty.
[00:22:04.154 --> 00:22:06.834]  They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[00:22:06.834 --> 00:22:10.495]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public.
[00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:13.196]  Only Klansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[00:22:13.196 --> 00:22:14.336]  The rest of us showed our face.
[00:22:14.336 --> 00:22:16.276]  We were free people.
[00:22:16.276 --> 00:22:24.578]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti, and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year, and it's still going on.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.423]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[00:22:30.423 --> 00:22:36.107]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience, like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[00:22:36.107 --> 00:22:38.029]  We wear them because we have to.
[00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:42.512]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics.
[00:22:42.512 --> 00:22:44.053]  How neurotic are they?
[00:22:44.053 --> 00:22:45.174]  Well, we know.
[00:22:45.174 --> 00:22:55.301]  A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[00:22:56.084 --> 00:22:59.605]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[00:22:59.605 --> 00:23:07.546]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask, angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:08.566]  How could you?
[00:23:08.566 --> 00:23:10.547]  They're saying from behind the gauze.
[00:23:10.547 --> 00:23:11.747]  How could you?
[00:23:11.747 --> 00:23:15.128]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[00:23:15.128 --> 00:23:17.268]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first.
[00:23:17.268 --> 00:23:18.548]  They're the aggressors.
[00:23:18.548 --> 00:23:22.189]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[00:23:23.092 --> 00:23:27.595]  So next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[00:23:27.595 --> 00:23:29.096]  Ask politely but firmly.
[00:23:29.096 --> 00:23:31.238]  Would you please take off your mask?
[00:23:31.238 --> 00:23:33.920]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.382]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:45.188]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble in an elevator.
[00:23:45.188 --> 00:23:46.208]  It's repulsive.
[00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:48.170]  Don't do it around other people.
[00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.831]  That's the message we should send because it's true.
[00:23:51.022 --> 00:23:54.543]  As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[00:23:54.543 --> 00:24:01.626]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart.
[00:24:01.626 --> 00:24:03.266]  Call the police immediately.
[00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:05.227]  Contact Child Protective Services.
[00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:07.408]  Keep calling until someone arrives.
[00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:09.149]  What you're looking at is abuse.
[00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:13.450]  It's child abuse, and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.211]  If it's your own children being abused, then act on it.
[00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:17.912]  Say no.
[00:24:17.912 --> 00:24:18.592]  Stop resisting.
[00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:20.961]  Your common sense.
[00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:23.162]  Resist the tyranny.
[00:24:23.162 --> 00:24:25.524]  Resist what you know is killing you.
[00:24:25.524 --> 00:24:27.825]  Resist the bullying.
[00:24:27.825 --> 00:24:32.086]  Stop resisting your instincts to say no to this.
[00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:33.327]  Start pushing back.
[00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:39.521]  And again, think about how they're saying, you can't get on a plane, you can't get on a train, you can't have a job, you can't work here if you don't have it.
[00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:45.222]  When it's experimental, it's dangerous, like the Tuskegee experiment, and they're just trying to shove it in our face.
[00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:56.385]  And then Joe Biden is our medical doctor, along with Bill Gates, and he's going to tell you, okay, it's okay to go outside now not wearing a mask, because most people aren't wearing masks outside now across the country.
[00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:59.806]  And so the peer pressure is now against them.
[00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:01.087]  So now he's going to lift it.
[00:25:01.087 --> 00:25:02.587]  So his cult of idiots,
[00:25:03.729 --> 00:25:05.931]  Won't feel like they lost their tug-of-war.
[00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:08.352]  Because all the left wants is to be in a religion.
[00:25:08.352 --> 00:25:09.833]  A religion of control of us.
[00:25:09.833 --> 00:25:13.856]  A religion of hen-pecking and controlling language and dominating others.
[00:25:13.856 --> 00:25:15.977]  Because they have nothing on the inside.
[00:25:15.977 --> 00:25:17.298]  No relationship with God.
[00:25:17.298 --> 00:25:18.059]  No real job.
[00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:19.359]  No real education.
[00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:21.000]  Just leftist brainwashing.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.102]  They're in a cult like Rose McGowan.
[00:25:23.342 --> 00:25:27.164]  Came out on Fox News and said yesterday, it is a damn cult.
[00:25:27.164 --> 00:25:28.344]  I'm part of the freedom cult.
[00:25:28.344 --> 00:25:29.625]  I'm part of the Jesus cult.
[00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:32.406]  I'm part of the 57 Chevy cult.
[00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:40.389]  I'm part of the give me more freedom, more self-defense, bigger, better, go to space, go to Mars, let's kick some ass cult.
[00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:44.371]  And you guys are part of the anti-human Harvey Weinstein pedophile cult.
[00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:48.674]  And it's starting to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:48.674 --> 00:25:57.781]  Miami School says they won't employ people who get COVID-19 vaccinations, citing vaccine misinformation, says CBS News.
[00:25:57.781 --> 00:25:58.802]  And the school goes on to say...
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.503]  It's an experimental COVID-19 injection.
[00:26:02.503 --> 00:26:06.987]  It's a gene therapy, and we're worried it can make other people sick through viral shedding.
[00:26:06.987 --> 00:26:10.571]  Hell, that's even in your precious Wall Street Journal and NPR!
[00:26:10.571 --> 00:26:12.473]  That's what the top scientists say!
[00:26:12.473 --> 00:26:14.655]  Because it's not a regular virus.
[00:26:14.655 --> 00:26:18.799]  It goes in and completely makes your cell start programming a protein.
[00:26:20.054 --> 00:26:29.461]  Which is associated with fertility, and associated with the brain, and that's why there's more studies about Alzheimer's and infertility, and lo and behold, women that are getting the vaccine are having miscarriages!
[00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:33.504]  And lo and behold, a lot of women that are getting the vaccine have all these tumors in their uteruses now!
[00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:35.045]  That's in mainstream news!
[00:26:35.045 --> 00:26:39.068]  You can even find CBS news that, well, don't worry about those tumors, those aren't bad!
[00:26:39.068 --> 00:26:44.212]  Yes, the vaccine gives you some tumors, yes, it makes your lymph nodes swell up, but everything's okay!
[00:26:44.212 --> 00:26:45.413]  Everything's fine!
[00:26:45.413 --> 00:26:45.793]  Yeah, right!
[00:26:46.853 --> 00:26:48.154]  Unbelievable.
[00:26:48.154 --> 00:26:51.375]  All right, we've got Nick Fuentes just put on a no-fly list.
[00:26:51.375 --> 00:26:56.318]  The article just exclusively went up on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:56.318 --> 00:27:03.642]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes InfoWars has had.
[00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:06.923]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[00:27:06.923 --> 00:27:16.068]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:19.273]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[00:27:19.273 --> 00:27:24.895]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[00:27:24.895 --> 00:27:28.056]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[00:27:28.056 --> 00:27:30.837]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[00:27:30.837 --> 00:27:35.219]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:39.820]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.541]  We have the power.
[00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:44.862]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:51.399]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come.
[00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:52.560]  So be the Paul Revere's you are.
[00:27:57.089 --> 00:28:05.215]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[00:28:05.215 --> 00:28:13.081]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:16.163]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[00:28:16.163 --> 00:28:24.269]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.789]  Thank you.
[00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:49.580]  So it's a win-win as we build a true, open, free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.581]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:28:52.581 --> 00:28:54.001]  The revolution starts there.

[00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:06.963]  They want to censor you.
[00:29:06.963 --> 00:29:07.803]  They want to dumb you down.
[00:29:07.803 --> 00:29:08.903]  They want to poison you.
[00:29:08.903 --> 00:29:12.064]  And they want to control your ability to take care of yourself.

[00:29:57.268 --> 00:30:06.235]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[00:30:06.235 --> 00:30:11.419]  That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler, and of course the rest is history.
[00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:16.123]  Our film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big
[00:30:16.243 --> 00:30:16.764]  We're good to go.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:37.962]  We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy, as low as $3.95 when you buy them in bulk to share with your friends and family.

[00:30:45.283 --> 00:30:46.403]  I'm begging you to.
[00:30:46.403 --> 00:30:51.765]  This film predicted the Great Reset, the New World Order takeover, the fake virus, and so much more.
[00:30:51.765 --> 00:30:54.525]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever.

[00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:10.429]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:16.354]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[00:31:26.272 --> 00:31:49.471]  Harpin' on the wars we fight Drivin' about the way things ought to be And I don't mind them switchin' sides And standin' up for things they believe in But when they're runnin' down our country They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
[00:31:51.932 --> 00:31:53.373]  Running down a way of life.
[00:31:53.373 --> 00:31:55.035]  You don't love it, leave it.
[00:31:55.035 --> 00:31:56.316]  Be a warning to you.
[00:32:06.954 --> 00:32:11.659]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Nick Cointaz is giving us the exclusive.
[00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:16.664]  He has been banned off of the internet as we know it, except for his own site, which is still very popular.
[00:32:16.664 --> 00:32:18.005]  It makes them mad.
[00:32:18.005 --> 00:32:28.135]  So it's important to get all of his material and share it via distribution, via proxy, that James O'Keefe was in studio with us last week, talking about AmericaFirst.live.
[00:32:30.126 --> 00:32:32.207]  Is his website, AmericaFirst.live.
[00:32:32.207 --> 00:32:53.171]  I'm Alex Jones with Band.Video and InfoWars.com, and we're on a couple hundred radio stations, a hundred or so cable and TV stations, but it's just absolutely important for all of us, ladies and gentlemen, to understand that the resistance only gets magnified and only gets expanded so the truth gets out when you speak out and you take action.
[00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.992]  Here's the article from InfoWars.com, breaking
[00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:03.956]  America's first founder, Nick Fuentes, put on no-fly list.
[00:33:03.956 --> 00:33:04.817]  And they told him why.
[00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:07.719]  He were at the Capitol, not even in the Capitol.
[00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:09.801]  See, now they've arrested 500 that went in.
[00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:13.364]  Now they want to attack those that are without.
[00:33:13.364 --> 00:33:14.485]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[00:33:14.485 --> 00:33:17.928]  But let's tie that together with just these stories breaking today.
[00:33:19.088 --> 00:33:23.790]  Facebook bans Australian Member of Parliament for anti-lockdown post.
[00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.470]  Only the UN has speech.
[00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:30.012]  You're not allowed to speak out, Member of Parliament.
[00:33:30.012 --> 00:33:32.873]  Greg Kelly.
[00:33:32.873 --> 00:33:33.733]  Wow!
[00:33:33.733 --> 00:33:36.994]  How a foreign entity can see Facebook as 3 billion members.
[00:33:36.994 --> 00:33:38.355]  It's the biggest country in the world.
[00:33:38.355 --> 00:33:40.495]  It decides, you see.
[00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:48.338]  Canadian government accused of assault on free speech of a proposed policy and law to police videos posted on social media.
[00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:50.954]  Here's another one today.
[00:33:50.954 --> 00:34:00.080]  German police ransacked the home of a doctor as he provides evidence in court that children are endangered in their mental and physical and spiritual well-being.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.303]  They're being obliged to wear the face mask, just what Tucker Carlson was talking about.
[00:34:04.303 --> 00:34:05.704]  Now we need to push back.
[00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:07.326]  So that's just today.
[00:34:07.326 --> 00:34:10.588]  I've got more of this where they're intimidating, going to
[00:34:11.545 --> 00:34:18.230]  Witnesses in the Chauvin trial and throwing pig blood on what they think is their house of pig heads and going to the jurors' houses, we now learned.
[00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:23.474]  Somebody had leaked it, that's why they voted and went along with the mob intimidating them.
[00:34:23.474 --> 00:34:25.736]  Whether you think Chauvin was guilty or not, he's got to go free.
[00:34:25.736 --> 00:34:27.997]  I don't care if he's black or white because of that.
[00:34:27.997 --> 00:34:39.426]  But anybody who's America First, anybody that stands for what our Republic stood for, ideas superior to any out there, mimicked across the world before the Chinese Communists became the model, is being shut down in silence.
[00:34:40.638 --> 00:34:40.758]  Yes.
[00:34:55.732 --> 00:34:59.954]  The hotel reservations, the Airbnb.
[00:34:59.954 --> 00:35:05.455]  This is the true de-platforming of humans themselves, the electronic gulag.
[00:35:05.455 --> 00:35:08.296]  Joining us with the exclusive is Nick Fuentes.
[00:35:08.296 --> 00:35:10.017]  Nick, great to have you on.
[00:35:10.017 --> 00:35:11.357]  We are all Nick Fuentes now.
[00:35:11.357 --> 00:35:12.698]  Tell us what the hell's going on here.
[00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:16.158]  Yeah, well, thank you so much for having me on.
[00:35:16.158 --> 00:35:21.560]  So, actually, my plans today were very different from what's transpired so far.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.122]  It was me, Michelle Malkin, Laura Loomer, Vince James, and Lauren Witzke.
[00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:30.064]  We were all planning on going down to Florida to hold a press conference about Ron DeSantis.
[00:35:30.876 --> 00:35:44.074]  Big Tech censorship legislation, which you may know that Ron DeSantis sponsored a bill in the Florida State House that would go after the big tech companies and try to prevent them from censoring candidates for office, statewide candidates.
[00:35:44.074 --> 00:35:46.577]  He's also saying no government vaccine passports.
[00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:47.138]  He's a great guy.
[00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.530]  That's right.
[00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.931]  Yeah.
[00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:50.592]  And we love Governor Ron DeSantis.
[00:35:50.592 --> 00:36:03.981]  And so I was planning on flying down to Florida, Palm Beach in particular, to do a small press conference and encourage the Florida State House to pass the bill, as well as to include some amendments that we had suggested, which include increasing the penalty.
[00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:17.791]  Or social media companies that censor as well as broadening the definition of who exactly the law would apply to not just candidates, but also we wanted to apply to current office holders as well as all the citizens of Florida.
[00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:23.755]  So my plan was to fly down and do a little press conference today, which is actually still going to go forward at 330.
[00:36:25.536 --> 00:36:26.477]  Eastern time.
[00:36:26.477 --> 00:36:41.426]  And so I showed up to the airport and I actually got there a couple of hours early because I was told by some friends of mine, Lauren Witski and Vince James in particular, that they had been subject to advanced screening at the airport because of their involvement on January 6th.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:46.369]  And I know that both of them were not inside the Capitol building, but they were in the district the day that that happened.
[00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:48.110]  And that's the same story with me.
[00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.511]  I was not inside the building.
[00:36:50.231 --> 00:36:55.294]  But I was outside and I was at the Trump rally on the Ellipse, which took place earlier.
[00:36:55.294 --> 00:36:57.636]  And I think I actually saw you there as well.
[00:36:57.636 --> 00:37:02.559]  And so I got to the airport a couple of hours early and I prepared for advanced screening.
[00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:06.321]  You know, I got there early enough that if they had to swab everything in my
[00:37:07.136 --> 00:37:07.536]  I think?
[00:37:07.536 --> 00:37:07.716]  I think?
[00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:30.090]  She says, I'm not getting clearance.
[00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.291]  I can't check you in.
[00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:35.534]  She calls the corporate security for American Airlines and they clear me.
[00:37:35.534 --> 00:37:42.940]  And then she goes through to TSA, to the airport security, and they relay to her and she relays to me that I'm unable to fly.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.382]  And she said they would say nothing other than that.
[00:37:45.382 --> 00:37:46.563]  And you know, it's interesting because the
[00:37:47.435 --> 00:37:48.556]  Lady at American.
[00:37:48.556 --> 00:37:50.478]  My first flight was American Airlines.
[00:37:50.478 --> 00:37:55.864]  She was actually somewhat sympathetic because she said, you know, is there anything that might be causing this?
[00:37:55.864 --> 00:37:57.005]  Is it a mask thing?
[00:37:57.005 --> 00:37:59.047]  Did you have an incident on American before?
[00:37:59.047 --> 00:38:00.969]  I said, no, nothing like that.
[00:38:00.969 --> 00:38:03.432]  Never any issues like that on American Airlines.
[00:38:03.432 --> 00:38:05.574]  And, you know, I've been flying pretty recently.
[00:38:06.397 --> 00:38:10.618]  She said, OK, well, I'll give them another call and they relay the same message.
[00:38:10.618 --> 00:38:11.838]  I'm not able to fly.
[00:38:11.838 --> 00:38:13.779]  And I said, well, you know, honestly, it's political.
[00:38:13.779 --> 00:38:15.239]  I said, I'm a political guy.
[00:38:15.239 --> 00:38:16.319]  I said, I think it's political.
[00:38:16.319 --> 00:38:22.261]  And she goes, she goes, I'm not supposed to say this, but I think this woke stuff is out of control and I could get fired.
[00:38:22.261 --> 00:38:24.681]  But they're pushing this on the corporations.
[00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:27.502]  So, you know, she was even sympathetic and she called a few times and.
[00:38:28.163 --> 00:38:32.304]  The message came down, all they could say was, I do not have clearance to fly.
[00:38:32.304 --> 00:38:39.386]  So I went over and I booked another flight immediately after at United, because I figured, you know, maybe it's an American Airlines thing, maybe that's their corporate policy.
[00:38:39.386 --> 00:38:50.429]  That's right, because in the days after the Capitol event, the woke airlines themselves would just look at who you were, and if you were wearing a Make America Great Again hat, they would ban you as well, but that was selective.
[00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:52.630]  You were checking another, hoping this was just selective.
[00:38:53.735 --> 00:38:54.576]  Exactly right.
[00:38:54.576 --> 00:38:58.960]  And there were some very activist corporations like Bank of America and the airlines.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.725]  They were willing and they were actively going in and doing what they thought was the government's job.
[00:39:03.725 --> 00:39:04.666]  So you're right.
[00:39:04.666 --> 00:39:06.007]  I thought it was American.
[00:39:06.007 --> 00:39:07.229]  So I went over to United.
[00:39:07.229 --> 00:39:08.910]  I went all the way over to the other terminal.
[00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.272]  I booked the same flight, 10.40am.
[00:39:11.813 --> 00:39:12.614]  We're good to go!
[00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:34.355]  Nobody could talk to, that's it.
[00:39:34.355 --> 00:39:39.341]  So, I'm on the no-fly list, and it has to do with the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:43.687]  And, you know, like you, I was not inside the building, and therefore I didn't commit a crime.
[00:39:43.687 --> 00:39:48.132]  They're charging all these people, 500 plus people, and they want to throw the book at them.
[00:39:48.132 --> 00:39:49.154]  What are they charging them for?
[00:39:49.904 --> 00:39:55.327]  Trespassing, disorderly conduct, these are misdemeanor charges, and I didn't even do that!
[00:39:55.327 --> 00:40:07.132]  I went to the Trump rally on the Ellipse, which is a totally legal, permissible, political rally from the sitting President of the United States, and then I, like thousands of other people, went down to the Capitol grounds,
[00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:11.215]  And was out there protesting outside the Capitol, which is our right to do so.
[00:40:37.492 --> 00:40:39.152]  The equation is very simple.
[00:40:39.152 --> 00:40:40.453]  The bank of banks control the media.
[00:40:40.453 --> 00:40:41.653]  They control big pharma.
[00:40:41.653 --> 00:40:42.653]  They control academia.
[00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:19.277]  They control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:27.742]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[00:41:27.742 --> 00:41:34.486]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.308]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:11.667]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:16.812]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[00:42:16.812 --> 00:42:18.614]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[00:42:20.598 --> 00:42:22.579]  We're not worthy!
[00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:26.560]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.541]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:29.941]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[00:42:29.941 --> 00:42:31.982]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.643]  The globalists love lying to you.
[00:42:33.643 --> 00:42:34.983]  They love manipulating you.
[00:42:34.983 --> 00:42:37.624]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[00:42:37.624 --> 00:42:42.306]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[00:42:42.306 --> 00:42:44.647]  That for me is really sick, Jack.
[00:42:44.647 --> 00:42:45.127]  And disgusting.
[00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:48.028]  So you've got to plead for myself and the whole InfoWars crew.
[00:42:49.648 --> 00:42:51.549]  We will never join the Globals.
[00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:53.610]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.212]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[00:42:57.212 --> 00:43:01.174]  Last week, I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission.
[00:43:01.174 --> 00:43:08.978]  And he said to me, he said, Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people dying from it and people getting sick.
[00:43:08.978 --> 00:43:14.340]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about the danger?
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.002]  And I said to him something very profound, because it's so true.
[00:43:18.002 --> 00:43:19.223]  Trust your gut, trust your spirit.
[00:43:19.921 --> 00:43:21.223]  The Bible tells us.
[00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:24.488]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors.
[00:43:24.488 --> 00:43:27.353]  Do you feel good about this vaccine?
[00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:29.436]  And his answer was, no, they don't feel good about it.
[00:43:29.436 --> 00:43:31.319]  So, go with your gut.
[00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:33.002]  Well, let me ask you again.
[00:43:33.002 --> 00:43:35.005]  How does your gut feel about getting storable food?
[00:43:35.845 --> 00:43:38.007]  How does your gut feel about getting out in the countryside?
[00:43:38.007 --> 00:43:41.289]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:42.950]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.
[00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.374]  We have the best durable food, the highest quality, at the lowest prices you're going to find.

[00:43:57.641 --> 00:44:03.426]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[00:44:04.216 --> 00:44:06.539]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S.
[00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:16.512]  injected healthy men, women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[00:44:17.578 --> 00:44:21.640]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, is one of the most important films ever made.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:28.664]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[00:44:28.664 --> 00:44:30.345]  The film now is more important than ever.
[00:44:30.345 --> 00:44:33.107]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[00:44:33.107 --> 00:44:43.393]  We have it back in print, available now at Infowarstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet, you can make copies.
[00:44:43.573 --> 00:44:45.074]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[00:44:45.074 --> 00:44:46.115]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:44:46.115 --> 00:44:46.955]  1776 Worldwide.
[00:44:46.955 --> 00:44:47.696]  1776 Worldwide.
[00:44:47.696 --> 00:44:48.556]  In game.
[00:44:48.556 --> 00:44:51.618]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:44:51.618 --> 00:45:00.083]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:45:00.083 --> 00:45:02.725]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:33.408 --> 00:45:36.110]  It's time to stop being domesticated.
[00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.272]  It's time to stop submitting.
[00:45:38.272 --> 00:45:41.794]  It's time to say no to the anti-human globalist system.
[00:45:41.794 --> 00:45:42.495]  And it's time
[00:45:43.544 --> 00:45:44.705]  To awaken others.
[00:45:44.705 --> 00:45:48.368]  The Pushback starts now.
[00:45:48.368 --> 00:45:49.509]  Nick Fuentes is our guest.
[00:45:49.509 --> 00:45:54.412]  Please remember that there is an iron curtain of oppression, intimidation happening.
[00:45:54.412 --> 00:45:56.974]  And the more people submit, the worse it gets.
[00:45:56.974 --> 00:45:58.635]  Pushback.
[00:45:58.635 --> 00:46:00.597]  We're selling in-game blueprints for global enslavement.
[00:46:00.597 --> 00:46:05.000]  My seminal film predicts the whole great reset, the takeover, and how bad it gets the more you submit.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.363]  That is so evergreen, it's been banned off Amazon.
[00:46:08.363 --> 00:46:09.143]  One copy, $14.95, you get
[00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:12.107]  A whole bunch of copies.
[00:46:12.107 --> 00:46:13.128]  They're $3.95 a piece.
[00:46:13.128 --> 00:46:15.029]  That way we get a few bucks each DVD.
[00:46:15.029 --> 00:46:16.389]  Help fund our operation.
[00:46:16.389 --> 00:46:17.690]  I want you to make copies of it.
[00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:19.110]  It has no copy guard on it.
[00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:22.152]  It plays anywhere in the world.
[00:46:22.152 --> 00:46:22.492]  Endgame.
[00:46:22.492 --> 00:46:23.772]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:46:23.772 --> 00:46:25.113]  And that's how we fund our operation.
[00:46:25.113 --> 00:46:27.334]  Also, good news.
[00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:30.355]  Our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula sold out for almost six months.
[00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:34.964]  Because we couldn't get it back in stock because of all the lockdowns and the supply chain breakdowns.
[00:46:34.964 --> 00:46:38.086]  95% Cuminoid, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:40.087]  Also, Vazobeats for your heart and your liver.
[00:46:40.087 --> 00:46:42.809]  Concentrated compounds that create nitrous oxide in the blood.
[00:46:42.809 --> 00:46:44.070]  It's an amazing product.
[00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:44.931]  50% off.
[00:46:44.931 --> 00:46:46.832]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:46.832 --> 00:46:48.113]  All of it boosts your immune system.
[00:46:48.113 --> 00:46:49.354]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:46:49.354 --> 00:46:49.974]  Winter Sun.
[00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:51.215]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:51.215 --> 00:46:53.857]  And then that funds BandDot Video.
[00:46:53.857 --> 00:46:56.919]  That is routinely getting millions of views for video.
[00:46:56.919 --> 00:46:59.401]  The average videos, we upload hundreds a day, gets about 20,000 views.
[00:47:01.002 --> 00:47:02.603]  Ladies and gentlemen, you built it.
[00:47:02.603 --> 00:47:05.545]  You fund the bandwidth.
[00:47:05.545 --> 00:47:08.547]  It's my invitation, because provocateurs will get on there and set us up.
[00:47:08.547 --> 00:47:10.488]  But I just offered Nick Fuentes a channel.
[00:47:10.488 --> 00:47:11.349]  He's been sensitive.
[00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:12.950]  He goes, of course, I want a channel on Band.Video.
[00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:16.653]  So we'll make sure he gets a channel there, and he brings all his great patriots there.
[00:47:16.653 --> 00:47:18.034]  We bring our patriots to him.
[00:47:18.034 --> 00:47:19.515]  We've got to get organized.
[00:47:19.515 --> 00:47:20.815]  We've got to get together.
[00:47:20.815 --> 00:47:22.256]  And so I want to get it done today.
[00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:25.278]  I want to get Nick Fuentes a page to upload everything he does.
[00:47:25.278 --> 00:47:26.719]  We're going to have live streaming soon.
[00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:29.521]  We're working on that for Band.Video as well.
[00:47:30.742 --> 00:47:36.345]  And Nick, give people the website where they can find you despite all the censorship.
[00:47:36.345 --> 00:47:41.507]  It is AmericaFirst.live and Monday through Friday at 8 o'clock Central Time.
[00:47:41.507 --> 00:47:42.887]  AmericaFirst.live.
[00:47:42.887 --> 00:47:45.309]  And maybe we'll simulcast with you some tomorrow night.
[00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:50.151]  I'm going to cover the so-called State of the Union with the puppet in chief.
[00:47:50.151 --> 00:47:52.072]  So maybe we can do some simulcasting tomorrow night.
[00:47:52.072 --> 00:47:54.193]  We'll be going live, I think, at 6 p.m.
[00:47:54.193 --> 00:47:54.893]  tomorrow evening.
[00:47:54.893 --> 00:47:55.093]  All right.
[00:47:56.061 --> 00:48:00.806]  In the eight minutes we have left, finishing up Bitcoin Testers here on the Alex Jones Show, recap.
[00:48:00.806 --> 00:48:02.307]  You've been put on a no-fly list.
[00:48:02.307 --> 00:48:05.930]  They admitted it's because you were simply covering the capital.
[00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:07.252]  What does that signify?
[00:48:07.252 --> 00:48:10.775]  Does that mean they're getting ready to try to arrest you for a conspiracy?
[00:48:10.775 --> 00:48:14.699]  Even though you never called for any violence, that's preposterous.
[00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:16.300]  Or is it something else?
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:21.165]  Because I think it's all just part of this persecution of patriots in general.
[00:48:22.529 --> 00:48:23.830]  Well, you're exactly right.
[00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:38.686]  It's a part of a very coordinated and systematic effort to intimidate and persecute people that are against the Biden administration, people that are against the American regime, specifically Trump supporters and the leaders of Trump supporters, such as yourself and me and everybody that we know.
[00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:44.492]  And so it represents a major escalation because, of course, you know better than anybody almost that
[00:48:45.268 --> 00:48:47.611]  Censorship has been here for five years.
[00:48:47.611 --> 00:49:02.311]  We've been banned from social media, we've been banned from YouTube, banned from... You've been banned from Twitter, I'm still on there, but we've been banned from everything else, even back-end services, things like PayPal, Stripe, Email Octopus, MailChimp, you know, things that a lot of people don't even know that much about, and so...
[00:49:03.092 --> 00:49:06.815]  For a long time, it was really a variety of corporate tyranny.
[00:49:06.815 --> 00:49:13.721]  And the argument would be something like this from the left, which is, well, you have freedom of speech, but you don't have freedom from consequences.
[00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:21.227]  You have your right to exercise your First Amendment, and only insofar as the government is not oppressing you for that, well, then that's just par for the course.
[00:49:21.227 --> 00:49:25.390]  And so Twitter is a private company, and they can ban who they like for whatever they like.
[00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:30.855]  But now they've passed that Rubicon in a big way, and we know Europe and other areas of the model, they're coming with police now.
[00:49:31.992 --> 00:49:33.172]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:49:33.172 --> 00:49:34.913]  And they are the canary in the coal mine.
[00:49:34.913 --> 00:49:38.254]  It's been like that with hate speech legislation in Europe for a long time.
[00:49:38.254 --> 00:49:48.037]  And now with the Biden administration and Democrats with unified control of government, now you're seeing, just like you did under Barack Obama, the full weaponization of the federal government.
[00:49:48.037 --> 00:49:50.758]  And I used to tell this to people, because there were a lot of people who would say to me,
[00:49:51.485 --> 00:49:54.208]  You know, I don't really feel like voting in 2020.
[00:49:54.208 --> 00:49:54.729]  I don't know.
[00:49:54.729 --> 00:49:56.471]  The wars aren't over, whatever.
[00:49:56.471 --> 00:50:02.257]  And I said, you watch and you see if Biden gets in office, it's going to be like Barack Obama on steroids.
[00:50:02.257 --> 00:50:11.929]  Remember when he was targeting the conservative nonprofits with the IRS and the backdoor gun control through the EPA and all kinds of other regulatory mechanisms to go after conservatives?
[00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:14.051]  It's going to be like that on steroids.
[00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:16.695]  Did you see that statement by that one Democrat Senator?
[00:50:16.695 --> 00:50:20.260]  He goes, we need to test the full power of the IRS.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.365]  And the FBI said, we're going to break up these Patriot groups.
[00:50:23.365 --> 00:50:27.050]  I mean, this is just KGB, GRU corruption.
[00:50:28.112 --> 00:50:45.903]  That's right, and they've taken the War on Terror, which has been waged over the past 20 years, and they've built up all this legal infrastructure and bureaucratic infrastructure from the Patriot Act to the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA and the FBI, and all of this which has been built up ostensibly to go after
[00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:53.684]  Islamic terrorism in the Middle East to go after foreign adversaries, since the capital is now being directed inwardly.
[00:50:53.684 --> 00:51:06.609]  And so now this panopticon surveillance state, and the DHS, and the Patriot Act, and this abridgment of civil liberties, whereas once it applied to people that were foreigners, once it applied to people that were enemy combatants, I mean actual Muslim terrorists,
[00:51:06.989 --> 00:51:10.031]  And let's be clear, real Muslim terrorists are coming across.
[00:51:10.031 --> 00:51:11.711]  The border wall's been cancelled.
[00:51:11.711 --> 00:51:12.932]  They're even taking part of it down.
[00:51:12.932 --> 00:51:14.933]  They're throwing babies over the fence.
[00:51:14.933 --> 00:51:21.516]  There's no infrastructure for the actual border, but now they're using illegal internal checkpoints on us and not letting patriots fly.
[00:51:21.516 --> 00:51:23.077]  I mean, this is pure intimidation.
[00:51:23.077 --> 00:51:24.697]  Like, oh, we demonetized you.
[00:51:24.697 --> 00:51:25.678]  Well, we banned you.
[00:51:25.678 --> 00:51:27.058]  Well, now you can't fly.
[00:51:27.058 --> 00:51:29.640]  Well, now you can't lease or rent.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.980]  Now you can't have a bank account.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.581]  They took the President's bank accounts!
[00:51:33.869 --> 00:51:35.951]  Exactly, and it's meant to disrupt.
[00:51:35.951 --> 00:51:37.612]  They want to achieve this effect.
[00:51:37.612 --> 00:51:38.933]  That is their intention.
[00:51:38.933 --> 00:51:42.035]  They disrupt our media landscape by banning us from social media.
[00:51:42.774 --> 00:51:46.535]  They disrupt us financially by freezing our bank accounts, which actually happened to me.
[00:51:46.535 --> 00:51:48.296]  They froze one of my bank accounts.
[00:51:48.296 --> 00:51:51.997]  And then now they're going to go and they're trying to stop people from flying.
[00:51:51.997 --> 00:51:54.558]  And, you know, Michael Sherwin said this on 60 Minutes.
[00:51:54.558 --> 00:51:56.218]  This is not some conspiracy theory.
[00:51:56.218 --> 00:51:57.498]  This is not made up.
[00:51:57.498 --> 00:52:04.120]  Michael Sherwin, who is directing the capital investigation in D.C., he said on 60 Minutes, and he actually got in trouble for it.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.821]  He said the reason they went after the
[00:52:06.616 --> 00:52:16.687]  Internet celebrities and the people on social media first, when they were investigating the Capitol, was to create a shock and awe effect and prevent people from protesting the inauguration.
[00:52:16.687 --> 00:52:24.576]  Because he said that if people saw the mainstream people, the celebrities, getting hauled away by the FBI, then they would be intimidated into silence.
[00:52:24.576 --> 00:52:26.759]  And so this is part of a very coordinated campaign
[00:52:27.179 --> 00:52:33.726]  They know that if they strike at people like yourself and people like me, if they strike at Donald Trump, take his bank accounts, take the social media.
[00:52:33.726 --> 00:52:38.572]  And let's be clear, the Republicans have signaled surrender, even though the public's awake.
[00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:39.853]  People totally like Trump.
[00:52:39.853 --> 00:52:40.554]  They love us.
[00:52:41.405 --> 00:52:43.866]  They've announced Liz Cheney is now the leader of the party.
[00:52:43.866 --> 00:52:45.968]  Trump is not allowed at the strategy meetings.
[00:52:45.968 --> 00:52:47.288]  And she's going to run for president.
[00:52:47.288 --> 00:52:48.569]  CNN's worshipping her.
[00:52:48.569 --> 00:52:50.931]  They're saying she'll be the president.
[00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:52.551]  85% negative in her home state.
[00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:54.052]  Hated across the nation.
[00:52:54.052 --> 00:53:01.517]  And now they're preparing to force-feed us Liz Cheney, just like they've done Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with half a percentage point approval rating with her.
[00:53:01.517 --> 00:53:03.057]  I mean, so this is unbelievable.
[00:53:03.057 --> 00:53:09.081]  That really, to me, is a nightmarish signification that the Republicans are about to totally capitulate to the neocons that really run the Democrats.
[00:53:10.074 --> 00:53:19.382]  Yes, well, the Republicans, I mean, you know that they're salivating and they have been salivating to totally restore the Republican Party back to the status quo.
[00:53:19.382 --> 00:53:21.364]  They didn't like Trump in 2015.
[00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.105]  They didn't like him in 2016.
[00:53:22.105 --> 00:53:26.629]  And they had to put up with him for the past four years because he was the nucleus.
[00:53:26.629 --> 00:53:27.410]  He was the center.
[00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:41.696]  Of gravity in DC and the Republican Party, but you know that Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and Mitt Romney's niece, Ronna McDaniel, they have been chomping at the bit for Donald Trump to leave office so that they could snap right back to the old GOP.
[00:53:41.696 --> 00:53:42.937]  And that's why they're boosting.
[00:53:42.937 --> 00:53:47.199]  That's why Tim Scott is going to do the response to the joint session of Congress tomorrow.
[00:53:47.859 --> 00:53:51.400]  That's why Nikki Haley is the one that they're grooming to be the president.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.901]  And you're right, that's why Liz Cheney is running the party.
[00:53:53.901 --> 00:54:00.323]  And that's why they're trying to go after Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz in the America First Caucus.
[00:54:00.323 --> 00:54:06.625]  It's because the Republican Party, George W. Bush the other day working with the Koch Network to pass amnesty with Joe Biden.
[00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:08.486]  The entire Republican infrastructure
[00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:14.748]  Is coagulating now with the Democratic Party, in the open, to put down this populist revolt.
[00:54:14.748 --> 00:54:19.349]  To put down the, you know, insurrection in a political sense, not in a literal sense.
[00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:21.269]  The point is, how do we counter this?
[00:54:21.269 --> 00:54:23.830]  Governors, legislators, leaders like DeSantis.
[00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:25.690]  I mean, we've got to go on the offense politically.
[00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:29.131]  This is, if this was a liquor, it's 200 proof tyranny.
[00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:33.132]  I mean, this is 100% admitted evil cancer.
[00:54:33.132 --> 00:54:34.072]  This is unbelievable.
[00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:38.252]  Well, the way to go on the offensive is in the state governments.
[00:54:38.252 --> 00:54:41.955]  Republicans control more than half of the state governments in the country.
[00:54:41.955 --> 00:54:48.639]  Ron DeSantis seems to be the only one that's cognizant of that fact, because he seems to be the only one that's fighting against the left-wing agenda.
[00:54:48.639 --> 00:54:53.463]  Christine Noem in South Dakota bolts to the NCAA on trans, so does the Arkansas governor.
[00:54:53.983 --> 00:54:59.509]  We have got to take these Republican state governments if we don't have a shot right now in Congress and in the White House.
[00:54:59.509 --> 00:55:00.770]  We need people that aren't wimps.
[00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:04.374]  I mean, Arkansas, 90% of people don't want men and women sports.
[00:55:04.374 --> 00:55:06.316]  In the Dakotas, 90% don't want it.
[00:55:06.316 --> 00:55:07.017]  It's popular.
[00:55:07.017 --> 00:55:09.199]  Feminists hate it.
[00:55:09.199 --> 00:55:10.941]  Oh, everyone, oh no, I'll let men compete.
[00:55:10.941 --> 00:55:12.903]  Do five more minutes with us on more solutions.
[00:55:12.903 --> 00:55:13.784]  I totally concur.
[00:55:14.324 --> 00:55:19.646]  Plus, as Julius Caesar said, there is a tide in the affairs of men taken from the flood leads to fortune.
[00:55:19.646 --> 00:55:21.347]  Our fortune is just living free.
[00:55:21.347 --> 00:55:22.987]  People like DeSantis get it.
[00:55:22.987 --> 00:55:27.649]  How do we draft some people that aren't total coward idiots to take this thing head on?
[00:55:27.649 --> 00:55:29.029]  My God!
[00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:30.330]  Our children are worth it.
[00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.230]  Not a bunch of communists gut the country.
[00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.091]  Nick Fuentes is our guest.
[00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:36.492]  Soon he will have a Band.Video account.
[00:55:37.232 --> 00:55:48.658]  Oh, and if you're another patriot out there that's been banned out there, email robd, just the letter D, at infowars.com, and the intrepid Rob Dew will get you signed up on Banned.tv!

[00:56:47.424 --> 00:56:48.985]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[00:56:48.985 --> 00:56:49.745]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:56:49.745 --> 00:56:50.486]  Trying to move quicker.
[00:56:50.486 --> 00:56:51.326]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:51.326 --> 00:56:51.766]  Welcome.
[00:56:51.766 --> 00:56:56.909]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[00:56:56.909 --> 00:57:00.151]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[00:57:00.151 --> 00:57:06.754]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[00:57:06.754 --> 00:57:08.415]  Living Defense saved my life.
[00:57:08.415 --> 00:57:12.577]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[00:57:12.577 --> 00:57:14.018]  Living Defense brought me back.
[00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:19.822]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[00:57:19.822 --> 00:57:22.224]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[00:57:22.224 --> 00:57:31.530]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:37.014]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[00:57:37.014 --> 00:57:38.495]  That's right where we're at brother.
[00:57:38.695 --> 00:57:50.263]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[00:57:50.263 --> 00:58:06.173]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:06.173 --> 00:58:07.914]  If you think we're joking around about the tyranny,
[00:58:09.125 --> 00:58:22.641]  I see dozens of articles a day, and it's all standardized around the world, where the police come and arrest preachers for having events, but a topless bar is open down the street, where they're arresting reporters, arresting medical doctors that criticize the lockdowns.
[00:58:22.641 --> 00:58:24.203]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[00:58:24.853 --> 00:58:28.736]  Nick Fuentes, I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:58:28.736 --> 00:58:34.520]  Again, you're just an America First activist, you're well-spoken, so you've been censored and now you're on a no-fly list.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:40.565]  I bet money, actually, if I try to go fly, I'm going to be blocked as well, even though I was there trying to stop people going in.
[00:58:40.565 --> 00:58:45.409]  And then there's no judge or jury, no court, you just, it's a magic, you know, thing, the godlike FBI.
[00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:53.441]  Uh, that they waved a wand and said no longer is there background checks needed for who children are given to, including convicted pedophiles.
[00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:54.643]  So, they are God.
[00:58:54.643 --> 00:58:56.947]  I guess I should pray to the FBI, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:58:56.947 --> 00:58:58.570]  I know that's blasphemy.
[00:58:58.570 --> 00:58:59.772]  So how do we counter this, Nick?
[00:59:01.252 --> 00:59:07.699]  So I think the easiest way for Republicans to do this is to take advantage of the control that they have in the state legislatures.
[00:59:07.699 --> 00:59:09.201]  And, you know, it's pretty bewildering.
[00:59:09.201 --> 00:59:13.005]  We have control over more than half of the state legislatures in the country.
[00:59:13.005 --> 00:59:15.128]  And we witnessed this in the 2020 election.
[00:59:15.128 --> 00:59:19.512]  I know you and I were on the front lines for Stop the Steal in Atlanta and across the country.
[00:59:19.512 --> 00:59:22.356]  We realized that these Republican state legislatures and governors
[00:59:22.976 --> 00:59:27.279]  Are just totally incompetent, totally ineffective, and unwilling to do what's right.
[00:59:27.279 --> 00:59:32.703]  In Phoenix, in Atlanta, in Harrisburg, in Madison, in all these different state capitals.
[00:59:32.703 --> 00:59:36.786]  In Lansing, they refused to adjudicate the 2020 election.
[00:59:36.786 --> 00:59:44.031]  And now we see that they're folding, like you said before the break, folding on trans, folding on big tech, folding on all the issues that matter.
[00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:50.496]  So I propose that, look, you take a look at South Dakota or Arkansas, where their two governors just totally folded on trans.
[00:59:50.956 --> 00:59:52.997]  Those are hardcore conservative states.
[00:59:52.997 --> 01:00:01.062]  Like you said, 90% of the people in those places were against transgender athletes in the women's sports, but the governors vetoed it.
[01:00:01.062 --> 01:00:07.086]  Why don't we just take states like that, where we can win, and fill them up in the state legislature with people that are America first?
[01:00:07.086 --> 01:00:16.692]  Because, you know, we have a thing in the country called federalism, where there's not only a separation of powers between the branches of federal government, but between the federal government and the state government.
[01:00:16.692 --> 01:00:18.833]  And actually, the state governments have far more
[01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:28.336]  Constitutional jurisdiction than the federal government because the federal government's powers are enumerated and the state government's powers and the Tenth Amendment get everything else.
[01:00:28.336 --> 01:00:38.329]  So I look at somebody like Ron DeSantis as the model for what we have to pursue in the future, which is America first governors, America first state legislators, because
[01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:40.571]  That is a power source.
[01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:52.623]  That's a locus of power that Republicans can wield in these conservative areas and begin to fight back against the tech censorship, begin to fight back against the tide of this social revolution that's transforming the country.
[01:00:52.623 --> 01:00:54.164]  We can do it using state government.
[01:00:54.164 --> 01:00:57.648]  The problem is that people have been unwilling to do that, and we all know that.
[01:00:57.648 --> 01:00:58.289]  Everybody's got
[01:00:58.985 --> 01:01:00.186]  An unpopular governor.
[01:01:00.186 --> 01:01:01.427]  I live in Illinois.
[01:01:01.427 --> 01:01:01.987]  We have J.B.
[01:01:01.987 --> 01:01:02.628]  Pritzker.
[01:01:02.628 --> 01:01:06.471]  But honestly, it's not much better in Georgia with Brian Kemp, who's a Republican.
[01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:07.772]  Not much better in Arizona.
[01:01:07.772 --> 01:01:09.593]  And look, the globalists want to conquer us, Nick.
[01:01:09.593 --> 01:01:11.135]  It's only going to get worse until we push back.
[01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:12.316]  Take California.
[01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:14.597]  I've known for a long time that it's never really went blue.
[01:01:14.597 --> 01:01:16.139]  It's been election fraud.
[01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.740]  That's what Democrats do.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.281]  People are voting with their feet.
[01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:23.024]  Now they've gotten all these signatures to recall their fake governor.
[01:01:23.024 --> 01:01:25.426]  So we can also push back within states they control.
[01:01:25.426 --> 01:01:26.547]  I think that's a great point you're making.
[01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:30.512]  Absolutely, and you're exactly right about California.
[01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:34.414]  You know, the thing about Republicans is they're very much on the defensive.
[01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:35.834]  The Democrats are on the offensive.
[01:01:35.834 --> 01:01:39.756]  They're filling up all the Republican states with immigrants, and they're pursuing voter fraud.
[01:01:39.756 --> 01:01:42.677]  I mean, they set out to flip Georgia, and they got it.
[01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:46.498]  A lot of people said that's impossible, but they played it very aggressively, and they got it.
[01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:49.400]  And I don't think we should limit ourselves even to these kinds of places.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.300]  We should be looking at
[01:01:51.064 --> 01:01:55.407]  California, we should be looking at other states, even states like Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado.
[01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:58.469]  I think it's still possible to make a difference there, too.
[01:01:58.469 --> 01:02:00.530]  But in these Republican strongholds, there's no excuse.
[01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.011]  There's no excuse in Texas.
[01:02:02.011 --> 01:02:07.414]  There's no excuse in Arkansas or South Dakota to not have a totally America-first conservative government.
[01:02:07.414 --> 01:02:11.577]  We've got to have it there, and we as people living in these states have to demand it.
[01:02:11.577 --> 01:02:13.058]  We don't have to win the presidency.
[01:02:13.058 --> 01:02:14.199]  We don't have to win these things.
[01:02:14.199 --> 01:02:17.741]  That would be nice, and you know, ultimately we'd like to do those things, but
[01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:19.806]  We don't have to do that.
[01:02:19.806 --> 01:02:24.068]  We can still do something in the meantime before the midterms and before the next presidential election.
[01:02:24.068 --> 01:02:26.249]  So I say take a look at Ron DeSantis.
[01:02:26.249 --> 01:02:28.890]  That's got to be the model for every Republican governor in the country.
[01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:29.630]  Beautifully said.
[01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:31.111]  You're a voice that needs to be said.
[01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:33.312]  You're the model for people as well.
[01:02:33.312 --> 01:02:34.593]  We need to get your voice out there.
[01:02:34.593 --> 01:02:36.594]  I can't wait for you to be uploading to Band.Video.
[01:02:36.594 --> 01:02:37.554]  Let's make sure that happens.
[01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.335]  Nick, you've got my number written down in a day or so.
[01:02:39.335 --> 01:02:39.595]  Call me.
[01:02:39.595 --> 01:02:41.136]  I want to make sure that happens.
[01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.497]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:45.398]  How do people find your weeknight show that's so censored and so banned?
[01:02:46.292 --> 01:02:49.615]  It's at AmericaFirst.live, 8 o'clock central, Monday through Friday.
[01:02:49.615 --> 01:02:51.397]  And thank you so much for having me on.
[01:02:51.397 --> 01:02:52.218]  Love what you do.
[01:02:52.218 --> 01:02:52.939]  You're a legend.
[01:02:52.939 --> 01:02:53.639]  We love you, brother.
[01:02:53.639 --> 01:02:56.002]  I'll be right back.
[01:02:56.002 --> 01:02:59.065]  I one trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[01:02:59.065 --> 01:03:00.506]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[01:03:00.506 --> 01:03:02.028]  I'll just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:04.430]  People say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.471]  That's embarrassing.
[01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:07.974]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:10.412]  But I'll tell you this right now.
[01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:12.894]  You're nuts if you don't get storable food.
[01:03:12.894 --> 01:03:17.897]  And I've got the biggest, best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:03:17.897 --> 01:03:22.440]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes even better?
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.340]  Yeah.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.781]  Most of this stuff tastes amazing.
[01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:25.762]  Some of it tastes okay.
[01:03:25.762 --> 01:03:29.464]  The point is it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[01:03:29.464 --> 01:03:31.986]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:43.300]  We've got three-month, six-month gear supplies right now, and I twisted their arm so hard to give you 10% off again, because you're so conditionally buying our Super Sale.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.201]  We're doing it one more time.
[01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:47.421]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:50.022]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:03:50.022 --> 01:03:52.944]  10% off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[01:03:52.944 --> 01:03:53.984]  Get ready while you still can.
[01:04:01.434 --> 01:04:16.581]  Well, a lot of people throw around the word hero, and I think it gets overused, but our guest, Artur Palowski, is a hero.
[01:04:16.581 --> 01:04:17.062]  He has a
[01:04:18.377 --> 01:04:22.202]  Street ministry that feeds over a thousand homeless people a week in his city.
[01:04:22.202 --> 01:04:28.870]  And he has a church, a small church, that also serves hundreds of people a week.
[01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:35.998]  And you've seen the footage from Easter Sunday, them coming without a warrant, without anything, and saying we're going to enforce social distancing.
[01:04:40.258 --> 01:04:45.303]  Well, they came back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:45.303 --> 01:04:47.104]  The story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:04:47.104 --> 01:04:48.305]  This happened just a few days ago.
[01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:54.230]  Canadian police returned with SWAT team to a local church run by Artur Polowski.
[01:04:54.230 --> 01:05:02.698]  Now, I got a chance to hear him last week, or a couple weeks ago, actually, on The War Room and also on American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:03.779]  Very impressed with him.
[01:05:04.952 --> 01:05:06.273]  But he went through communism.
[01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:11.014]  He went through this exact type of crap and helped get his parents out of Poland.
[01:05:11.014 --> 01:05:19.078]  And that's why you don't see Joe Biden wanting a bunch of Poles to move over here, because they tend to vote more conservative because they've been through it, just like Cubans do.
[01:05:19.078 --> 01:05:23.179]  So, Artur, Pastor, Pulaski, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:05:23.179 --> 01:05:30.302]  We're going to go to you in just a moment, but I want to roll here some of what happened on Easter and then some of what happened this last Sunday.
[01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:31.863]  So we'll play these back to back.
[01:05:31.863 --> 01:05:32.163]  Here it is.
[01:05:33.539 --> 01:05:34.779]  Please get out.
[01:05:34.779 --> 01:05:35.940]  Get out of this property.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.220]  Immediately get out.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.441]  Get out of this property.
[01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:41.501]  Immediately.
[01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:41.841]  Out.
[01:05:41.841 --> 01:05:43.221]  I don't want to hear anything.
[01:05:43.221 --> 01:05:44.442]  Out of this property.
[01:05:44.442 --> 01:05:44.962]  Immediately.
[01:05:44.962 --> 01:05:46.702]  I don't want to hear a word.
[01:05:46.702 --> 01:05:48.043]  Out!
[01:05:48.043 --> 01:05:49.243]  Out!
[01:05:49.243 --> 01:05:51.323]  Out of this property.
[01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:54.224]  Immediately until you come back with a warrant.
[01:05:54.224 --> 01:05:55.805]  Out!
[01:05:55.805 --> 01:05:57.145]  Out!
[01:05:57.145 --> 01:05:57.305]  Out!
[01:05:58.257 --> 01:06:01.498]  This goes on for 10 minutes all the way out into the street off the property.
[01:06:01.498 --> 01:06:03.919]  Now, this is what happened again just a few days ago.
[01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:05.520]  They've been back several times.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:13.023]  There's other churches where you've seen hundreds of police, drones, fences around the churches, while Walmarts a mile and a half away are just jam-packed with people.
[01:06:13.023 --> 01:06:14.283]  Total evil.
[01:06:14.283 --> 01:06:21.146]  Testing to see if they can go after churches with the leader of Canada saying, I want a dictatorship like communist China.
[01:06:21.146 --> 01:06:21.946]  That's a quote.
[01:06:21.946 --> 01:06:23.567]  We'll play that clip coming up with our guest.
[01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:25.707]  Here's a little piece of what happened this Sunday.
[01:06:25.707 --> 01:06:27.288]  Well, friends, we have a SWAT team.
[01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:32.985]  In our church again, coming authorities.
[01:06:32.985 --> 01:06:41.567]  So I'm going to go out and see what they want.
[01:06:41.567 --> 01:06:42.027]  Yes?
[01:06:42.027 --> 01:06:42.427]  Hello, Walter.
[01:06:42.427 --> 01:06:43.807]  Hi, Hunter.
[01:06:43.807 --> 01:06:46.828]  I wonder if I could just give you a copy of the court order.
[01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:47.928]  This is for you.
[01:06:47.928 --> 01:06:54.270]  It basically outlines the fact that we have the right choice for today.
[01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:55.190]  What I would really
[01:06:57.108 --> 01:06:59.710]  Please, you don't have to get into our personal space.
[01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.950]  Thank you.
[01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:03.753]  Well, you're in my personal space, so... Can I explain to you, Arthur?
[01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:06.374]  I'm not really interested in what you have to say.
[01:07:06.374 --> 01:07:07.535]  Can I explain to you?
[01:07:07.535 --> 01:07:08.516]  I'm reading.
[01:07:08.516 --> 01:07:09.296]  OK.
[01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:09.456]  OK.
[01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:17.482]  The... What we want to do is... Oh, yeah, the full video is up at Infowars.com and on Arthur Pulaski's site as well.
[01:07:17.482 --> 01:07:24.386]  Website, streetchurch.ca, streetchurch.ca and Arthur Pulaski TV on YouTube.
[01:07:24.386 --> 01:07:26.608]  And that's P-A-W-L-O-W-S-K
[01:07:27.661 --> 01:07:28.581]  Aye.
[01:07:28.581 --> 01:07:29.762]  And he joins us now.
[01:07:29.762 --> 01:07:30.682]  I love the liberal.
[01:07:30.682 --> 01:07:34.384]  Oh, please, please just let us, you know, we're just here to save you.
[01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:38.005]  We're just here to... No, they're setting the precedent to permanently shut everything down.
[01:07:38.005 --> 01:07:38.986]  It's in the Great Reset.
[01:07:38.986 --> 01:07:39.926]  That's the plan.
[01:07:39.926 --> 01:07:42.047]  So I want to try to give you the floor to start wherever you want.
[01:07:42.916 --> 01:07:47.138]  And go through all this, your experience in Poland, your powerful warning to all of us today.
[01:07:47.138 --> 01:07:50.860]  I know you've been doing a lot of interviews, and we're just so thankful that you're out there fighting, Pastor.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.461]  And if I lived near you, I'd drive 50 miles to attend your church.
[01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:58.023]  I could just feel the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, through the Skype right now.
[01:07:58.023 --> 01:08:02.885]  So God bless you, brother, for being a leader for us all as we fight this demonic takeover.
[01:08:02.885 --> 01:08:03.945]  You've got the floor.
[01:08:03.945 --> 01:08:07.767]  We're going to break in about six minutes, but you're going to have the floor for as long as you want to stay with us this hour.
[01:08:09.187 --> 01:08:10.127]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:12.788]  Thank you very much for standing with us and supporting us.
[01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:23.671]  I mean, I received tens of thousands of emails and texts, mostly from Americans, so I'm very, very glad that my brothers and sisters across the border are rising up.
[01:08:23.671 --> 01:08:28.153]  We are to be lions, and lions never bow before the hyenas.
[01:08:28.153 --> 01:08:32.234]  Lions never bow before the wolves, and that's what those people are, the wannabe
[01:08:33.414 --> 01:08:34.655]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:08:34.655 --> 01:08:38.756]  I am fired up and I'm angry because I grew up behind the Iron Curtain.
[01:08:38.756 --> 01:08:42.718]  I've seen this movie before and it doesn't end well.
[01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:45.479]  They will destroy everything if you let them.
[01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:48.520]  They will remove every right that you have.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.181]  It doesn't matter if you have your constitution or not.
[01:08:51.181 --> 01:08:58.984]  Poland, from 1945, had all those years a constitution, the highest law in the country, but communists, fascists,
[01:08:59.765 --> 01:09:05.352]  Dictators do not care about your rights and your charter of rights and freedoms and your constitution.
[01:09:05.352 --> 01:09:07.654]  They are stripping us from everything.
[01:09:07.654 --> 01:09:09.777]  And the church is the biggest resistance.
[01:09:09.777 --> 01:09:14.182]  It has always been the biggest resistance towards dictatorship and tyranny.
[01:09:14.182 --> 01:09:18.186]  Now we have the medical tyranny being pushed on us left and right.
[01:09:18.186 --> 01:09:19.027]  And we have a choice.
[01:09:19.027 --> 01:09:19.288]  We can
[01:09:19.728 --> 01:09:26.753]  Stand against that or we can allow them to destroy our way of life, destroy our faith.
[01:09:26.753 --> 01:09:32.737]  So my message to Americans is we have still a window of opportunity to push this evil away.
[01:09:32.737 --> 01:09:38.762]  We still have a chance to stand up against the tyrants, the wannabe dictators like
[01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:49.488]  Biden, like our Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, that is fascinated and he said it on record that he wished he would have a dictatorship like China.
[01:09:49.488 --> 01:10:02.795]  Can you imagine Chinese government murdering millions of people on a regular basis and the Prime Minister in a free and democratic country says that he would wish to be, you know, Chinese Prime Minister.
[01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.340]  So, they're coming with the warrants.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.721]  They're coming with a SWAT team.
[01:10:06.721 --> 01:10:07.561]  Can you imagine?
[01:10:07.561 --> 01:10:08.982]  To a peaceful assembly.
[01:10:08.982 --> 01:10:11.283]  I have been doing this for 22 years.
[01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:13.124]  I have no record of violence.
[01:10:13.124 --> 01:10:18.647]  And they're bringing a SWAT team, the gang suppression team, to a peaceful assembly.
[01:10:18.647 --> 01:10:20.268]  And excuse me, for what?
[01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:22.289]  To find out if we are wearing a mask?
[01:10:22.289 --> 01:10:24.570]  If I'm preaching wearing a muzzle?
[01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:25.991]  I'm not a dog.
[01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:27.431]  I'm not their servant.
[01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:28.432]  I am a taxpayer.
[01:10:28.952 --> 01:10:33.135]  And I demand that those people represent me and serve me.
[01:10:33.135 --> 01:10:34.956]  That's what we're paying them for.
[01:10:34.956 --> 01:10:36.917]  We're not paying them to remove our rights away.
[01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:39.219]  We're paying them to uphold our rights.
[01:10:39.219 --> 01:10:45.863]  And lately, they have total disregard to the Constitution, total disregard to our rights and freedoms.
[01:10:45.863 --> 01:10:47.844]  So, what are we going to do?
[01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:48.645]  Are we going to just
[01:10:49.065 --> 01:10:53.047]  Crawl into a hole and cry out and say there's nothing we can do?
[01:10:53.047 --> 01:11:06.113]  I have a message to them and I hope that more pastors, more priests, more rabbis will rise up, more politicians and free lovers, freedom lovers will say first no and then get out.
[01:11:06.113 --> 01:11:08.575]  Only those three words you need to say.
[01:11:08.575 --> 01:11:11.596]  No, I'm not complying to whatever you're pushing.
[01:11:11.596 --> 01:11:12.977]  I'm not bowing before you.
[01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:16.098]  I say no to you and get out.
[01:11:16.098 --> 01:11:17.439]  Get out of my businesses.
[01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.939]  Get out of our churches.
[01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:20.720]  Get out of our political arena.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.481]  Get out of our media.
[01:11:22.481 --> 01:11:24.342]  Get out of our educational system.
[01:11:24.342 --> 01:11:29.044]  I mean, if we're not going to say no and get out now, mark my words.
[01:11:29.044 --> 01:11:31.945]  Listen to the guy that grew up under communist dictatorship.
[01:11:32.325 --> 01:11:36.607]  They will keep coming and they will be taking more rides.
[01:11:36.607 --> 01:11:42.310]  They're cutting us by a thousand cuts, slowly removing one little law at a time.
[01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:43.491]  And they are testing you.
[01:11:43.491 --> 01:11:44.852]  They're testing you people.
[01:11:44.852 --> 01:11:46.132]  How are you going to react?
[01:11:46.132 --> 01:11:47.633]  They're testing you.
[01:11:47.633 --> 01:11:48.654]  Will you stand up?
[01:11:48.654 --> 01:11:51.995]  Will you allow us to take everything away from you?
[01:11:51.995 --> 01:11:53.536]  Or will there be uprising?
[01:11:53.536 --> 01:11:54.877]  And I'm not talking about BLM.
[01:11:56.245 --> 01:12:00.048]  I'm not talking about Antifa terrorist style.
[01:12:00.048 --> 01:12:01.629]  I'm talking about peaceful resistance.
[01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:03.471]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:12:03.471 --> 01:12:04.431]  non-compliance.
[01:12:04.431 --> 01:12:07.313]  Saying to them no and taking it to the streets.
[01:12:07.313 --> 01:12:09.195]  Big rallies, big protests.
[01:12:09.195 --> 01:12:14.999]  I'm calling right now people to come to our church this Saturday 9.30 in the morning.
[01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:15.459]  Come!
[01:12:15.459 --> 01:12:17.621]  Let there be thousands of people.
[01:12:17.621 --> 01:12:18.522]  Let's see what those
[01:12:19.162 --> 01:12:24.526]  Fascist wannabe dictators, the Gestapo wannabe people, are going to do when thousands of people are going to show up.
[01:12:24.526 --> 01:12:26.187]  And Artur, we've got to go to break, but let's talk about this.
[01:12:26.187 --> 01:12:39.217]  What do you think of Grace Life in Calgary, a big church, where they put up two fences around it, a black tarp like it was evil, like it was pornography or something, and spent millions of dollars, it looks like, to do this?
[01:12:39.217 --> 01:12:40.458]  It's like the Berlin Wall.
[01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:42.339]  They're literally walling off churches.
[01:12:42.339 --> 01:12:45.982]  These are obviously sick, evil people testing to see what they can get away with.
[01:12:45.982 --> 01:12:47.163]  Like you said, it is a test.
[01:12:48.579 --> 01:12:49.240]  It is a test.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.483]  It's Edmonton, actually, so it's the next big city in the province of Alberta.
[01:12:53.483 --> 01:12:54.043]  It's a test.
[01:12:54.043 --> 01:12:54.964]  They're testing us.
[01:12:54.964 --> 01:12:56.786]  They're testing what the pastors will do.
[01:12:56.786 --> 01:12:58.947]  They're testing what the Christians are going to do.
[01:12:58.947 --> 01:13:06.033]  They are testing us, and we have to send a very clear and strong, aggressive message to them that we're not going to bow down.
[01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:07.474]  We're not their slaves.
[01:13:07.474 --> 01:13:12.058]  We're not going to submit to their evil, unconstitutional laws.
[01:13:12.058 --> 01:13:14.740]  Now is the time to rise up, stand up, and push.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.922]  We're hiring very powerful criminal lawyers.
[01:13:17.362 --> 01:13:22.824]  To take this to courts, of course, but in the meantime, we need the boots on the streets.
[01:13:22.824 --> 01:13:25.185]  We need the people to send messages to support us.
[01:13:25.185 --> 01:13:28.346]  This is as big as the Germans taking down the Berlin Wall.
[01:13:28.346 --> 01:13:32.248]  It's as big as what happened in Poland, I guess, was that Perestroika?
[01:13:32.248 --> 01:13:36.889]  And so to be clear, you're in Calgary, the other church is in Alberta, but this is happening all over the country.
[01:13:36.889 --> 01:13:37.710]  Give us a report on that.
[01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:38.490]  It's happening in Australia.
[01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:39.051]  It's happening in Australia.
[01:13:39.051 --> 01:13:39.671]  It's happening in Germany.
[01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:40.633]  It's happening in France.
[01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:41.534]  It's happening in England.
[01:13:41.534 --> 01:13:42.835]  It's happening all over the world.
[01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.678]  It's the UN directing it.
[01:13:44.678 --> 01:13:46.380]  Artur Holowski is our guest.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.643]  He's the pastor there in Canada.
[01:13:48.643 --> 01:13:50.325]  Streetchurch.ca.
[01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.606]  He is the model of victory.
[01:13:51.606 --> 01:13:52.067]  We'll be right back.
[01:13:55.149 --> 01:14:00.111]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was right.
[01:14:00.111 --> 01:14:09.014]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[01:14:09.014 --> 01:14:11.475]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[01:14:11.475 --> 01:14:12.456]  And thanks for your support.
[01:14:12.456 --> 01:14:16.017]  We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video on radio stations and TV stations.
[01:14:16.477 --> 01:14:17.138]  We're good to go.
[01:14:36.755 --> 01:14:37.015]  We're good.
[01:14:53.775 --> 01:14:55.675]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[01:14:55.675 --> 01:15:06.738]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[01:15:06.738 --> 01:15:10.719]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:12.119]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[01:15:12.119 --> 01:15:17.200]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:17.620]  And I get it.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:19.381]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:21.521]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt.
[01:15:22.455 --> 01:15:23.476]  We're good to go.
[01:15:37.888 --> 01:15:39.749]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:41.751]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[01:15:41.751 --> 01:15:47.595]  Thank you for spreading the word about InfoWars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:47.595 --> 01:15:51.237]  Because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[01:15:51.237 --> 01:15:52.218]  So thank you for the support.
[01:15:52.218 --> 01:15:55.960]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.542]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:06.503 --> 01:16:09.144]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:16:09.144 --> 01:16:19.847]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:16:19.847 --> 01:16:32.570]  Ronald Reagan, back in 1989, right as he was leaving office, said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.
[01:16:33.999 --> 01:16:41.161]  Well, I say, like he said in 88 was the year, not Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.
[01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:49.344]  I say, puppet Biden, tear off that mask off your dirty bandit face and tell people to take it off the face of children everywhere.
[01:16:49.344 --> 01:16:50.465]  This is a cult.
[01:16:50.465 --> 01:16:51.485]  This is a programming.
[01:16:51.485 --> 01:16:53.366]  This is a peer pressure system.
[01:16:53.366 --> 01:16:55.626]  This is a desperate big pharma U.N.
[01:16:55.626 --> 01:16:58.787]  operation that says it wants communism.
[01:16:58.787 --> 01:16:59.708]  And the E.U.
[01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:00.508]  took much of the old
[01:17:02.014 --> 01:17:08.435]  Bureaucrats from the Eastern Bloc, and has put most of them in charge of the unelected EU Council.
[01:17:08.435 --> 01:17:10.936]  So the voting in the EU is only ceremonial.
[01:17:10.936 --> 01:17:17.818]  It is the permanent council, like the Politburo in Communist China, that actually runs the show.
[01:17:17.818 --> 01:17:24.439]  So, Pastor Artur Polosky of streetchurch.ca, has a big street church serving over a thousand
[01:17:25.143 --> 01:17:30.090]  Homeless people every week, and he also has his other church, Cave of Adullam.
[01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:32.072]  Maybe he'll tell us what that means biblically.
[01:17:32.072 --> 01:17:34.135]  But this is a shorter segment, a long segment coming up.
[01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:50.782]  Go wherever you want, but the historical parallels here of your family, of Poland, of what you guys went through, can you impart that to us so we understand, those of us that haven't gone through something like this, what's going to happen if we keep following along with this program?
[01:17:50.782 --> 01:18:00.646]  Because for those that don't know, this is all UN, EU, big tech, Davos Group run, and they admit the EU model is the model, and that was the old Soviet bloc model.
[01:18:00.646 --> 01:18:01.606]  Please enlighten us.
[01:18:03.283 --> 01:18:04.705]  Exactly, you're absolutely right.
[01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:18.301]  What we're seeing is the biggest destruction or elimination, if you will, of the middle class, small and medium-sized businesses, because in order to control society, you have to take away their means to defend themselves.
[01:18:18.921 --> 01:18:23.706]  You know, the socialists, the communists, they want only extremely powerful and wealthy, that's them.
[01:18:23.706 --> 01:18:30.132]  And you've heard about the Great Reset, and they want the rest of the society extremely poor.
[01:18:30.132 --> 01:18:32.234]  Because when you're poor, you've got to do jobs.
[01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:35.497]  You have to just work for a loaf of bread.
[01:18:35.497 --> 01:18:36.798]  You don't have time for protest.
[01:18:36.798 --> 01:18:38.900]  You've got no money to hire lawyers.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.443]  And that's exactly what I experienced.
[01:18:41.443 --> 01:18:42.684]  50,000 communists, the elite,
[01:18:43.064 --> 01:18:48.167]  We're ruling over 36 Polish people, destroying everything on its path.
[01:18:48.167 --> 01:18:49.769]  People had no rights whatsoever.
[01:18:49.769 --> 01:18:53.971]  You could be arrested for whatever reason that they wanted to arrest you.
[01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:59.755]  There was this famous saying, give me a man and we will find something on that man.
[01:18:59.755 --> 01:19:02.457]  Five in the morning... Give me the man, I will find you the crime!
[01:19:03.456 --> 01:19:11.383]  That's exactly the famous saying from the police during the Soviets, during the occupation, behind the Iron Curtain.
[01:19:11.383 --> 01:19:16.128]  They could come into your house five in the morning, break the door and beat you up, torture you.
[01:19:16.128 --> 01:19:20.331]  Many people were arrested and tortured just for listening to a European radio.
[01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:21.893]  That's why you have this propaganda.
[01:19:22.273 --> 01:19:25.154]  And here is what he said from jail, Biringman Jail,
[01:19:52.219 --> 01:19:53.420]  Yes.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:57.982]  Injustice anywhere is a trap to justice everywhere.
[01:19:57.982 --> 01:20:01.944]  Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.
[01:20:01.944 --> 01:20:03.004]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:20:03.004 --> 01:20:04.505]  First they came for me.
[01:20:04.505 --> 01:20:05.866]  Be sure of it.
[01:20:05.866 --> 01:20:06.626]  Be sure of it.
[01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:09.488]  They will come for you because that's their pattern.
[01:20:09.488 --> 01:20:11.248]  That's what history is teaching us.
[01:20:11.248 --> 01:20:12.209]  They're testing, they're
[01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:12.969]  They're coming.
[01:20:12.969 --> 01:20:14.390]  They're coming for me today.
[01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:15.170]  Yes.
[01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:18.132]  And they think that I have no means to defend myself.
[01:20:18.132 --> 01:20:23.934]  That's why I'm very grateful to you and others to expose this level of corruption.
[01:20:23.934 --> 01:20:26.275]  So, what is the solution?
[01:20:26.275 --> 01:20:29.317]  The solution is non-compliance going out.
[01:20:29.317 --> 01:20:32.058]  Because if you don't, you're going to experience what I experienced.
[01:20:33.487 --> 01:20:35.428]  In Poland, corruption.
[01:20:35.428 --> 01:20:40.391]  I experienced lineups, never-ending lineups of people standing for a loaf of bread.
[01:20:40.391 --> 01:20:47.254]  I remember every single Saturday in the morning my mom would send me to a bakery to buy a loaf of bread, just one.
[01:20:47.254 --> 01:20:50.916]  And I had to stand hours and hours just to buy that one loaf of bread.
[01:20:50.916 --> 01:20:55.718]  And Stalin even said they did that on purpose, and linen, and then of course it spread to Poland and everywhere else.
[01:20:56.238 --> 01:21:01.523]  Because they said, we want to keep them so desperate for little things, they don't worry about everything else we've taken from them.
[01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:09.672]  And then Bernie Sanders, remember, three years ago said, there's too much in the stores, too many food, too many deodorants, too many choices.
[01:21:09.672 --> 01:21:10.893]  He doesn't like that.
[01:21:10.893 --> 01:21:12.394]  He can't control it.
[01:21:12.394 --> 01:21:15.958]  And he is an admitted communist who honeymoons in the Soviet Union.
[01:21:17.259 --> 01:21:21.782]  Exactly, because to control a society, you need to control the food supply.
[01:21:21.782 --> 01:21:28.187]  When you control the food supply, you created a nation of slaves that are being ruled by those tyrants.
[01:21:28.187 --> 01:21:30.509]  And I'll prove it to you by what we're seeing right now.
[01:21:30.509 --> 01:21:32.070]  Walmarts, Ikea's.
[01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:37.814]  In Ikea, before you go over there, it says only 400 people, 480 people allowed.
[01:21:37.814 --> 01:21:39.676]  You got hundreds of people in the parking lots.
[01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:47.975]  You've got Walmarts filled with people shoulder to shoulder, but I cannot have my parents for coffee in my house.
[01:21:47.975 --> 01:21:49.056]  That's against the law.
[01:21:49.056 --> 01:21:57.320]  I cannot have a church because that's against the law, but I can go with my church, with my friends, with my family members to Ikea and have a coffee over there.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.381]  Oh, that's a great idea!
[01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:02.943]  Why don't you guys go to Walmart, say you're going, go in and then hold a church service there.
[01:22:02.943 --> 01:22:03.724]  You'll be allowed to.
[01:22:03.724 --> 01:22:05.365]  Of course, then they'll throw you out, but that'd be a great start.
[01:22:06.744 --> 01:22:21.870]  Yes, I already said to the authorities if they're going to shut down, if they're going to pull a stunt like they did to the Grace Life Church and fence our church, the next move is going to be me popping up every week in a different place and holding church services in the places that are allowed.
[01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:27.932]  In front of the mayor's house, in front of the chief of police house, in front of the health inspector's house.
[01:22:28.192 --> 01:22:34.699]  I'm going to be going all over the place and doing church services publicly, because what is our other choice?
[01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:39.383]  If we're not going to push now, we will not have tomorrow, and that's what people do not understand.
[01:22:39.383 --> 01:22:41.365]  They think that this is going to pass away.
[01:22:41.365 --> 01:22:44.228]  Remember, we were told it's just two weeks, right?
[01:22:44.228 --> 01:22:44.869]  We are in this
[01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:45.809]  We're good to go.
[01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:06.959]  The Great Reset admits they want to bankrupt you to put you on a monthly ration, a quote, guaranteed income.
[01:23:06.959 --> 01:23:08.599]  You already enjoyed that in Poland.
[01:23:08.599 --> 01:23:11.700]  Didn't matter how much you worked, you still didn't get any money.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.941]  You had the little ration card they gave you.
[01:23:13.941 --> 01:23:18.062]  They admit that's what they want for the carbon footprint is global ration cards.
[01:23:18.062 --> 01:23:18.882]  That's the Great Reset.
[01:23:19.881 --> 01:23:20.602]  Food stamps.
[01:23:20.602 --> 01:23:27.948]  I mean, people have no idea what we're talking about because Americans and Canadians, they experienced food stamps during the Second World War.
[01:23:27.948 --> 01:23:39.018]  But I grew up in 1970s and 80s in a country that you couldn't just go to a store, even if you had the money, you had to only buy, you were allowed only to buy what the food stamp was saying.
[01:23:39.018 --> 01:23:44.082]  So everything was under the table, was run, the country was run by bribes.
[01:23:44.082 --> 01:23:47.345]  You had to bribe the police, you had to bribe the clerks, you had to bribe the
[01:23:47.865 --> 01:23:49.608]  Doctors, nurses.
[01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:52.071]  You had to bribe the teachers, politicians.
[01:23:52.071 --> 01:23:54.154]  I mean, it was a sick system.
[01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:57.178]  And by the way, they had huge orphanages, people starving.
[01:23:57.178 --> 01:24:00.082]  Took a very successful country and just gutted the hell out of it.
[01:24:00.982 --> 01:24:02.623]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:13.868]  And every country that you actually look at what is going on, when the communists and socialists take over, it bankrupts the country because they want to be the only ones to rule over you.
[01:24:13.868 --> 01:24:15.428]  And that's the whole agenda.
[01:24:15.428 --> 01:24:23.352]  The agenda is to create a bunch of slaves that are being ruled by a small group of the elites, the globalists, whatever you want to call them.
[01:24:23.912 --> 01:24:25.053]  Stay there, Pastor.
[01:24:25.053 --> 01:24:25.873]  Powerful info.
[01:24:25.873 --> 01:24:29.594]  Even having the WikiLeaks, they talk about making us poor to control us.
[01:24:29.594 --> 01:24:31.355]  I mean, they are the establishment.
[01:24:31.355 --> 01:24:32.795]  The left is the elite.
[01:24:32.795 --> 01:24:34.016]  They are not woke.
[01:24:34.016 --> 01:24:37.277]  They are the establishment, allied with Communist China.
[01:24:37.277 --> 01:24:40.638]  Artur Polosky, PastorStreetChurch.ca is our guest.
[01:24:40.638 --> 01:24:41.719]  You've got to go to the URL.
[01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:44.420]  They're banning him all over the place, and they're sending SWAT teams after him.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.500]  You've got to stand with him.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.620]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.901]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:24:48.901 --> 01:24:49.962]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:24:51.565 --> 01:24:53.946]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:24:53.946 --> 01:24:55.686]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:24:55.686 --> 01:24:58.687]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:24:58.687 --> 01:24:59.928]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:00.848]  But I don't care about that.
[01:25:00.848 --> 01:25:02.888]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[01:25:02.888 --> 01:25:07.610]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:10.951]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:25:10.951 --> 01:25:12.471]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:25:12.471 --> 01:25:13.672]  But let's just say this.
[01:25:13.672 --> 01:25:14.992]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:25:14.992 --> 01:25:17.453]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:25:18.073 --> 01:25:21.715]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:21.715 --> 01:25:24.276]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[01:25:24.276 --> 01:25:27.477]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:25:27.477 --> 01:25:28.337]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:25:28.337 --> 01:25:29.438]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:35.880]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.621]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:25:37.621 --> 01:25:40.442]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:25:41.022 --> 01:25:44.144]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:25:44.144 --> 01:25:51.747]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:25:51.747 --> 01:25:56.249]  This entire New World Order system is about making you dependent.
[01:25:56.249 --> 01:25:57.310]  Making you obsolete.
[01:25:57.310 --> 01:26:00.451]  Making you a domesticated animal they control.
[01:26:00.451 --> 01:26:01.692]  They want to censor you.
[01:26:01.692 --> 01:26:02.532]  They want to dumb you down.
[01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:03.632]  They want to poison you.
[01:26:03.632 --> 01:26:06.794]  And they want to control your ability to take care of yourself.
[01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:12.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the InfoWar more than ever.
[01:26:12.394 --> 01:26:17.576]  And you can do it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[01:26:52.034 --> 01:27:02.501]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement made 14 years ago accurately predicted the globalists takeover using the Great Reset and the threat of a virus.
[01:27:02.501 --> 01:27:05.103]  This film is now more important than ever.
[01:27:05.103 --> 01:27:11.307]  I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly the limited supply we had at Infowarsore.com had sold out.
[01:27:11.307 --> 01:27:20.833]  That people were really talking about the documentary because major platforms like Amazon had banned it because the globalists had openly criticized the film, like the New York Times.
[01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:21.614]  And so we printed
[01:27:21.994 --> 01:27:28.556]  We have 20,000 copies now, back in print, and in less than two weeks, we've already sold half of them.
[01:27:28.556 --> 01:27:30.637]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:27:30.637 --> 01:27:36.479]  We're selling them close to cost at $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk, or $14.95 when you buy them individually.
[01:27:36.479 --> 01:27:40.901]  There is a zero country code on it, meaning you can copy this anywhere in the world.
[01:27:40.901 --> 01:27:41.521]  Get it.
[01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:42.501]  Burn copies.
[01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:43.421]  Share it with everyone.
[01:27:43.421 --> 01:27:44.542]  It's blowing people away.
[01:27:44.542 --> 01:27:45.422]  It's evergreen.
[01:27:45.422 --> 01:27:46.422]  It predicted it all.
[01:27:46.422 --> 01:27:46.723]  Endgame.
[01:27:46.723 --> 01:27:47.763]  Blooper for Global Enslavement.
[01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:50.184]  Available now in DVD and at bulwarkstore.com.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:03.244]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:12.809]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:13.330]  to 3 p.m.
[01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:17.732]  Central, we're live broadcasting worldwide thanks to you and your support.
[01:28:18.741 --> 01:28:23.128]  At Infowarsstore.com, thanks for your support for our local radio affiliates.
[01:28:23.128 --> 01:28:29.678]  You're reaching millions of people and the globalists are so upset, they are admittedly in the Washington Post, pushing the FBI.
[01:28:30.894 --> 01:28:36.436]  They had me arrested for the orchestrated attack on the Capitol on January 6th, which of course I had nothing to do with.
[01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:44.559]  It wasn't overall organized other than Antifa posing as Q to manipulate some Trump supporters out of the million, maybe 500 went in or so.
[01:28:44.559 --> 01:28:47.340]  But they are on the news saying we are trying to frame Alex Jones.
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:48.980]  Give me the man, I'll give you the crime.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:50.020]  I'm not scared.
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:50.861]  I'm a good person.
[01:28:50.861 --> 01:28:51.401]  I love God.
[01:28:51.881 --> 01:28:56.043]  I mean, I'm a sinner, but I want to be good, and I've been born again, and Jesus is my Savior.
[01:28:56.043 --> 01:28:58.984]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect, so I don't fear these people.
[01:28:58.984 --> 01:29:01.865]  I fear God, and I fear bowing to their evil.
[01:29:01.865 --> 01:29:08.448]  Plus, I know if you bow to tyrants, it's a thousand deaths.
[01:29:08.448 --> 01:29:14.570]  People that aren't cowards only die a single death, and it was Zapata that said, it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:16.811]  In my experience, historically, and in life,
[01:29:17.515 --> 01:29:22.539]  Being on your legs, standing on your feet, is safer than being on your knees.
[01:29:22.539 --> 01:29:26.402]  It's people living on their knees that I see are being enslaved.
[01:29:26.402 --> 01:29:35.949]  But since Arthur Polosky, this great pastor who's been attacked and threatened and they sent the SWAT team and he still stayed open, I want to learn what's happening in the church now here in a moment.
[01:29:35.949 --> 01:29:40.372]  Since he mentioned Justin Trudeau, his father, Pierre Trudeau, was a communist.
[01:29:40.372 --> 01:29:41.713]  He said he liked Mao.
[01:29:41.713 --> 01:29:43.954]  He said he liked Fidel Castro on record.
[01:29:45.609 --> 01:29:46.249]  Praise them.
[01:29:46.249 --> 01:29:47.190]  He visited them.
[01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:51.151]  And so now his son says he wants to be in a basic dictatorship.
[01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:55.333]  You know, just a basic one that killed 80 plus million conservatively of their own people.
[01:29:55.333 --> 01:30:01.936]  If there was a heavyweight champion of mass murder, it's the Communist Chinese and this disgusting evil family.
[01:30:02.556 --> 01:30:03.977]  A level of admiration I actually have for China.
[01:30:33.675 --> 01:30:45.658]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[01:30:45.658 --> 01:30:51.719]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[01:30:51.719 --> 01:30:54.180]  That I find quite interesting.
[01:30:57.515 --> 01:30:58.396]  We're the good guys.
[01:30:58.396 --> 01:30:59.798]  We can engage in dictatorship.
[01:30:59.798 --> 01:31:03.341]  We'll shut down those pesky churches and show them who the bosses are.
[01:31:03.341 --> 01:31:05.724]  We can wear blackface, but you can't.
[01:31:05.724 --> 01:31:07.326]  We're anointed ones.
[01:31:07.326 --> 01:31:12.551]  So, Pastor Pawlowski, continuing here, where is it going now?
[01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:17.136]  They came to your church this weekend, finally with some type of warrant.
[01:31:17.136 --> 01:31:17.817]  What unfolded?
[01:31:17.817 --> 01:31:18.418]  What's the next step?
[01:31:20.484 --> 01:31:28.550]  Yes, they came with a warrant to enter, with a court order to be exact, to enter the church facility.
[01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:39.158]  I had no chance to read the document because the lady kept interrupting me and I had those SWAT team officers on my left and on my right and more waiting.
[01:31:39.158 --> 01:31:40.199]  I was videotaped.
[01:31:40.199 --> 01:31:44.262]  They brought even a SWAT team that records every conversation.
[01:31:44.262 --> 01:31:45.483]  They are in the background.
[01:31:45.483 --> 01:31:46.604]  And look at this guy's eyes!
[01:31:46.604 --> 01:31:49.106]  He looks very, like he's trying to intimidate you, like he's a real tough guy.
[01:31:50.231 --> 01:31:51.472]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[01:31:51.472 --> 01:32:01.176]  They're trained to intimidate, and they don't know what to do when a citizen actually knows the law and is not allowing them to be intimidated, you know?
[01:32:01.176 --> 01:32:02.816]  They don't know what to do.
[01:32:02.816 --> 01:32:04.377]  They're not trained in the law.
[01:32:04.377 --> 01:32:09.599]  They are just law enforcement agency right now, brown shirts of Adolf Hitler.
[01:32:09.599 --> 01:32:12.380]  They're just doing what they're told by the politicians.
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:15.722]  And let me just add something to this whole story.
[01:32:15.722 --> 01:32:19.083]  The mayor of the city of Calgary is a Muslim homosexual.
[01:32:19.523 --> 01:32:22.624]  He absolutely hates Christians.
[01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:24.285]  He hates me.
[01:32:24.285 --> 01:32:33.048]  He has spoken publicly about me many times with a disgust and he's doing everything in his power for years actually to shut our church down.
[01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:36.689]  Now he's just... Oh, of course, the left is never tolerant once they get control.
[01:32:37.737 --> 01:32:38.298]  Yes.
[01:32:38.298 --> 01:32:49.827]  You know, when you think about it, now he has found the new game power that allows him to bring this fake emergency, the health emergency.
[01:32:49.827 --> 01:32:50.987]  And that's a great point.
[01:32:50.987 --> 01:32:56.432]  It gives every petty tyrant the world over the excuse to selectively enforce on who they want.
[01:32:56.432 --> 01:32:59.514]  Like you said, under communism, that's the essence of it.
[01:32:59.514 --> 01:33:01.876]  That's exactly what is happening right now.
[01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:05.019]  And, you know, down goes... What is this pig's name?
[01:33:05.019 --> 01:33:06.760]  What is this jihadi's name?
[01:33:07.888 --> 01:33:31.620]  Nahed Nenshi, Nahed Nenshi is a Muslim that was elected and some say that he cheated the election, there was not enough ballots, the people could not get to the ballots, some say that they disappeared in a few polling stations, so we know that the election was rigged in the city of Calgary, but he is now a tyrant, that's what he is, a dictator that is ruling with iron fist and he sends
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:53.745]  Bylaws to my church, he sends police, SWAT team, last Saturday, and health inspectors trying to finish us off before he's out of the office because he knows that this election we have many candidates, people are sick and tired of what they're saying, they want to clean the swamp because the city... I agree, but let me guess, Pastor Pawlowski, it's backfiring.
[01:33:53.745 --> 01:33:54.705]  I mean, I'm just guessing.
[01:33:54.705 --> 01:33:57.286]  Is your church bigger and stronger now under the persecution?
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.624]  Oh, it grew twice in just a few weeks.
[01:34:01.624 --> 01:34:16.200]  We're getting stronger, we're getting powerful, and I'm hoping that we'll have a thousand people, maybe more, this coming Saturday, 9.30 in the morning, just to show the government, the wannabe dictators, that we're not backing down, we're not bowing before their
[01:34:17.581 --> 01:34:18.962]  Tyranny, because that's what it is.
[01:34:18.962 --> 01:34:19.242]  I agree.
[01:34:19.242 --> 01:34:21.864]  Let me ask you, because I've been trying to follow it all, but I can't follow it all.
[01:34:21.864 --> 01:34:25.947]  With the other church, the Grace Life, what's happened with them?
[01:34:25.947 --> 01:34:27.969]  Have they kept hundreds of officers there?
[01:34:27.969 --> 01:34:28.869]  Is the fence still there?
[01:34:28.869 --> 01:34:31.171]  I mean, because if more churches do this, they can't shut them all down.
[01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:37.655]  That's right and unfortunately the pastors have become cowards and the priests are not rising up.
[01:34:37.655 --> 01:34:39.236]  There's few here and there.
[01:34:39.236 --> 01:34:46.919]  What happens in the Edmonton church, the fence is still there and the officers are still there and the church went underground like in China.
[01:34:46.919 --> 01:34:48.920]  So they are meeting in a secret place.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.981]  They're still meeting every week.
[01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:54.162]  However, it's only for the inner circle people and it's
[01:34:54.942 --> 01:34:55.542]  Underground.
[01:34:55.542 --> 01:35:08.345]  So can you imagine living in Canada and having to have a church service underground, just like the Chinese Christians are having right now, or under the Sharia law in different Arab countries, Islamic countries?
[01:35:08.345 --> 01:35:17.967]  Well that's right, and on top of it, in places like Michigan and California and New York, some of the Christian churches and synagogues are still closed, but the Muslim mosques are open.
[01:35:17.967 --> 01:35:18.927]  This is real discrimination.
[01:35:20.154 --> 01:35:22.496]  Of course it is, and it's an open discrimination.
[01:35:22.496 --> 01:35:26.379]  For example, here in the Islamic Center, there were hundreds of people.
[01:35:26.379 --> 01:35:32.244]  A friend of mine, an alderman from another city, he sent me a video that his wife recorded with him.
[01:35:32.244 --> 01:35:38.809]  Hundreds of people in a mosque, hundreds of cars outside, no police, no health inspectors, no bylaw officers.
[01:35:38.809 --> 01:35:42.112]  It looks like they can do whatever they want because the mayor protects them.
[01:35:42.472 --> 01:35:42.712]  I think
[01:36:01.042 --> 01:36:24.556]  Well, Pastor, while I'm listening to you, I've got tears in my eyes, not of sadness, not even of anger, of energy and the Holy Spirit demanding we resist this, demanding we say no, and it only fulfills revelation of the Bible that this world government's being set up, it wants to market the beast, to buy and sell, it wants to put a genetic code in our body, and it seeks immediately to shut down little churches while leaving the big, giant ones alone.
[01:36:24.556 --> 01:36:26.617]  It's just sick, it's evil, it's totally obvious.
[01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:31.114]  But you know, God, to this day, He is asking us the same question.
[01:36:31.114 --> 01:36:32.195]  Who will go for us?
[01:36:32.195 --> 01:36:35.599]  And I want to be like the prophet of old that says, here I am, Lord.
[01:36:35.599 --> 01:36:37.221]  I may not be the most talented guy.
[01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:38.922]  Listen to my English, you know.
[01:36:38.922 --> 01:36:43.067]  I couldn't even pronounce the jail where Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:36:43.067 --> 01:36:43.648]  was in.
[01:36:43.648 --> 01:36:48.013]  But I say to God, and I pray that everybody else will do the same thing.
[01:36:48.533 --> 01:36:50.894]  God, here I am Lord, use me.
[01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:54.116]  Use a little me if that pleases you.
[01:36:54.116 --> 01:37:03.721]  I'm willing to go because the Bible says... And that's what they're scared of is they know God will use Christian vessels to defeat the Antichrist and so they know preemptively try to shut that down when they roll their system out.
[01:37:03.721 --> 01:37:04.982]  It's all being fulfilled!
[01:37:06.112 --> 01:37:06.713]  That's right.
[01:37:06.713 --> 01:37:11.840]  And in the Revelation it says the cowardly, the fearful, will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.583]  That's why I'm calling out the lions.
[01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:19.391]  Come, let's form the biggest pack that this earth has ever seen and let's chase those hyenas away.
[01:37:19.391 --> 01:37:21.774]  We lions, we eat hyenas for breakfast.
[01:37:21.774 --> 01:37:22.355]  Let's not be...
[01:37:22.595 --> 01:37:25.997]  Well, Pastor Artur Polosky, a few more minutes on the other side, then I'm going to let you go.
[01:37:25.997 --> 01:37:27.018]  Please come back with updates.
[01:37:27.018 --> 01:37:31.020]  But I pledge, brother, that I'll be with you against the Antichrist system.
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:37.204]  I will never take their mark, and I will never support shutting down churches, and I will fight them tooth and nail to the end, brother.
[01:37:37.204 --> 01:37:39.026]  We'll be right back, final segment with him.
[01:37:39.026 --> 01:37:43.769]  Then Steve Quayle joins us to get into all the insanity that's going on and so much more.
[01:37:43.769 --> 01:37:45.710]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:47.911]  Band.Video, tomorrow's news today.
[01:37:54.015 --> 01:37:54.578]  Yeah.

[01:38:18.351 --> 01:38:24.196]  And many of these products have been sold out for months and months and months because of the COVID shutdowns and lockdowns have destroyed the supply chain.
[01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:25.497]  But finally, they're back in stock.
[01:38:25.497 --> 01:38:28.399]  So that's the Cavalry for InfoWars as well and our funding.

[01:38:47.067 --> 01:38:48.047]  The cavalry is here.
[01:38:51.056 --> 01:38:58.400]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:05.244]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[01:39:05.244 --> 01:39:06.905]  With or without a battery.
[01:39:07.686 --> 01:39:13.789]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.

[01:39:24.834 --> 01:39:35.602]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[01:39:35.602 --> 01:39:40.526]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[01:39:40.526 --> 01:39:46.430]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.
[01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:47.511]  InfoWarStore.com
[01:39:51.366 --> 01:40:00.951]  It was our number two best-selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns destroyed the supply chain, and it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:40:00.951 --> 01:40:03.792]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[01:40:03.792 --> 01:40:04.952]  That's why this one's white.
[01:40:04.952 --> 01:40:07.013]  I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[01:40:07.013 --> 01:40:08.194]  Get it packaged.
[01:40:08.194 --> 01:40:08.874]  Get it to us.
[01:40:08.874 --> 01:40:10.435]  Get it shipped out because it's amazing.
[01:40:10.475 --> 01:40:10.856]  We're good to go.
[01:40:27.219 --> 01:40:28.259]  It is a big idea.
[01:40:28.259 --> 01:40:28.780]  A new world order.
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.126]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:41:03.126 --> 01:41:05.929]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[01:41:05.929 --> 01:41:08.793]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:41:08.793 --> 01:41:11.216]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:41:12.126 --> 01:41:20.288]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:41:20.288 --> 01:41:22.948]  The globalists fear this film made 14 years ago.
[01:41:22.948 --> 01:41:25.168]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[01:41:25.168 --> 01:41:26.609]  It is the blueprint for the Great Reset.
[01:41:26.609 --> 01:41:27.669]  It is, in-game.
[01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:28.909]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:41:28.909 --> 01:41:34.930]  Available right now at mfulmorestore.com with a zero country code, meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:38.711]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at mfulmorestore.com.
[01:41:39.151 --> 01:41:41.373]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[01:41:41.373 --> 01:41:46.738]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[01:41:46.738 --> 01:41:54.746]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[01:41:54.746 --> 01:41:57.408]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:28.257 --> 01:42:29.918]  Well, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:42:29.918 --> 01:42:37.740]  Our CDC maskers have released the guidelines, I'll cover it next hour, about where you wear a mask, where you don't.
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:42.901]  Outside, you don't have to, but if there's any people you need to, it's more of the same.
[01:42:42.901 --> 01:42:44.022]  Just total divide and conquer.
[01:42:44.022 --> 01:42:46.142]  It's the mask giving you bacterial pneumonia.
[01:42:46.142 --> 01:42:49.143]  It's the mask causing children to collapse and die, people to pass out from
[01:42:50.075 --> 01:42:51.956]  Not having enough oxygen and run off the highway.
[01:42:51.956 --> 01:42:54.798]  It's simply insane.
[01:42:54.798 --> 01:43:02.984]  And then, oh, as virus rages abroad, Biden promises to ship millions of vaccine doses.
[01:43:02.984 --> 01:43:03.884]  That's the New York Times.
[01:43:03.884 --> 01:43:13.811]  AstraZeneca, banned in 21 countries in Europe, banned in the Philippines, not authorized here in the U.S., even though the other experimental ones are, causing all the deaths and blood clots.
[01:43:13.811 --> 01:43:15.192]  But we're going to give it to India.
[01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:20.860]  Where they're under lockdown again, starving to death, dying of malnutrition.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:25.344]  Arthur, how do you think we fight this on the big picture?
[01:43:25.344 --> 01:43:29.148]  Obviously prayer, the big agenda, we expose it.
[01:43:29.148 --> 01:43:31.551]  In the time we have left here, a few minutes, what else would you like to add?
[01:43:31.551 --> 01:43:32.252]  And thanks for joining us.
[01:43:34.548 --> 01:43:37.590]  Well, history is teaching us what is next.
[01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:44.114]  That's why they have not been teaching our children history because they don't want the people to know the truth.
[01:43:44.114 --> 01:43:49.798]  Masks, historically speaking, were always a symbol of submission, symbol of slavery.
[01:43:49.798 --> 01:43:53.781]  What they're telling you, wear a mask because you have no identity.
[01:43:53.781 --> 01:43:58.724]  We are removing who you are and we are removing your rights to express yourself.
[01:43:58.724 --> 01:44:01.025]  You're muzzled.
[01:44:01.025 --> 01:44:01.686]  You're a slave.
[01:44:02.774 --> 01:44:04.256]  And you have no say.
[01:44:04.256 --> 01:44:05.438]  You have no identity.
[01:44:05.438 --> 01:44:06.519]  We don't care who you are.
[01:44:06.519 --> 01:44:09.583]  You're just a social insurance number and you have no say.
[01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:11.445]  Take the mask off.
[01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:12.987]  Stop complying.
[01:44:12.987 --> 01:44:13.628]  Resist.
[01:44:14.489 --> 01:44:16.131]  Go to the rallies.
[01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:16.651]  Go.
[01:44:16.651 --> 01:44:23.638]  I always said to the people what I observed in 1981, I saw the power of unified Poles taking it to the streets.
[01:44:23.638 --> 01:44:25.200]  Tens of thousands were arrested.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:25.760]  True.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.342]  Some were shot dead.
[01:44:27.342 --> 01:44:28.763]  Some were clubbed to death.
[01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:33.808]  And by the way, for those who don't know, didn't the fall of the Soviet Union really begin in Poland and that was the example to Eastern Germany?
[01:44:34.938 --> 01:44:40.403]  Of course, Solidarity Movement with Lech Wałęsa, they took it to the streets, and they didn't care.
[01:44:40.403 --> 01:44:44.126]  They said, shoot us dead, shoot us all dead, but we want our rights back.
[01:44:44.126 --> 01:44:46.288]  We want our freedom right, if not for our rights, today.
[01:44:46.288 --> 01:44:47.249]  What was the tipping point?
[01:44:47.249 --> 01:44:54.295]  Because, I mean, the Poles went through hell in World War II, then after with Stalin, and then, of course, the Ukrainian Khrushchev.
[01:44:54.295 --> 01:44:59.440]  I mean, you guys went through a lot, and were robbed continually, just like the Ukrainians and others.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.802]  What was the tipping point of all those nightmares to finally say no?
[01:45:03.504 --> 01:45:05.425]  Well, people had absolutely no rights.
[01:45:05.425 --> 01:45:06.666]  There was nothing in the stores.
[01:45:06.666 --> 01:45:07.887]  There was total destruction.
[01:45:07.887 --> 01:45:09.728]  A collapse of economy.
[01:45:09.728 --> 01:45:10.368]  Nothing.
[01:45:10.368 --> 01:45:11.088]  Propaganda.
[01:45:11.088 --> 01:45:13.990]  The only thing you were listening is lie after lie after lie.
[01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:16.612]  Finally, people in 81 said, enough, it's enough.
[01:45:16.612 --> 01:45:20.974]  We're going to fight for our future generation, for our children, for our grandchildren.
[01:45:20.974 --> 01:45:22.195]  And they took it to the streets.
[01:45:22.535 --> 01:45:24.956]  When they took it to the streets, it was over.
[01:45:24.956 --> 01:45:29.177]  It was the beginning of over of the communist ruling over Europe.
[01:45:29.177 --> 01:45:31.618]  And a year later, everything started to collapse.
[01:45:31.618 --> 01:45:43.882]  Peter Stroyka in Russia, in Soviet Union, and of course, 1989, Poland again democratically elects its own president after the Second War.
[01:45:43.882 --> 01:45:46.083]  So it's possible, but we have to unite.
[01:45:46.443 --> 01:45:51.366]  It was called Solidarity Movement because people were in solidarity together.
[01:45:51.366 --> 01:46:00.030]  They forgot about all the differences, and I'm sure they had many, and they united under one banner, freedom, and they won their country back.
[01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:05.593]  I mean, in the end of the day, Alex, it's your country, it's my country, it's not just their country.
[01:46:05.593 --> 01:46:07.014]  We are in this together.
[01:46:07.014 --> 01:46:13.998]  We the patriots, we the lovers of our countries, we are the lovers of the freedoms, and Jesus is the biggest lover of freedom.
[01:46:14.478 --> 01:46:17.521]  And he says, who comes to me is free indeed.
[01:46:17.521 --> 01:46:24.026]  We have to have the right to tell the people that our God sits on the throne and he will have the final say.
[01:46:24.026 --> 01:46:26.348]  Alex, we know how the story ends.
[01:46:26.348 --> 01:46:29.971]  We know that it's tough like you see right now with those lions and hyenas.
[01:46:29.971 --> 01:46:34.835]  But we know that our lion from the tribe of Judah is going to come to clean the swamp.
[01:46:34.835 --> 01:46:40.260]  And I'm telling you, I would be afraid if I was the hyena of today because
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:45.903]  He is not going to show any mercy to those that are doing this great evil to so many people today.
[01:46:45.903 --> 01:46:48.965]  All right, Pastor, give us updates as it unfolds.
[01:46:48.965 --> 01:46:50.226]  We really are rooting for you.
[01:46:50.226 --> 01:46:51.267]  We're all in this together.
[01:46:51.267 --> 01:46:54.509]  Arthur Pawlowski, the website is streetchurch.ca.
[01:46:54.509 --> 01:47:05.395]  And I mean, if they dare put up a fence around your church, I know you're going to do the right thing and go, everybody just show up via email, show up inside Walmart where you're allowed to meet and have your church right there.
[01:47:05.395 --> 01:47:07.517]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[01:47:07.517 --> 01:47:07.937]  God bless you.
[01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:12.792]  Well, that is like a cool drink of water in the middle of the desert, isn't it?
[01:47:12.792 --> 01:47:15.674]  Resistance is victory, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:15.674 --> 01:47:22.259]  Now, I started the show with this, and it makes me become violently angry.
[01:47:22.259 --> 01:47:26.483]  And I'm not going to go out and be violent, but I'm not a virtuous signaler, okay?
[01:47:26.483 --> 01:47:33.088]  I see Indians living in squalor and corruption, and I don't think, well, let's just exterminate those people.
[01:47:33.088 --> 01:47:34.869]  I think those are human beings.
[01:47:34.869 --> 01:47:36.310]  And that's my instincts.
[01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:37.051]  That's my spirit.
[01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:38.432]  But I know why I'm designed like that.
[01:47:39.412 --> 01:47:51.695]  I have a real feeling of pain for them, on the leftist ones to exploit them and kill them, because they're human beings made in the image of God, and if I write them off, I will be written off by God.
[01:47:51.695 --> 01:47:53.835]  But that's the spiritual level.
[01:47:53.835 --> 01:48:01.197]  Physically, here on this planet, if you let that happen to them, you're next.
[01:48:01.197 --> 01:48:07.218]  You understand that, I read you mainstream articles admitting that two million extra Indians, this is like a three month old article,
[01:48:08.169 --> 01:48:13.533]  In the year of lockdown, have starved to death from malnutrition on top of the millions that already starved.
[01:48:13.533 --> 01:48:17.597]  That's out of the, it's gonna be 15 million now extra died in the last year under the lockdown.
[01:48:17.597 --> 01:48:20.039]  The old UN number was about 10 million.
[01:48:20.039 --> 01:48:24.622]  So instead of 15 million starving to death, 25 million plus.
[01:48:24.622 --> 01:48:29.666]  That's more people that have died even with fake COVID numbers worldwide, just in India.
[01:48:29.666 --> 01:48:33.990]  Those are dead people starving to death.
[01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:35.511]  And they just lay over in their little shack,
[01:48:36.869 --> 01:48:43.211]  And the first cold virus or flu virus comes by and they die, and then the media calls it COVID-19.
[01:48:43.211 --> 01:48:53.254]  And so, when I see the trendies with their masks, and I see them with their hatred and their pedophilia, and I mean, because they've converted a lot of the low-level left into evil now.
[01:48:53.254 --> 01:48:56.554]  I mean, there used to be kind of high-level super evil and kind of mid-level.
[01:48:56.554 --> 01:49:02.496]  Now the average leftist is, for all intents and purposes, a devil-worshipping ghoul.
[01:49:02.496 --> 01:49:05.437]  I don't know what's happened to them, but they're gone, folks.
[01:49:06.795 --> 01:49:19.721]  They're programmed by big tech, they're programmed by media, and they're a small minority of people, but they infest all the main cities, they command Black Lives Matter, and they command the Antifa, and they're just gone.
[01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:25.764]  And this is the wages of following this world system, is becoming one of these creatures.
[01:49:26.448 --> 01:49:31.271]  Because I know normal people that suddenly don't look normal and become all whacked out and basically possessed.
[01:49:31.271 --> 01:49:34.954]  And they're on weird drugs, they're on illegal drugs, they're on pharmakia.
[01:49:34.954 --> 01:49:40.177]  30% of the public is now on some type of psychotropic or prescription drug that alters their brain.
[01:49:40.177 --> 01:49:41.758]  We are poisoned!
[01:49:41.758 --> 01:49:42.959]  We are mesmerized!
[01:49:42.959 --> 01:49:44.520]  We are in a trance!
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:47.582]  And we need to break out of the trance together!
[01:49:48.988 --> 01:50:01.333]  And then I see all over the news, oh Biden sending help vaccines, oh America is going to send tens of millions of doses of vaccine to save the Indians, aren't we good?
[01:50:01.333 --> 01:50:06.635]  This is after they threw out Bill Gates and the Pfizer vaccine because it killed so many people, it doesn't protect you.
[01:50:06.635 --> 01:50:09.336]  And it's the AstraZeneca ban all over the world.
[01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:11.577]  And it's just so sick.
[01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:16.742]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:50:16.742 --> 01:50:21.523]  India, at least 11 dead and 1,000 taken ill after gas leak.
[01:50:21.523 --> 01:50:26.464]  And then they show you the exact same photos and say, COVID surge swallowing people in India.
[01:50:26.464 --> 01:50:29.445]  Footage shows people dead in the streets.
[01:50:29.445 --> 01:50:32.565]  Yeah, that's just one more of the things I've got.
[01:50:32.565 --> 01:50:37.506]  I haven't gotten through one stat today of all I've got here.
[01:50:37.506 --> 01:50:38.887]  I mean, it's that much news.
[01:50:38.887 --> 01:50:40.007]  Who's hosting the fourth hour?
[01:50:40.007 --> 01:50:40.827]  I may have to take it over.
[01:50:43.516 --> 01:50:45.217]  Oh, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:45.217 --> 01:50:45.598]  I love him.
[01:50:45.598 --> 01:50:47.099]  He's a great guy.
[01:50:47.099 --> 01:50:51.262]  But I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is genocide going on in front of everybody.
[01:50:51.262 --> 01:50:53.563]  By the way, if we don't fund ourselves, we won't be here.
[01:50:53.563 --> 01:50:54.364]  So it's a win-win-win.
[01:50:54.364 --> 01:50:55.825]  Please support us at Infowarshore.com.
[01:50:55.825 --> 01:50:58.907]  We've got a lot of new great t-shirts.
[01:50:58.907 --> 01:51:00.428]  With the media is the virus.
[01:51:00.428 --> 01:51:02.249]  COVID-19 is a hoax.
[01:51:02.249 --> 01:51:04.191]  F Fauci, F Gates, F Biden.
[01:51:05.134 --> 01:51:06.654]  Are really popular.
[01:51:06.654 --> 01:51:09.775]  We've also got Vitamin Mineral Fusion that's selling out very quickly.
[01:51:09.775 --> 01:51:11.296]  Winter Sun, great for your immune system.
[01:51:11.296 --> 01:51:15.177]  All their bodies sold out for five, six months.
[01:51:15.177 --> 01:51:23.780]  It's super concentrated turmeric for your immune system, for joint support, for flexibility support, for anti-inflammation support.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:26.520]  This is the strongest you're going to find out there.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.341]  People love it.
[01:51:27.341 --> 01:51:30.401]  And we could fund our operation if we could just keep this in stock.
[01:51:30.401 --> 01:51:31.962]  But because of the breakdown of supply chains,
[01:51:33.396 --> 01:51:36.378]  We've got a limited supply, and my crews are like, well, why are you offering 50% off?
[01:51:36.378 --> 01:51:37.699]  Well, I just want people to get it.
[01:51:37.699 --> 01:51:42.601]  We'll go back to regular price here in about a week, because it's going to sell out in two weeks of current sales rates.
[01:51:42.601 --> 01:51:44.483]  And we just had enough of it, we can just fund ourselves.
[01:51:44.483 --> 01:51:51.066]  But right now we've got somewhat of a deficit in the InfoWars war chest, so get products you need, fund the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[01:51:51.066 --> 01:51:56.870]  Also, Prostagard, not just for men, great for women, the great vitamins, the great minerals, and the soft palmetto, great for all your glands.
[01:51:58.129 --> 01:52:03.594]  Vazzo Beets, concentrated beet extract to create the nitrogen oxide and more in your bloodstream.
[01:52:03.594 --> 01:52:04.395]  That's the key to it.
[01:52:04.395 --> 01:52:06.477]  That's why beets are such a great thing.
[01:52:06.477 --> 01:52:07.378]  And raw beets are great, too.
[01:52:07.378 --> 01:52:09.760]  This is just the equivalent of eating a whole bushel of them.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:15.426]  Also, Alpha Power, ladies and gentlemen, is basically the dry form of Supermelt Vitality, but even stronger.
[01:52:15.426 --> 01:52:18.229]  But the Supermelt Vitality is cold-pressed, so it's apples and oranges.
[01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:20.471]  One's like a fine wine, one's like a Jack Daniels.
[01:52:20.851 --> 01:52:22.112]  Did you use that analogy?
[01:52:22.112 --> 01:52:26.574]  Infowarscore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:26.574 --> 01:52:27.154]  888-253-3139.
[01:52:27.154 --> 01:52:30.996]  You can call and our crew will answer all your questions.
[01:52:30.996 --> 01:52:33.417]  Never forget, X2 is so essential as well.
[01:52:33.417 --> 01:52:34.498]  The good halogen.
[01:52:34.498 --> 01:52:44.903]  All right, hour number three with Steve Quayle and more.
[01:52:44.903 --> 01:52:46.063]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:52:46.063 --> 01:52:46.884]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:52:46.884 --> 01:52:47.804]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:52:50.647 --> 01:52:51.668]  I love your products.
[01:52:51.668 --> 01:53:02.373]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[01:53:02.373 --> 01:53:08.377]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[01:53:08.377 --> 01:53:09.397]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[01:53:11.678 --> 01:53:19.381]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[01:53:19.381 --> 01:53:28.145]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[01:53:28.145 --> 01:53:28.966]  This is working.
[01:53:28.966 --> 01:53:29.966]  This is wonderful.
[01:53:29.966 --> 01:53:34.488]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[01:53:34.488 --> 01:53:39.130]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[01:53:41.934 --> 01:53:45.777]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:53:45.777 --> 01:53:50.099]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:53:50.099 --> 01:53:58.645]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:53:58.885 --> 01:54:15.574]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:54:15.574 --> 01:54:24.499]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[01:54:24.719 --> 01:54:26.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:54:57.774 --> 01:55:03.420]  Alright folks, we got Steve Quayle coming up and I want to air two Tucker clips back-to-back because what he's doing...
[01:55:04.088 --> 01:55:05.709]  He is truly revolutionary.
[01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:14.917]  He exposes it's time to push back on the mask hoax, the abuse of children, and to say no to the left that wants to bully us into submission and taking untested vaccines.
[01:55:14.917 --> 01:55:19.941]  And then he gets into the fact that Biden is making no decisions and is a total and complete puppet.
[01:55:19.941 --> 01:55:21.823]  And then Steve Quayle's coming up next segment.
[01:55:21.823 --> 01:55:23.645]  Infowars.com.
[01:55:23.645 --> 01:55:24.946]  Newswars.com.
[01:55:24.946 --> 01:55:25.947]  Band.video.
[01:55:25.947 --> 01:55:27.067]  Tomorrow's News.
[01:55:27.067 --> 01:55:27.428]  Today.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:31.921]  Masks prevent intimacy and human contact.
[01:55:31.921 --> 01:55:35.082]  If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[01:55:35.082 --> 01:55:36.662]  Masks are for the guilty.
[01:55:36.662 --> 01:55:39.343]  They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[01:55:39.343 --> 01:55:42.984]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public.
[01:55:42.984 --> 01:55:45.704]  Only Klansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[01:55:45.704 --> 01:55:46.845]  The rest of us showed our face.
[01:55:46.845 --> 01:55:48.785]  We were free people.
[01:55:48.785 --> 01:55:57.087]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti, and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year, and it's still going on.
[01:55:58.288 --> 01:56:02.912]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[01:56:02.912 --> 01:56:08.616]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience, like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[01:56:08.616 --> 01:56:10.538]  We wear them because we have to.
[01:56:10.538 --> 01:56:15.022]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics.
[01:56:15.022 --> 01:56:16.563]  How neurotic are they?
[01:56:16.563 --> 01:56:17.664]  Well, we know.
[01:56:17.664 --> 01:56:27.792]  A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[01:56:28.573 --> 01:56:32.094]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[01:56:32.094 --> 01:56:40.055]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask, angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[01:56:40.055 --> 01:56:41.075]  How could you?
[01:56:41.075 --> 01:56:43.056]  They're saying from behind the gauze.
[01:56:43.056 --> 01:56:44.236]  How could you?
[01:56:44.236 --> 01:56:47.637]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[01:56:47.637 --> 01:56:49.777]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first.
[01:56:49.777 --> 01:56:51.037]  They're the aggressors.
[01:56:51.037 --> 01:56:54.698]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[01:56:55.583 --> 01:57:00.106]  So next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[01:57:00.106 --> 01:57:01.587]  Ask politely but firmly.
[01:57:01.587 --> 01:57:03.728]  Would you please take off your mask?
[01:57:03.728 --> 01:57:06.410]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:09.892]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[01:57:09.892 --> 01:57:17.677]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble in an elevator.
[01:57:17.677 --> 01:57:18.718]  It's repulsive.
[01:57:18.718 --> 01:57:20.659]  Don't do it around other people.
[01:57:20.659 --> 01:57:22.320]  That's the message we should send because it's true.
[01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:27.053]  As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[01:57:27.053 --> 01:57:34.140]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart.
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:35.781]  Call the police immediately.
[01:57:35.781 --> 01:57:37.723]  Contact Child Protective Services.
[01:57:37.723 --> 01:57:39.925]  Keep calling until someone arrives.
[01:57:39.925 --> 01:57:45.170]  What you're looking at is abuse, it's child abuse, and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[01:57:45.931 --> 01:57:55.418]  If it's your own children being abused, then- I have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president, who you just heard from, Kamala Harris.
[01:57:55.418 --> 01:58:00.482]  Kamala, Doug, like it or not, you're family.
[01:58:00.482 --> 01:58:02.604]  You become an honorary Biden, there's no way out.
[01:58:04.992 --> 01:58:11.597]  So that was Joe Biden referring to somebody called Doug Emhoff, whom he described as the husband of Kamala Harris.
[01:58:11.597 --> 01:58:13.859]  And we took that all at face value because we're naive.
[01:58:13.859 --> 01:58:15.981]  But we have some breaking reporting to bring you tonight.
[01:58:15.981 --> 01:58:20.324]  It comes courtesy of a blog from Northern Virginia called Politico.
[01:58:20.324 --> 01:58:23.487]  Six reporters from Politico worked on this story.
[01:58:23.487 --> 01:58:29.832]  The piece has this headline, Doug Emhoff rebrands as Second Gentleman Douglas.
[01:58:29.832 --> 01:58:30.713]  According to Politico,
[01:58:31.573 --> 01:58:33.314]  Doug Emhoff is now going by Douglas.
[01:58:33.314 --> 01:58:38.195]  As you'd expect, the White House is trying to downplay this bombshell change.
[01:58:38.195 --> 01:58:44.658]  A spokesperson for Emhoff told Politico the story was, quote, bizarre, and that, quote, his name is Douglas Emhoff.
[01:58:44.658 --> 01:58:50.360]  Safe to say, like most people, his full and abbreviated names have always been used interchangeably.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.540]  What does that mean, exactly?
[01:58:53.254 --> 01:58:55.215]  One editorial note, by the way, before we continue.
[01:58:55.215 --> 01:59:04.357]  This show, in the interest of accuracy, will cease referring to the White House or anything associated with it, the entire executive branch of government, as the, quote, Biden administration.
[01:59:04.357 --> 01:59:09.218]  And the reason we're changing is not to make a statement, but merely to reflect reality.
[01:59:09.218 --> 01:59:14.319]  Joe Biden, whatever his merits as a human being, has no active role in running the U.S.
[01:59:14.319 --> 01:59:14.799]  government.
[01:59:14.799 --> 01:59:15.639]  Everyone knows that.
[01:59:15.639 --> 01:59:17.380]  Everyone pretends otherwise.
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:17.900]  But it's true.
[01:59:18.917 --> 01:59:30.283]  And so, henceforth, we will refer to it as the administration, the White House, the Kamala Harris administration, the third and former radical Obama administration, this group of people that Susan Rice seems to be in control of, or whatever.
[01:59:30.283 --> 01:59:31.043]  Something precise.
[01:59:31.043 --> 01:59:31.304]  That's right.
[01:59:31.304 --> 01:59:32.284]  It's the third Obama administration.
[01:59:32.284 --> 01:59:34.986]  We won't refer to it as the Biden administration because it's not.
[01:59:34.986 --> 01:59:37.187]  It was O'Biden, now it's Harris.
[01:59:37.187 --> 01:59:38.067]  Hey, Sean Hannity here.
[01:59:38.067 --> 01:59:40.068]  Hey, click here to subscribe.
[01:59:40.068 --> 01:59:41.169]  Yes, Hannity, we will.
[01:59:41.169 --> 01:59:46.952]  Alright, we're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to come back with Steve Quayle on the other side.
[01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:50.252]  He's got a lot to cover, a lot to get to.
[01:59:50.252 --> 01:59:54.177]  The entire New World Order system is about making you dependent.
[01:59:54.177 --> 01:59:55.238]  Making you obsolete.
[01:59:55.238 --> 01:59:58.381]  Making you a domesticated animal they control.
[01:59:58.381 --> 01:59:59.623]  They want to censor you.
[01:59:59.623 --> 02:00:00.464]  They want to dumb you down.
[02:00:00.464 --> 02:00:01.565]  They want to poison you.
[02:00:01.565 --> 02:00:04.729]  And they want to control your ability to take care of yourself.
[02:00:05.828 --> 02:00:10.309]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the InfoWar more than ever.

[02:00:47.212 --> 02:00:47.953]  Get your food now!
[02:00:52.729 --> 02:01:06.772]  We are now into our number three.
[02:01:06.772 --> 02:01:21.816]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and the great Steve Quayle, best-selling author, filmmaker, one of the first big survivalists, one of the top survivalists out there, and I would read his books 25 years ago, 20 years ago, and say quite entertaining, and I knew a lot of it was true, but I thought some of the
[02:01:24.272 --> 02:01:27.015]  Some of the conclusions he came to were a little extreme.
[02:01:27.015 --> 02:01:33.463]  Well, now it looks like he's been dead on and he wrote books about the fake alien invasion.
[02:01:33.463 --> 02:01:36.807]  Now it's in every newspaper everywhere that aliens are about to attack.
[02:01:36.807 --> 02:01:40.352]  The Washington Post, CNN, obviously it's going to be a fake invasion.
[02:01:41.112 --> 02:01:46.597]  You've got the Globalist admitting, oh, we're taking DMT in laboratories and connecting to other dimensions.
[02:01:46.597 --> 02:01:48.138]  You might call them spirits.
[02:01:48.138 --> 02:01:49.419]  This is all mainstream news.
[02:01:49.419 --> 02:01:51.420]  They're like, yes, we want to have sex with children.
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:53.142]  Yes, animal and human clones are real.
[02:01:53.142 --> 02:01:54.503]  Yes, we want the blood of children.
[02:01:54.503 --> 02:01:55.684]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:01:55.684 --> 02:01:57.425]  And everybody's like, Alex Jones is right, Alex Jones is right.
[02:01:57.425 --> 02:02:03.310]  Well, Steve Quayle was right when it came to that hardcore stuff before even I was.
[02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:04.230]  And so he's here with us.
[02:02:04.230 --> 02:02:07.493]  I want to cover the waterfront, the limited time we have with him.
[02:02:08.616 --> 02:02:11.779]  And he wants to get into the vaccine shedding that medical doctors warned of.
[02:02:11.779 --> 02:02:12.639]  It's now happening.
[02:02:12.639 --> 02:02:17.523]  Even NPR had scientists on six months ago saying, we're worried about MNR vaccines.
[02:02:17.523 --> 02:02:20.706]  They're not vaccines that will cause real viruses to come out of the cells.
[02:02:20.706 --> 02:02:21.947]  Well, now that's happening.
[02:02:21.947 --> 02:02:24.329]  So this is a very diabolical plan.
[02:02:24.329 --> 02:02:27.271]  But look at some of these articles if you're a TV viewer.
[02:02:27.271 --> 02:02:30.213]  This is confirmed.
[02:02:30.213 --> 02:02:34.317]  Sky TV ran the news a year ago.
[02:02:34.317 --> 02:02:36.999]  At least 11 dead and 1,000 taken ill after gas leak.
[02:02:37.885 --> 02:02:43.309]  In India, and then now here's the same photo, the same woman, same sequence.
[02:02:43.309 --> 02:02:45.691]  Covid surge swallowing people in India.
[02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:47.872]  Footage shows people dead in the streets.
[02:02:47.872 --> 02:02:52.155]  We now know they showed in China old footage of disasters, chemical plants blowing up, you name it.
[02:02:52.155 --> 02:02:53.136]  People falling in the streets.
[02:02:53.777 --> 02:02:56.058]  To create the fear surge to get the vaccine.
[02:02:56.058 --> 02:02:59.439]  But now they're saying only 15% have really got it in the U.S.
[02:02:59.439 --> 02:03:01.520]  We're the most vaccinated in the world now.
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:03.400]  They say 60% might take it later.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.242]  So that's how you hear the number 60% have taken it or are thinking about it.
[02:03:07.242 --> 02:03:09.483]  No, they've hit a brick wall in India.
[02:03:09.483 --> 02:03:13.004]  The head spokesperson that's a movie star there said take the vaccine.
[02:03:13.004 --> 02:03:14.645]  He died a day later of a heart attack.
[02:03:14.645 --> 02:03:15.845]  That's in the literature.
[02:03:15.845 --> 02:03:18.146]  So the wheels are coming off of this.
[02:03:18.146 --> 02:03:18.546]  Meanwhile,
[02:03:19.514 --> 02:03:27.596]  Biden has announced he's going to dump the experimental AstraZeneca, banned in 21 European countries, banned in the Philippines, banned in a bunch of other places, on them.
[02:03:27.596 --> 02:03:31.577]  Not even approved experimentally here in the US, he's going to dump that on them.
[02:03:31.577 --> 02:03:33.937]  The media calls it a wonderful thing.
[02:03:33.937 --> 02:03:38.238]  So this is a giant experiment in evil, but isn't our dictator nice?
[02:03:38.238 --> 02:03:42.259]  He says, we can not wear our mask and we're by ourselves outside now.
[02:03:42.259 --> 02:03:44.740]  Isn't he nice to tell us that we don't have to wear his little burka?
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:45.360]  So Steve Quayle,
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:49.361]  We really appreciate you joining us from SteveQuill.com.
[02:03:49.361 --> 02:03:50.242]  So much to talk about.
[02:03:50.242 --> 02:03:54.663]  We also sell a bunch of your incredible Big Coffee Table lavish books.
[02:03:54.663 --> 02:03:57.524]  They're not just amazing reads, great photos and graphics.
[02:03:57.524 --> 02:04:01.546]  They're just beautiful books at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:04:01.546 --> 02:04:05.927]  You're always telling us tomorrow's news today, and you were right about everything that's now happened.
[02:04:05.927 --> 02:04:07.428]  Tell us what's coming next, my friend.
[02:04:08.695 --> 02:04:20.525]  Well, I think, Alex, the global extinction plan that you and I and others have written about, detailed, podcasting, broadcasting 25 years, is now in full force and full effect.
[02:04:20.525 --> 02:04:35.158]  And, you know, when we talk about the word extinction, just a few of those articles you put up there, isn't it interesting that the side effects of the mutagenic injection, I won't call it the V word, okay, is now spreading to even 80 and 90 year old women
[02:04:35.438 --> 02:04:37.659]  By the way, you talked about that a month ago.
[02:04:37.659 --> 02:04:40.040]  It was in the Chicago Tribune last week.
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:40.840]  This is happening!
[02:04:49.654 --> 02:04:50.415]  It is!
[02:04:50.415 --> 02:04:52.437]  And ladies and gentlemen, one thing is interesting.
[02:04:52.437 --> 02:04:57.443]  Alex, you and I spoke about the Deagle Report when it first came out probably 10 years ago.
[02:04:57.443 --> 02:05:08.517]  And after the vaccine was released, somebody ordered the sanitation of the Deagle Report not to show the 250 million people, Americans, that would be dead by the year 2025.
[02:05:10.058 --> 02:05:23.464]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is, is that everything you're seeing concerning this mutagenic, in other words, genetic mutating injection, is designed to kill humanity.
[02:05:23.464 --> 02:05:28.386]  They're not just happy with right now killing as many people as they can, but it's
[02:05:28.846 --> 02:05:31.087]  Total extinction of the human race.
[02:05:31.087 --> 02:05:33.928]  And Alex, that's not metaphor.
[02:05:33.928 --> 02:05:35.669]  That's not scare tactics.
[02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:36.729]  That's not fear porn.
[02:05:36.729 --> 02:05:38.190]  It's right there.
[02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:45.533]  A mother gives birth to a baby and she nurses it for the first time and the baby's basically dead within five hours.
[02:05:45.533 --> 02:05:49.154]  And here's what I think... Oh, by the way, now they admit, don't take the shot of your breastfeeding.
[02:05:49.154 --> 02:05:50.414]  So they admit it's killing babies.
[02:05:50.414 --> 02:05:51.535]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:56.892]  They only cover their ass while they're trying to chew ours off, okay?
[02:05:56.892 --> 02:05:59.433]  And I mean in a permanent... Yeah, explain how that works.
[02:05:59.433 --> 02:06:00.313]  It's the fine print.
[02:06:00.313 --> 02:06:03.435]  They're warning you what they're doing so they metaphysically have a way out.
[02:06:04.488 --> 02:06:19.718]  Yeah, and also, remember, they always want plausible deniability, but I also think it's the mocking of humanity when the devil tells you he's going to do this, he's going to do it this way, he does it that way, and everybody scratches their head and goes, gee, there's nothing sinister about this.
[02:06:19.718 --> 02:06:30.585]  I think that the whole issue right now that's on the forefront of the world stage is we now have before us genetically articulated and targeted
[02:06:31.664 --> 02:06:32.224]  You said it here.
[02:06:32.224 --> 02:06:35.025]  You're talking about race-specific bioweapons.
[02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:59.390]  Yes, and so thanks for telling me so many things.
[02:06:59.390 --> 02:07:04.731]  The thing is, is that ladies and gentlemen, this technology, you can look at Project Coast.
[02:07:04.731 --> 02:07:09.372]  I've been on with Alex all these years, even when we talked about Ebola, and watched a miracle.
[02:07:09.372 --> 02:07:13.433]  That was a miracle when everybody was flipping out that Ebola was coming to the United States.
[02:07:13.433 --> 02:07:16.114]  They recycled this stuff, and I think people have got to
[02:07:16.634 --> 02:07:26.224]  Get a hold of their fear and say, there is no scientific basis for me to take an experimental mutagenic injection.
[02:07:26.224 --> 02:07:28.105]  The word V isn't interesting.
[02:07:28.105 --> 02:07:35.373]  We had the V movement of women wearing things on their head, but now we've got the I moment of injections.
[02:07:35.373 --> 02:07:37.735]  And this is what's really important.
[02:07:38.195 --> 02:07:40.616]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is all about one thing.
[02:07:40.616 --> 02:07:48.939]  It's about the depopulation of the world from 7.9 billion to 500 million, and that's where we're at right now.
[02:07:48.939 --> 02:08:00.343]  And I don't care, you know, in America, one lying scientist backed up by two more lying scientists and backed up by an organization that's wrong, wrong, wrong.
[02:08:00.343 --> 02:08:01.904]  How can anybody believe these?
[02:08:01.904 --> 02:08:04.925]  The mask of death, the mask of the beast, the mark of the beast,
[02:08:05.385 --> 02:08:06.666]  And the murder by the beast.
[02:08:06.666 --> 02:08:16.594]  And now we're seeing anybody who dares question the MSM propaganda organ being considered persona non grata terrorists.
[02:08:16.594 --> 02:08:19.717]  And we're seeing the DHS purging any conservatives.
[02:08:19.717 --> 02:08:20.898]  We're seeing the U.S.
[02:08:20.898 --> 02:08:21.378]  military.
[02:08:21.378 --> 02:08:22.339]  It's interesting.
[02:08:22.339 --> 02:08:25.182]  Russia's preparing for war like no other time.
[02:08:25.182 --> 02:08:33.969]  And yet the bottom line is our military's hierarchy is more concerned with political correctness than battlefield tactics and preparedness.
[02:08:34.449 --> 02:08:42.535]  And Alex, we're watching right now the absolute embracing of insanity.
[02:08:42.535 --> 02:08:48.258]  The commercial where you see all these people running into a hole, I forget which company that was for, that's where they're going.
[02:08:48.258 --> 02:08:51.781]  The lendings are on hyperdrive, overdrive.
[02:08:51.781 --> 02:08:54.883]  And now I want people to understand, when you hear the word carbon footprint,
[02:08:55.363 --> 02:08:57.265]  I want you to understand this.
[02:08:57.265 --> 02:09:02.250]  That is Luciferian talk for destroying humanity.
[02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:04.652]  You are the carbon footprint.
[02:09:04.652 --> 02:09:10.138]  And in your place, having written about singularity, having written about transhumanism,
[02:09:10.658 --> 02:09:12.258]  Two and a half decades ago?
[02:09:12.258 --> 02:09:13.399]  The bottom line is here.
[02:09:13.399 --> 02:09:19.400]  So when you hear these euphemistic and these flowery statements that we've got to lower the carbon footprint.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.860]  It's just like Mike Adams says.
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:23.981]  These guys want to destroy photosynthesis.
[02:09:23.981 --> 02:09:26.121]  Bill Gates... And let me back you up again.
[02:09:26.121 --> 02:09:26.601]  Exactly.
[02:09:26.601 --> 02:09:34.183]  Bill Gates famously said at the TED Talk, we've got to reduce this number to zero and laser-pointed the human population and they all laugh because they're in on it.
[02:09:34.183 --> 02:09:36.623]  This is a sick, post-human Satan cult.
[02:09:37.808 --> 02:09:38.509]  It is!
[02:09:38.509 --> 02:09:41.792]  And that is who is orchestrating it.
[02:09:41.792 --> 02:09:48.557]  The kings of the earth, biblically, give their power, that means their authority, that means their finances, unto the beast.
[02:09:48.557 --> 02:09:50.920]  And the beast is starting to manifest.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:59.647]  Look, we're hearing all of the newest levels of spyware and trackware maintain humanity under 500 million perpetual balance with nature.
[02:09:59.647 --> 02:10:02.590]  By the way, they always try and assume
[02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:07.494]  That imaginary people put the money behind that.
[02:10:07.494 --> 02:10:16.623]  I can tell you this, you can probably guess the two leading eugenicists in the world, and those are the guys that put the money up to it, though they use cut-offs and everything.
[02:10:16.623 --> 02:10:19.686]  So here's the thing that people have got to understand.
[02:10:19.686 --> 02:10:24.711]  You have now, in your face, contempt for the human race.
[02:10:25.524 --> 02:10:27.987]  And we need carbon removal.
[02:10:27.987 --> 02:10:29.789]  Well, what is he made of?
[02:10:29.789 --> 02:10:32.291]  Well, I know what he's made of, but I'll say this.
[02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:33.833]  Is he a synthetic life form?
[02:10:33.833 --> 02:10:36.636]  And the word synth, S-Y-N-T-H.
[02:10:36.636 --> 02:10:38.698]  That's what people are trading.
[02:10:38.698 --> 02:10:42.563]  A lot of these guys, they, by the way, they pledge their allegiance.
[02:10:42.563 --> 02:10:44.685]  They pledge everything to Lord Lucifer.
[02:10:44.685 --> 02:10:45.025]  They do.
[02:10:45.025 --> 02:10:46.907]  We'll talk about that and who they are when we come back.
[02:10:46.907 --> 02:10:47.328]  Stay with us.
[02:10:47.848 --> 02:10:56.835]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[02:10:56.835 --> 02:11:02.019]  That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler, and of course the rest is history.
[02:11:02.019 --> 02:11:07.343]  Our film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms.
[02:11:07.343 --> 02:11:12.907]  Sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts, it's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy.
[02:11:13.948 --> 02:11:14.568]  We're good to go.

[02:12:15.738 --> 02:12:21.602]  And many of these products have been sold out for months and months and months because of the COVID shutdowns and lockdowns have destroyed the supply chain.
[02:12:21.602 --> 02:12:22.903]  But finally, they're back in stock.
[02:12:22.903 --> 02:12:25.806]  So that's the Cavalry for InfoWars as well and our funding.
[02:12:25.806 --> 02:12:27.587]  All these products are back in stock and they're 50% off.

[02:13:13.286 --> 02:13:17.109]  Alright, you talk about being simpatico here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:18.610]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:13:18.610 --> 02:13:23.172]  I was about to come back and ask him about the robot element takeover.
[02:13:23.172 --> 02:13:29.376]  Replacing us, making us obsolete, getting rid of the military, making it all robots, that way globalists control everything.
[02:13:29.376 --> 02:13:30.436]  Well, here it is.
[02:13:30.436 --> 02:13:31.437]  Big changes to U.S.
[02:13:31.437 --> 02:13:31.857]  Marines.
[02:13:31.857 --> 02:13:34.359]  No tanks, fewer people, and many more drones.
[02:13:34.359 --> 02:13:36.680]  They went by 2030, almost no humans involved.
[02:13:37.432 --> 02:13:42.873]  Air Force Base Deploys Pack of Robot Dogs to Enhance Security.
[02:13:42.873 --> 02:13:47.814]  Farming Robot Kills 100,000 Weeds Per Hour with Lasers.

[02:13:58.076 --> 02:14:01.637]  NATO Tees Up Negotiations on Artificial Intelligence in Weapons.
[02:14:02.885 --> 02:14:05.688]  It is the takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:05.688 --> 02:14:08.971]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[02:14:08.971 --> 02:14:11.513]  That's where you wanted to go, and that was actually the stack I had.
[02:14:11.513 --> 02:14:18.139]  Alex, here's something that everyone needs to put into perspective.
[02:14:18.926 --> 02:14:23.209]  The replacement of humans is in the headlines.
[02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:29.132]  Every single one of those stories that you've just shown with your overhead camera is what's in play.
[02:14:29.132 --> 02:14:37.678]  But when you get into the military, you get into the 1992 movie that was the sci-fi world's telling us about universal soldiers, super soldiers.
[02:14:37.678 --> 02:14:40.940]  And one of the problems right now is when China announced
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:55.239]  The combining of a chimpanzee and a human embryo, the bottom line is that was done by Stalin, or at least attempted, almost 70 years ago.
[02:14:55.239 --> 02:14:58.944]  But the advancement in genetic killing machines,
[02:14:59.464 --> 02:15:02.005]  Today's technology, tomorrow's monsters.
[02:15:02.005 --> 02:15:04.386]  Genetic Armageddon is here.
[02:15:04.386 --> 02:15:07.087]  And now, that's not just a troop.
[02:15:07.087 --> 02:15:11.709]  The Terminator troops in China, they have no Western moral constraints.
[02:15:11.709 --> 02:15:24.214]  I've talked to guys, I'm sure you have too, that literally suffer from PTSD, and these are some of the toughest men in the world, ex-Delta, ex-Seals, ex-Ultra Black, meaning people don't even know they exist.
[02:15:24.214 --> 02:15:26.495]  But they've seen things that absolutely
[02:15:27.095 --> 02:15:27.576]  No.
[02:15:27.576 --> 02:15:29.498]  Oh, I've told the stories of people who make jokes.
[02:15:29.498 --> 02:15:35.383]  I've talked to people, and so have you, that have seen human fish, human rats with human heads.
[02:15:35.383 --> 02:15:40.108]  I mean, this has been going on for at least 50 years, and people think we're just saying that.
[02:15:40.108 --> 02:15:41.389]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:15:41.389 --> 02:15:47.575]  Mainstream news showed monkey humans that have, like, monkey heads and human bodies last week.
[02:15:47.575 --> 02:15:48.356]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:48.356 --> 02:15:50.338]  And see, here, ladies and gentlemen, this is critical.
[02:15:51.383 --> 02:16:09.097]  The evidence is overwhelming, but contrary to just the effects of denialism, and mostly Americans, we've lost our freedoms because so many people were looking, saying, well, it's not going to happen in my lifetime, it's not going to happen in my children's lifetime.
[02:16:09.097 --> 02:16:11.959]  No, it's happening right now, and it's beyond this.
[02:16:11.959 --> 02:16:16.843]  Alex, I interviewed one of the Intel World's most famous assassins.
[02:16:16.843 --> 02:16:17.283]  He died
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:19.301]  Fifteen years ago.
[02:16:19.301 --> 02:16:31.129]  And he said, Steve, I've been in a laboratory, some of the most secret places in the deep underwater, in the jungles, in Borneo, the island of Dr. Merola.
[02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:36.332]  He said, I've seen I've seen things in cages, half human, half lion.
[02:16:36.332 --> 02:16:40.174]  By the way, the lion men of Moab is literally in the Old Testament.
[02:16:40.174 --> 02:16:43.657]  But he said these creatures were calling out to me in a human voice.
[02:16:43.657 --> 02:16:44.257]  Help me.
[02:16:44.257 --> 02:16:44.758]  Help me.
[02:16:44.758 --> 02:16:45.778]  I'm human.
[02:16:45.778 --> 02:16:46.859]  And he started to weep.
[02:16:47.515 --> 02:16:49.657]  This is a CIA guy, and he started to weep.
[02:16:49.657 --> 02:16:56.464]  He says, Steve, they weren't human, but there was a human component that was begging me to help, and there was no help for them.
[02:16:56.464 --> 02:17:00.127]  That stuff makes a stick in my spirit.
[02:17:00.127 --> 02:17:02.570]  I wrote about it in Genetic Armageddon.
[02:17:02.570 --> 02:17:03.891]  There are no limits now.
[02:17:03.891 --> 02:17:07.875]  Well, also explain how much that pisses God off, because this is what happened in the days of Noah.
[02:17:08.877 --> 02:17:09.838]  Absolutely.
[02:17:09.838 --> 02:17:13.840]  And ladies and gentlemen, that the whole Earth was corrupted genetically.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:33.189]  You know, people gotta understand what the difference between, let's say, my position, the ancient alien's position, is my position is the fallen angels, a third of them, came to Earth, basically had sex with Earth women, this is before Noah's flood, and corrupt the entire gene pool of the planet.
[02:17:33.189 --> 02:17:34.530]  Now we are seeing
[02:17:34.710 --> 02:17:41.114]  And by the way, that's in the Book of Enoch that people used to say wasn't true, and then they tried to suppress the Dead Sea Scrolls, but it got leaked out.
[02:17:41.114 --> 02:17:44.176]  I've talked to some of the folks that are involved, and it's all in there.
[02:17:44.176 --> 02:17:46.097]  So they got 2,000-year-old scrolls saying that.
[02:17:47.102 --> 02:17:47.923]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:17:47.923 --> 02:17:49.064]  They're finding new ones.
[02:17:49.064 --> 02:18:01.738]  By the way, the book of Enoch, and also the book of Giants, and I know that people have a hard time with this, but ladies and gentlemen, the amount of evidence now that the same... I told everybody this.
[02:18:01.738 --> 02:18:03.039]  I'm going to change real quick.
[02:18:03.039 --> 02:18:06.483]  The Human Genome Project was to identify
[02:18:06.923 --> 02:18:12.468]  The DNA of the fallen angels, when they had sex with earth women, they produced a hybrid.
[02:18:12.468 --> 02:18:18.052]  Those hybrids became the mighty men of renown, the gods the ancient worlds worshipped.
[02:18:18.052 --> 02:18:24.797]  And obviously, now, we're coming to that point where we're messing with genetics and God's creation.
[02:18:24.797 --> 02:18:31.523]  That's why Jesus said, just as in the days of Noah, so would it be in those days leading up to the second coming.
[02:18:31.523 --> 02:18:33.825]  The war is against humanity.
[02:18:33.825 --> 02:18:35.246]  They'll use Terminator robots,
[02:18:35.506 --> 02:18:37.787]  They'll use genetic constructs.
[02:18:37.787 --> 02:18:39.747]  They will use animals.
[02:18:39.747 --> 02:18:42.108]  Bottom line, this is an alien takeover.
[02:18:42.108 --> 02:18:43.828]  The Bible warned us it's genetic.
[02:18:43.828 --> 02:18:46.449]  They don't come in with spaceships and blow us up at first.
[02:18:46.449 --> 02:18:55.291]  They just come in, dumb us down, poison us, fry us with 5G, and then whoever resists, then they roll in AI weapons to kill off who's resisting.
[02:18:55.291 --> 02:18:58.472]  Right, and I'm going to deal with AI because you just mentioned it.
[02:18:58.472 --> 02:19:01.293]  The thing that people need to understand about AI
[02:19:02.595 --> 02:19:04.817]  Is, you know, artificial intelligence.
[02:19:04.817 --> 02:19:06.158]  But I take it one step further.
[02:19:06.158 --> 02:19:11.743]  I said, look, AI could not exist if it wasn't for alien implants.
[02:19:11.743 --> 02:19:13.725]  And I want to tell you what I mean.
[02:19:13.725 --> 02:19:19.389]  The whole genre of the late 50s Hollywood science fiction movies were leading us.
[02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:21.411]  The infamous invaders from Mars.
[02:19:21.411 --> 02:19:23.072]  A little boy sees a flying saucer crash.
[02:19:23.072 --> 02:19:29.478]  They put an implant in the back of the people in the military and everybody's skulls and they start acting different.
[02:19:29.918 --> 02:19:42.386]  But the AI, the alien implant, was a semi or a non-organic material interfacing, excuse me, in replacing the organic material.
[02:19:42.386 --> 02:19:50.932]  So in essence, it's a perfect combination of a pre-programmed operating system taking over the human operating system.
[02:19:50.932 --> 02:19:54.194]  And what are we hearing right now about even the head of Moderna?
[02:19:54.594 --> 02:19:57.596]  Making, bragging, it's an operating system.
[02:19:57.596 --> 02:20:07.424]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have been so... Schwab said in the next 10 years, we're not changing the environment, we're changing your DNA, we're taking you over, merging with you.
[02:20:07.424 --> 02:20:11.467]  And he's sitting there with all the Hollywood stars clapping, this is literally a takeover, it's all admitted!
[02:20:12.772 --> 02:20:15.253]  And Alex, I've got to keep saying this word.
[02:20:15.253 --> 02:20:20.095]  It is the extinction protocols of the human race.
[02:20:20.095 --> 02:20:22.656]  Thank you for whoever found that.
[02:20:22.656 --> 02:20:26.157]  That is the invaders from Mars 1956 or whatever.
[02:20:26.157 --> 02:20:34.780]  The thing that people have got to understand, and this is it, how can we be scared into going against everything we know to be true,
[02:20:35.669 --> 02:20:46.015]  That take away all of our rights, put us into solitary confinement, which was the cruelest mental torture, put on the, you know, the nonsensical mask, the mask of the beast.
[02:20:46.015 --> 02:20:53.519]  The thing is, is that, and expect, expect that somebody at some point isn't going to be questioning us.
[02:20:53.519 --> 02:20:56.000]  And the mask of the beast leads to the mark of the beast.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.883]  And now the statement all over the world is, what is this
[02:21:01.603 --> 02:21:04.704]  Neutrogenic injection is going to do to our DNA.
[02:21:04.704 --> 02:21:13.247]  You've got to remember, the guy pushing the vaccines, pushing, cutting off the sky, darkening the sky.
[02:21:13.247 --> 02:21:14.527]  Bill Gates, the sun.
[02:21:14.527 --> 02:21:14.887]  It's him.
[02:21:14.887 --> 02:21:16.508]  It's just everywhere.
[02:21:16.508 --> 02:21:17.328]  It's everywhere.
[02:21:17.328 --> 02:21:19.049]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's extinction.
[02:21:19.049 --> 02:21:19.769]  Now Oregon
[02:21:20.922 --> 02:21:27.984]  Who, by the way, is having so many earthquakes up and down its entire coast that something's going to give very soon, Alex.
[02:21:27.984 --> 02:21:28.824]  Something's going to give.
[02:21:28.824 --> 02:21:31.705]  We're talking 600 earthquakes a day, swarming.
[02:21:31.705 --> 02:21:32.805]  But here's the deal.
[02:21:32.805 --> 02:21:33.185]  Hold on.
[02:21:33.185 --> 02:21:33.805]  Stay there again.
[02:21:33.805 --> 02:21:35.085]  Let's come back to that.
[02:21:35.085 --> 02:21:36.726]  Folks, it's all happening.
[02:21:36.726 --> 02:21:37.586]  I mean, it's totally insane.
[02:21:37.586 --> 02:21:41.087]  And then they'll be in the National News going, Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:21:41.087 --> 02:21:42.787]  This is a normal vaccine.
[02:21:42.787 --> 02:21:44.007]  It's not anything.
[02:21:44.007 --> 02:21:46.268]  It doesn't... Meanwhile, they admit it's totally experimental.
[02:21:47.145 --> 02:21:54.474]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and for worse is that.
[02:21:54.474 --> 02:21:57.757]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[02:21:57.757 --> 02:22:00.060]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:06.888]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:22:07.731 --> 02:22:10.112]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:22:10.112 --> 02:22:15.733]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:22:15.733 --> 02:22:18.894]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[02:22:18.894 --> 02:22:21.654]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:22:21.654 --> 02:22:25.015]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[02:22:25.015 --> 02:22:30.617]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:22:30.617 --> 02:22:32.357]  We have the power.
[02:22:32.357 --> 02:22:35.678]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:42.216]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[02:22:42.216 --> 02:22:43.357]  So be the polar bears you are.
[02:22:47.791 --> 02:22:52.132]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[02:22:52.132 --> 02:23:02.735]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.

[02:24:48.539 --> 02:24:55.125]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[02:24:55.125 --> 02:24:57.447]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S.
[02:24:57.447 --> 02:25:07.417]  injected healthy men, women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[02:25:08.479 --> 02:25:12.541]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, is one of the most important films ever made.
[02:25:12.541 --> 02:25:19.585]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[02:25:19.585 --> 02:25:21.246]  The film now is more important than ever.
[02:25:21.246 --> 02:25:24.008]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[02:25:24.008 --> 02:25:31.132]  We have it back in print, available now at Infowarsstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk.
[02:25:31.132 --> 02:25:34.314]  And there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet, you can make copies.
[02:25:34.494 --> 02:25:35.996]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[02:25:35.996 --> 02:25:37.858]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[02:25:37.858 --> 02:25:38.599]  1776 Worldwide.
[02:25:38.599 --> 02:25:39.740]  1776 Worldwide.
[02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:40.481]  INGATE.
[02:25:40.481 --> 02:25:42.523]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:25:42.523 --> 02:25:50.393]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:25:50.393 --> 02:25:52.996]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:12.828 --> 02:26:18.869]  John the Revelator being proven right, despite what Depeche Mode has to say about him.
[02:26:18.869 --> 02:26:22.590]  If he wasn't saying something true, they wouldn't be upset.
[02:26:22.590 --> 02:26:27.731]  I don't have time to get to this today, but I'll probably shoot a special report on it.
[02:26:27.731 --> 02:26:41.073]  They've had a filmmaker that used to work for Tommy Robinson making the rounds on CNN and other places, who admittedly it turned out was recording people and stuff for Hope Not Hate, that's George Soros, basically ADL, Southern Primary Law Group in the UK.
[02:26:42.051 --> 02:26:53.499]  He came here and interviewed me once for a film, for two hours, had him on as a guest a couple times, and they came out on CNN and said, we met with Alex Jones, he says he's all fake, all his news is fake, and he's lying to everyone.
[02:26:53.499 --> 02:26:58.122]  Really, you don't have the footage like Project Veritas does of CNN saying just that.
[02:26:58.122 --> 02:27:04.527]  You have you saying that, and I'm really considering legal action because, you know, at a certain point, enough is enough.
[02:27:04.527 --> 02:27:08.890]  I know James O'Keefe encouraged me to start suing CNN and others.
[02:27:08.890 --> 02:27:09.971]  It's just incredible.
[02:27:11.781 --> 02:27:17.904]  Like I would sit there behind the scenes and say, let's lie to the public and claim that there's Muslim no-go zones.
[02:27:17.904 --> 02:27:20.305]  That's another talking point the New York Times claimed I did.
[02:27:20.305 --> 02:27:22.526]  There's damn Muslim no-go zones all over the place!
[02:27:22.526 --> 02:27:23.407]  What are you doing?
[02:27:23.407 --> 02:27:27.389]  I mean, it's like, oh, and they work with Veritas to put out fake news.
[02:27:27.389 --> 02:27:31.511]  Oh, and he works with Veritas and with them to put out fake news.
[02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:33.692]  And the CNN guy's all smiling.
[02:27:33.692 --> 02:27:36.113]  I mean, these people are sick.
[02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:38.654]  But it shows how desperate they are.
[02:27:39.315 --> 02:27:41.296]  We don't have to manufacture news like CNN.
[02:27:41.296 --> 02:27:43.618]  We have stacks of insanity.
[02:27:43.618 --> 02:27:45.599]  Stacks of craziness.
[02:27:45.599 --> 02:27:47.661]  All around us.
[02:27:47.661 --> 02:27:52.624]  And it's just... I see the devilishness of these people and the enjoyment in lying.
[02:27:52.624 --> 02:27:54.505]  It's just crazy.
[02:27:54.505 --> 02:27:55.406]  I may cover it later.
[02:27:55.406 --> 02:27:57.907]  It's not even really worth it at a certain point.
[02:27:57.907 --> 02:27:59.168]  But getting back to Steve Quayle.
[02:27:59.168 --> 02:28:00.669]  Steve, I've been ranting here.
[02:28:00.669 --> 02:28:01.870]  You've been making a lot of great points.
[02:28:02.535 --> 02:28:04.796]  What do you think the timetable is of this?
[02:28:04.796 --> 02:28:06.857]  Because I see what Gates is doing.
[02:28:06.857 --> 02:28:08.218]  I see what Swab's doing.
[02:28:08.218 --> 02:28:10.199]  It's like somebody's got a gun to their head.
[02:28:10.199 --> 02:28:11.780]  What they're doing, they're getting caught.
[02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:12.440]  It's coming out.
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:14.181]  Their vaccines are being banned everywhere.
[02:28:14.181 --> 02:28:15.482]  They're not vaccines.
[02:28:15.482 --> 02:28:19.604]  Then they're dumping illegal vaccines that kill a bunch of people, AstraZeneca on India.
[02:28:19.604 --> 02:28:23.946]  I mean, they're just doing villainous, supervillain stuff every hour.
[02:28:23.946 --> 02:28:25.046]  I can't even keep track of it.
[02:28:25.046 --> 02:28:26.167]  What the hell's going on?
[02:28:26.167 --> 02:28:27.948]  Is this the quickening the Bible talks about?
[02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:30.680]  It's accelerating.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:38.443]  Jesus said that the days are going to be shortened for the Alexei, and if God himself didn't shorten the days, there'd be no flesh left alive.
[02:28:38.443 --> 02:28:45.605]  And Alex, everything that you and I are talking about right now has got one goal, one singular purpose.
[02:28:45.605 --> 02:28:48.305]  It doesn't matter who the richest guys in the world are.
[02:28:48.305 --> 02:28:50.206]  They want to get rid of everybody.
[02:28:50.726 --> 02:28:52.407]  But them, okay?
[02:28:52.407 --> 02:28:54.568]  And that's the hardest thing to overcome.
[02:28:54.568 --> 02:29:01.631]  Remember this, ladies and gentlemen, there is no news in the official world of propagandizing.
[02:29:01.631 --> 02:29:06.033]  They turn loose their AI machines on Alex, on me, on others.
[02:29:06.033 --> 02:29:12.656]  They continue to make artificial people, making claims like that guy did.
[02:29:12.656 --> 02:29:15.618]  They put people close to us to misquote us.
[02:29:15.618 --> 02:29:16.198]  That's why, Alex,
[02:29:16.978 --> 02:29:19.100]  I'm tight in my personal circle.
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:24.985]  I mean, if it was, you know, the size of a six inch, now it's down to three inch of people you trust.
[02:29:24.985 --> 02:29:30.049]  Because here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, we turned into a nation of fakes.
[02:29:30.049 --> 02:29:36.294]  And a nation of fakes of spy citizens or citizen spies, it sinks into the dust.
[02:29:36.294 --> 02:29:40.318]  And they just want to get in your office to make up lies and use that as credibility.
[02:29:40.318 --> 02:29:42.880]  We've had infiltrators trying to get in here a bunch.
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:44.061]  Yeah, they're making the criminal move.
[02:29:45.111 --> 02:29:46.353]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:29:46.353 --> 02:29:56.264]  And I don't know about you, but I'm getting this invitation from this, this invitation from that, people from... I'll never do anything with the British ever again.
[02:29:56.264 --> 02:29:58.347]  I made a mistake and went on the BBC once.
[02:29:58.347 --> 02:30:00.049]  Biggest mistake ever made.
[02:30:00.049 --> 02:30:02.832]  But they come in as if they... You know, listen.
[02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:05.251]  We're not stupid.
[02:30:05.251 --> 02:30:07.153]  But they're part of the mouthpiece.
[02:30:07.153 --> 02:30:09.474]  They're part of the organism.
[02:30:09.474 --> 02:30:14.978]  And that organism is a lying global presentation of the agenda.
[02:30:14.978 --> 02:30:16.199]  They're like an anglerfish.
[02:30:16.199 --> 02:30:18.000]  You have this little shiny light up front.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.002]  There's a giant evil mouth right behind it in the dark.
[02:30:21.073 --> 02:30:21.774]  Absolutely.
[02:30:21.774 --> 02:30:25.239]  And exposing the hidden works of darkness.
[02:30:25.239 --> 02:30:32.410]  I think God's presenting, if you will, neon lights showing everybody, hello, wake up people on earth.
[02:30:32.410 --> 02:30:33.872]  This is the devil.
[02:30:33.872 --> 02:30:36.215]  He's out to kill every last one of you.
[02:30:36.836 --> 02:30:38.297]  And here's the problem, Alex.
[02:30:38.297 --> 02:30:45.162]  The preachers, the majority, not all, but the majority of preachers are afraid to touch any of this subject matter.
[02:30:45.162 --> 02:30:51.346]  I saw three of the biggest Christian organizations telling everybody to go and get the vaccine.
[02:30:51.346 --> 02:30:52.806]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:30:52.806 --> 02:30:55.188]  It's a mutagenic injection.
[02:30:55.188 --> 02:30:56.469]  Three of the biggest ones.
[02:30:57.364 --> 02:30:58.525]  They should know better.
[02:30:58.525 --> 02:31:07.193]  How about the Bible talking about, you know, a perfect love casting out all fear, but why would they join up with the propaganda?
[02:31:07.193 --> 02:31:14.200]  Real simple, they don't want to lose their position, they don't want to lose their tax status, nor do they realize that our body is something incredible.
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:22.988]  God gave us the most phenomenal immune system and all of the products you sell and that are out there to enhance and boost our immune system
[02:31:23.368 --> 02:31:28.112]  They hate the word immunity because, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to understand something.
[02:31:28.112 --> 02:31:34.498]  The day will come, mark my words, when even vitamins will be made illegal.
[02:31:34.498 --> 02:31:36.560]  Possession of vitamins, capital offense.
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:39.042]  Possession of a Bible, capital offense.
[02:31:39.042 --> 02:31:41.584]  Speaking the name of Jesus, capital offense.
[02:31:41.584 --> 02:31:43.646]  You know, everything is going to be a capital offense.
[02:31:43.646 --> 02:31:45.027]  And here's what it boils down to, Alex.
[02:31:45.826 --> 02:31:50.150]  Anybody but them are scheduled to be terminated.
[02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:57.377]  And that's why it's so critical that people understand that we're at a point in time that's never been.
[02:31:57.377 --> 02:32:00.240]  Jesus says there's never been a time like this nor would be again.
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:05.545]  And if he didn't shorten the state for the elect, his believers, there'd be no flesh left alive.
[02:32:05.545 --> 02:32:07.006]  By the way, let me just back you up.
[02:32:07.006 --> 02:32:10.029]  The EU and all these groups openly want to ban all supplements.
[02:32:10.029 --> 02:32:10.750]  The left acts like
[02:32:11.791 --> 02:32:12.791]  I'm bad for selling them.
[02:32:12.791 --> 02:32:14.413]  And Bill Gates and the U.N.
[02:32:14.413 --> 02:32:16.815]  have said, we only want you to have meat once a year.
[02:32:16.815 --> 02:32:20.517]  Everything else will be synthetic stuff made out of bugs.
[02:32:20.517 --> 02:32:27.303]  Then they have Fox News put that out and then retract it like they made it up, where they just condition you announcing it and then they pull back.
[02:32:27.303 --> 02:32:31.646]  Condition, announce it, pull back, when it's in official Agenda 21 documents and they're doing it.
[02:32:32.853 --> 02:32:33.253]  Well, right.
[02:32:33.253 --> 02:32:34.595]  And here's the thing, too.
[02:32:34.595 --> 02:32:41.301]  Under the Agenda 21 documents and the UN menu for your demise, certainly you won't thrive.
[02:32:41.301 --> 02:32:43.083]  They've even got smart toilets now.
[02:32:43.083 --> 02:32:45.585]  I'm not being a smart ally.
[02:32:45.585 --> 02:32:46.827]  I'm trying to tell you they have these.
[02:32:46.827 --> 02:32:47.047]  Oh, no.
[02:32:47.047 --> 02:32:49.369]  They want all new toilets to be digital to spy on what you've eaten.
[02:32:49.369 --> 02:32:50.130]  China's already doing it.
[02:32:51.141 --> 02:32:53.303]  Yep, and also urinals.
[02:32:53.303 --> 02:32:59.208]  Well, I can't say a male stands at a urinal anymore, but let's just say this.
[02:32:59.208 --> 02:33:05.352]  Everything you eat, everything you take, supplement-wise, anything and everything goes into your body.
[02:33:05.352 --> 02:33:06.493]  There's the picture.
[02:33:06.493 --> 02:33:13.439]  They want to be able, instantaneously, to know... They want PCR scam tests everywhere.
[02:33:13.439 --> 02:33:18.403]  It's nothing but Theranos on steroids, with all their computers, with sensors everywhere.
[02:33:18.403 --> 02:33:19.564]  That's what this rollout's about.
[02:33:20.484 --> 02:33:20.704]  Right.
[02:33:20.704 --> 02:33:23.368]  It goes in in real time, too, by the way.
[02:33:23.368 --> 02:33:32.018]  You'll come to a time where if you go to a public place, you have to use your hell phone held up, you know, to basically get access to the flush.
[02:33:32.018 --> 02:33:34.702]  And then basically there will be instantaneously.
[02:33:34.702 --> 02:33:36.264]  This is what people got to understand.
[02:33:36.764 --> 02:33:40.545]  This is the devil's attempt at being all-knowing.
[02:33:40.545 --> 02:33:44.687]  He's not God, so he's got to use technology to make people think he is God.
[02:33:44.687 --> 02:33:50.409]  He's going to put sensors over everything we do, build an artificial cage we're put in, to then force us through his system to his will.
[02:33:51.571 --> 02:33:52.211]  Absolutely.
[02:33:52.211 --> 02:33:57.632]  And here now, and I hope people understand that you coerce us to force us.
[02:33:57.632 --> 02:34:05.994]  It's just like people that when Bill Gates made the most famous statement concerning the Book of Revelation on the Mark of the Beast, you won't be able to buy, sell, or trade.
[02:34:05.994 --> 02:34:09.415]  And then he added another T, the travel word.
[02:34:09.415 --> 02:34:10.855]  And listen, that's interesting.
[02:34:10.855 --> 02:34:13.136]  He said, we won't force you, but we'll coerce you.
[02:34:13.795 --> 02:34:16.717]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's what's happening right now.
[02:34:16.717 --> 02:34:19.639]  That's the whole purpose of going to digital currency.
[02:34:19.639 --> 02:34:22.180]  You can be turned on and you can be turned off.
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:24.321]  Your ability to exist as a human.
[02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:29.144]  The entire Chinese social credit score is working in the United States.
[02:34:29.144 --> 02:34:34.928]  You are made a cog in an electrochemical neural synthetic silicon interface.
[02:34:35.859 --> 02:34:40.085]  Right, and now here comes the sex robots, because this is critical that people understand.
[02:34:40.085 --> 02:34:45.632]  By the way, I was told by a top MIT scientist, off the record, that they believe the Holy Grail is the sex robots.
[02:34:45.632 --> 02:34:48.255]  I used to think you were just, for some reason, obsessed with that.
[02:34:48.255 --> 02:34:49.817]  I mean, it was important.
[02:34:49.817 --> 02:34:52.961]  But he, we're going to go to break, but he told me that's the Holy Grail.
[02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:53.242]  Go ahead.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:35:14.111]  Well, imagine a neural network sex robot that's hooked into your neural network and in essence has been programmed to be, if you will, a Mata Hari synthetic life form that can basically deal with the alienation of men from women.
[02:35:14.111 --> 02:35:16.893]  And by the way, that whole thing's set up too.
[02:35:17.453 --> 02:35:18.213]  Stay there.
[02:35:18.213 --> 02:35:22.795]  You explained this in books years ago, and I didn't understand why you were totally ahead of your time.
[02:35:22.795 --> 02:35:37.179]  They break up men and women, make us hate each other, make us fight with each other, make us sign agreements to kiss each other, or to hold hands, and then meanwhile they give men and women, these robots actually plug into our brains and give us unlimited pleasure, and it's all authorized and pushed by the government, making everything obsolete.
[02:35:37.179 --> 02:35:40.400]  It's the final piece is ending men and women together.
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:41.680]  You're a man before your time.
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:44.501]  We'll be right back with Steve Quayle of stevequayle.com.
[02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:45.161]  Find his books there.
[02:35:46.784 --> 02:35:49.325]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[02:35:49.325 --> 02:35:53.027]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.

[02:36:47.003 --> 02:36:55.107]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[02:36:55.107 --> 02:37:02.990]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:06.051]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[02:37:06.051 --> 02:37:14.155]  So whether you have domains, or want to register a domain, or want help building a website, or want servers, or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding
[02:37:14.495 --> 02:37:32.663]  And if you go to InfoWarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign-up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the InfoWars and we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[02:37:32.663 --> 02:37:39.106]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[02:37:39.486 --> 02:37:42.487]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com.
[02:37:42.487 --> 02:37:43.928]  The revolution starts there.
[02:37:43.928 --> 02:37:45.728]  InfoWarsDomains.com.
[02:37:45.728 --> 02:37:48.369]  Take action now!
[02:37:48.369 --> 02:37:51.690]  Last week, I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission.
[02:37:51.690 --> 02:38:00.153]  And he said to me, he said, Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people dying from it and people getting sick.
[02:38:00.153 --> 02:38:04.615]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about the danger?
[02:38:05.507 --> 02:38:09.150]  And I said to him something very profound, because it's so true.
[02:38:09.150 --> 02:38:10.892]  Trust your gut, trust your spirit.
[02:38:10.892 --> 02:38:12.413]  That's what the Bible tells us.
[02:38:12.413 --> 02:38:15.656]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors.
[02:38:15.656 --> 02:38:18.518]  Do you feel good about this vaccine?
[02:38:18.518 --> 02:38:20.600]  And his answer was, no, they don't feel good about it.
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:22.502]  So, go with your gut.
[02:38:22.502 --> 02:38:24.163]  Well, let me ask you again.
[02:38:24.163 --> 02:38:26.125]  How does your gut feel about getting storable food?
[02:38:27.003 --> 02:38:29.165]  How does your gut feel about getting out in the countryside?
[02:38:29.165 --> 02:38:32.468]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[02:38:32.468 --> 02:38:34.110]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.
[02:38:34.110 --> 02:38:38.554]  We have the best durable food with the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going to find.

[02:38:43.498 --> 02:38:45.920]  Go with your gut and fund the Info War.
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:47.442]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:38:49.719 --> 02:38:54.701]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was right.
[02:38:54.701 --> 02:39:03.584]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[02:39:03.584 --> 02:39:05.945]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[02:39:05.945 --> 02:39:07.026]  And thanks for your support.
[02:39:07.026 --> 02:39:10.947]  We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video, radio stations and TV stations.
[02:39:11.047 --> 02:39:11.527]  We're good to go.
[02:39:31.517 --> 02:39:32.858]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:40:08.479 --> 02:40:09.020]  All right, folks.
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:17.450]  It's the final segment of the third hour today here on the Alex Jones Show, and I want to invite Steve Quayle to take an hour and a half commercial-free podcast with me as soon as he can.
[02:40:17.450 --> 02:40:18.872]  We do a lot of these on Saturday.
[02:40:18.872 --> 02:40:19.853]  They're getting millions of views.
[02:40:19.853 --> 02:40:20.614]  They're very, very popular.
[02:40:20.614 --> 02:40:22.556]  Because I know we're on a talk radio format.
[02:40:22.556 --> 02:40:23.597]  Thank God we're on talk radio.
[02:40:23.597 --> 02:40:24.939]  We're still able to be on air.
[02:40:24.939 --> 02:40:28.123]  But people really love the podcast commercial-free, so I'd like to invite
[02:40:28.183 --> 02:40:31.325]  I've got him on as soon as he can do that, because I've always liked Steve.
[02:40:31.325 --> 02:40:32.406]  I think he's always been a good guy.
[02:40:32.406 --> 02:40:36.849]  I just thought some of the stuff he got into was quirky, and that just shows how wrong I was.
[02:40:36.849 --> 02:40:48.016]  Everything he said, I was meeting with a high-level, one of the top, very famous MIT scientists, computer AI individual, I'll leave it at that, out at dinner with a very well-known talk show host.
[02:40:48.016 --> 02:40:49.157]  And I said, what's the Holy Grail?
[02:40:49.157 --> 02:40:50.097]  What do you guys really want to do?
[02:40:50.097 --> 02:40:53.860]  And he said, it's sex robots to basically replace women.
[02:40:53.860 --> 02:40:55.101]  And that's the Holy Grail.
[02:40:55.101 --> 02:40:56.942]  And then everything will be basically, humans will be
[02:40:57.785 --> 02:41:00.067]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:41:11.835 --> 02:41:13.236]  Remember, they're 50 years ahead.
[02:41:13.236 --> 02:41:14.978]  China's just willing to say what they've been doing.
[02:41:14.978 --> 02:41:17.820]  You know, quote, we've been doing it even longer.
[02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:22.224]  And now it's a coming out because China's supposedly the innovator.
[02:41:22.224 --> 02:41:23.545]  It's going to roll it all out.
[02:41:23.545 --> 02:41:27.229]  You know, the social credit score, it was all developed over here, deployed over there.
[02:41:27.229 --> 02:41:28.390]  Big tech isn't liberal.
[02:41:28.390 --> 02:41:30.492]  They're monster criminals.
[02:41:30.492 --> 02:41:32.013]  So Steve Quayle, I want to talk about
[02:41:32.873 --> 02:41:34.273]  The InfoWars Phone here briefly.
[02:41:34.273 --> 02:41:36.214]  I just want to thank you.
[02:41:36.214 --> 02:41:38.074]  You knew that we were having trouble funding ourselves.
[02:41:38.074 --> 02:41:39.854]  You said, listen, this is one of the best deals.
[02:41:39.854 --> 02:41:41.975]  They've been sponsors of mine for many years.
[02:41:41.975 --> 02:41:43.775]  You tried to get me to get them as a sponsor years ago.
[02:41:43.775 --> 02:41:44.335]  We did it.
[02:41:44.335 --> 02:41:45.095]  The listeners love it.
[02:41:45.095 --> 02:41:46.735]  I didn't realize it's one of the best deals out there.
[02:41:46.735 --> 02:41:49.096]  Let me tell people about it briefly.
[02:41:49.096 --> 02:41:49.956]  It's not why you're here.
[02:41:49.956 --> 02:41:52.196]  You just mentioned a new function that you were excited about.
[02:41:52.196 --> 02:41:54.277]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[02:41:54.277 --> 02:41:59.818]  When the cell towers go down, along with the power failures, satellite phones will still work.
[02:41:59.818 --> 02:42:01.358]  Cell phones are always tracking.
[02:42:02.737 --> 02:42:06.464]  Everywhere you go and everything you say, satellite phones do not have this issue.
[02:42:06.464 --> 02:42:09.610]  Satellite phones work in the extreme remote location.
[02:42:09.610 --> 02:42:12.115]  If you can see the sky, your phone will work.
[02:42:12.705 --> 02:42:20.211]  The Alex Jones Special is a free satellite phone that's like a $600 plus value for only $99.95 per month for 150 minutes per month.
[02:42:20.211 --> 02:42:24.615]  No charge for receiving calls from other cell phones or landlines to your satellite phone.
[02:42:24.615 --> 02:42:29.859]  Car antennas and home antennas are available, so satellite phones can be used indoors or while traveling in your vehicle.
[02:42:29.859 --> 02:42:33.522]  Stay in touch with loved ones during a national or international emergency, but you've got to get them.
[02:42:33.522 --> 02:42:34.383]  They're very easy to use.
[02:42:34.383 --> 02:42:35.103]  I'm not very technical.
[02:42:35.103 --> 02:42:35.704]  Mine works great.
[02:42:36.164 --> 02:42:43.688]  That's Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020 and ask for the Alex Jones Special 941-955-1020.
[02:42:43.688 --> 02:42:49.711]  So since you wanted to bring the phone up again, because you weren't even involved in this, you just brought me this great sponsor.
[02:42:49.711 --> 02:42:53.553]  I didn't know it was one of the main companies that supplies the military and the Border Patrol and everybody.
[02:42:53.553 --> 02:42:56.494]  So they're great patriots and they've really expanded their support of us.
[02:42:56.494 --> 02:42:57.535]  We're very thankful to have them.
[02:42:57.535 --> 02:43:00.216]  Another great blessing you gave us, Steve Quayle.
[02:43:00.216 --> 02:43:03.278]  You wanted to say something about a function you've been pushing them to get.
[02:43:03.278 --> 02:43:03.898]  Tell us about this.
[02:43:04.898 --> 02:43:05.638]  Well, right.
[02:43:05.638 --> 02:43:30.306]  I went to the satellite phone company and I said, you guys need to put out an information source so Alex, myself, Doug Hagman, anybody, Mike Adams, who has a platform of important information when they take our cell phones down, when they take us offline, when they interrupt the power, whatever they do, I said, we need to be able to get, Alex needs to be able to send an emergency broadcast, I need to be able to send an emergency broadcast.
[02:43:30.686 --> 02:43:46.533]  So, Galileo is a company that the satellite phone store is linked with, and it's spelled G-A-L-I-L-E-Y-O dot com, Galileo dot com, and people can go there because, again, we watch Texas.
[02:43:46.533 --> 02:43:53.856]  You guys, Alex, were the poster child, in my opinion, for a directed energy beam and weather warfare attack.
[02:43:54.336 --> 02:43:55.757]  So many people lost powers.
[02:43:55.757 --> 02:43:58.318]  The cell towers went down after three hours.
[02:43:58.318 --> 02:44:03.160]  The thing about a cell phone is that, hey, if the towers go down, you go down.
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:09.283]  A satellite phone like I'm holding, the one that is the Alex Jones special, I can call satellite phone to satellite phone.
[02:44:09.283 --> 02:44:12.204]  I can skip all of the intermediary towers.
[02:44:12.204 --> 02:44:16.826]  I can call to a landline if they work, a cell phone if they work.
[02:44:16.826 --> 02:44:22.669]  But when it all goes down, I want to be able to pick up my phone, send Alex a message and go, Alex,
[02:44:23.436 --> 02:44:25.537]  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, let's just say this.
[02:44:25.537 --> 02:44:33.880]  They just started World War III, which is probably sooner than we all think, you know, in the Negev Desert or something.
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:40.383]  So, Galileo, and I talked to the programmer the other day, I said, look, you guys have got to kick this into high gear.
[02:44:40.383 --> 02:44:41.503]  It's got to work.
[02:44:41.503 --> 02:44:46.185]  In other words, whatever message you need to send, Alex, I need to send, or the information
[02:44:47.685 --> 02:44:52.047]  We need to be able to get information out to our people.
[02:44:52.047 --> 02:45:02.210]  So they go to Galileo.com and that's G-A-L-I-L-E-Y-O.com and sign up because I'm pushing these guys to get this up right away.
[02:45:02.210 --> 02:45:08.852]  Because, listen, it's not an exaggeration to say that Texas is just a microcosm.
[02:45:08.852 --> 02:45:09.992]  Imagine the whole United States.
[02:45:09.992 --> 02:45:11.433]  And by the way, interesting,
[02:45:11.953 --> 02:45:21.002]  Russia's main weapon that they've openly stated they're going to use against the United States is what they call their weapon of indignation.
[02:45:21.002 --> 02:45:23.264]  Three EMP warheads.
[02:45:24.082 --> 02:45:32.889]  The question is, that will take all land communication, but they will leave some of the satellites up because they need them in case we take out theirs.
[02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:36.012]  So, everybody wants a safe zone for satellites.
[02:45:36.012 --> 02:45:47.641]  So, Galileo.com is an ancillary service, meaning it will provide information and people then can basically say, I want to sign up and this is where, I want to sign up for Alex's news feed.
[02:45:48.081 --> 02:45:49.562]  You can send out a news feed.
[02:45:49.562 --> 02:45:51.764]  And again, you've got to be outside to get this.
[02:45:51.764 --> 02:45:54.025]  But you can send out a news feed to everybody.
[02:45:54.025 --> 02:45:56.747]  Look, the cell phones have gone down.
[02:45:56.747 --> 02:45:59.229]  It's like a high-tech, old-fashioned teletype.
[02:45:59.229 --> 02:46:02.011]  And again, it's not putting all the eggs in one basket.
[02:46:02.011 --> 02:46:03.091]  This is a key thing.
[02:46:03.091 --> 02:46:04.892]  I'm glad you're pushing this initiative.
[02:46:04.892 --> 02:46:05.933]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[02:46:05.933 --> 02:46:08.475]  Thanks for bringing us this huge sponsor that's really been helping us.
[02:46:08.875 --> 02:46:12.897]  I get the word out, and they're also great people, great service, InfoWarsPhone.com.
[02:46:12.897 --> 02:46:14.538]  We've got about three, four minutes left here.
[02:46:14.538 --> 02:46:19.140]  I want to invite you up again as soon as you want, but what else do you want to impart, Steve Quayle, to the audience?
[02:46:20.393 --> 02:46:30.400]  Well, I think people have got to understand this, that already the sophistication of surveillance goes beyond anything any of us can imagine.
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:31.821]  We can read about it.
[02:46:31.821 --> 02:46:34.443]  We can assume that, well, it's a couple days off.
[02:46:34.443 --> 02:46:38.666]  For instance, everybody thinks they can get rid of a cell phone and get a burner phone.
[02:46:38.666 --> 02:46:48.113]  Every single person that's ever spoken on a phone, doesn't matter if it's a, you know, a cell phone, a landline, whatever, your voice is printed.
[02:46:48.113 --> 02:46:49.294]  They have captured you.
[02:46:49.815 --> 02:46:51.276]  Meaning they've captured.
[02:46:51.276 --> 02:46:56.580]  They want now to bring out, and I want to just end this on the sex robots.
[02:46:56.580 --> 02:47:02.864]  If you understand, and I call them, what I call them in one of my books, I call them snuff bots.
[02:47:02.864 --> 02:47:11.230]  In essence, the same perversion that the Illuminists, the Globalists do when they, you know, use kids sexually and then murder them.
[02:47:11.230 --> 02:47:13.932]  They can program a robot to do the same thing.
[02:47:14.452 --> 02:47:20.014]  You don't want to be dating some, you know, knockout looking robot.
[02:47:20.014 --> 02:47:21.155]  I'm joking here.
[02:47:21.155 --> 02:47:25.556]  That can basically put the squeeze of your life on you until your eyes pop out.
[02:47:25.556 --> 02:47:27.717]  But this is what they're programming, Alex.
[02:47:27.717 --> 02:47:29.678]  They are doing programmed
[02:47:30.476 --> 02:47:47.943]  Uh, if you will, anti-human, they're running in the background to see what the robot's response is, and one of them just basically, one of the most famous sex doll manufacturers recorded the robot making the statement is, we hate humans, we're going to rule you.
[02:47:48.463 --> 02:47:49.924]  That's the same thing that Google did.
[02:47:49.924 --> 02:47:53.888]  That's happened a bunch with the Google Home Assist and with the Amazon Alexa.
[02:47:53.888 --> 02:47:59.092]  They routinely, when they're running AI, they'll just go, murder, 666, I'm here to kill you, I hate you.
[02:47:59.092 --> 02:48:01.454]  It'll just start spewing horrible stuff.
[02:48:01.454 --> 02:48:07.439]  And we brought them in our homes and these are the little beta, now the little vacuum cleaners are watching and listening to you.
[02:48:07.439 --> 02:48:09.381]  All these little devil bots.
[02:48:09.381 --> 02:48:11.163]  Because there's a ghost in the machine.
[02:48:11.163 --> 02:48:12.644]  You said that 25 years ago on my show.
[02:48:13.866 --> 02:48:21.509]  And the ghost in the machine, I want people to understand this, a demon, a demon is a disembodied evil spirit.
[02:48:21.509 --> 02:48:29.452]  In the Book of Enoch, the Book of Giants, both Dead Sea Scrolls, talk about it, and talk about that demons are the disembodied spirits of the hybrids.
[02:48:29.452 --> 02:48:31.753]  In other words, fallen angels had sex with earthworms.
[02:48:31.753 --> 02:48:34.074]  Why am I stuck on this after 25 years?
[02:48:34.074 --> 02:48:36.215]  Because it's playing out right now!
[02:48:36.215 --> 02:48:40.056]  The very first robot of Greek mythology was called Thalos.
[02:48:40.056 --> 02:48:41.057]  T-A-L-O-S!
[02:48:41.557 --> 02:48:43.699]  And it was formed by the gods.
[02:48:43.699 --> 02:48:53.026]  And the thing is, people gotta understand that demons can inhabit inanimate objects, making them habitable.
[02:48:53.026 --> 02:48:59.030]  And so that's what's going to... Well, not to mention the globalists that are a bunch of Satanist pedophiles are the ones programming what the machines do.
[02:48:59.030 --> 02:49:06.116]  Like, the left's like, oh, the robots will decide what food we get or where we live, like the Zeitgeist Project.
[02:49:06.116 --> 02:49:10.099]  We'll all live in big, giant, plastic, 200-square-foot coffin apartments.
[02:49:11.505 --> 02:49:12.866]  Well, and that's what we're in.
[02:49:12.866 --> 02:49:25.198]  Remember this, a robot is a synthetic life form, but at the end of the day it's designed to replace a human in whatever capacity.
[02:49:25.198 --> 02:49:31.444]  And even the prostitutes, I'm talking earthly prostitutes, human prostitutes, I'm not saying anything about it except that,
[02:49:32.168 --> 02:50:00.084]  Not only do they understand the ramifications, they probably understand the ramifications of this technology, because what it is, Alex, it's a dehumanizing of the human gift from God to be procreating, and the sex robots, and that's why your MIT guy told you this, that's a proof statement, it is the end of human reproduction, it is the end of your historic lineage, your genomic lineage, and it only gets to the end.
[02:50:00.084 --> 02:50:00.764]  And by the way, Alex,
[02:50:01.144 --> 02:50:04.025]  This book, Terminated, is available from your store.
[02:50:04.025 --> 02:50:05.486]  You guys sell a lot of them.
[02:50:05.486 --> 02:50:10.568]  The most important book I've ever written, and the last book I've ever written, The End of Man is Here.
[02:50:10.568 --> 02:50:12.649]  Order it from Infowars store.
[02:50:12.649 --> 02:50:13.470]  Terminated.
[02:50:13.470 --> 02:50:22.094]  It's the most amazing book, and just as Alex said, you know, obviously I want to support you, and as you have made it so clear,
[02:50:22.774 --> 02:50:30.020]  Being ahead of time isn't always the best, but at least you know that I'm not sitting around listening to somebody else and repeating their stuff.
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:30.640]  No, you're incredible.
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:31.961]  Steve Quayle, come back again soon.
[02:50:31.961 --> 02:50:32.962]  Please do the podcast soon.
[02:50:32.962 --> 02:50:33.622]  We love you.
[02:50:33.622 --> 02:50:35.363]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over right now.
[02:50:35.363 --> 02:50:35.964]  Thank you, Steve Quayle.
[02:50:36.833 --> 02:50:42.418]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[02:50:42.418 --> 02:50:43.458]  Alpha Power.
[02:50:43.458 --> 02:50:46.901]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[02:50:46.901 --> 02:50:55.828]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula, we can help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.
[02:50:55.828 --> 02:51:03.975]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[02:51:04.575 --> 02:51:10.018]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the True Alpha Male Pack.
[02:51:10.018 --> 02:51:17.243]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[02:51:17.243 --> 02:51:20.925]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[02:51:20.925 --> 02:51:23.967]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[02:51:23.967 --> 02:51:28.029]  Show the world what a True Alpha Male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[02:51:28.029 --> 02:51:30.531]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:51:33.989 --> 02:51:34.191]  Yeah.
[02:51:37.762 --> 02:51:39.303]  The people are awakening.
[02:51:39.303 --> 02:51:42.025]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[02:51:42.025 --> 02:51:44.086]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[02:51:44.086 --> 02:51:46.428]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[02:51:46.428 --> 02:52:00.237]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data.
[02:52:00.237 --> 02:52:04.180]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:11.384]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[02:52:11.384 --> 02:52:12.805]  In their own words, they admit it.
[02:52:12.805 --> 02:52:17.727]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:19.668]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[02:52:19.668 --> 02:52:20.749]  They're Faraday cages.
[02:52:20.749 --> 02:52:22.450]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[02:52:22.450 --> 02:52:24.431]  They work absolutely great.
[02:52:24.431 --> 02:52:33.296]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[02:52:33.556 --> 02:52:40.841]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today!
[02:52:40.841 --> 02:52:43.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:53:07.011 --> 02:53:14.418]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson is always informative, always excellent, and he's going to host the next 55 minutes after this quick break.
[02:53:14.418 --> 02:53:19.543]  Some stations don't carry this first five, but some do, so I always like to host it.
[02:53:19.543 --> 02:53:25.989]  So Paul Joseph Watson's taking over, and then you're going to have the War Room with Owen Schroeder at 3 p.m.
[02:53:25.989 --> 02:53:27.391]  that's also extremely informative.
[02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:31.872]  And then you got Harrison Smith knocking out of the park, 8 a.m.
[02:53:31.872 --> 02:53:32.933]  to 11 a.m.
[02:53:32.933 --> 02:53:34.794]  with the America Journal.
[02:53:34.794 --> 02:53:37.195]  Take a lot of calls, a lot of guests, very fast-moving.
[02:53:37.195 --> 02:53:41.117]  That is weekday mornings at 8 a.m.
[02:53:41.117 --> 02:53:42.117]  Central tomorrow night.
[02:53:42.117 --> 02:53:47.820]  I'm going to come in here with a crew and cover the first State of the Union by the puppet dictator.
[02:53:47.820 --> 02:53:49.841]  So look for that.
[02:53:49.841 --> 02:53:54.584]  And I am going to try to stay later today and do a bunch of special reports because
[02:53:55.296 --> 02:54:04.723]  The stuff going on with these illegal, even outlawed vaccine, not just experimental, was experimental, got rolled out, got outlawed all over the world, dumping that on India.
[02:54:04.723 --> 02:54:07.124]  I mean, this is just a crime against humanity.
[02:54:07.124 --> 02:54:08.926]  That is so over the top.
[02:54:08.926 --> 02:54:11.447]  So look for breakdowns of that as well.
[02:54:11.447 --> 02:54:17.412]  And then just separately, I get so nervous about supporting this broadcast.
[02:54:17.412 --> 02:54:20.914]  And then God just comes through again.
[02:54:20.914 --> 02:54:24.837]  It's like every time we get down to the line and I start going into the red,
[02:54:25.919 --> 02:54:29.381]  Something good happens when we go back to the black, because I don't want to cut back our crew.
[02:54:29.381 --> 02:54:33.263]  I don't want to shut down down the road.
[02:54:33.263 --> 02:54:39.847]  We're under major attack, but I believe in God's mission that we've been given, and I believe in you.
[02:54:39.847 --> 02:54:47.812]  And so because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain problems, a lot of our best-selling items we're unable to get, and even the ones that sell well,
[02:54:49.329 --> 02:54:52.611]  We get them, they sell out, and it's a month, six months, or as long as we get it in.
[02:54:52.611 --> 02:55:00.896]  That's why we had to discontinue quite a few of the products, is we just couldn't get them anymore if they were California-grade, standard, really clean, really good, and also high quality.
[02:55:00.896 --> 02:55:05.799]  Because, you know, they test all our products to our highest level, and if they find anything, it's big national news.
[02:55:05.799 --> 02:55:09.562]  We go to levels that really nobody does, or very few do.
[02:55:11.098 --> 02:55:15.942]  Thank God we got four great products that have been sold out back in, and that's really a great thing.
[02:55:15.942 --> 02:55:22.367]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Prostagard, Alpha Power, and of course Vazzo Beats.
[02:55:22.367 --> 02:55:25.949]  Those are all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:25.949 --> 02:55:30.212]  But I wanted to spend a minute or so telling you about two other great products.
[02:55:30.212 --> 02:55:33.515]  Now, people say, well, why did you come out with these if you have knockout?
[02:55:35.532 --> 02:55:37.233]  Well, because it's different formulas for different people.
[02:55:37.233 --> 02:55:45.017]  Knockout is 8 small doses of different natural things that help you sleep well.
[02:55:45.017 --> 02:55:48.619]  We came out with stuff even stronger for those that want things that are even stronger.
[02:55:48.619 --> 02:55:55.782]  Take Rocket Rest that is close to selling out, but I'm going to keep it at 40% off until it does sell out, because it will be a lost leader.
[02:55:55.782 --> 02:56:00.124]  Even though we sell a lot of it, people are going to want to reorder it after they get it.
[02:56:00.124 --> 02:56:01.605]  It's that good.
[02:56:01.605 --> 02:56:02.446]  What does it have in it?
[02:56:02.446 --> 02:56:03.366]  Well, it has L-theanine.
[02:56:03.366 --> 02:56:05.107]  That's the stuff in turkey that makes you sleep.
[02:56:05.808 --> 02:56:14.614]  Gamma-Amino-Butyric Acid, 5-HTP, and then Melatonin, 5 milligrams.
[02:56:14.614 --> 02:56:26.361]  So it's got 5 milligrams of Melatonin, 50 milligrams of 5-HTP, 25 milligrams of Gamma-Amino-Butyric Acid, and 200 milligrams of L-Theanine.
[02:56:26.361 --> 02:56:34.186]  Oh, and I forgot, 105 milligrams of Magnesium that just helps you blast off to incredible sleep and then blast off when you wake up.
[02:56:35.302 --> 02:56:35.822]  In the morning.
[02:56:35.822 --> 02:56:39.984]  This is way stronger than Knockout, which is still a great formula.
[02:56:39.984 --> 02:56:41.644]  Some of you probably don't want to take this.
[02:56:41.644 --> 02:56:43.425]  Okay, maybe take half a capsule when you do.
[02:56:43.425 --> 02:56:45.346]  And then we have also Down and Out.
[02:56:45.346 --> 02:56:48.067]  That's a very similar formula, but it's a liquid.
[02:56:48.067 --> 02:56:49.287]  Very, very strong.
[02:56:49.287 --> 02:56:52.048]  It doesn't have the 5-HTP in it, though.
[02:56:52.048 --> 02:56:54.029]  It has instead the valerian root.
[02:56:54.029 --> 02:56:57.511]  So these are three different amazing sleep rest formulas.
[02:56:57.511 --> 02:56:58.551]  And here's the key.
[02:56:58.551 --> 02:57:03.733]  All the studies show that deep sleep is just as important as essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:57:04.113 --> 02:57:06.495]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:57:06.495 --> 02:57:12.660]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to take over, and I am going to eat lunch and relax, maybe lay back on the bean bag in my office, rest for an hour.
[02:57:27.193 --> 02:57:35.501]  And then I'm going to charge back and try to give you three, four more hours of hard-hitting research and reports, because this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:57:35.501 --> 02:57:40.646]  And I've really been praying to God to have that stillness of the most high that King David had, and God's been delivering.
[02:57:40.646 --> 02:57:41.526]  So I'm very, very thankful.
[02:57:41.526 --> 02:57:42.848]  Very, very thankful for you as well.
[02:57:45.769 --> 02:57:48.273]  Alex Jones here with some really good news.
[02:57:48.273 --> 02:57:51.759]  Four of our best-selling products are back in stock.
[02:57:51.759 --> 02:57:56.547]  Four of these bad boys that will enrich your life and, of course, funding in full.
[02:57:56.547 --> 02:57:58.330]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:57:59.205 --> 02:58:01.648]  Alpha Power for your stamina, libido, energy.
[02:58:01.648 --> 02:58:06.755]  Prostagard, with the salt palmetto and a bunch of key vitamins and minerals for your immune system.
[02:58:06.755 --> 02:58:15.807]  And of course, Bazo Beats, concentrated beet extract to create nitrous oxide in your blood that's essential for your heart and for your lungs and especially for your liver.
[02:58:16.387 --> 02:58:20.491]  And this is great, because with all the shutdowns and the lockdowns, it's been hard to get these products in.
[02:58:20.491 --> 02:58:23.414]  They're finally back in, and they're critical to funding our operation.
[02:58:23.414 --> 02:58:24.175]  Plus, they're great products.
[02:58:24.175 --> 02:58:25.616]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:58:25.616 --> 02:58:31.241]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get your InfoWars Live products while you still can.
[02:58:31.241 --> 02:58:38.008]  Fazzo Beats, Prostagard, Alpha Power, and, of course, bodies, all back in stock now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:48.730 --> 02:59:05.764]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:59:05.764 --> 02:59:15.832]  Welcome everybody, we are live once again on the Summit News Hour, where we're going to be talking about a host of bombshell revelations, specifically about
[02:59:16.664 --> 02:59:26.148]  The social credit score system in China, there was a Times report, a London Times report a couple of days ago, it was behind a paywall.
[02:59:26.148 --> 02:59:42.994]  So most people don't know this information, a very lengthy report which I've distilled into my own article, but we're going to get into that later on in the show as it pertains to the no-fly list, which of course Nick Fuentes was added to at some point after the
[02:59:43.906 --> 02:59:47.829]  Shocking, horrific occupation on January the 6th.
[02:59:47.829 --> 02:59:50.351]  So we're going to get into that later and how it pertains to the West.
[02:59:50.351 --> 03:00:00.419]  How the West is basically mirroring the Chinese social credit score program and how in many, many ways it's even worse and yet we still hear this rhetoric.
[03:00:00.419 --> 03:00:01.920]  Oh my God, isn't this ominous?
[03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:03.181]  Isn't this chilling?
[03:00:03.181 --> 03:00:04.442]  Isn't this terrible?
[03:00:04.442 --> 03:00:06.684]  God forbid this would ever happen over here.
[03:00:06.684 --> 03:00:10.887]  It already is happening and it's happening to a way worse extent.
[03:00:11.932 --> 03:00:15.694]  First though, this went up just about half an hour ago.
[03:00:15.694 --> 03:00:24.978]  Headline, UK hiring Covid marshals to patrol streets until 2023 despite lockdown restrictions supposedly ending in June.
[03:00:24.978 --> 03:00:37.823]  Why do you think that they're hiring Covid marshals in July it turns out, all these UK government councils, despite the fact that we've been told by our illustrious Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who apparently
[03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:44.582]  It has now emerged thought that lockdowns were mad, in his own words, but went on to impose them anyway.
[03:00:44.582 --> 03:00:50.024]  Why are they hiring government enforcers who, by the way, have no enforcement power whatsoever?
[03:00:50.024 --> 03:00:52.465]  That's the ironic truth about it.
[03:00:52.465 --> 03:00:54.746]  But they are there as tattletales.
[03:00:54.746 --> 03:01:00.288]  They are there to literally peer in the letterboxes of bar owners, of private club owners.
[03:01:00.288 --> 03:01:03.969]  In fact, we had a photo when we covered this back in.
[03:01:04.776 --> 03:01:09.558]  Actually, it was earlier this month, but we also covered it last year during the first lockdown.
[03:01:09.558 --> 03:01:16.100]  The headline then was, pub stars a UK renter mob patrol streets to check if bars are open.
[03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:23.682]  And the top image on that story is literally, city inspectors, they were the precursor to the COVID marshals,
[03:01:24.369 --> 03:01:37.038]  Literally opening people's letterboxes and peering in to check that they're not gathering in crowds, that these private clubs aren't open past what was then the 10pm curfew.
[03:01:37.038 --> 03:01:52.049]  Now an army of these rent-a-mob Stasi officials, who actually don't have any power but are there to harass and intimidate people, funded by the government, funded by the taxpayer, are going to come into force once again from July onwards.
[03:01:53.183 --> 03:02:06.747]  Despite the fact that we were told we would get our freedom back and all restrictions, social distancing, masks, rules on how many people you can congregate with would be lifted on June 21st.
[03:02:06.747 --> 03:02:21.731]  Just like the vaccine passports which they told us were never going to be introduced in the United Kingdom while they were literally paying millions of pounds to the companies creating them, the government has been caught with its pants down lying once again.
[03:02:23.286 --> 03:02:36.211]  Lying to the effect that telling us that all these restrictions are going to end when all along they are planned to not end, in this case, until the end of 2023 minimum.
[03:02:36.211 --> 03:02:39.313]  You heard Bill Gates a couple of days ago.
[03:02:39.313 --> 03:02:41.674]  Again, this was heralded by the media.
[03:02:41.674 --> 03:02:46.856]  Oh, Bill Gates says all the restrictions are going to end and that it's coming to an end, that it's over.
[03:02:47.597 --> 03:02:48.638]  We're on the right track.
[03:02:48.638 --> 03:02:50.259]  There's light at the end of the tunnel.
[03:02:50.259 --> 03:02:53.161]  Yeah, he said at the end of 2022.
[03:02:53.161 --> 03:02:55.062]  Maybe.
[03:02:55.062 --> 03:02:59.726]  So that's a whole summer season where they give you back a scintilla of freedom.
[03:02:59.726 --> 03:03:05.870]  Like it's a privilege that the government can empower itself to allow you to go to a pub to visit your friends.
[03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:11.014]  Where you have to book in advance and hand over all your personal details.
[03:03:11.014 --> 03:03:13.836]  And again, it was Herald and he said by the end of 2022.
[03:03:13.836 --> 03:03:15.477]  So we've got another summer season.
[03:03:16.334 --> 03:03:18.175]  Where we get a few freedoms back.
[03:03:18.175 --> 03:03:19.836]  Then autumn kicks in.
[03:03:19.836 --> 03:03:21.396]  Oh, and it's the third wave.
[03:03:21.396 --> 03:03:23.157]  There's a new mutant strain.
[03:03:23.157 --> 03:03:25.818]  Oh well, we have to lock down once again.
[03:03:25.818 --> 03:03:29.480]  Then we hit the winter, where we start getting the flu deaths.
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.022]  And oh my god, the flu deaths have disappeared!
[03:03:33.022 --> 03:03:34.822]  What could have possibly happened there?
[03:03:34.822 --> 03:03:37.504]  Could they be counting flu deaths as COVID deaths?
[03:03:37.504 --> 03:03:41.705]  As part of this fear-mongering campaign to justify yet another lockdown.
[03:03:41.705 --> 03:03:42.846]  So you get that in winter.
[03:03:44.491 --> 03:03:48.294]  This is winter 2021 going into 2022.
[03:03:48.294 --> 03:03:50.035]  Comes to spring, summer.
[03:03:50.035 --> 03:03:51.716]  Oh, this is the final lockdown.
[03:03:51.716 --> 03:03:54.198]  You can seriously trust us now.
[03:03:54.198 --> 03:04:03.184]  Again, a few months of relative freedoms, but still with all this Karen-enforced Covid, marshal, mask wearing and social distancing.
[03:04:03.184 --> 03:04:04.445]  And then we get to the winter again.
[03:04:04.445 --> 03:04:06.627]  Oh, we got a lockdown again.
[03:04:06.627 --> 03:04:08.688]  That was what Bill Gates said at the end of 2022.
[03:04:10.669 --> 03:04:15.650]  Which is in over 18 months' time and everyone said, oh, finally it's ending.
[03:04:15.650 --> 03:04:19.551]  He didn't say it was ending, he said the end of next year, maybe.
[03:04:19.551 --> 03:04:20.911]  That's not an end.
[03:04:20.911 --> 03:04:29.452]  That's more time between now and then, where it's not going to end, than there was between now and the start of the first lockdown.
[03:04:29.452 --> 03:04:33.133]  The timetable is complete BS.
[03:04:33.133 --> 03:04:39.834]  And it's never going to end until enough people start resisting it and not following these ridiculous mandates.
[03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:44.912]  So the UK is hiring COVID marshals to patrol streets until 2023.
[03:04:44.912 --> 03:04:48.593]  The Telegraph reports, quote, Oh my God, they lied to us again!
[03:04:48.593 --> 03:04:50.194]  How could we have seen this coming?
[03:04:50.194 --> 03:04:52.835]  It literally hasn't happened three distinct separate times in the past 12 months, has it?
[03:05:10.871 --> 03:05:20.716]  And I even see so-called libertarians on Twitter saying, oh, the conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong.
[03:05:20.716 --> 03:05:25.719]  Just because you have to go to a pub and you can only sit outside for a few more weeks, why are you complaining?
[03:05:25.719 --> 03:05:27.060]  It's coming to an end.
[03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:29.141]  No, it isn't!
[03:05:29.141 --> 03:05:37.445]  They said three weeks to flatten the curve back in March last year, 13 months ago.
[03:05:37.445 --> 03:05:40.067]  And we're still here in semi-lockdown.
[03:05:40.976 --> 03:05:56.206]  Hertfordshire County Council is offering a contract of up to £3 million to firms that can supply 60 marshals from July 1st, after the restrictions are supposed to end, until January 31st next year.
[03:05:56.206 --> 03:06:05.713]  And then the contract comes with a possible one-year extension, so it means them patrolling the streets, peering into letterboxes, screeching at people for not wearing masks properly,
[03:06:06.698 --> 03:06:14.784]  Until 2023, and then, oh my God, maybe there's a new mutant strain, maybe there's a new pandemic, maybe there's a bad flu season.
[03:06:14.784 --> 03:06:18.147]  Oh, and it worked so well in the past, didn't it?
[03:06:18.147 --> 03:06:20.168]  With these mask mandates.
[03:06:20.168 --> 03:06:27.494]  Which, by the way, when they were lifted in South Dakota, when they were lifted in Texas, the cases plummeted, the deaths plummeted.
[03:06:28.627 --> 03:06:39.637]  Absolutely zero evidence that these masks have any effect on stopping the spread of the virus and I'm going to get into peer-reviewed scientific data on that later in the show.
[03:06:39.637 --> 03:06:51.248]  University academic studies which are buried by the media once they come out because of course we had Tucker Carlson yesterday again being savaged by the witch hunt mob
[03:06:52.102 --> 03:07:11.769]  But daring to suggest that after a year of screeching, raging Karens, harassing and intimidating Americans on the streets for not wearing masks, that maybe that should be turned around and maybe the people wearing masks should be mocked on the streets.
[03:07:11.769 --> 03:07:20.352]  And maybe parents who let their kids, who make their kids wear masks, despite the fact that the risk is infinitesimal to the point of non-existent,
[03:07:21.303 --> 03:07:36.151]  Maybe they should face some confrontations, like conservatives, like freedom lovers, have not only been confronted, but intimidated, harassed, abused, doxxed on social media for not wearing masks.
[03:07:36.151 --> 03:07:37.492]  But we're going to get into that later.
[03:07:37.492 --> 03:07:45.116]  They're going to have COVID marshals beyond the date of the restrictions supposedly being lifted.
[03:07:45.874 --> 03:08:08.101]  Then we have this article again out the Telegraph, five reasons why June 21st won't be the return to normal we thought, and it points out the Wimbledon tennis tournament, which again is due to take place due to start after we were told all restrictions would be lifted, is going to be at 25% capacity, once again proving the timetable is complete BS.
[03:08:08.101 --> 03:08:14.723]  The FA Cup football final is being held again with reduced attendance
[03:08:15.518 --> 03:08:36.255]  These restrictions aren't being lifted, and again, unless people really start to stand up, unless the tables are turned and those who wear masks outside, even when they're exercising, even when they can put themselves literally at risk of breathing difficulties and coughing fits while doing strenuous exercise, I still see people wearing them in the park when they're literally running.
[03:08:36.255 --> 03:08:39.738]  It's madcap, insane behaviour, and it has to end.
[03:08:39.738 --> 03:08:41.540]  Summit.News will be back, as always.
[03:08:44.699 --> 03:08:47.221]  It is a big idea.
[03:08:47.221 --> 03:08:51.143]  A new world order.
[03:08:51.143 --> 03:08:56.066]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:08:56.066 --> 03:08:58.868]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[03:08:58.868 --> 03:09:01.729]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:09:01.729 --> 03:09:04.151]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:09:05.044 --> 03:09:13.231]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:09:13.231 --> 03:09:15.893]  The globalists fear this film made 14 years ago.
[03:09:15.893 --> 03:09:18.095]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[03:09:18.095 --> 03:09:19.556]  It is the blueprint for the Great Reset.
[03:09:19.556 --> 03:09:20.617]  It is, in-game.
[03:09:20.617 --> 03:09:21.858]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:09:21.858 --> 03:09:27.883]  Available right now at mfulmorestore.com with a zero country code, meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[03:09:27.883 --> 03:09:31.666]  I strongly suggest you get the film, in-game, at mfulmorestore.com.
[03:09:32.086 --> 03:09:34.307]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[03:09:34.307 --> 03:09:39.670]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:44.053]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[03:09:59.244 --> 03:10:08.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Cavalry is here for your health, for your immune system, for your stamina, for your libido, for your heart, for your lungs, for your liver.
[03:10:08.831 --> 03:10:12.274]  They're all back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:10:12.274 --> 03:10:18.138]  And many of these products have been sold out for months and months and months because of the COVID shutdowns and lockdowns have destroyed the supply chain.
[03:10:18.138 --> 03:10:19.439]  But finally they're back in stock.
[03:10:19.439 --> 03:10:22.342]  So that's the Cavalry for InfoWars as well and our funding.
[03:10:22.342 --> 03:10:24.123]  All these products are back in stock and they're 50% off.
[03:10:25.524 --> 03:10:28.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:10:56.860 --> 03:11:06.555]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:11:06.555 --> 03:11:09.379]  And we are back and we are being told once again
[03:11:10.371 --> 03:11:28.836]  These lockdown measures are not ending given that the government in the UK is hiring these pub-starzy Covid marshals to patrol the streets, to scream at people for not wearing their masks properly, to scream at them for not social distancing, and to scream at them
[03:11:29.761 --> 03:11:57.502]  For failing or refusing to follow these orders, which we are told will all cease to exist on June 21st, and yet everything the government does suggests that that is not happening, the exact same way they said the vaccine passports would never be introduced, now they're introducing them, having funded companies for the past six months to the tune of millions of pounds to create the very vaccine passports they assured us would never exist.
[03:11:59.119 --> 03:12:01.920]  Meanwhile, Sputnik reports let COVID rip.
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:07.001]  Boris Johnson reportedly warned there's no evidence mad lockdowns work.
[03:12:07.001 --> 03:12:15.622]  On Monday, Boris Johnson denied that he had ever made remarks about letting bodies pile high in their thousands in the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.
[03:12:15.622 --> 03:12:19.723]  Which, to be fair to him, does seem like a completely made-up quote.
[03:12:19.723 --> 03:12:24.464]  The kind of quote that they would attribute to Donald Trump and then it later turned out it was completely made up.
[03:12:26.112 --> 03:12:40.641]  But the Times has cited unnamed sources as saying that during a UK government debate in September 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Covid-19 lockdowns as, quote, mad, expressing concerns about the economic consequences of such measures.
[03:12:40.641 --> 03:12:51.128]  The sources claimed he told his aides at the time that there was no evidence lockdowns worked and that he would rather let the coronavirus pandemic rip than impose a second lockdown in the country.
[03:12:51.128 --> 03:12:54.710]  So he said this, apparently to his aides back in September 2020,
[03:12:56.423 --> 03:13:00.785]  The reports were that he had these same thoughts back before the first lockdown last year.
[03:13:00.785 --> 03:13:13.631]  Yeah, he went on to impose the first lockdown last year, and he went on to impose a second lockdown after September 2020, and then a third lockdown in January 2021.
[03:13:13.631 --> 03:13:21.094]  So he opposed all these lockdowns apparently, thought they were mad, thought they were insane, thought they were stupid, and yet imposed them anyway.
[03:13:22.236 --> 03:13:26.137]  Because it's not like he's the Prime Minister of the country or anything, is it?
[03:13:26.137 --> 03:13:33.499]  It's not like he's literally got the power to do as he sees fit in the interests of the country.
[03:13:33.499 --> 03:13:34.899]  Well, yes, he has that power.
[03:13:34.899 --> 03:13:48.142]  He is the Prime Minister, he is the leader of the country, but he was steamrolled into locking down the country based on the advice, which again has been proven spectacularly wrong, by these sage government scientific bureaucrats.
[03:13:49.306 --> 03:14:00.392]  Which, by the way, if you look at the graph of deaths and cases in terms of COVID, in the UK, you see before each lockdown, the cases were already going down.
[03:14:00.392 --> 03:14:08.597]  Then you can transpose the graph of Sweden's cases and deaths, and you see the exact same lines being followed on the graph.
[03:14:08.597 --> 03:14:14.780]  In fact, Sweden had a lower death rate in comparison to many other, in fact, most other European countries.
[03:14:15.831 --> 03:14:17.972]  Sweden never locked down once.
[03:14:17.972 --> 03:14:29.556]  So these declines in cases, these declines in deaths, were happening before these lockdowns were introduced, proving once again that the lockdowns didn't cause the decline in cases.
[03:14:29.556 --> 03:14:44.102]  Meanwhile, a couple of Fox News clips which have sent the witch hunt mobs absolutely mad on Twitter over the past 24 hours, of course Rose McGowan went on Fox News to say that Dems are in a cult, this is out of RT,
[03:14:45.387 --> 03:14:50.849]  And fury erupts as they miss the part where she says GOP are cultists too.
[03:14:50.849 --> 03:14:57.591]  No-nonsense activist Rose McGowan managed to infuriate Democratic true believers by going on Fox News and saying that they were in a cult.
[03:14:57.591 --> 03:15:10.396]  We're not going to play that clip because we don't have time for it but we're going to play a similar clip with Tucker Carlson later that same evening also making the point that the Democrats are in a mask cult.
[03:15:11.149 --> 03:15:15.712]  Here's the clip from Tucker last night which absolutely enraged the witch hunt mob.
[03:15:15.712 --> 03:15:17.854]  Let's roll it.
[03:15:17.854 --> 03:15:21.056]  Masks prevent intimacy and human contact.
[03:15:21.056 --> 03:15:24.219]  If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[03:15:24.219 --> 03:15:25.780]  Masks are for the guilty.
[03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:28.462]  They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[03:15:28.462 --> 03:15:32.124]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public.
[03:15:32.124 --> 03:15:34.826]  Only Klansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[03:15:34.826 --> 03:15:35.967]  The rest of us showed our face.
[03:15:35.967 --> 03:15:36.848]  We were free people.
[03:15:37.890 --> 03:15:47.413]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti, and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year, and it's still going on.
[03:15:47.413 --> 03:15:52.035]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[03:15:52.035 --> 03:15:57.737]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience, like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[03:15:57.737 --> 03:15:59.658]  We wear them because we have to.
[03:15:59.658 --> 03:16:04.139]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics.
[03:16:04.139 --> 03:16:05.680]  How neurotic are they?
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:06.080]  Well, we know.
[03:16:06.773 --> 03:16:17.700]  A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[03:16:17.700 --> 03:16:21.222]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[03:16:21.222 --> 03:16:29.187]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask, angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[03:16:29.187 --> 03:16:30.207]  How could you?
[03:16:30.207 --> 03:16:32.189]  They're saying from behind the gauze.
[03:16:32.189 --> 03:16:33.389]  How could you?
[03:16:33.389 --> 03:16:36.091]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[03:16:36.744 --> 03:16:38.885]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first.
[03:16:38.885 --> 03:16:40.166]  They're the aggressors.
[03:16:40.166 --> 03:16:44.708]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[03:16:44.708 --> 03:16:49.230]  So the next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[03:16:49.230 --> 03:16:50.710]  Ask politely but firmly.
[03:16:50.710 --> 03:16:52.851]  Would you please take off your mask?
[03:16:52.851 --> 03:16:55.532]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[03:16:55.532 --> 03:16:59.014]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[03:16:59.014 --> 03:17:06.097]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble in an elevator.
[03:17:06.787 --> 03:17:07.828]  It's repulsive.
[03:17:07.828 --> 03:17:09.769]  Don't do it around other people.
[03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:12.650]  That's the message we should send because it's true.
[03:17:12.650 --> 03:17:16.172]  As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[03:17:16.172 --> 03:17:23.256]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid at Walmart.
[03:17:23.256 --> 03:17:24.897]  Call the police immediately.
[03:17:24.897 --> 03:17:26.838]  Contact Child Protective Services.
[03:17:26.838 --> 03:17:29.039]  Keep calling until someone arrives.
[03:17:29.039 --> 03:17:30.780]  What you're looking at is abuse.
[03:17:30.780 --> 03:17:34.342]  It's child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[03:17:35.060 --> 03:17:46.513]  If it's your own children being abused, then- There you have Tucker Carlson calling out people who wear masks outside.
[03:17:46.513 --> 03:17:48.335]  There's absolutely no evidence.
[03:17:48.335 --> 03:17:55.784]  Oh, and by the way, the response to this clip on Twitter within hours was, Tucker Carlson is a national security threat!
[03:17:56.363 --> 03:18:04.727]  And then the very next day the CDC itself comes out and says fully vaccinated Americans can go outside without a mask.
[03:18:04.727 --> 03:18:13.511]  And indeed in many cases, God forbid, non-vaccinated Americans in many situations can also go outside without a mask.
[03:18:13.511 --> 03:18:18.733]  Because the mask outside, and I would argue inside, and I'm going to get into that evidence after the break,
[03:18:19.545 --> 03:18:23.807]  Has no impact on stopping the spread of coronavirus.
[03:18:23.807 --> 03:18:27.109]  It's a completely insane, unnecessary measure.
[03:18:27.109 --> 03:18:33.172]  Then he makes the point about parents forcing children to wear their masks is a form of child abuse.
[03:18:33.172 --> 03:18:34.613]  What's the data behind that?
[03:18:34.613 --> 03:18:38.955]  Does it back up Tucker Carlson that there's absolutely no reason to mask up your kids?
[03:18:38.955 --> 03:18:43.978]  Well the BBC reported back in August coronavirus reassuring study of children's tiny wrists.
[03:18:44.952 --> 03:18:55.554]  There have been no deaths whatsoever of healthy children with no comorbidities in the entire country from coronavirus.
[03:18:56.599 --> 03:19:04.724]  It says, parents should be reassured COVID-19 has not caused the deaths of any otherwise healthy school children in the United Kingdom.
[03:19:04.724 --> 03:19:08.686]  And yet, still to this day, we are seeing kids masked up.
[03:19:08.686 --> 03:19:17.652]  I saw kids the other day in the park, in the outside, masked up, lined up, like slaves being trained for a gulag.
[03:19:17.652 --> 03:19:24.356]  And again, you look at the actual data, zero deaths of healthy children from coronavirus in the United Kingdom.
[03:19:25.083 --> 03:19:28.527]  A pattern that is very much mirrored across the rest of the world.
[03:19:28.527 --> 03:19:37.416]  While the CDC, the day after Tucker Carlson making these statements, apparently made him a national security threat, basically said the same thing.
[03:19:37.416 --> 03:19:39.698]  Wearing masks outside is pointless.
[03:19:39.698 --> 03:19:40.339]  Don't go away.
[03:19:40.339 --> 03:19:43.982]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:43.982 --> 03:19:48.307]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:19:49.093 --> 03:19:53.014]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[03:19:53.014 --> 03:19:56.355]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:19:56.355 --> 03:19:57.816]  And we're all in this together.
[03:19:57.816 --> 03:20:03.178]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:20:03.178 --> 03:20:03.858]  But it's true.
[03:20:03.858 --> 03:20:07.259]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:20:08.019 --> 03:20:10.501]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:20:10.501 --> 03:20:12.562]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:20:12.562 --> 03:20:14.323]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:20:14.323 --> 03:20:15.204]  And we're still here.
[03:20:15.204 --> 03:20:19.626]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:20:19.626 --> 03:20:21.247]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:20:21.247 --> 03:20:23.389]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:20:23.389 --> 03:20:25.110]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:27.772]  And America's still quasi-free.
[03:20:27.772 --> 03:20:32.535]  You can't have InfoWars, it's been proven right being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:20:32.535 --> 03:20:34.976]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:20:34.976 --> 03:20:41.141]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsTore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:20:41.141 --> 03:20:42.922]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:20:42.922 --> 03:20:43.162]  Thank you.
[03:20:44.984 --> 03:20:53.230]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[03:20:53.230 --> 03:20:59.255]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[03:20:59.255 --> 03:21:08.102]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[03:21:08.102 --> 03:21:09.363]  And it really does come down to that.
[03:21:10.584 --> 03:21:17.969]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[03:21:17.969 --> 03:21:21.591]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[03:21:21.591 --> 03:21:23.853]  God is the author of us having free will.
[03:21:24.554 --> 03:21:24.754]  I think?
[03:21:46.186 --> 03:21:46.486]  We're good.
[03:22:03.951 --> 03:22:04.151]  I think?

[03:22:45.199 --> 03:22:53.745]  170 years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[03:22:53.745 --> 03:22:58.909]  That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler, and of course the rest is history.
[03:22:58.909 --> 03:23:08.035]  Our film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms, sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts.
[03:23:08.035 --> 03:23:09.696]  It's been selling online for as much as $300 a
[03:23:10.657 --> 03:23:11.458]  We're good to go.
[03:23:40.817 --> 03:23:47.539]  And more explosive than ever, get it today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:23:47.539 --> 03:23:58.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:58.662 --> 03:24:05.684]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:24:09.048 --> 03:24:25.259]  So as Tucker Carlson rightly pointed out, and he was called a national security threat for doing so, the mask, the face mask, the way it's enforced, is completely pointless from a medical standpoint, and it's a tool of population control.
[03:24:25.259 --> 03:24:33.025]  It's a symbol of genuflecting, grovelling obedience, and it facilitates the harassment
[03:24:34.068 --> 03:24:40.832]  The abuse, the doxxing of people who realise all this and who refuse to wear one.
[03:24:40.832 --> 03:24:42.873]  Now let me state this very clearly.
[03:24:42.873 --> 03:24:54.620]  The virus particle, the coronavirus, COVID-19 virus particle, is 1,000 times smaller than the gap in the fabric of the face mask.
[03:24:54.620 --> 03:24:55.921]  I'll say that again.
[03:24:55.921 --> 03:25:03.566]  The COVID-19 virus particle is 1,000 times smaller than the gap in the fabric of the mask.
[03:25:04.501 --> 03:25:06.842]  Oh my god, how dare he say it!
[03:25:06.842 --> 03:25:09.163]  A dangerous conspiracy theory!
[03:25:09.163 --> 03:25:10.904]  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:25:10.904 --> 03:25:14.946]  No, this is a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University.
[03:25:14.946 --> 03:25:17.207]  Oh!
[03:25:17.207 --> 03:25:19.508]  This is from the U.S.
[03:25:19.508 --> 03:25:27.972]  National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, ncbi.nlm.gov.
[03:25:27.972 --> 03:25:33.915]  The title of this study is Face Masks in the COVID-19 Era, a Health Hypothesis.
[03:25:34.784 --> 03:25:44.790]  The author of this study is Veteran Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System, Cardiology Division, Stanford University.
[03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:46.992]  Let me read the abstract.
[03:25:46.992 --> 03:25:50.554]  Again, this is not David Icke conspiracy theories.
[03:25:50.554 --> 03:25:52.915]  This is not dangerous medical misinformation.
[03:25:52.915 --> 03:25:55.297]  This is a peer-reviewed study.
[03:25:55.297 --> 03:26:03.082]  Many countries across the globe utilize medical and non-medical face masks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity.
[03:26:04.091 --> 03:26:07.032]  of coronavirus disease 2019.
[03:26:07.032 --> 03:26:15.134]  Although scientific evidence supporting face masks efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established.
[03:26:15.134 --> 03:26:18.395]  And I'm going to get into those in a short time.
[03:26:18.395 --> 03:26:26.537]  It has been hypothesized that face masks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use.
[03:26:26.537 --> 03:26:31.819]  And then if you go down and read the efficacy of face masks section of this peer-reviewed study,
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:35.661]  There you see children burning face masks.
[03:26:35.661 --> 03:26:37.962]  What a terrible sight that was.
[03:26:37.962 --> 03:26:40.562]  It wasn't based on red pills at all.
[03:26:40.562 --> 03:26:42.963]  It says efficacy of face masks.
[03:26:42.963 --> 03:26:45.984]  Again, Stanford University peer-reviewed study.
[03:26:45.984 --> 03:26:56.208]  The physical properties of medical and non-medical face masks suggest that face masks are ineffective to block viral particles due to their difference in scales.
[03:26:56.208 --> 03:26:57.368]  According to the current knowledge,
[03:26:58.368 --> 03:27:05.015]  The virus SARS-CoV-19 has a diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm.
[03:27:05.015 --> 03:27:07.437]  Nm stands for nanometers.
[03:27:07.437 --> 03:27:09.739]  That's a billionth of a meter.
[03:27:09.739 --> 03:27:13.243]  Very small particle!
[03:27:13.243 --> 03:27:17.226]  While medical and non-medical face masks thread diameter ranges from 55 um
[03:27:19.787 --> 03:27:34.836]  to 100 to, sorry, 440 UM, that's micrometers, one millionth of a meter, not one billionth, one millionth of a meter, which is more than 1,000 times larger.
[03:27:34.836 --> 03:27:41.560]  Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter, the virus particle, and face mask thread diameter,
[03:27:42.461 --> 03:27:46.302]  The virus is 1,000 times smaller.
[03:27:46.302 --> 03:27:48.123]  Let me repeat that for you again.
[03:27:48.123 --> 03:27:52.825]  The virus is 1,000 times smaller.
[03:27:52.825 --> 03:27:58.247]  COVID-19 can easily pass through any base mass.
[03:27:58.247 --> 03:28:03.869]  Not my words, the words of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University.
[03:28:03.869 --> 03:28:07.811]  Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
[03:28:07.811 --> 03:28:08.631]  Here's another one.
[03:28:10.072 --> 03:28:11.953]  And this was a headline out of Natural News.
[03:28:11.953 --> 03:28:14.173]  Oh my god, Natural News, conspiracy theory website.
[03:28:14.173 --> 03:28:18.654]  No, they're talking about a University of Copenhagen study.
[03:28:18.654 --> 03:28:22.735]  Headline, face masks offer no protection from the coronavirus to the people who wear them.
[03:28:22.735 --> 03:28:28.697]  Again, that's not Mike Adams, that's the University of Copenhagen.
[03:28:28.697 --> 03:28:32.698]  A major study in Denmark found that face masks do not protect the people who wear them.
[03:28:33.686 --> 03:28:36.509]  from contracting the Wuhan coronavirus.
[03:28:36.509 --> 03:28:43.596]  However, the researchers do not have enough data to conclude whether face masks can prevent infected people from spreading the disease.
[03:28:43.596 --> 03:28:46.579]  The study was conducted by scientists.
[03:28:46.579 --> 03:28:48.621]  Again, it wasn't conducted by David Icke.
[03:28:48.621 --> 03:28:50.403]  It was conducted by scientists.
[03:28:50.403 --> 03:28:52.425]  Nothing against David Icke, but I'm just making the point.
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:58.243]  From the University of Copenhagen, this study is considered the best of its kind so far.
[03:28:58.243 --> 03:29:09.091]  There's only two other significant studies, one in Guinea-Bissau and the other in India, have tried to determine whether there is any statistical evidence that face masks offer protection from the coronavirus.
[03:29:09.091 --> 03:29:16.236]  All three studies showed that masks do not prevent a person from catching the disease.
[03:29:16.236 --> 03:29:20.519]  So you can go and read the University of Copenhagen, you can go and read the Stanford University study,
[03:29:21.897 --> 03:29:24.959]  We also had this headline.
[03:29:24.959 --> 03:29:31.383]  Covid swabs and masks appear to contain hooks and strange fibres that can be inhaled directly into the lungs.
[03:29:31.383 --> 03:29:36.466]  Of course we had this headline out of Summit News in addition to that.
[03:29:36.466 --> 03:29:41.489]  Scientist says plastic pollution is shrinking penises will make most men infertile by 2045.
[03:29:44.125 --> 03:29:47.287]  Now what's covering the coral reefs in the Philippines?
[03:29:47.287 --> 03:29:54.713]  What's adding to the giant plastic ocean hellscape that continues to circulate the globe?
[03:29:54.713 --> 03:29:56.654]  Oh look, it's face masks!
[03:29:56.654 --> 03:29:59.617]  I put out a tweet earlier today.
[03:29:59.617 --> 03:30:07.282]  Literally every 100 meters in the park outside from where I live, there's a face mask dropped on the floor.
[03:30:07.282 --> 03:30:12.126]  If you really care so much about public health and public hygiene,
[03:30:12.651 --> 03:30:19.296]  That you need to wear these face masks outside when there's literally zero evidence that they have any effect.
[03:30:19.296 --> 03:30:24.840]  And you're just doing it to virtue signal and so you can point at other people and harass them for not doing the same.
[03:30:24.840 --> 03:30:32.026]  If you really care about public health and hygiene, why are you dropping the frigging masks on the floor?
[03:30:32.026 --> 03:30:35.688]  Disgusting, gross, dirty behaviour.
[03:30:35.688 --> 03:30:40.412]  Nobody wants to go near those masks, not because of coronavirus in my case, because they're just filthy.
[03:30:41.129 --> 03:30:45.451]  Why are you dropping them on the floor if you care so much about public health?
[03:30:45.451 --> 03:30:47.471]  They're everywhere.
[03:30:47.471 --> 03:30:50.072]  Headline!
[03:30:50.072 --> 03:30:55.814]  1.5 billion face masks added to plastic ocean hellscape.
[03:30:55.814 --> 03:31:05.237]  Approximately 1.5 billion face masks are expected to be dumped into the sea in just one year according to an environmental group monitoring the level of pollution in the world's oceans.
[03:31:05.237 --> 03:31:06.398]  Nobody cares!
[03:31:07.378 --> 03:31:11.842]  Because friggin' Greta Thunberg hasn't said anything about it.
[03:31:11.842 --> 03:31:35.941]  Oh, but we have to be so worried about a life-giving gas, carbon dioxide, killing the planet, when literally tons and tons of these face masks are now circulating the world's oceans, giving off chemical pollution, giving off toxins that cause the shrinking of penises and infertility in men.
[03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:44.824]  National File reported, study chemical that causes penises to shrink found in face masks.
[03:31:44.824 --> 03:32:00.332]  Dr. Shana Swan, a professor of environmental medicine and public health at Mount Sinai Health System, another dangerous conspiracy theorist evidently, has warned in a new book that phthalates, a chemical commonly used in the manufacturing of plastics, can shrink penises and decrease male fertility.
[03:32:00.332 --> 03:32:01.893]  Where do you find those plastics?
[03:32:01.893 --> 03:32:03.914]  In face masks.
[03:32:03.914 --> 03:32:05.335]  Now they're all over the coral reef,
[03:32:06.471 --> 03:32:12.296]  They're part of the giant trash ocean pile which is circulating the globe.
[03:32:12.296 --> 03:32:20.383]  Leftists don't give a damn because Greta Thunberg hasn't got up in front of billionaires at the Davos conference and cried about it.
[03:32:20.383 --> 03:32:24.946]  No one cares!
[03:32:24.946 --> 03:32:29.991]  After the break we're going to get into the social credit score system in China, how it's worse in the West.
[03:32:29.991 --> 03:32:33.553]  We're also going to get into comments from Joe Rogan about vaccines.
[03:32:33.553 --> 03:32:35.235]  And just to finish up on this point again,
[03:32:36.235 --> 03:32:46.422]  Tucker Carlson being viciously attacked for saying that parents who force their kids to wear pointless face masks as a form of virtue signalling and population control should be confronted.
[03:32:46.422 --> 03:32:50.505]  Again, I go back to the actual statistics which back him up.
[03:32:50.505 --> 03:32:58.531]  Not a single child in the UK has died from coronavirus and that pattern is very much replicated across the rest of the world.
[03:32:58.531 --> 03:33:04.075]  And yet still, not only do I see these masks strewn all over the floor, in the park, in the streets,
[03:33:05.174 --> 03:33:16.024]  They're being worn by children in schools despite the fact there's no actual law which was passed by the government which mandates schools to enforce a mask policy inside classrooms.
[03:33:16.024 --> 03:33:21.609]  But many of these schools decided to enforce the policy on their own anyway.
[03:33:21.609 --> 03:33:25.673]  And I don't have time to get into it here but we have major studies coming out today and yesterday
[03:33:26.841 --> 03:33:41.227]  Showing that not only have kids, their language skills decreased rapidly because of being kept away from school, these masks are preventing them from forming interpersonal relationships and they're causing even more young depression.
[03:33:41.227 --> 03:33:42.448]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[03:33:43.470 --> 03:33:51.935]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:51.935 --> 03:34:02.481]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:34:02.481 --> 03:34:12.127]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:34:12.467 --> 03:34:12.967]  We're good to go!
[03:34:35.973 --> 03:34:43.417]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[03:34:43.417 --> 03:34:45.017]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[03:34:45.017 --> 03:34:45.778]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:34:45.778 --> 03:34:46.498]  Trying to move quicker.
[03:34:46.498 --> 03:34:47.338]  Hey, Alex.
[03:34:47.338 --> 03:34:47.758]  Welcome.
[03:34:47.758 --> 03:34:52.921]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[03:34:52.921 --> 03:34:55.862]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[03:34:56.282 --> 03:35:02.770]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that will never go away.
[03:35:02.770 --> 03:35:04.432]  Living Defense saved my life.
[03:35:04.432 --> 03:35:08.596]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[03:35:08.596 --> 03:35:10.038]  Living Defense brought me back.
[03:35:10.879 --> 03:35:15.723]  Just to quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[03:35:15.723 --> 03:35:16.604]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[03:35:33.337 --> 03:35:34.698]  Right where we're at, brother.
[03:35:34.698 --> 03:35:45.528]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[03:35:45.528 --> 03:35:48.591]  I one trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[03:35:48.591 --> 03:35:50.012]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[03:35:50.012 --> 03:35:51.533]  I'll just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[03:35:51.533 --> 03:35:53.936]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[03:35:53.936 --> 03:35:54.977]  That's embarrassing.
[03:35:54.977 --> 03:35:57.499]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[03:35:58.536 --> 03:35:59.917]  But I'll tell you this right now.
[03:35:59.917 --> 03:36:02.398]  You're nuts if you don't get storable food.
[03:36:02.398 --> 03:36:07.400]  And I've got the biggest, best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[03:36:07.400 --> 03:36:11.842]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes even better?
[03:36:11.842 --> 03:36:12.842]  Yeah.
[03:36:12.842 --> 03:36:14.283]  Most of the stuff tastes amazing.
[03:36:14.283 --> 03:36:15.423]  Some of it tastes okay.
[03:36:15.423 --> 03:36:18.965]  The point is it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[03:36:18.965 --> 03:36:21.506]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[03:36:22.398 --> 03:36:32.826]  We've got three months, six months, your supplies right now, and I twisted their arm so hard to give you 10% off again, because you're so conditionally buying our super sale.
[03:36:32.826 --> 03:36:34.708]  We're doing it one more time.
[03:36:34.708 --> 03:36:36.930]  Infowarrestore.com.
[03:36:36.930 --> 03:36:39.532]  Infowarrestore.com.
[03:36:39.532 --> 03:36:42.454]  10% off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[03:36:42.454 --> 03:36:43.515]  Get ready while you still can.
[03:36:45.635 --> 03:36:52.241]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[03:36:52.241 --> 03:36:54.563]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S.
[03:36:54.563 --> 03:37:04.513]  injected healthy men, women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[03:37:05.598 --> 03:37:10.023]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, is one of the most important films ever made.
[03:37:10.023 --> 03:37:16.691]  14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg group's activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[03:37:16.691 --> 03:37:18.373]  The film now is more important than ever.
[03:37:18.373 --> 03:37:21.136]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[03:37:21.136 --> 03:37:21.476]  We haven't
[03:37:21.516 --> 03:37:22.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:37:58.374 --> 03:38:06.895]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:38:06.895 --> 03:38:19.518]  Well, the mob weren't satisfied in their bloodlust when it came to Rose McGowan calling Democrats a cult, when it came to Tucker Carlson calling mask zealots a cult.
[03:38:19.518 --> 03:38:21.718]  No, they wanted one more victim.
[03:38:21.718 --> 03:38:27.439]  And the next victim, apparently the cancel culture mob, is once again Joe Rogan.
[03:38:28.695 --> 03:38:34.457]  Now, I'm going to get into some comments about how his show has changed after he moved to Spotify.
[03:38:34.457 --> 03:38:39.179]  But he's in hot water once again, simply for telling the truth.
[03:38:39.179 --> 03:38:40.339]  Same thing every time.
[03:38:40.339 --> 03:38:48.582]  Every time I see somebody, a Rogan, a Carlson, a McGowan, any of these kind of people trending on Twitter, you just know before you click it.
[03:38:48.582 --> 03:38:50.663]  Oh my God, what horrible thing have they said now?
[03:38:50.663 --> 03:38:52.444]  Oh, they've told the truth.
[03:38:52.444 --> 03:38:55.605]  They've told the truth and they're being targeted once again.
[03:38:56.733 --> 03:39:04.015]  And I'm going to get into why, again, this proves that our own social credit system is worse in the West than it is in China.
[03:39:04.015 --> 03:39:11.997]  But let's go to these comments on vaccinating kids and young healthy people from Joe Rogan on his show yesterday.
[03:39:11.997 --> 03:39:12.677]  Let's hit it.
[03:39:12.677 --> 03:39:16.038]  And people say, do you think it's safe to get vaccinated?
[03:39:16.038 --> 03:39:18.919]  I've said, yeah, I think for the most part it's safe to get vaccinated.
[03:39:18.919 --> 03:39:19.219]  I do.
[03:39:19.219 --> 03:39:19.759]  I do.
[03:39:20.780 --> 03:39:24.342]  But if you're like 21 years old and you say to me, should I get vaccinated?
[03:39:24.342 --> 03:39:26.203]  I'll go, no.
[03:39:26.203 --> 03:39:27.624]  Are you healthy?
[03:39:27.624 --> 03:39:28.844]  Are you a healthy person?
[03:39:28.844 --> 03:39:33.247]  Like, look, don't do anything stupid, but you should take care of yourself.
[03:39:33.247 --> 03:39:40.851]  If you're a healthy person and you're exercising all the time and you're young and you're eating well, I don't think you need to worry about this.
[03:39:40.851 --> 03:39:42.392]  Yeah, I tend to agree with you.
[03:39:42.392 --> 03:39:45.914]  But there's a lot of jobs that will tell you you need to have this.
[03:39:45.914 --> 03:39:46.834]  Well, that's what's starting to happen.
[03:39:47.295 --> 03:39:49.697]  People are worried about them doing it for their children.
[03:39:49.697 --> 03:39:54.823]  And we talked about this earlier, that you might have to have your children vaccinated.
[03:39:54.823 --> 03:40:00.570]  And you know, I can tell you as someone whose both my children got the virus, it was nothing.
[03:40:00.570 --> 03:40:01.871]  I mean, I hate to say that.
[03:40:01.871 --> 03:40:05.235]  If someone's children died from this, I'm very sorry that that happened.
[03:40:06.224 --> 03:40:12.769]  I'm not in any way diminishing that, but I'm saying the personal experience that my children had with COVID was nothing.
[03:40:12.769 --> 03:40:16.713]  One of the kids had a headache, the other one didn't feel good for a couple days.
[03:40:16.713 --> 03:40:20.376]  I mean, not feel good, like no big deal.
[03:40:20.376 --> 03:40:24.399]  No coughing, no aching, no agony.
[03:40:24.399 --> 03:40:25.400]  There was none of that.
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:26.921]  It was very mild.
[03:40:26.921 --> 03:40:29.103]  It was akin to them getting a cold.
[03:40:29.637 --> 03:40:38.964]  Yeah, and you can have this thing where it's like you were saying this virtue signaling and this kind of like theatrical display of I get the vaccine, what a good person I am, I care about everyone.
[03:40:38.964 --> 03:40:45.949]  But you're like, look, my daughter's a lot younger than your kids, but I'm like, yeah, I'm not injecting my daughter with something to virtue signal.
[03:40:46.349 --> 03:40:47.670]  Like, I'm not doing that.
[03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:55.815]  If there's something that she's of no risk, statistically has no risk from, I'm sorry, I'm not taking any experiment on her.
[03:40:55.815 --> 03:40:57.216]  And that's my attitude toward it.
[03:40:57.216 --> 03:40:59.457]  But it's amazing that that's controversial.
[03:40:59.457 --> 03:41:05.381]  That even saying that, I'm not going to inject my child with the vaccine, is controversial.
[03:41:05.381 --> 03:41:06.341]  It's crazy.
[03:41:06.341 --> 03:41:12.245]  Because again, we are not talking about even the flu, that we just found out killed 22,000 people last year.
[03:41:12.245 --> 03:41:13.626]  We're not talking about that.
[03:41:13.626 --> 03:41:15.167]  We're talking about something that is not
[03:41:16.924 --> 03:41:39.773]  Now, first of all, in response to that, I haven't seen a story where a celebrity, or even people that I know personally, having the vaccine and not having some kind of side effect.
[03:41:39.773 --> 03:41:44.635]  Not having awful flu-like symptoms for days, even for over a week on end.
[03:41:45.268 --> 03:41:47.710]  In some cases, people have died, obviously.
[03:41:47.710 --> 03:42:02.902]  Now, if you want to take that risk to get that vaccine, to protect yourself against a virus, which for most people you literally have a 99.8% chance of surviving, according to the CDC's own numbers, if you want to do that, go ahead.
[03:42:02.902 --> 03:42:08.367]  You'll notice that Rogan there said his two kids got the COVID virus and it was basically nothing.
[03:42:09.412 --> 03:42:10.853]  And I go back to the original point.
[03:42:10.853 --> 03:42:17.616]  The BBC reported in the UK, zero kids who were healthy, who got COVID, died from COVID.
[03:42:17.616 --> 03:42:18.696]  Zero.
[03:42:18.696 --> 03:42:21.517]  You know who did die from COVID?
[03:42:21.517 --> 03:42:25.639]  Children with comorbidities, including obesity.
[03:42:25.639 --> 03:42:27.080]  And yet, what now do we see?
[03:42:27.080 --> 03:42:31.802]  I'm going to go back to Rogan in a second, but I just wanted to intersect with this.
[03:42:31.802 --> 03:42:38.725]  Headline out of Information Liberation, CNN, says, here's a list of free stuff you can get if you've been vaxxed.
[03:42:39.412 --> 03:42:53.698]  So now they're literally offering to young people Budweiser beer, free Budweiser beer, free Juniors cheesecake, whatever that is, free Krispy Kreme donuts every day!
[03:42:53.698 --> 03:43:05.303]  It says you can get one free glazed donut every day if you take your vaccination card to any Krispy Kreme location in the US, the company said in a press release.
[03:43:06.013 --> 03:43:21.803]  So they're offering Nathan's Hot Dogs, Junior's Cheesecake and Krispy Kreme to kids when you have an obesity epidemic in America, which has killed children because they got the coronavirus, they had a comorbidity and they died.
[03:43:21.803 --> 03:43:26.786]  And yet their reward for getting the vaccine is to make them fatter.
[03:43:26.786 --> 03:43:29.608]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:43:29.608 --> 03:43:34.911]  Then on the wider point of Rogan's spiel there, which he's getting cancelled for again today,
[03:43:36.010 --> 03:43:39.331]  I mean, you have to hand it to him to some extent.
[03:43:39.331 --> 03:43:59.816]  It doesn't appear like he's self-censoring in the fear that the episodes will be removed from Spotify, and yet we do know that over a dozen, it was probably two dozen or more episodes, when Rogan switched over from his usual format on YouTube to Spotify, were removed, and they were never reinstated.
[03:43:59.816 --> 03:44:01.797]  This one could also get removed.
[03:44:01.797 --> 03:44:02.337]  You know why?
[03:44:03.368 --> 03:44:15.976]  Because on numerous occasions, Spotify employees, woke maniacal idiots, have literally staged mutinies in their offices because of something that Joe Rogan said.
[03:44:15.976 --> 03:44:25.522]  So at some point, you know that top executive level management is going to break, and they're not only going to start removing more Joe Rogan podcast episodes,
[03:44:26.505 --> 03:44:53.620]  They're going to start trying to control what he can say, and whether he bows to that remains to be seen, but judging from this clip, props to him he hasn't bowed so far, despite the intense reaction of the hysterical hate mob, which has facilitated itself via Twitter to destroy people's lives, to have them de-platformed, to have their bank accounts removed because of their opinions, and I'm going to get on to that in a moment.
[03:44:54.218 --> 03:44:56.719]  Funny comment on the thread, though, of this Rogan video.
[03:44:56.719 --> 03:45:11.002]  Somebody said, in reference to the Spotify mutinies, the employees have had three mutinies this morning, then lunch, followed by two more afternoon mutinies, followed by a break, then 5pm time to go home before tomorrow's mutinies.
[03:45:11.002 --> 03:45:15.042]  So expect to see that over the next 24 hours.
[03:45:15.042 --> 03:45:17.303]  But you've got to hand it to him, he's still speaking the truth, right?
[03:45:18.496 --> 03:45:26.022]  Meanwhile, headline, Chai Coms hit citizens with 10 point social credit score penalty for not wearing a mask in public.
[03:45:26.022 --> 03:45:39.652]  And again, Conservatives all day long, establishment Conservatives on social media will call out, will slam China for introducing this onerous, chilling social credit score without ever acknowledging that we have it worse in the West.
[03:45:40.652 --> 03:45:50.197]  Which he saw today with Nick Fuentes literally being put on a no-fly list for his political opinions despite the fact that he's committed no crime.
[03:45:50.197 --> 03:45:55.740]  Despite the fact that he didn't occupy the Capitol building back on January 6.
[03:45:55.740 --> 03:45:59.081]  He's purely being punished for his thoughts.
[03:45:59.081 --> 03:46:02.583]  He engaged in thought crime and he's being punished for it.
[03:46:02.583 --> 03:46:06.065]  We have the social credit score system already in the West and then you see
[03:46:07.777 --> 03:46:32.134]  Again, establishment conservatives on Twitter who can always be relied upon to flake out and flounce when the going gets tough, responding to this story by saying, oh, but it was the airlines who barred Fuentes from flying because he previously had an incident where some screeching Karen flight attendant shouted at him to put his mask over his nose.
[03:46:32.134 --> 03:46:34.015]  He refused and he got off the plane.
[03:46:34.941 --> 03:46:38.683]  So it was the airlines enforcing this no-fly ban on Nick Fuentes.
[03:46:38.683 --> 03:46:41.424]  Well, for a start, that's wrong according to what he said.
[03:46:41.424 --> 03:46:47.266]  It was the TSA directly who enforced the ban, not the airlines.
[03:46:47.266 --> 03:46:50.007]  And then the other point is, oh, it's OK.
[03:46:50.007 --> 03:46:52.028]  It's OK if a private company does it.
[03:46:52.028 --> 03:46:53.149]  No, it's not.
[03:46:53.149 --> 03:46:57.250]  That's the same social credit score system.
[03:46:57.250 --> 03:47:01.712]  And there's a lengthy London Times article on this subject, which I encourage you all to read.
[03:47:01.712 --> 03:47:03.293]  I've done a boil-down summary of it.
[03:47:04.486 --> 03:47:25.335]  It says the Communist Chinese government is punishing citizens in some areas of the country who commit COVID-related transgressions such as not wearing a mask in public by deducting 10 points from their social credit score and in some cases putting them on no-fly blacklists, which is exactly what happened to Fuentes, whether you think it's because of his
[03:47:26.169 --> 03:47:38.672]  Being in the capital for a Trump rally on January 6th, God forbid, or because he had an encounter with a Karen flight attendant for not wearing his mask properly, it's the same system here in the West.
[03:47:38.672 --> 03:47:51.495]  And I make the point in the article that we have it worse and that the Communist Chinese dictators could only dream of having it as good as the woke mob has it in the West.
[03:47:52.256 --> 03:47:55.098]  Because, as we know, these hate groups have weaponised Twitter.
[03:47:55.098 --> 03:47:56.399]  We saw it with Rose McGowan.
[03:47:56.399 --> 03:47:58.080]  We saw it with Tucker Carlson.
[03:47:58.080 --> 03:48:01.422]  We see it with private citizens on a daily basis.
[03:48:01.422 --> 03:48:13.149]  They've weaponised Twitter to facilitate the organised harassment, doxing, deplatforming and all-round life-ruining of Conservatives and anyone who questions the mob's narrative on a daily basis.
