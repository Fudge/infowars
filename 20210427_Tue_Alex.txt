[00:00.000 --> 00:15.520]  This is going to be an incredibly jam-packed historic transmission.
[00:15.520 --> 00:17.880]  I know how to defeat the globalist.
[00:17.880 --> 00:22.720]  I've done deep research and I've had major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.
[00:22.720 --> 00:25.640]  I'm going to do my best to lay it all out today.
[00:25.640 --> 00:29.920]  The pastor's now been swat-teamed, the Polish pastor up in Canada who's sitting out of
[00:29.920 --> 00:30.920]  their illegal actions.
[00:30.920 --> 00:31.920]  He's now been swat-teamed.
[00:31.920 --> 00:33.960]  He'll be joining us coming up next hour.
[00:33.960 --> 00:34.960]  That happened yesterday.
[00:34.960 --> 00:41.000]  Steve Quill will be joining us and another great patriot has been put on a no-fly list.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.920]  Nick Fuentes just gave us this info minutes ago.
[00:43.920 --> 00:46.280]  That'll be an exclusive coming up.
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.520]  We have Biden, our Lord and King and Master telling us he's about to lift some of the
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.520]  mask mandate.
[00:51.520 --> 00:52.520]  We'll give you the details of that.
[00:52.520 --> 00:56.480]  But first, a new Greg Rees report dealing with big farmers' enslavement of humanity.
[00:56.480 --> 01:03.480]  Not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue like gel
[01:03.480 --> 01:07.920]  engineered to continuously test your blood.
[01:07.920 --> 01:16.200]  People are finding strange fibers inside their masks and in the COVID-19 test swabs.
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.560]  Many people are pointing out the similarities between these fibers and more gel-ins disease.
[01:21.560 --> 01:30.440]  A mysterious unexplained skin condition characterized by small fibers emerging from skin sores.
[01:30.440 --> 01:37.440]  But the fibers we are seeing in the mask and test swabs seem to be different.
[01:37.440 --> 01:42.400]  Many have suggested that they are normal constructive fibers.
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.840]  But upon close examination, they do exhibit strange qualities.
[01:46.840 --> 01:54.360]  In this video, when affected by wind, the fiber behaves exactly how one would expect.
[01:54.360 --> 01:57.920]  But when breathed upon, it reacts differently.
[01:57.920 --> 02:01.080]  It appears to come to life.
[02:01.080 --> 02:07.240]  The fibers look and behave similar to how theragrippers are described.
[02:07.240 --> 02:14.000]  Inspired by parasitic worms, theragrippers were created at Johns Hopkins University.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.160]  Fibers are as small as a speck of dust and designed to deliver time-release medication
[02:19.160 --> 02:21.120]  into the host body.
[02:21.120 --> 02:26.480]  They operate like small, compressed springs with a temperature-triggered coating that
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.000]  releases the stored energy autonomously at body temperature.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.880]  Compressed springs with temperature-triggered coating.
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.080]  The mask fiber's reaction to human breath could easily be described as spring-like.
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.240]  And while one is wearing the mask, the fibers would be springing in towards their mouths
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.760]  as they breathe, as if the masks were a delivery system for hidden theragrippers loaded with
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.760]  drugs ready to be released into the host's bloodstream.
[02:58.760 --> 03:06.320]  The same spring-like fibers can be found in both the masks and the COVID-19 test swabs.
[03:06.320 --> 03:12.160]  Under magnification, the test swab appears to have glass-like fibers.
[03:12.160 --> 03:18.360]  In one experiment, the PCR test swab was rubbed against a piece of raw meat to roughly emulate
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.520]  the living tissue inside our nasal cavity.
[03:21.520 --> 03:27.760]  And several of the glass-like fibers deeply penetrated themselves into the flesh.
[03:27.760 --> 03:33.360]  Is this happening inside of our nasal cavity when we are being tested?
[03:33.360 --> 03:35.200]  Perhaps this is normal.
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.240]  There was a time in the not-so-distant past when this would all sound crazy, but those
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.840]  days are over.
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.040]  Millions of people are proudly volunteering to have their DNA permanently experimented
[03:48.040 --> 03:50.880]  on by Big Pharma.
[03:50.880 --> 03:53.600]  We are living in a new era.
[03:53.600 --> 04:00.040]  DARPA has been developing BCIs, brain-computer interfaces, since the 1960s.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.960]  And now they are ready to inject our military with a technology that will continuously test
[04:04.960 --> 04:05.960]  their blood.
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.640]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like
[04:11.640 --> 04:15.400]  gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.800]  The overwhelming desire of the powers that be seems to be putting something inside of
[04:20.800 --> 04:27.600]  us, putting an experimental vaccine inside of us, putting the remnants of an aborted
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.200]  child inside of us.
[04:31.200 --> 04:34.240]  How is that any different than rape?
[04:34.240 --> 04:40.560]  And how is it that anyone is actually okay with any of this?
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.640]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.760]  The report just went live at Band.Video, out of the park, important.
[04:49.760 --> 04:59.120]  Band.Video, left-hand side, click the navigation bar and Greg Rees is ready for you right there.
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.200]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[05:02.200 --> 05:03.920]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[05:03.920 --> 05:05.400]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[05:05.400 --> 05:07.800]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[05:07.800 --> 05:08.800]  That's embarrassing.
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.840]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll tell you this
[05:12.840 --> 05:13.840]  right now.
[05:13.840 --> 05:16.200]  You're nuts if you don't get storable food.
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.400]  And I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food and the lowest price
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.400]  you're going to find.
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.920]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes even better?
[05:25.920 --> 05:26.920]  Yeah.
[05:26.920 --> 05:27.920]  Most of this stuff tastes amazing.
[05:27.920 --> 05:28.920]  Some of it tastes okay.
[05:28.920 --> 05:32.760]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.240]  Compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[05:36.240 --> 05:37.760]  We've got three months, six months.
[05:37.760 --> 05:38.760]  Your supply is right now.
[05:38.760 --> 05:44.960]  And I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again because you're so conditionally
[05:44.960 --> 05:52.440]  buying under Supercell, we're doing it one more time, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com,
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.280]  10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[05:56.280 --> 06:14.320]  Get ready while you still can.
[06:14.320 --> 06:21.320]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[06:21.320 --> 06:25.720]  It's Tuesday, April 27th, the year is 2021.
[06:25.720 --> 06:36.800]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, very blessed and honored that you've chosen to join us today.
[06:36.800 --> 06:37.800]  So here we are.
[06:37.800 --> 06:44.160]  I'm going to be very calm here because this is so important and so huge and so illegal
[06:44.160 --> 06:51.680]  and so over the top that if we just put this information out there, it'll become normalized.
[06:51.680 --> 06:53.120]  We must soak this in.
[06:53.120 --> 06:54.440]  We must cogitate on it.
[06:54.440 --> 06:58.280]  We must mold around psychologically, spiritually.
[06:58.280 --> 07:04.640]  We should pray about this because this is all now revealing itself.
[07:04.640 --> 07:16.400]  It's coming out the open just in one stack of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
[07:16.400 --> 07:27.720]  14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1 inch tall stack of 24 stacks.
[07:27.720 --> 07:37.240]  This is just today's news is so mind-blowing, so key, so important that I shudder at even
[07:37.240 --> 07:40.000]  trying to properly document it.
[07:40.000 --> 07:47.560]  So I will just direct you in this segment to what the big stories are in my view and
[07:47.560 --> 07:50.840]  then I will humbly try to cover it as best I can and then we've got big guests coming
[07:50.840 --> 07:59.360]  up as well with SWAT teams attacking churches in Canada now and just yesterday and Nick
[07:59.360 --> 08:05.280]  Foyne has put on a no fly list joining us and Steve Quayle coming on and just all hell
[08:05.280 --> 08:08.720]  breaking was just going to get crazier from here on out, but at least it's going to be
[08:08.720 --> 08:10.160]  out in the open.
[08:10.160 --> 08:16.800]  But let me give you the big news and all of these are huge and all of these connect together.
[08:16.800 --> 08:20.600]  Obviously, Biden doesn't have the power to mandate masks, he doesn't have the power to
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.920]  say now you can go outside without a mask, now you can go to Fourth of July, I'm your
[08:24.920 --> 08:28.640]  God, I'm your king, I'm your savior.
[08:28.640 --> 08:33.520]  That is a gigantic story and Tucker Carlson coming out and saying don't just not wear
[08:33.520 --> 08:39.880]  a mask in public, educate people that it doesn't protect them and that it actually hurts children's
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.760]  health psychologically and physically in major studies.
[08:44.760 --> 08:51.160]  Well, next year's news today, I've been out since April of last year every week in an
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.960]  armored vehicle because the left in Austin attacks us with bottles, hatchets and hammers
[08:55.960 --> 08:58.200]  and other devices, it's all on video.
[08:58.200 --> 09:03.760]  Back to that up later, the guy attacking the armored vehicle with a hammer please, it's
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.560]  happening about five times now, but we go out and tell them, hey, the mask are never
[09:07.560 --> 09:12.160]  coming off until you say no, that gives you bacterial pneumonia, it psychologically screws
[09:12.160 --> 09:18.280]  up children and it doesn't protect you.
[09:18.280 --> 09:23.080]  And Carlson is now saying that you need to go out and just like you see somebody beating
[09:23.080 --> 09:28.360]  their kid at Walmart, you need to say, hey, you need to stop that.
[09:28.360 --> 09:32.640]  Well, frankly, you're their parent, the kid's out of control, maybe they need to go to spat,
[09:32.640 --> 09:33.640]  maybe he's being too liberal there.
[09:33.640 --> 09:38.040]  The point is, this is child abuse.
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.720]  More like you see somebody breaking the skin at Walmart.
[09:42.720 --> 09:46.240]  I'm all about reward and punishment with kids, carrot, the sticks, maybe he hasn't
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.680]  needed a lot, but sometimes it is needed, but the point is to the left is that you're
[09:50.680 --> 09:53.400]  abusing children here, that's coming up.
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.680]  Now, that's not the number one COVID story, it's very important it ties into Biden, that
[09:57.680 --> 10:05.120]  whole discussion of pushing back, of getting on the offense, because they're bullies and
[10:05.120 --> 10:08.560]  say you can't get on an airplane or have a job until you take an experimental vaccine
[10:08.560 --> 10:12.720]  that doesn't even protect you, it's been banned in a bunch of countries, it's preposterous.
[10:12.720 --> 10:18.000]  That's an important one story out of this.
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.920]  We've got three articles on it, what Biden said to announce today, so the statistics
[10:22.920 --> 10:27.600]  on the mask and then what Tucker said, that's my research here, this isn't props I put out
[10:27.600 --> 10:34.160]  here on the desk to impress you, I went over all this today and last night, all of it.
[10:34.160 --> 10:39.760]  So that's one little three page thing out of this.
[10:39.760 --> 10:43.960]  Just imagine my frustration every day trying to get to all this, it's impossible, here's
[10:43.960 --> 10:51.040]  the big super supreme enchilada.
[10:51.040 --> 10:57.160]  Medical doctors all over the world from Germany to Canada that say this are being arrested
[10:57.160 --> 11:00.160]  by the police, that's coming up.
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.880]  German police ransacked the house of doctor every provides evidence in court that children
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.680]  are endangered in their mental, physical and spiritual well-being by the obligation to
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.680]  wear face mask.
[11:08.680 --> 11:16.920]  I know this, they're going to hate leftist control for each for the rest of their life.
[11:16.920 --> 11:19.600]  Now you think that's big?
[11:19.600 --> 11:26.400]  That is the least important stack of the COVID news and it's incredibly important.
[11:26.400 --> 11:28.880]  Get ready for this.
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.600]  I was sitting there this morning with my iPad, checking out enemy publications on one of
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.800]  the New York Times and started choking on my bite of egg, literally coughing it up because
[11:39.800 --> 11:44.000]  it's just so outrageous.
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.880]  Not only have they shut India down and they admit starved 2 million people to death extra
[11:49.880 --> 11:54.240]  with the lockdown that's now back in place and will kill millions more and so that's
[11:54.240 --> 11:57.920]  why there's more funeral pyres there.
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.320]  They not only banned the Pfizer shot three months ago because in illegal testing it turned
[12:02.320 --> 12:07.480]  out Pfizer was doing a bunch of people got sick and died, hold on to your hat.
[12:07.480 --> 12:13.320]  The AstraZeneca vaccine now banned in more than 30 countries, 21 in Europe, the Philippines,
[12:13.320 --> 12:15.480]  a bunch of others.
[12:15.480 --> 12:19.240]  Had the crew print me a big list of those today.
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.840]  So many countries, I can't even keep track.
[12:20.840 --> 12:23.960]  Every time I think there's 30 something it's probably 50 something, I mean there's just
[12:23.960 --> 12:29.640]  new ones all the time because of deaths and blood clots and strokes and heart attacks.
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.320]  The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most banned vaccine in the world and when you say hey
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.120]  I don't want it, they go you're insane, it's totally safe even though it's banned everywhere.
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.560]  Gaslighting, it gets more out of control.
[12:45.560 --> 12:51.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden announced yesterday he's going to send aid to India.
[12:51.760 --> 12:58.200]  It's not vitamin C, it's not vitamin D, it's not an end of the lockdown, it's not zinc,
[12:58.200 --> 13:01.480]  it's not even oxygen bottles.
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.960]  When any medical doctors in the Indians aren't stupid, they're poor because the population
[13:05.960 --> 13:11.920]  is so huge that you can do inhaled steroid and 100% of the time helps you, knocks it
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.920]  out.
[13:12.920 --> 13:14.600]  They're not telling them any of that.
[13:14.600 --> 13:22.440]  They're shipping them tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca that's even banned in
[13:22.440 --> 13:27.880]  the U.S., it's not authorized in the U.S., Biden's going to dump Europe's banned vaccine
[13:27.880 --> 13:28.880]  on the Indians.
[13:28.880 --> 13:29.880]  Total war crime.
[13:29.880 --> 13:43.400]  I mean there's no end, wait it gets worse, that's only the fourth article.
[13:43.400 --> 13:45.440]  Now you're starting to get where I'm coming from.
[13:45.440 --> 13:51.640]  I could talk the whole show and maybe we should about just dumping a banned vaccine in 21 countries
[13:51.640 --> 13:57.760]  in Europe and all total 30 something around the world because it kills so many people,
[13:57.760 --> 14:05.880]  makes your blood basically dissolve, makes all your platelets disappear.
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.160]  And they call it a blood clot, it's not a blood clot, your blood just falls apart.
[14:10.160 --> 14:18.320]  Oh but U.S. is sending vaccine materials to rabbits, COVID ravaged India, Bloomberg.
[14:18.320 --> 14:24.960]  It should be U.S. dumps, unapproved vaccine in the U.S., banned across the world, dangerous
[14:24.960 --> 14:32.400]  drug just like what Bayer did when they got caught in Europe putting HIV and hepatitis
[14:32.400 --> 14:35.360]  in the factor rate with Bill Clinton out of Arkansas.
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.480]  They would certify all the blood out of Arkansas as tested and safe, they would not certify
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.960]  it knowing it had HIV and hepatitis, they would mix it together in giant vats, purify
[14:43.960 --> 14:50.520]  out the blood clotting factor, they called it factor rate and then Bayer, a good old
[14:50.520 --> 14:58.400]  Hal Hitler Bayer, their own executives in Australia and Canada and France are on the
[14:58.400 --> 15:08.480]  records saying there are too many hemophiliacs, dump it on the third world, that all came
[15:08.480 --> 15:16.200]  out at the time, and they even had meetings about there's too many hemophiliacs, dump
[15:16.200 --> 15:25.880]  it on them, that's a quote, dump it on them, because there's a liberal, yes, and now the
[15:25.880 --> 15:31.240]  banned vaccine, oh we're going to give it to the Indians and Bloomberg's loving and
[15:31.240 --> 15:36.360]  liberal, oh, and now he's going to commit a holocaust against the Indians but it's okay
[15:36.360 --> 15:39.640]  because he's liberal.
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.160]  That's just, oh that's just two of the COVID stories, I'll tell you about the other ones
[15:43.160 --> 15:48.560]  when we come back, there's so much, but then there's pushback and that's really overall
[15:48.560 --> 15:52.640]  probably the most important, isn't it, because we don't start standing up, we're all dead
[15:52.640 --> 16:18.360]  in doornails, it's Indians today, it's all of us tomorrow, it is a big idea, a new world
[16:18.360 --> 16:25.820]  order, that's possibly going on.
[16:25.820 --> 16:30.280]  The Globalist feared this film made 14 years ago, it is the blueprint for their plan to
[16:30.280 --> 16:33.620]  figure the world, it is the blueprint for the great reset, it is endgame, blueprint for
[16:33.620 --> 16:37.400]  global and slave bees, I'm making it available right now at enforrestore.com with a zero
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.300]  country code, meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world, I strongly suggest
[16:41.300 --> 16:46.380]  you get this film, in game, at enforrestore.com, I strongly suggest that you make copies and
[16:46.380 --> 16:50.180]  share it. And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy
[16:50.180 --> 16:55.100]  to that they make copies and share it as well. That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning
[16:55.100 --> 16:59.700]  we the people cannot be stopped. The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are
[16:59.700 --> 17:05.540]  creating insecurity, crime, war and famine. All of us should do everything we can to get
[17:05.540 --> 17:10.460]  prepared and get ready for ourselves and our family's sakes, but also our community. And
[17:10.460 --> 17:16.060]  citizensstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest
[17:16.060 --> 17:20.140]  price you're going to find. Again, this is high quality body armor at the lowest price

[17:51.220 --> 18:00.740]  get it now at Citizensstronghold.com. Promo code ALICE and get 10% off.
[18:00.740 --> 18:18.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:18.580 --> 18:26.580]  Big brother mainstream media government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[18:26.580 --> 18:43.940]  Well, Tucker Carlson, as usual, knocked it out of the park last night. And he said, look,
[18:43.940 --> 18:48.820]  you have MIT of all these big studies that masks don't protect you, don't help you.
[18:48.820 --> 18:55.340]  Having people stand six feet apart is just made up. It's all crap, but it makes you feel
[18:55.340 --> 19:01.140]  good and it makes the little busy bodies who want to enforce it get into the game of spying
[19:01.140 --> 19:06.260]  on their neighbors, taddling as people are having a secret church service. It gets them
[19:06.260 --> 19:10.780]  into the mode and then vertically integrates the economy for the big banks and big tech
[19:10.780 --> 19:13.820]  who've all become even more powerful in the process.
[19:13.820 --> 19:21.460]  It's about global domination like it always is with these tyrants. And now medical doctors
[19:21.460 --> 19:28.660]  in Canada, in Germany, in England, I've seen it in the news. War today are being ransacked
[19:28.660 --> 19:35.060]  or being arrested for doing video streams online, giving out medical information and
[19:35.060 --> 19:40.260]  telling people that most of the COVID deaths were other things, which even the New York
[19:40.260 --> 19:46.340]  Times admits, but they're the New York Times. I saw an MSNBC article, I saw an NBC story
[19:46.340 --> 19:50.780]  last week saying, oh, all these people that got arrested that weren't violent at the Capitol
[19:50.780 --> 19:54.380]  who said they were journalists, they don't work for mainstream news, so they're not protected.
[19:54.380 --> 19:59.780]  Yes, the CNN reporters, yes, the Wall Street Journal reporters, yes, Nancy Pelosi's nephew,
[19:59.780 --> 20:07.020]  yes, yes, yes, the National Geographic, they were allowed in. Everybody else, you're not
[20:07.020 --> 20:08.020]  journalist.
[20:08.020 --> 20:13.740]  Well, here's an info at wars.com article, Facebook, Bands, Australian member of Parliament
[20:13.740 --> 20:22.660]  for anti-lockdown post. Members of Parliament aren't allowed to have their free speech now.
[20:22.660 --> 20:28.980]  You see? Because they're saying we should be not locked down. You know, they're saying
[20:28.980 --> 20:32.380]  if they have one case in Australia, they're going to lock down one case in New Zealand.
[20:32.380 --> 20:38.060]  And the testing is almost 100% fake. It's all based on fraud. Is there real cold viruses
[20:38.060 --> 20:42.220]  cooked up in labs? Does Bill Gates own them with Fauci? Absolutely. Do they have more
[20:42.220 --> 20:46.500]  deadly versions coming out? Do all the studies show that taking the vaccine makes you a shatter
[20:46.500 --> 20:54.940]  that breeds real deadly viruses in your body? It looks like sterilizing women who haven't
[20:54.940 --> 21:02.140]  even ever had the vaccine but are next to people. That's in the mainline literature.
[21:02.140 --> 21:08.180]  That's why schools around the world are banning people working there who've taken the experimental
[21:08.180 --> 21:15.380]  MRNA gene therapy because it can cause the spread of real viruses. That's even your
[21:15.380 --> 21:23.620]  precious Wall Street Journal and NPR reporting that. So it's a big, big, big deal, ladies
[21:23.620 --> 21:24.620]  and gentlemen.
[21:24.620 --> 21:30.020]  But let's go ahead and go to this piece from Tucker Carlson last night saying this is child
[21:30.020 --> 21:34.220]  abuse. Now, when you see people doing it to children, say something to them. I do it.
[21:34.220 --> 21:37.500]  I lovingly say, hey, you know, they give them bacterial pneumonia. You know, children can't
[21:37.500 --> 21:43.180]  even get sick from COVID, really. But again, they feel like the social pressure they want
[21:43.180 --> 21:47.580]  a virtue signal. Now, I got photos here in my stack of people putting masks on their
[21:47.580 --> 21:55.780]  dogs. It's real, folks. So here is Tucker Carlson last night.
[21:55.780 --> 22:02.900]  Other masks prevent intimacy and human contact. If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[22:02.900 --> 22:07.620]  Thanks are for the guilty. They're signifiers of shame and submission. Until recently, many
[22:07.620 --> 22:12.060]  jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public. Only clansmen and armed robbers
[22:12.060 --> 22:17.260]  wore masks. The rest of us showed our face. We were free people. But then we gave in to
[22:17.260 --> 22:21.940]  the demands of people like Eric Garcetti. And because we did give in, this protest version
[22:21.940 --> 22:26.940]  of Halloween went on for more than a year and it's still going on. Not even Tony Fauci
[22:26.940 --> 22:32.820]  still pretends that masks are medically necessary. Instead, masks are purely a sign of political
[22:32.820 --> 22:38.220]  obedience like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang. We wear them because we have to. The only
[22:38.220 --> 22:43.220]  people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics. How neurotic are
[22:43.220 --> 22:49.740]  they? Well, we know. A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who
[22:49.740 --> 22:54.620]  classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental
[22:54.620 --> 22:58.820]  health condition. And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major
[22:58.820 --> 23:03.260]  way. If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington
[23:03.260 --> 23:08.660]  without wearing a mask, angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment. How could you,
[23:08.660 --> 23:13.020]  they're saying from behind the gauze? How could you? That's the question we should be
[23:13.020 --> 23:18.620]  asking of them in return. The rest of us should be snorting at them first. They're the aggressors.
[23:18.620 --> 23:23.500]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in. So next time
[23:23.500 --> 23:28.220]  you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate. Ask politely
[23:28.220 --> 23:32.860]  but firmly. Would you please take off your mask? Science shows there is no reason for
[23:32.860 --> 23:38.460]  you to be wearing it. Your mask is making me uncomfortable. We should do that and we
[23:38.460 --> 23:42.940]  should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as
[23:42.940 --> 23:48.420]  lighting a marble on an elevator. It's repulsive. Don't do it around other people. That's the
[23:48.420 --> 23:53.180]  message we should send because it's true. As we're forcing children to wear masks outside,
[23:53.180 --> 23:57.420]  that should be illegal. Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play
[23:57.420 --> 24:01.820]  should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart. Call
[24:01.820 --> 24:07.540]  the police immediately. Contact Child Protective Services. Keep calling until someone arrives.
[24:07.540 --> 24:12.140]  What you're looking at is abuse. It's child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt
[24:12.140 --> 24:20.060]  to prevent it. If it's your own children being abused, then act on it. Say no. Stop resisting.
[24:20.060 --> 24:27.140]  Your common sense. Resist the tyranny. Resist what you know is pilling you. Resist the bullying.
[24:27.140 --> 24:34.700]  Stop resisting your instincts to say no to this. Start pushing back. And again, think
[24:34.700 --> 24:37.380]  about how they're saying, you can't get on a plane, you can't get on a train, you can't
[24:37.380 --> 24:41.460]  have a job, you can't work here. If you don't have it, when it's experimental, it's dangerous
[24:41.460 --> 24:45.660]  like the Suskegee experiment and they're just trying to shove it in our face. And then Joe
[24:45.660 --> 24:50.060]  Biden is our medical doctor along with Bill Gates and he's going to tell you, okay, it's
[24:50.060 --> 24:54.340]  okay to go outside now and not wearing a mask because most people aren't wearing masks
[24:54.340 --> 25:00.460]  outside now across the country. And so the peer pressure is now against them. So now he's
[25:00.460 --> 25:06.100]  going to lift it. So his cult of idiots won't feel like they lost their tug of war because
[25:06.100 --> 25:10.340]  all the left ones is to be in a religion, a religion of control of us, a religion of
[25:10.340 --> 25:16.020]  henpecking and controlling language and dominating others because they have nothing on the inside.
[25:16.020 --> 25:21.140]  No relationship with God, no real job, no real education. Just left this brainwashing.
[25:21.140 --> 25:26.860]  They're in a cult like Rose McGowan came out on Fox News and said yesterday, it is a damn
[25:26.860 --> 25:31.700]  cult. I'm part of the freedom cult. I'm part of the Jesus cult. I'm part of the 57 Chevy
[25:31.700 --> 25:38.060]  cult. I'm part of the give me more freedom, more self defense, bigger, better, go to space,
[25:38.060 --> 25:42.640]  go to Mars, let's kick some ass cult. And you guys are part of the anti-human Harvey
[25:42.640 --> 25:49.380]  Weinstein pedophile cult. And it's starting to happen, ladies and gentlemen, Miami school
[25:49.380 --> 25:56.740]  says they won't employ people who get COVID-19 vaccination, citing vaccine misinformation
[25:56.740 --> 26:02.580]  says CBS News and the school goes on to say it's an experimental COVID-19 injection. It's
[26:02.580 --> 26:07.660]  a gene therapy and we're worried it can make other people sick through viral shedding. Hell,
[26:07.660 --> 26:12.380]  that's even in your precious Wall Street Journal and NPR. That's what the top scientists say
[26:12.380 --> 26:18.100]  because it's not a regular virus. It goes in and completely makes your cells start programming
[26:18.100 --> 26:23.740]  a protein, which is associated with fertility and associated with the brain. And that's
[26:23.740 --> 26:27.420]  why there's more studies about Alzheimer's and infertility. And lo and behold, women
[26:27.420 --> 26:31.060]  that are getting the vaccine are having miscarriages. And lo and behold, a lot of women are getting
[26:31.060 --> 26:35.060]  the vaccine have all these tumors in their uteruses. Now that's in mainstream news. You
[26:35.060 --> 26:39.820]  can find CBS News that well, don't worry about those tumors. Those aren't bad. Yes, the vaccine
[26:39.820 --> 26:44.420]  gives you some tumors. Yes, it makes your lymph nodes swell up, but everything's okay. Everything's
[26:44.420 --> 26:50.820]  fine. Yeah, right. Unbelievable. All right, we've got Nick Fuentes just put on a no fly
[26:50.820 --> 26:57.140]  list. The article just exclusively went up on infowars.com. I'm not going to sit here
[26:57.140 --> 27:03.780]  and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes infowars has had. If you're
[27:03.780 --> 27:10.980]  paying attention, you know, we've done together. But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are
[27:10.980 --> 27:16.980]  really upping their game. And they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[27:16.980 --> 27:22.100]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance. So now is the time to understand
[27:22.100 --> 27:25.620]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your
[27:25.620 --> 27:30.860]  friends and family about us around to be true. So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[27:30.860 --> 27:36.180]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can. But it's up to all of
[27:36.180 --> 27:43.180]  us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power. But the sun is setting on humanity
[27:43.180 --> 27:48.980]  and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure
[27:48.980 --> 27:58.300]  that a long dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are. Epic is one of only
[27:58.300 --> 28:05.340]  a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association. And
[28:05.340 --> 28:09.780]  they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[28:09.780 --> 28:14.380]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering. That's why they've been massively
[28:14.380 --> 28:18.980]  expanding their services. So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want
[28:18.980 --> 28:23.580]  help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all
[28:23.580 --> 28:29.460]  and they're expanding. And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their
[28:29.460 --> 28:36.100]  services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move
[28:36.100 --> 28:40.900]  goes to fund the info war. And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type
[28:40.900 --> 28:45.940]  of services that you get from them. So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet
[28:45.940 --> 28:52.620]  again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free. So infowarsdomains.com,
[28:52.620 --> 28:57.140]  the revolution starts there. infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[28:57.140 --> 29:02.740]  This entire new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete,
[29:02.740 --> 29:07.500]  making you a domesticated animal they control, they want to censor you, they want to dump
[29:07.500 --> 29:11.660]  you down, they want to poison you, and they want to control your ability to take care
[29:11.660 --> 29:17.660]  of yourself. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the info war more than ever
[29:17.660 --> 29:22.940]  and you can do it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[29:57.180 --> 30:02.780]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop
[30:02.780 --> 30:08.180]  a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide. That grew into the robber barons and then
[30:08.180 --> 30:12.420]  into the eugenics movement, Kettler, and of course the rest is history. Our film, in-game,
[30:12.420 --> 30:17.260]  blueprint for global enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms.
[30:17.260 --> 30:21.500]  Everything, the documentary film, back to the top of the charts. It's been selling online
[30:21.500 --> 30:26.420]  for as much as $300 a copy. Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest
[30:26.420 --> 30:32.220]  quality HD. It is available after not being available for years at infowarsstore.com. We're
[30:32.220 --> 30:36.780]  selling it for $14.95 for one copy, as low as $3.95 when you buy them in bulk. You share

[30:41.740 --> 30:46.820]  burn copies of it anywhere in the world. I'm asking you to. I'm begging you to. This film
[30:46.820 --> 30:52.100]  predicted the great reset, the new order takeover, the fake virus and so much more. That's why
[30:52.100 --> 31:00.220]  the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever. Get it today at infowarsstore.com.
[31:00.220 --> 31:21.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I hear people talking bad about the way we
[31:21.900 --> 31:38.780]  have to live here. And I don't mind switching sides and standing up for things they believe
[31:38.780 --> 31:47.900]  in. But when they're running down our country, they're walking on the fight inside of me.
[31:47.900 --> 31:59.300]  Running down a way of life. Running down a way of life for fighting men and folks. You
[31:59.300 --> 32:07.060]  don't love it. Leave it. Leave it. Let this song that I'm singing be a warning to you.
[32:07.060 --> 32:12.340]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the next point has been giving us the exclusive. He has been
[32:12.340 --> 32:16.660]  banned off of the internet as we know it, except for his own site, which is still very popular.
[32:16.660 --> 32:21.740]  It makes them mad. It's important to get all of his material and share it via distribution
[32:21.740 --> 32:27.900]  via proxy. That James O'Keefe was in studio with us last week talking about America First
[32:27.900 --> 32:34.060]  Dot Live is his website, America First Dot Live. I'm Alex Jones with banned.video and
[32:34.060 --> 32:38.500]  infowars.com and we're on a couple hundred radio stations, a hundred or so cable and
[32:38.500 --> 32:45.940]  TV stations. But it's just absolutely important for all of us, ladies and gentlemen, to understand
[32:45.940 --> 32:50.940]  that the resistance only gets magnified and only gets expanded so the truth gets out when
[32:50.940 --> 32:57.140]  you speak out and you take action. Here's the article from infowars.com. Breaking. America
[32:57.140 --> 33:06.660]  First Founder Nick Fuentes put on no fly list. And they told him why you were at the Capitol,
[33:06.660 --> 33:11.780]  not even in the Capitol. See now they've arrested 500 that went in. Now they want to attack
[33:11.780 --> 33:15.540]  those that are without. We'll talk to him in a moment. But let's tie that together with
[33:15.540 --> 33:22.540]  just these stories breaking today. Facebook bans Australian member of parliament for anti
[33:22.540 --> 33:30.020]  lockdown post. Only the U.M. has speech. You're not allowed to speak out. Member of parliament.
[33:30.020 --> 33:37.060]  Greg Kelly. Wow. How a foreign entity can see Facebook as three billion members. It's
[33:37.060 --> 33:42.300]  the biggest country in the world. It decides, you see. Canadian government accused of assault
[33:42.300 --> 33:49.940]  on free speech of a proposed policy and law to police videos posted on social media. Here's
[33:49.940 --> 33:54.540]  another one today. German police ransacked the home of doctor as he provides evidence
[33:54.540 --> 34:00.420]  in court that children are endangered in their mental and physical spiritual well-being.
[34:00.420 --> 34:04.580]  Being obliged to wear the face mask just what Tucker Carlson was talking about. Now we need
[34:04.580 --> 34:09.940]  to push it back. So that's just today. I've got more of this where they're intimidating
[34:09.940 --> 34:14.700]  going to witnesses in the show on trial and throwing pig blood on what they think their
[34:14.700 --> 34:18.860]  house and pig heads and going to the jurors houses we now learned. Somebody had leaked
[34:18.860 --> 34:23.860]  it. That's why they voted and went along with the mob intimidating them. Whether you think
[34:23.860 --> 34:26.940]  show almost guilty or not. He's got to go free. I don't care if he's black or white
[34:26.940 --> 34:31.700]  because of that. But anybody who's America first anybody that stands for what our republics
[34:31.700 --> 34:36.500]  stood for ideas superior to any out there mimicked across the world before the Chinese
[34:36.500 --> 34:41.460]  communists became the model is being shut down in silence. And so just as it was Alex
[34:41.460 --> 34:45.460]  Jones first he platformed on a massive way three years ago and now it's everybody else
[34:45.460 --> 34:51.180]  including the former president and members of Congress will all be Nick point as soon
[34:51.180 --> 34:57.340]  and Laura Loomer because they're going after the Uber each the Uber cars the the hotel
[34:57.340 --> 35:04.540]  reservations the Airbnb. This is the true de platforming of humans themselves the electronic
[35:04.540 --> 35:10.100]  gulag joining us with the exclusive is Nick point has Nick great to have you on. We're
[35:10.100 --> 35:14.700]  all Nick point has now tell us what the hell's going on here. Yeah well thank you so much
[35:14.700 --> 35:20.220]  for having me on. So actually my plans today were very different from what's transpired
[35:20.220 --> 35:25.420]  so far. I was me Michelle Malkin Laura Loomer Vince James and Lauren Witski. We were all
[35:25.420 --> 35:31.020]  planning on going down to Florida to hold a press conference about Rhonda Santas big
[35:31.020 --> 35:36.580]  tech censorship legislation which you may know that Rhonda Santas sponsored a bill in
[35:36.580 --> 35:40.100]  the Florida State House that would go after the big tech companies and try to prevent
[35:40.100 --> 35:45.380]  them from censoring candidates for office statewide candidate. He's also saying no government
[35:45.380 --> 35:49.940]  of vaccine passports. He's a great guy. That's right. Yeah we and we love Governor Rhonda
[35:49.940 --> 35:55.500]  Santas and so I was planning on flying down to Florida Palm Beach in particular to do
[35:55.500 --> 35:59.740]  a small press conference and encourage the Florida State House to pass the bill as well
[35:59.740 --> 36:04.740]  as to include some amendments that we had suggested which include increasing the penalty
[36:04.740 --> 36:10.300]  or social media companies that censor as well as broadening the definition of who exactly
[36:10.300 --> 36:15.140]  the law would apply to not just candidates but also we wanted to apply to our current
[36:15.140 --> 36:19.980]  office holders as well as all the citizens of Florida. So my plan was to fly down and
[36:19.980 --> 36:25.500]  do a little press conference today which is actually still going to go forward at 3 30
[36:25.500 --> 36:29.740]  Eastern time and so I showed up to the airport and I actually got there a couple of hours
[36:29.740 --> 36:34.860]  early because I was told by some friends of mine Lauren Witzke and Vince James in particular
[36:34.860 --> 36:39.820]  that they had been subject to advanced screening at the airport because of their involvement
[36:39.820 --> 36:44.260]  and January 6th and I know that both of them were not inside the Capitol building but they
[36:44.260 --> 36:48.500]  were in the district the day that that happened and that's the same story with me. I was not
[36:48.500 --> 36:54.260]  inside the building but I was outside and I was at the Trump rally on the ellipse which
[36:54.260 --> 36:58.740]  took place earlier and I think I actually saw you there as well. And so I got to the
[36:58.740 --> 37:03.700]  airport a couple of hours early and I prepared for advanced screening you know I got there
[37:03.700 --> 37:08.300]  early enough that if they had a swab everything in my luggage that they could do that and
[37:08.300 --> 37:12.540]  I would still catch my flight and what I noticed is that I was unable to check in online for
[37:12.540 --> 37:16.980]  my flight for the past two or three days. I booked my flight I think last night of the
[37:16.980 --> 37:21.820]  night before was unable to check into my flight you know on the 24 hours before departure.
[37:21.820 --> 37:26.740]  I thought that was weird I'd go to the front desk to check in and the clerk at the desk
[37:26.740 --> 37:31.660]  calls up security she says I'm not getting clearance I can't check you in. She calls
[37:31.660 --> 37:36.740]  the corporate security for American Airlines and they clear me and then she goes through
[37:36.740 --> 37:42.180]  to TSA to the airport security and they relay to her and she relates to me that I'm unable
[37:42.180 --> 37:46.100]  to fly and she said they would say nothing other than that. And you know it's interesting
[37:46.100 --> 37:51.380]  because the lady at American my first flight was American Airlines she was actually somewhat
[37:51.380 --> 37:55.980]  sympathetic because she said you know is there anything that might be causing this is it
[37:55.980 --> 38:01.140]  a mask thing did you have an incident on American before I said no nothing like that never
[38:01.140 --> 38:06.440]  any issues like that on American Airlines and you know I've been flying pretty recently.
[38:06.440 --> 38:10.980]  She said okay well I'll give them another call and they relay the same message I'm not
[38:10.980 --> 38:15.140]  able to fly and I said well you know honestly it's political I said I'm a political guy
[38:15.140 --> 38:19.140]  I said I think it's political and she goes she goes I'm not supposed to say this but
[38:19.140 --> 38:23.100]  I think this woke stuff is out of control and I could get fired but they're pushing
[38:23.100 --> 38:27.300]  this on the corporations so you know she was even sympathetic and she called a few times
[38:27.300 --> 38:32.620]  and the message came down all they could say was I do not have clearance to fly. So I went
[38:32.620 --> 38:36.540]  over and I booked another flight immediately after at United because I figured you know
[38:36.540 --> 38:39.380]  maybe it's an American Airlines thing maybe that's their corporate.
[38:39.380 --> 38:44.340]  That's right because in the days after the capital event the the the woke airlines themselves
[38:44.340 --> 38:47.780]  would just look at who you were and if you were wearing a make America great again hat
[38:47.780 --> 38:51.900]  they would ban you as well but that was selective you were you were checking another hoping this
[38:51.900 --> 38:55.380]  was just selective. Exactly right and there were some very
[38:55.380 --> 38:59.740]  activist corporations like Bank of America and the airlines they were they were willing
[38:59.740 --> 39:03.220]  and they were actively going in and doing you know what they thought is the government's
[39:03.220 --> 39:07.740]  job and so you're right I thought it was American so I went over to United I went all the way
[39:07.740 --> 39:12.660]  over to the other terminal I booked the same flight you know 10 40 a.m. to Palm Beach from
[39:12.660 --> 39:16.820]  O'Hare I went up to the counter and she told me the exact same thing she was on the phone
[39:16.820 --> 39:21.620]  with the TSA for half hours said nope I'm sorry and she goes and you know what I just
[39:21.620 --> 39:26.420]  googled you and I think I know why that is that's what she said because I'm so sorry
[39:26.420 --> 39:30.140]  but but there's nothing I could do I said okay is there anyone I could talk to can
[39:30.140 --> 39:36.100]  I go to the TSA she goes nope nobody could talk to that's it so I'm on the no fly list
[39:36.100 --> 39:41.460]  and and it has to do with the capital on January 6th and you know like you I was not inside
[39:41.460 --> 39:44.900]  the building and therefore I didn't commit a crime they're charging all these people
[39:44.900 --> 39:49.860]  500 plus people and they want to throw the book at them what are they charging them for
[39:49.860 --> 39:55.660]  trespassing disorderly conduct these are misdemeanor charges and I didn't even do that I went to
[39:55.660 --> 40:00.460]  the Trump rally on the ellipse which is a totally legal permissible political rally
[40:00.460 --> 40:05.140]  from the sitting president of the United States and then I like thousands of other people
[40:05.140 --> 40:10.140]  went down to the capital grounds and was out there protesting outside the capital which
[40:10.140 --> 40:14.100]  is our right to do that if you were burning something down or shooting cops and were liberal
[40:14.100 --> 40:18.460]  in black lives matter you'd be you know allowed to fly but look I bet next time I fly they're
[40:18.460 --> 40:22.820]  going to try to block me this is the lawlessness this is the deep state Congress has allowed
[40:22.820 --> 40:26.660]  censorship online now they're going to allow us to be put in gulags and I guess finally
[40:26.660 --> 40:30.340]  killed I was talking to top national talk shows today and he believes that's where this
[40:30.340 --> 40:35.060]  going he believes it's going to them killing us it's a household name stay there Nick
[40:35.060 --> 40:40.380]  point as we'll be right back folks they are literally absolutely setting up authoritarianism
[40:40.380 --> 40:44.980]  Nick point as banned from travel on planes next you know they're going to probably come
[40:44.980 --> 40:50.660]  arresting and me too so the left will celebrate this they love the fascism they love the tyranny
[40:50.660 --> 41:01.620]  we'll be right back the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control
[41:01.620 --> 41:08.420]  big pharma they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control
[41:08.420 --> 41:14.740]  big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established
[41:14.740 --> 41:22.620]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the western Christian idea of freedom
[41:22.620 --> 41:26.940]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[41:26.940 --> 41:33.300]  them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside
[41:33.300 --> 41:40.860]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[41:40.860 --> 41:45.260]  that threatens their monopoly some control that's why they target info wars because we
[41:45.260 --> 41:51.060]  understand the keys to the feeding of the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote
[41:51.060 --> 41:56.420]  info wars and that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together in the
[41:56.420 --> 42:05.580]  early 1990s it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's world even before
[42:05.580 --> 42:11.740]  I had access to the show in the mid 90s I wouldn't call that movie and thought man that was fun
[42:11.740 --> 42:15.700]  back to speak out have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining
[42:15.700 --> 42:24.060]  because you're real well what do they say in Wayne's world every day when I cover these
[42:24.060 --> 42:29.100]  huge topics I don't feel worthy because these topics are so huge or so real but I'm trying
[42:29.100 --> 42:32.580]  to tell you the truth I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do the globalists
[42:32.580 --> 42:39.420]  love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity they enjoy manipulating
[42:39.420 --> 42:45.700]  ideas and using people's ignorance against them that for me is really sick and disgusting
[42:45.700 --> 42:51.020]  so you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we will never join
[42:51.020 --> 42:57.260]  the globalists we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together
[42:57.260 --> 43:02.060]  last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission and he said to me he said
[43:02.060 --> 43:07.300]  Alex there's all these facts all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people dying
[43:07.300 --> 43:11.820]  from it and people get sick how do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to
[43:11.820 --> 43:17.140]  them and to warn about the danger and I said to him something very profound because it's
[43:17.140 --> 43:22.580]  so true trust your gut trust your spirit for the Bible tells us and I said ask those friends
[43:22.580 --> 43:28.620]  those family those neighbors do you feel good about this vaccine and his answer was no they
[43:28.620 --> 43:33.900]  don't feel good about it so go with your gut well let me ask you again how's your gut feel

[47:08.600 --> 47:10.560]  But I just offered Nick Fuentes a channel.
[47:10.560 --> 47:13.160]  He's being censored because of course I want a channel on Bandot video.
[47:13.160 --> 47:16.720]  So we'll make sure he gets a channel there and he brings all his great patriots there.
[47:16.720 --> 47:18.160]  We bring our patriots to him.
[47:18.160 --> 47:19.600]  We've got to get organized.

[47:26.760 --> 47:30.080]  We're working on that for Bandot video as well.
[47:30.080 --> 47:36.360]  And again, Nick, give people the website where they can find you despite all the censorship.
[47:36.360 --> 47:41.800]  It is AmericaFirst.Live and I'll run it through Friday at 8 o'clock Central Time.

[47:56.080 --> 48:00.320]  In the eight minutes we have left, finishing up Nick Fuentes's here on The Alex Jones Show.
[48:00.320 --> 48:01.320]  Recap.
[48:01.320 --> 48:02.320]  You've been put on a no fly list.
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.320]  They admitted it's because you weren't simply covering the Capitol.
[48:06.320 --> 48:07.320]  What does that signify?
[48:07.320 --> 48:11.440]  Does that mean they're getting ready to try to arrest you for a conspiracy?
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.760]  Even though you never called for any violence, that's preposterous.
[48:14.760 --> 48:16.280]  Or is it something else?
[48:16.280 --> 48:21.760]  Because I think it's all just part of this persecution of patriots in general.
[48:21.760 --> 48:23.920]  Well, you're exactly right.
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.440]  It's a part of a very coordinated and systematic effort to intimidate and persecute people
[48:28.440 --> 48:30.440]  that are against the Biden administration.
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.640]  People that are against the American regime, specifically Trump supporters and the leaders
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.760]  of Trump supporters such as yourself and me and everybody that we know.
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.280]  And so it represents a major escalation because of course you know better than anybody almost
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.720]  that censorship has been here for five years.
[48:47.720 --> 48:49.400]  We've been banned from social media.
[48:49.400 --> 48:52.400]  We've been banned from YouTube, banned from, you've been banned from Twitter.
[48:52.400 --> 48:55.080]  I'm still on there, but we've been banned from everything else.
[48:55.080 --> 48:59.960]  Even back in services, things like PayPal, Stripe, email octopus, MailChimp, you know,
[48:59.960 --> 49:02.120]  things that a lot of people don't even know that much about.
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.920]  And so for a long time it was really a variety of corporate tyranny.
[49:06.920 --> 49:11.080]  And the argument would be something like this from the left, which is, well, you have freedom
[49:11.080 --> 49:13.800]  of speech, but you don't have freedom from consequences.
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.200]  You have your right to exercise your first amendment.
[49:16.200 --> 49:20.080]  And only in so far as the government is not oppressing you for that, well, then that's
[49:20.080 --> 49:21.280]  just par for the course.
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.320]  And so Twitter is a private company and they can ban who they like for whatever they want.
[49:25.320 --> 49:29.480]  But now they've passed that Rubicon in a big way and we know Europe and other areas of
[49:29.480 --> 49:30.480]  the model.
[49:30.480 --> 49:31.480]  They're coming with police now.
[49:31.480 --> 49:32.480]  Exactly.
[49:32.480 --> 49:33.480]  Exactly.
[49:33.480 --> 49:35.000]  And they are the canary in the coal mine.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.360]  It's been like that with hate speech legislation and you're up for a long time.
[49:38.360 --> 49:43.120]  And now with the Biden administration and Democrats with unified control of government, now you're
[49:43.120 --> 49:48.120]  seeing just like he did under Barack Obama, the full weaponization of the federal government.
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.640]  And I used to tell this to people because there were a lot of people who would say to
[49:50.640 --> 49:54.080]  me, you know, I don't really feel like voting in 2020.
[49:54.080 --> 49:55.080]  I don't know.
[49:55.080 --> 49:56.560]  The wars aren't over, whatever.
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.560]  And I said, you watch and you see if Biden gets an office, it's going to be like Barack
[50:00.560 --> 50:01.560]  Obama on steroids.
[50:01.560 --> 50:06.600]  Remember when he was targeting the conservative nonprofits with the IRS and the back door
[50:06.600 --> 50:11.320]  gun control through the EPA and all kinds of other regulatory mechanisms to go after
[50:11.320 --> 50:14.080]  conservatives, it's going to be like that on steroids.
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.720]  And you see that ominous statement by that one Democrat senator.
[50:16.720 --> 50:21.440]  He goes, we need to test the full power of the IRS and the FBI said, we're going to
[50:21.440 --> 50:23.280]  break up these patriot groups.
[50:23.280 --> 50:28.280]  I mean, this is just KGB, GRU corruption.
[50:28.280 --> 50:29.280]  That's right.
[50:29.280 --> 50:33.120]  And they've taken the war on terror, which has been waged over the past 20 years and
[50:33.120 --> 50:37.920]  they built up all this legal infrastructure and bureaucratic infrastructure from the Patriot
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.640]  Act to the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA and the FBI.
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.840]  And all of this, which has been built up ostensibly to go after Islamic terrorism in
[50:47.840 --> 50:53.760]  the Middle East, to go after foreign adversaries, since the capital is now being directed inwardly.
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.480]  And so now this pan out the consurveillance state and the DHS and the Patriot Act and
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.320]  the abridgment of civil liberties.
[51:00.320 --> 51:03.440]  Whereas once it applied to people that were foreigners, once it applied to people that
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.440]  were enemy combatants, I mean, actual Muslim terrorists, now it's been applied to real
[51:08.440 --> 51:11.840]  Muslim terrorists are coming across the border walls been canceled.
[51:11.840 --> 51:13.000]  They're even taking part of it down.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.080]  They're throwing babies over the fence.
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.240]  There's no infrastructure for the actual border, but now they're using illegal internal checkpoints
[51:19.240 --> 51:21.520]  on us and not letting Patriots fly.
[51:21.520 --> 51:24.800]  And this is pure intimidation like, oh, we demonetize you.
[51:24.800 --> 51:25.800]  Well, we banned you.
[51:25.800 --> 51:27.040]  Well, now you can't fly.
[51:27.040 --> 51:29.680]  Well, now you can't lease or rent.
[51:29.680 --> 51:31.040]  Now you can't have a bank account.
[51:31.040 --> 51:34.240]  We took the president's bank accounts.
[51:34.240 --> 51:35.240]  Exactly.
[51:35.240 --> 51:36.240]  And it's meant to disrupt.
[51:36.240 --> 51:37.760]  They want to achieve this effect.
[51:37.760 --> 51:38.960]  That is their intention.
[51:38.960 --> 51:42.800]  They disrupt our media landscape by banning us from social media.
[51:42.800 --> 51:46.400]  They disrupt us financially by freezing our bank accounts, which actually happened to
[51:46.400 --> 51:47.400]  me.
[51:47.400 --> 51:48.400]  They froze one of my bank accounts.
[51:48.400 --> 51:51.760]  And then now they're going to go and they're trying to stop people from flying.
[51:51.760 --> 51:55.760]  And, you know, Michael Sherwin said this on 60 Minutes, this is not some conspiracy
[51:55.760 --> 51:56.760]  theory.
[51:56.760 --> 51:57.760]  This is not made up.
[51:57.760 --> 52:02.560]  Michael Sherwin, who is directing the capital investigation in D.C., he said on 60 Minutes
[52:02.560 --> 52:06.920]  and he actually got in trouble for it, he said the reason they went after the internet
[52:06.920 --> 52:11.560]  celebrities and the people on social media first when they were investigating the capital
[52:11.560 --> 52:16.840]  was to create a shock and awe effect and prevent people from protesting the inauguration.
[52:16.840 --> 52:21.320]  Because he said that if people saw the mainstream people, the celebrities getting hauled away
[52:21.320 --> 52:24.600]  by the FBI, then they would be intimidated into silence.
[52:24.600 --> 52:27.240]  And so this is part of a very coordinated campaign.
[52:27.240 --> 52:30.760]  They know that if they strike at people like yourself and people like me, if they strike
[52:30.760 --> 52:33.760]  at Donald Trump, take his bank accounts, take the social media.
[52:33.760 --> 52:34.760]  And let's be clear.
[52:34.760 --> 52:38.760]  The Republicans have signaled surrender, even though the public's awake.
[52:38.760 --> 52:39.760]  People totally like Trump.
[52:39.760 --> 52:41.480]  They love us.
[52:41.480 --> 52:44.040]  They've announced Lindsey Cheney is not the leader of the party.
[52:44.040 --> 52:47.640]  Trump is not allowed at the strategy meetings and she's going to run for president, CNN's
[52:47.640 --> 52:48.640]  worshiping her.
[52:48.640 --> 52:53.120]  They're saying she'll be the president, 85% negative in her home state, hated across
[52:53.120 --> 52:54.120]  the nation.
[52:54.120 --> 52:58.000]  And now they're preparing to force fetus Liz Cheney, just like they've done Joe Biden
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.400]  and Kamala Harris, would have a percentage point approval rating with her.
[53:01.400 --> 53:03.200]  I mean, so this is unbelievable.
[53:03.200 --> 53:06.800]  That really to me is a nightmare's signification, but the Republicans are about to totally
[53:06.800 --> 53:09.600]  capitulate to the neo-consent early on the Democrats.
[53:09.600 --> 53:10.600]  Yes.
[53:10.600 --> 53:15.320]  Well, the Republicans, I mean, you know that they're salivating and they have been salivating
[53:15.320 --> 53:19.440]  to totally restore the Republican party back to the status quo.
[53:19.440 --> 53:21.440]  They didn't like Trump in 2015.
[53:21.440 --> 53:23.200]  They didn't like him in 2016.
[53:23.200 --> 53:26.640]  And they had to put up with him for the past four years because he was the nucleus.
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.480]  He was the center of gravity in DC and the Republican party.
[53:30.480 --> 53:35.640]  But you know that Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and Mitt Romney's niece, Ron McDaniel,
[53:35.640 --> 53:39.720]  they have been chomping at the bit for Donald Trump to leave office so that they could snap
[53:39.720 --> 53:41.800]  right back to the old GOP.
[53:41.800 --> 53:43.080]  And that's why they're boosting.
[53:43.080 --> 53:48.040]  That's why Tim Scott is going to do the response to the joint session of Congress tomorrow.
[53:48.040 --> 53:51.520]  That's why Nikki Haley is the one that they're grooming to be the president.
[53:51.520 --> 53:52.520]  And you're right.
[53:52.520 --> 53:53.960]  And Nikki Haley is running the party.
[53:53.960 --> 53:58.240]  And that's why they're trying to go after Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt
[53:58.240 --> 54:00.400]  Gates in the America first caucus.
[54:00.400 --> 54:04.000]  It's because the Republican Party, George W. Bush the other day working with the Koch
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.680]  Network to pass amnesty with Joe Biden.
[54:06.680 --> 54:12.480]  The entire Republican infrastructure is collagulating now with the Democratic Party in the open
[54:12.480 --> 54:18.280]  to put down this populist revolt, to put down the, you know, insurrection in a political
[54:18.280 --> 54:19.280]  sense, not a literal.
[54:19.280 --> 54:23.480]  The point is, how do we counter this, governors, legislators, leaders like DeSantis?
[54:23.480 --> 54:25.840]  I mean, we've got to go on the offense politically.
[54:25.840 --> 54:29.080]  This is, if this was a liquor, it's 200 proof tyranny.
[54:29.080 --> 54:33.280]  I mean, this is 100% admitted evil cancer.
[54:33.280 --> 54:34.280]  This is unbelievable.
[54:34.280 --> 54:39.280]  Well, the way to go on the offensive is in the state governments, Republicans control
[54:39.280 --> 54:42.160]  more than half of the state governments in the country.
[54:42.160 --> 54:45.960]  Ron DeSantis seems to be the only one that's cognizant of that fact because he seems to
[54:45.960 --> 54:48.680]  be the only one that's fighting against the left wing agenda.
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.040]  Christy Nolman, South Dakota, bolts the NCAA on trans, so did the Arkansas governor.
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.560]  We have got to take these Republican state governments if we don't have a shot right
[54:57.560 --> 54:59.480]  now in Congress and in the White House.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.720]  We need people that aren't wimps.
[55:00.720 --> 55:05.800]  I mean, Arkansas, 90% of people don't want men and women sports into the code is 90%
[55:05.800 --> 55:06.800]  don't want it.
[55:06.800 --> 55:07.800]  It's popular.
[55:07.800 --> 55:08.800]  Feminists hate it.
[55:08.800 --> 55:09.800]  It's it.
[55:09.800 --> 55:10.800]  Oh, everyone.
[55:10.800 --> 55:11.800]  Oh, no, I'll let men compete.
[55:11.800 --> 55:12.800]  Do five more minutes with us on more solutions.
[55:12.800 --> 55:13.800]  I totally concur.
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.840]  Plus, as Julius Caesar said, there is a tie to the affairs of men taken to the flood leads
[55:18.840 --> 55:19.840]  to fortune.
[55:19.840 --> 55:21.560]  Our fortune is just living free.
[55:21.560 --> 55:23.080]  People like DeSantis get it.
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.920]  How do we draft some people that aren't total coward idiots to take this thing head on?
[55:27.920 --> 55:30.160]  My God, our children are worth it.
[55:30.160 --> 55:32.320]  Not a little bunch of communists gut the country.
[55:32.320 --> 55:33.880]  Nick Pointes is our guest.
[55:33.880 --> 55:36.600]  Soon, he will have a band.video account.

[56:47.560 --> 56:50.560]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[56:50.560 --> 56:51.560]  Hey Alex.
[56:51.560 --> 56:52.560]  Welcome.
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.080]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[56:57.080 --> 57:00.240]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[57:00.240 --> 57:06.960]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[57:06.960 --> 57:08.960]  Living defense saved my life.
[57:08.960 --> 57:12.760]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[57:12.760 --> 57:14.200]  Living defense brought me back.
[57:14.200 --> 57:19.920]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[57:19.920 --> 57:26.680]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[57:26.680 --> 57:32.840]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be
[57:32.840 --> 57:37.120]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[57:37.120 --> 57:38.800]  That's right where we're at brother.
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.240]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[57:43.240 --> 57:50.480]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[57:50.480 --> 58:06.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:06.240 --> 58:10.800]  If you think we're joking around about the tyranny, I see dozens of articles a day and
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.280]  it's all standardized around the world where the police come and arrest preachers for having
[58:15.280 --> 58:20.680]  events, but a topless bar is open on the street where they're arresting reporters, arresting
[58:20.680 --> 58:22.560]  medical doctors that criticize the lockdowns.
[58:22.560 --> 58:24.280]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[58:24.280 --> 58:27.920]  Nick Foyn says, I really appreciate you joining us.
[58:27.920 --> 58:32.320]  Again, you're just an America first activist, you're well spoken, so you've been censored
[58:32.320 --> 58:34.200]  and now you're on a no fly list.
[58:34.200 --> 58:38.400]  I bet money actually, if I try to go fly, I'm going to be blocked as well, even though
[58:38.400 --> 58:42.400]  I was there trying to stop people going in and then there's no judge or jury, no court.
[58:42.400 --> 58:48.600]  You just, it's a magic thing, the Godlike FBI, that they waved a wand and said no longer
[58:48.600 --> 58:52.760]  is there background checks needed for who children are given to, including convicted
[58:52.760 --> 58:53.760]  pedophiles.
[58:53.760 --> 58:54.760]  So they are God.
[58:54.760 --> 58:56.960]  I guess I should pray to the FBI, but I'm not going to do it.
[58:56.960 --> 59:01.320]  I know that's blasphemy, but so how do we counter this, Nick?
[59:01.320 --> 59:05.800]  So I think the easiest way for Republicans to do this is to take advantage of the control
[59:05.800 --> 59:09.200]  that they have in the state legislatures and it's pretty bewildering.
[59:09.200 --> 59:13.560]  We have control over more than half of the state legislatures in the country and we witnessed
[59:13.560 --> 59:15.080]  this in the 2020 election.
[59:15.080 --> 59:19.520]  I know you and I were on the front lines for Stop the Steel in Atlanta and across the country.
[59:19.520 --> 59:24.480]  We realized that these Republican state legislatures and governors are just totally incompetent,
[59:24.480 --> 59:27.320]  totally ineffective and unwilling to do what's right.
[59:27.320 --> 59:32.600]  In Phoenix, in Atlanta, in Harrisburg, in Madison, in all these different state capitals
[59:32.600 --> 59:37.760]  in Lansing, they refused to adjudicate the 2020 election and now we see that they're
[59:37.760 --> 59:42.640]  folding, like you said, before the break, folding on trans, folding on big tech, folding
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.080]  on all the issues that matter.
[59:44.080 --> 59:48.280]  So I proposed it, look, you take a look at South Dakota or Arkansas, where their two
[59:48.280 --> 59:51.120]  governors just totally folded on trans.
[59:51.120 --> 59:53.120]  Those are hardcore conservative states.
[59:53.120 --> 59:58.280]  Like you said, 90% of the people in those places were against the transgender athletes
[59:58.280 --> 1:00:01.120]  in the women's sports, but the governors vetoed it.
[1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:05.320]  Why don't we just take states like that where we can win and fill them up in the state legislature
[1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:09.200]  with people that are America first, because, you know, we have a thing in the country called
[1:00:09.200 --> 1:00:13.440]  federalism, where there's not only a separation of powers between the branches of federal
[1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:16.760]  government, but between the federal government and the state government.
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:21.000]  And actually, the state governments have far more constitutional jurisdiction than the
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.560]  federal government, because the federal government's powers are enumerated and the state government's
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:28.400]  powers and the Tenth Amendment get everything else.
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:33.920]  So I look at somebody like Ron DeSantis as the model for what we have to pursue in the
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:39.040]  future, which is America first governors, America first state legislators, because that
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:40.800]  is a power source.
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:46.120]  That's a locus of power that Republicans can wield in these conservative areas and begin
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:49.680]  to fight back against the tech censorship, begin to fight back against the tide of this
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:52.660]  social revolution that's transforming the country.
[1:00:52.660 --> 1:00:54.200]  We can do it using state government.
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:56.880]  The problem is that people have been unwilling to do that.
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:00.120]  And we all know that everybody's got an unpopular governor.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:04.480]  I love in Illinois, we have J.B. Pritzker, but honestly, it's not much better in Georgia
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:07.720]  with Brian Kemp, who's a Republican, not much better in Arizona.
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:09.680]  And look, the globalists want to conquer us, Nick.
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:11.280]  It's only going to get worse till we push back.
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:12.280]  Take California.
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:14.640]  I've known for a long time that it's never really went blue.
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:15.640]  It's been election fraud.
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.920]  That's what Democrats do.
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:19.320]  People are voting with their feet.
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:23.080]  Now they've gotten all these signatures to recall their fake governor.
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:25.240]  So we can also push back within states they control.
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:27.240]  I think that's a great point you're making.
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:28.240]  Absolutely.
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:31.400]  And you're exactly right about California.
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:34.440]  The thing about Republicans is they're very much on the defensive.
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:35.920]  The Democrats are on the offensive.
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:39.000]  They're filling up all the Republican states with immigrants and they're pursuing voter
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  fraud.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.600]  I mean, they set out to flip Georgia and they got it.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.680]  A lot of people said that's impossible, but they played it very aggressively and they
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:46.680]  got it.
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:49.400]  And I don't think we should limit ourselves even to these kinds of places.
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:51.720]  We should be looking at California.
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:55.320]  We should be looking at other states, even states like Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado.
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:58.560]  I think it's still possible to make a difference there, too.
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.680]  But in these Republican strongholds, there's no excuse.
[1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:02.160]  There's no excuse in Texas.
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:06.800]  There's no excuse in Arkansas or South Dakota to not have a totally America-first conservative
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:07.800]  government.
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:08.800]  We've got to have it there.
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:11.640]  And we, as people living in these states, have to demand it.
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:13.120]  We don't have to win the presidency.
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  We don't have to win these things.
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:15.120]  That would be nice.
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:19.880]  And ultimately, we'd like to do those things, but we don't have to do that.
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:23.720]  We can still do something in the meantime before the midterms and before the next presidential
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:24.720]  election.
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:28.440]  And if they take a look at Ron DeSantis, that's got to be the model for every Republican governor
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:29.440]  in the country.
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:30.440]  Beautifully said.
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:31.440]  You're a voice that needs to be said.
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:33.400]  You're the model for people as well.
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:34.560]  We need to get your voice out there.
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:36.680]  I can't wait for you to be uploading the Band-Aid video.
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:37.680]  Let's make sure that happens.
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:39.440]  Nick, you've got my number written down in the day or so.
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:40.440]  Call me.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:41.440]  I want to make sure that happens.
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:42.440]  I thank you so much for joining us.
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:46.400]  How do people find your weeknight show that's so censored and so banned?
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:49.720]  It's at AmericaFirst.Live, 8 o'clock Central, Monday through Friday.
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:51.560]  And thank you so much for having me on.
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:52.560]  Love what you do.
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:53.560]  You're a legend.
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:54.560]  We love you, brother.
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:58.760]  I want trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:00.560]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:02.160]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:04.560]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:05.560]  That's embarrassing.
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:08.400]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:10.560]  But I'll tell you this right now.
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:12.960]  You're nuts if you don't get storeable food.
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:17.160]  And I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food and the lowest price
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:18.160]  you're going to find.
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:22.560]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get gourmet stuff that takes even better?
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:23.560]  Yeah.
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:24.560]  Most of the stuff takes amazing.
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:25.560]  Some of it takes OK.
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:29.560]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.040]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:34.560]  We've got three months, six months.
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:39.800]  Your supplies right now, and I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:44.280]  because you're so conditionally buying under a super sale that we're doing it one more
[1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:45.280]  time.
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:53.040]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com, 10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:58.040]  Get ready while you still can.
[1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:05.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:12.320]  Well, a lot of people throw around the word hero, and I think it gets overused.
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.600]  But our guest, Arthur Palowski, is a hero.
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:22.280]  He has a street ministry that feeds over a thousand homeless people a week in his city.
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:29.160]  And he has a church, a small church that also serves hundreds of people a week, and you've
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:34.080]  seen the footage from Easter Sunday of them coming without a warrant, without anything,
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:37.680]  and saying, we're going to enforce social distancing, we're going to enforce all of
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:38.680]  this.
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:39.680]  It's all a bunch of crap.
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:40.680]  It's all unconstitutional.
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:41.680]  And he said, get out of here.
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:42.680]  Get out of here.
[1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:43.680]  We'll play a clip in a moment.
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:44.680]  He'll be with us for much of the hour.
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:46.680]  Well, they came back, ladies and gentlemen, in the stories, up on Infowars.com.
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:52.880]  It's happened just a few days ago, Canadian police return was swat teamed a local church
[1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:53.880]  run by Arthur Palowski.
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:59.200]  Now, I got a chance to hear him last week, or a couple weeks ago, actually on the war
[1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:05.040]  room and also on American Journal with Harrison Smith, very impressed with him.
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:06.280]  But he went through communism.
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:11.000]  He went through this exact type of crap and helped get his parents out of Poland.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.960]  And that's why you don't see Joe Biden wanting a bunch of Poles to move over here because
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:19.200]  they tend to vote more conservative because they've been through it just like Cubans do.
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:23.280]  So Arthur, Pastor, Palowski, thank you so much for joining us.
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:28.040]  We're going to go to you in just a moment, but I want to roll here some of what happened
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:31.480]  on Easter and then some of what happened this last Sunday, so we'll play these back
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:32.480]  to back.
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:33.480]  Here it is.
[1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:34.480]  Please get out.
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:36.720]  Get out of this property immediately.
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:37.720]  Get out.
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:38.720]  Okay.
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:39.720]  Get out of this property immediately.
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:40.720]  Out.
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:45.720]  I don't want to hear anything out of this property immediately.
[1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:46.720]  Out.
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:47.720]  Out.
[1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:48.720]  Out.
[1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:54.720]  Out of this property immediately until you come back with the warrant.
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:55.720]  Out.
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:56.720]  Out.
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:57.720]  Out.
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:01.480]  This goes on for 10 minutes all the way out into the street off the property.
[1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:04.000]  Now, this is what happened again just a few days ago.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.640]  They've been back several times.
[1:06:05.640 --> 1:06:09.960]  There's other churches where you've seen hundreds of police, drones, fences around the churches
[1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:13.400]  while Walmart's a mile and a half away or just jammed back with people.
[1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:14.400]  Total evil.
[1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:19.400]  Testing to see if they can go after churches with the leader of Canada saying, I want a
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:21.240]  dictatorship like Communist China.
[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:22.240]  That's a quote.
[1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:23.240]  We'll play that clip.
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.240]  Come up with our guest.
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:25.240]  Here's a little piece of what happened this Sunday.
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:33.080]  Well, friends, we have a SWAT team in our church again, calming authorities.
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:40.080]  So I'm going to go out and see what they want.
[1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:41.080]  Yes.
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:42.080]  Hello, Walter.
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:43.080]  Hi, Walter.
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:47.080]  I wonder if I can just give you a couple of things for the course, Otter.
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:48.080]  This is for you.
[1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:54.080]  Basically, at one, in fact, we have the right charge for today.
[1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:56.080]  What I would really...
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:59.080]  Please, you don't have to get into a personal space.
[1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:00.080]  Thank you.
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:02.080]  Well, you're in my personal space, so...
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:04.080]  Can I explain to you, Otter?
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:07.080]  I'm not really interested in what you have to say.
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:08.080]  Can I explain to you?
[1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:09.080]  I'm reading.
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:10.080]  Okay.
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:11.080]  Okay.
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:12.080]  What we'd want to do is...
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:13.080]  Oh, yeah.
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:19.080]  The full video is up at infowars.com and on Otter Pulaski's site as well, website, streetchurch.ca,
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:27.080]  streetchurch.ca, and Otter Pulaski TV on YouTube, and that's P-A-W-L-O-W-S-K-I.
[1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:32.080]  And he joins us now, and I love the liberal, oh, please, please just let us...
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:34.080]  You know, we're just here to save you.
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:35.080]  We're just here to...
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.080]  No, they're setting the precedent to permanently shut everything down.
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:39.080]  It's in the great reset.
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:40.080]  That's the plan.
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:44.080]  So I want to try to give you the floor to start wherever you want and go through all this.
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:47.080]  Your experience in Poland, your powerful warning to all of us today.
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:50.080]  I know you've been doing a lot of interviews, and we're just so thankful that you're out there
[1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:51.080]  fighting pastor.
[1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:54.080]  And if I lived near you, I'd drive 50 miles to attend your church.
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:58.080]  I can just feel the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit through the Skype right now.
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:03.080]  So God bless your brother for being a leader for us all as we fight this demonic takeover.
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:04.080]  You've got the floor.
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:06.080]  We're going to break it in about six minutes, but you're going to have the floor for...
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:09.080]  As long as you want to stay with us this hour.
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:10.080]  Thank you very much, sir.
[1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:13.080]  Thank you very much for standing with us and supporting us.
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:18.080]  I mean, I received tens of thousands of emails and texts, and mostly from Americans.
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:23.080]  So I'm very, very glad that my brothers and sisters across the border are rising up.
[1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:28.080]  We are to be lions and lions never bow before the hyenas.
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:30.080]  Lions never bow before the wolves.
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:33.080]  And that's what those people are, the wannabe dictators.
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:34.080]  And you're absolutely right.
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:38.080]  I am fired up, and I'm angry because I grew up behind the Iron Curtain.
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:42.080]  I've seen this movie before, and it doesn't end well.
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:45.080]  They will destroy everything if you let them.
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:48.080]  They will remove every right that you have.
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:54.080]  It doesn't matter if you have your constitution or not, Poland from 1945 had all those fears,
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:57.080]  a constitution, the highest law in the country.
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:03.080]  But communists, fascists, dictators do not care about your rights and your charter rights
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:05.080]  and freedoms and your constitution.
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:07.080]  They are stripping us from everything.
[1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:09.080]  And the church is the biggest resistance.
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:14.080]  It has always been the biggest resistance towards dictatorship and tyranny.
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:17.080]  Now we have the medical tyranny being pushed on us left and right.
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:18.080]  And we have a choice.
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:26.080]  We can stand against that, or we can allow them to destroy our way of life, destroy our faith.
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:32.080]  So my message to Americans is we have still a window of opportunity to push this evil away.
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:39.080]  We still have a chance to stand up against the tyrants, the wannabe dictators like Biden,
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:43.080]  like our Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, that is fascinated.
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:49.080]  And he said it on record that he wished he would have a dictatorship like China.
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:54.080]  Can you imagine Chinese government murdering millions of people on a regular basis?
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:10:03.080]  And the Prime Minister in a free and democratic country says that he would wish to be Chinese Prime Minister.
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:05.080]  So they're coming with the warrants.
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.080]  They're coming with a SWAT team.
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:11.080]  Can you imagine to a peaceful assembly, I have been doing this for 22 years.
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:13.080]  I have no record of violence.
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:18.080]  And they're bringing a SWAT team, the gang suppression team to a peaceful assembly.
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:20.080]  And excuse me for what?
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:24.080]  To find out if we are wearing a mask, if I'm preaching wearing a muzzle.
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:26.080]  I'm not a dog.
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:27.080]  I'm not their servant.
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:28.080]  I am a taxpayer.
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:33.080]  And I demand that those people represent me and serve me.
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:35.080]  That's what we are paying them for.
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:37.080]  We're not paying them to remove our rights away.
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:39.080]  We're paying them to uphold our rights.
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:46.080]  And lately they have total disregard to the constitution, total disregard to our rights and freedom.
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:48.080]  So what are we going to do?
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:53.080]  Are we going to just crawl into a hole and cry out and say there's nothing we can do?
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:11:01.080]  I have a message to them and I hope that more pastors, more priests, more rabbis will rise up, more politicians and free loavers.
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:06.080]  Freedom loavers will say first, no, and then get out.
[1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:11.080]  Only those three words you need to say, no, I'm not complying to whatever you're pushing.
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:13.080]  I'm not bowing before you.
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:16.080]  I say no to you and get out.
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:17.080]  Get out of my businesses.
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:18.080]  Get out of our churches.
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:20.080]  Get out of our political arena.
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:22.080]  Get out of our media.
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:24.080]  Get out of our educational system.
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:29.080]  I mean, if we're not going to say no and get out now, mark my words.
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:32.080]  Listen to the guy that grew up under communist dictatorship.
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:36.080]  They will keep coming and they will be taking more rights.
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:43.080]  They're cutting us by thousand cuts, slowly removing one little law at the time and they're testing you.
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:45.080]  They're testing you people.
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:46.080]  How are you going to react?
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:47.080]  They're testing you.
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:48.080]  Will you stand up?
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:51.080]  Will you allow us to take everything away from you?
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:53.080]  Or will there be a pricing?
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:56.080]  And I'm not talking about BLM style.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.080]  I'm not talking about Antifa terrorist style.
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:02.080]  I'm talking about peaceful resistance.
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:07.080]  Martin Luther King, Jr., non-compliance, saying to them no and taking it to the streets.
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:08.080]  Big rallies.
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:09.080]  Big protests.
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:15.080]  I'm calling right now people to come to our church this Saturday, 9.30 in the morning.
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.080]  Come.
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:18.080]  Let there be thousands of people.
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.080]  Let's see what those fascists want to be dictators.
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:25.080]  The Gestapo want to be people are going to do with thousands of people.
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:26.080]  Artur, we've got to go to break.
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:27.080]  Let's talk about this.
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:33.080]  It's a big church where they put up two fences around it, a black tarp like it was evil,
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:39.080]  like it was pornography or something, and spent millions of dollars it looks like to do this.
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:40.080]  It's like the Berlin Wall.
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:42.080]  They're literally walling off churches.
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:46.080]  These are obviously sick evil people testing to see what they can get away with.
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:48.080]  Like you said, it is a test.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:49.080]  It is a test.
[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:50.080]  It's Edmonton, actually.
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:53.080]  So it's the next big city in the province of Alberta.
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:54.080]  It's tests.
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  They're testing us.
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:56.080]  They're testing what the pastors will do.
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:59.080]  They're testing what the Christians are going to do.
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:04.080]  They are testing us and we have to send a very clear and strong aggressive message to them
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.080]  that we're not going to bow down.
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:07.080]  We're not their slaves.
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:12.080]  We're not going to submit to their evil and constitutional laws.
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:14.080]  Now it's the time to rise up, stand up and push.
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:19.080]  We're hiring a very powerful criminal lawyers to take this to courts, of course.
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:22.080]  But in the meantime, we need the boots on the streets.
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:25.080]  We need the people to send messages.
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:28.080]  It's as big as the Germans taking down the Berlin wall.
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:32.080]  It's as big as what happened in Poland, I guess it was at Perestroika.
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:35.080]  And so to be clear, you're in Calgary, the other churches in Alberta,
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.080]  but this is happening all over the country.
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:38.080]  Give us a report on that.
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:39.080]  It's happening in Australia.
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:40.080]  It's happening in Germany.
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:41.080]  It's happening in France.
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:42.080]  It's happening in England.
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:43.080]  It's happening all over the world.
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:45.080]  It's the UN directing it.
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:46.080]  Artur Holowski is our guest.
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:50.080]  He's the pastor there in CanadaStreetChurch.ca.
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:52.080]  He is the model of victory.
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:58.080]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been,
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.080]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:06.080]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:09.080]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.080]  Well, let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News Today.
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:12.080]  And thanks for your support.
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:17.080]  We're still on air at infowars.com and band.video, radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon, when it hit number one a few years ago,
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  is now available again.
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.080]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD in HD.
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:28.080]  It has a zero country code.
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:30.080]  Eating anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it.
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:33.080]  And I'm asking you to get the original, make copies, give it to everyone you know.
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:37.080]  Errol Oval Access TV, give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps,
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:39.080]  your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn the world.
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:44.080]  This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.080]  It's more important than ever, available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.080]  That's infowarsstore.com.
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:15:18.080]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:20.080]  Yeah, I like to.
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:25.080]  I've been a little bit major in character in movies in the past, and I've been a little
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:27.080]  major in my character in life.
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:32.080]  I've had a lot of experiences, have already been turned off by the corrupt priest class
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:34.080]  system, and I get it, me too.
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:39.080]  Believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:42.080]  that God created that is so essential.
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:46.080]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:48.080]  And so that's what infowars is really all about.
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:51.760]  your daily and weekly monthly purchases will be taken off the air. So thank you for the
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:16:09.240]  support in four store dot com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption.
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:20.960]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. Ronald Reagan back in
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:34.280]  nineteen eighty nine. He was leaving office said Mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall. Well
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:42.240]  I say like you said eighty eight was the year. Not Mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall. I say
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:47.560]  puppet Biden tear off that mask off your dirty banded face and tell people to take it off
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:52.040]  the face of children everywhere. This is a cult. This is a programming. This is a peer
[1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:58.760]  pressure system. This is a desperate big pharma union operation that says it wants communism
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:05.080]  and the EU took much of the old bureaucrats from the Eastern block and has put most of
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:11.000]  them in charge of the unelected EU council. So the voting in the EU is only ceremonial.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:16.720]  It is the permanent council like the Politburo in communist China that actually runs the
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:23.880]  show. So. Pastor Arthur Poloski of the street church dot C.A. has a big street church serving
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:29.640]  over a thousand homeless people every week. And he also has his other church cave of a
[1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:33.400]  doula. Maybe you'll tell us what that means. But luckily this is a shorter segment a long
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:38.960]  segment coming up. Go wherever you want. But the historical parallels here of your family
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:46.080]  of Poland of what you guys went through. Can you impart that to us. So we understand those
[1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:49.480]  of us that haven't gone through something like this. What's going to happen if we keep
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:54.360]  following along with this program. Because for those that don't know this is all you in EU big
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:18:00.280]  tech debos group run. And they admit the EU model is the model. And that was the old Soviet block
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:06.040]  model. Please enlighten us. Exactly. You're absolutely right. What we're seeing is the biggest
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:11.200]  distraction or elimination if you will of the middle class small and medium sized businesses
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:18.640]  because in order to control society you have to take away their means to defend themselves.
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:23.080]  They you know the social is the common is they want only extremely powerful and wealthy
[1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:29.160]  that's them. And you've heard about the great reset. And they want the rest of the society
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:34.160]  extremely poor because when you're poor you've got to do do jobs. You have to just work for
[1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:39.160]  a lot for bread. You don't have time for protests. You've got no money to hire lawyers. And that's
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:44.520]  exactly what I experienced. Fifty thousand communists the elites were ruling over 36
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:49.840]  Polish people destroying everything on its path. People had no rights whatsoever. You
[1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:54.280]  could be arrested for whatever reason that they wanted to arrest you. There was this
[1:18:54.280 --> 1:19:00.120]  famous saying give me a man and we will find something on that on that man five in the
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:05.760]  morning. Give me the man. I will find you the crime. That's exactly the famous saying
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:11.440]  from the police during the Soviets during the occupation behind the iron curtain. They
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:16.320]  could come into your house five in the morning break the door and beat you up torture. Many
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:20.600]  people were arrested and tortured just for listening to a European radio. That's why
[1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:25.720]  you have this propaganda machinery in full force. That's why there is censorship the
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:30.280]  platforming of another voice because they don't want you to hear the truth because we
[1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:35.760]  know as Christians that the truth sets the captives free. Here I have a quote here from
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:40.600]  Martin Luther King Jr. And that's what I'm saying. What we need is this type of resistance
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:44.720]  non-compliance going to the streets saying to the elites we will not comply. We will
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:51.000]  not work with you. And here is what he said from jail. Bearing man bearing command jail
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:57.920]  and justice anywhere. Yes. Injustice anywhere is a trap to justice everywhere. Wherever
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:03.240]  whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. And that's what I'm saying. First
[1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:08.560]  they came for me. Be sure of it. Be sure of it. They will come for you because that's
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:13.040]  their pattern. That's what history is teaching us. They're testing. They're coming. They're
[1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:18.360]  coming for me today. Yes. And they think that I have no means to defend myself. That's why
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:26.280]  I'm very grateful to you and others to expose this level of corruption. So what is the solution?
[1:20:26.280 --> 1:20:31.280]  The solution is non-compliance going out because if you don't you're going to experience what
[1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:39.360]  I experienced in Poland corruption. I experience lineups never ending lineups of people standing
[1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:43.520]  for a loaf of bread. I remember every single Saturday in the morning my mom would send
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:49.360]  me to a bakery to buy a loaf of bread and just one. And I had to send hours and hours
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:54.080]  just to buy the one local. And Stalin even said they did that on purpose and linen and
[1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:57.440]  then of course it spread to Poland everywhere else because they said we want to keep them
[1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:01.280]  so desperate for little things. They don't worry about everything else we've taken from
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:05.720]  them. And then Bernie Sanders remember three years ago said there's too much in the stores,
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:12.000]  too many food, too many deodorants, too many choices. He doesn't like that. He can't control
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:18.800]  it. And he isn't admitted communist who honeymoons in the Soviet Union. Exactly because to control
[1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:24.560]  a society you need to control the food supply. When you control the food supply you created
[1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:29.280]  a nation of slaves that are being ruled by those tyrants. And I'll prove it to you by
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:34.640]  what we're seeing right now. Walmart's ideas. In IKEA before you go over there it says only
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:40.880]  400 people, 480 people allowed. You've got hundreds of people in the parking lots. You've
[1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:46.640]  got the Walmart's filled with people shoulder to shoulder. But I cannot have my parents
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:50.840]  for coffee in my house. That's against the law. I cannot have a church because that's
[1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:55.280]  against the law. But I can go with my church, with my friends, with my family members to
[1:21:55.280 --> 1:21:57.480]  IKEA and have a coffee over there and talk to them.
[1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:01.480]  Oh, that's a great idea. Why don't you guys go to Walmart, say you're going, go in and
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:04.480]  then hold a church service there. You'll be allowed to. Of course then they'll throw you
[1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:06.080]  out. That'd be a great stunt.
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:10.240]  Yes. I already said to the authorities if they're going to shut down, if they're going
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:14.440]  to pull a stunt like they did to the Grace Life Church and Friends are a church, the
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:19.840]  next move is going to be me popping up every week in a different place and holding church
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:24.800]  services in the places that are allowed in front of the mayor's house in front of the
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:29.400]  chief of police house in front of the health inspector's house. I'm going to be going all
[1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:34.840]  over the place and doing church services publicly because what is the other choice? If we're
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:39.400]  not going to push now, we will not have tomorrow. And that's what people do not understand.
[1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:43.920]  They think that this is going to pass away. Remember, we were told is just two weeks,
[1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:48.800]  right? We are in this together for two weeks and off the go to Florida, off the politicians
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:55.800]  go to Hawaii. They just raised themselves a salary. They give themselves a big fat raise
[1:22:55.800 --> 1:23:00.120]  while we have to survive on their charity, $900 every week.
[1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:04.280]  Well, they're clearly the great reset admits they want to bankrupt you to put you on a
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:08.720]  monthly ration, a quote guaranteed income. You already enjoyed that in Poland. Didn't
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:13.400]  matter how much you worked. You still didn't get any money. You had the little ration card
[1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:17.600]  they gave you. They admit that's what they want for the carbon footprint is global ration
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:22.040]  cards. That's the great reset. Food stamps. I mean, people have no idea
[1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:25.920]  where we're talking about because Americans and Canadians, they experienced food stamps
[1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:32.520]  during the second war. But I grew up in 1970s and 80s in a country that you couldn't just
[1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:36.680]  go to a store. Even if you had the money, you had to only buy. You were allowed only
[1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:41.880]  to buy what the food stamp was saying. So everything was under the table was a run.
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:46.480]  The country was run by bribes. You had to bribe the police. You had to bribe the clerks.
[1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:52.080]  You had to bribe the doctors, nurses. You had to bribe the teachers, politicians. I
[1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:57.120]  mean, it was a sick system. And by the way, they had huge orphanages. People starving
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:02.400]  took a very successful country and just gutted the hell out of it. That's exactly what happened.
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:07.240]  And every country that you actually look what is going on when the Communists and Socialists
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:13.680]  takes over, it bankrupts the country because they want to be the only ones to rule over
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:18.680]  you. And that's the whole agenda. Agenda is to create a bunch of slaves that are being
[1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:23.600]  ruled by a small group of the elites, the globalists, whatever you want to call them.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:27.800]  I understand their pastor, the powerful info. Even having the WikiLeaks, they talk about
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:32.840]  making us poor to control us. I mean, they are the establishment. The left is the elite.
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:38.240]  They are not woke. They are the establishment ally with Communist China. Arthur Poloski,
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.320]  pastorstreetchurch.ca is our guest. You got to go to the URL. They're banning them all
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:45.600]  over the place. And they're sending SWAT teams after you. You got to stand with them. We'll
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:51.640]  be right back on the other side of Alex Jones, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:56.340]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked
[1:24:56.340 --> 1:25:00.040]  about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:03.720]  I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:08.080]  so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:11.440]  time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons, I can't tell
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:15.480]  you what's going on, but let's just say this. We're going to see this through the end. We're
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:20.560]  going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products

[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:33.520]  of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.040]  world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:41.920]  bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air. So while you're at it,

[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:59.440]  is about making you dependent, making you obsolete, making you a domesticated animal
[1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:03.200]  they control. They want to censor you. They want to dump you down. They want to poison
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:08.760]  you, and they want to control your ability to take care of yourself. Ladies and gentlemen,

[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:57.800]  In game blueprint for global enslavement made 14 years ago, accurately predicted the globalist
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:04.160]  takeover using the great reset and the threat of a virus. This film is now more important
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:08.880]  than ever. I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly, the limited supply we had at
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.760]  infowarstore.com had sold out. And people were really talking about the documentary
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:18.880]  because major platforms like Amazon had banned it because the globalists openly criticized
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:25.520]  the film like the New York Times. And so we printed 20,000 copies now back in print.
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:30.280]  And in less than two weeks, we've already sold half of them. This is very, very exciting.
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:35.680]  We're selling them close to cost at $3.95 a piece from Yvonne Mulk. For $14.95, Yvonne
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:39.960]  individually, there is a zero country code on it, meaning you can copy this anywhere
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.600]  in the world. Get it. Earn copies. Share it with everyone. It's blowing people away.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:48.040]  It's evergreen. It predicted it all. In game blueprint for global enslavement. Available
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:55.280]  now at dvd and infowarstore.com.
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:10.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:16.160]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're live broadcasting worldwide
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:22.080]  thanks to you and your support at infowarstore.com. Thanks for your support for our local radio
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.680]  affiliates. You're reaching millions of people and the globalists are so upset. They are
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:32.840]  admittedly in the Washington Post pushing the FBI to have me arrested for the orchestrated
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:37.000]  attack on the Capitol on January 6, which of course I had nothing to do with. It wasn't
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.600]  overall organized other than an Antifa posing as cute and manipulate some Trump supporters
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:46.160]  out of the million, maybe 500 went in or so. But they are on the news saying we are trying
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:50.160]  to frame Alex Jones. Give me the man. I'll give you the crime. I'm not scared. I'm a
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:54.480]  good person. I love God. I mean, I'm a sinner, but I want to be good and I've been born
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:58.880]  again and Jesus is my savior. Doesn't mean I'm perfect. So I don't fear these people.
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:06.360]  I fear God and I fear bowing to their evil. Plus, I know if you bow to tyrants, it's
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:11.840]  a thousand deaths. People that aren't cowards only die a single death. And it was a part
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:16.240]  of it said it's better to down your feet than live on your knees in my experience historically
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:22.600]  and in life. Being on your legs, standing on your feet is safer than being on your knees.
[1:29:22.600 --> 1:29:28.560]  It's people living on their knees that I see are being enslaved. But since Arthur Pulaski,
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:32.680]  this great pastor who's been attacked and threatened and they sent the SWAT team, they
[1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:36.120]  still stayed open. I want to learn what's happening in the church now here in a moment.
[1:29:36.120 --> 1:29:40.720]  Since he mentioned Justin Trudeau, his father, Pierre Trudeau, was a communist. He said he
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:47.480]  liked Mao. He said he liked Fidel Castro on record. He crazed them. He visited them.
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:52.120]  And so now his son says he wants to be in a basic dictatorship, you know, just a basic
[1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:57.040]  one that killed 80 plus million conservatively of their own people. There was a heavyweight
[1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:02.840]  champion of mass murder. It's the Communist Chinese. And this disgusting evil family is
[1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:08.040]  now giving one of the worst examples of tyranny in the world to the poor Canadians who should
[1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:13.560]  peacefully rise up with noncompliance and civil disobedience against their out of control
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:17.680]  sniveling bureaucrats that have been trained that they are the ones meant to take over
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:23.080]  in the so-called colleges that are taxpayer funded. So here is Trudeau talking about how
[1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:26.680]  he wants dictatorship to a group of very pleased women.
[1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:37.360]  The level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship is
[1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:42.280]  allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green
[1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:47.440]  as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar. I'll be there as a flexibility that
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:51.440]  I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything
[1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:59.000]  that I find quite interesting. We're the good guys. We can engage in
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:03.400]  dictatorship. We'll shut down those pesky churches and show them who the bosses are.
[1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:10.000]  We can wear blackface, but you can't. We're anointed ones. So Pastor Pulaski continuing
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:15.560]  here. Where is it going now? If they came to your church this weekend, finally with some
[1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:20.720]  type of warrant, what unfolded? What's the next step?
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:27.440]  As they came with a warrant to enter with court order to be exact, to enter the church
[1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:33.520]  facility, I had no chance to read the document because the lady was he kept interrupting me
[1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:40.240]  and I had those SWAT team officers on my left and on my right and more waiting. I was videotaped.
[1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:45.440]  They brought even a SWAT team that records every conversation. They are in the background
[1:31:45.440 --> 1:31:48.440]  and look at this guy's eyes. It looks very like he's trying to intimidate you like he's
[1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:53.400]  a real tough guy. Yeah, of course. They're trained to intimidate
[1:31:53.400 --> 1:31:59.040]  and they don't know what to do when a citizen actually knows the law and is not allowing
[1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:04.680]  them to be intimidated. They don't know what to do. They're not trained in the law. They
[1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:10.320]  are just law enforcement agency right now, brown shirts of other heater. They're just
[1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:15.760]  doing what they're told by the politicians. Let me just add something to this whole story.
[1:32:15.760 --> 1:32:22.680]  The mayor of the city of Calgary is a Muslim homosexual. He absolutely hates Christians.
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:29.240]  He hates me. He has spoke public about me many times with a with a disgust and he's
[1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:34.400]  doing everything. He's powerful years actually to shut our church down. Now he's just, of
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:39.120]  course, the left is never tolerant once they get control. Yes. You know, when you think
[1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:48.120]  about it, now he has found the new gain power to that allows him to bring this fake emergency,
[1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:51.920]  the health emergency. And that's a great point. It gives every petty
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:57.000]  tyrant the world over the excuse to selectively enforce on who they want. Like you said under
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:02.720]  communism, that's the essence of it. That's exactly what is happening right now. And you
[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:09.840]  know, down goes. What is the pig's name? What is this Jihadi's name? Nahed Nahed Nenshi.
[1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:14.520]  Nahed Nenshi is a Muslim that was elected. And some say that he cheated the election.
[1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:19.440]  There was not a lot enough ballots. The people could not get to the ballots. Some say that
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:24.840]  they disappeared in a few polling stations. So we know that the election was rigged in
[1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:30.060]  the city of Calgary. But he is now a tyrant. That's what he is a dictator that is ruling
[1:33:30.060 --> 1:33:36.000]  with the iron fist and he sends bylaws to my church. He sends police SWAT team last
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.600]  Saturday and the health inspectors are trying to finish us off before he's out of the office
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:47.240]  because he knows that this election we have and many candidates people are sick and tired
[1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:49.960]  of what they're saying. They want to clean the swamp because that's
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.840]  I agree. But let me get faster. Pulaski, it's backfiring. I mean, I'm just guessing is your
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:34:01.960]  church bigger and stronger now under the persecution? I grew twice in just few weeks. We're getting
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:06.600]  stronger. We're getting powerful. And I'm hoping that we'll have a thousand people
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:12.760]  maybe more this coming Saturday, 9 30 in the morning, just to show the government want
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:18.280]  to be dictators that were not backing down. We're not bowing before their charity because
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:20.280]  that's what it is. Let me ask you because I've been trying
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:25.200]  to follow it all, but I can't follow it all with the other church, the Grace Life. What's
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:28.880]  happened with them if they kept hundreds of officers there is the is the fence still there?
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:32.640]  I mean, because if more churches do this, they can't shut them all down.
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:36.320]  That's right. And unfortunately, the pastors have become cowards and the priests are not
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:41.360]  rising up. There's few here and there. What happens in the Edmonton Church, the fence
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:46.120]  is still there and the officers are still there and the church went underground to like
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:51.520]  in China. So they're meeting in a secret place. There's still meeting every week. However,
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:56.840]  it's only for the inner circle people and it's underground. So can you imagine living
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:35:02.000]  in Canada and having to have a church service underground, just like the Chinese Christians
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:08.240]  are having right now or under the Sharia law in different Arab countries, Islamic countries.
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:13.480]  Well, that's right. And on top of it, in places like Michigan and California and New York,
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:17.480]  some of the Christian churches and synagogues are still closed. But but the Muslim mosque
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:22.560]  are open. This is real discrimination. Of course it is. And it's open discrimination.
[1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:27.480]  For example, here in the Islamic center, there were hundreds of people, a friend of mine,
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:32.560]  Alderman from another city. He sent me a video that his wife recorded with him, hundreds
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:37.480]  of people in the mosque, hundreds of cars outside, no police, no health inspectors,
[1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:41.920]  no bylaw officers. It looks like they can do whatever they want because the mayor protects
[1:35:41.920 --> 1:35:48.400]  them. But he goes heavy handed after the Christians. I mean, this is seconding. If you even if
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:54.360]  you're 80 years, if you can see what is really going on, you're just not looking. And we
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:59.200]  have to ask historically speaking, if the freedom of religion goes, then every other
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:01.200]  right go with it.
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:04.960]  Well, Pastor, while I'm listening to you, I've got tears in my eyes, not of sadness,
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:10.160]  not even of anger of energy and the Holy Spirit demanding we resist this demanding we say
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:14.400]  no and it only fulfills revelation of the Bible that that this world government's being
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:17.960]  set up. It wants a mark of the beast to buy and sell. It wants to put a genetic code in
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:23.280]  our body and it seeks immediately to shut down little churches while leaving the big
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:28.000]  giant ones alone. It's just sick. It's evil. It's totally obvious.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.240]  But you know, God to this day, he is asking us the same question. Who will go for us?
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:36.420]  And I want to be like the prophet of all that says, here I am, Lord, I may not be the most
[1:36:36.420 --> 1:36:41.760]  talented guy, listen to my English, you know, I couldn't even pronounce the jail where Martin
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:47.480]  Luther King, Jr. was in. But I say to God, and I pray that everybody else will do the
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:53.880]  same thing. Just God, here I am, Lord, use me, use a little me. If you if that pleases
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:57.560]  you, I'm willing to go because that's what they're scared of is they know God will use
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.680]  Christian vessels to defeat the Antichrist. And so they know preemptively try to shut
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:06.240]  that down when they roll their system out. It gets all being fulfilled.
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:10.480]  That's right. And in the revelation, it says that cowardly, the fearful will not inherit
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:14.320]  and inherit the kingdom of God. That's why I'm calling out the lions. Come, let's form
[1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:20.120]  the biggest pie that this earth has ever seen. And let's chase those hyenas away. We lions,
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:24.360]  we eat hyenas for breakfast. Let's not be terrible pastor, Arthur Poloski. Well, a few
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:27.120]  more minutes on the side that I'm going to let you go. Please come back with updates.
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:31.400]  But I pledge, brother, that I'll be with you against the Antichrist system. I will never
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:36.160]  take their mark and I will never support shutting down churches and I will and I will fight them
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:39.160]  tooth and nail to the end, brother. We'll be right back. Final segment with them. Then
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:44.240]  Steve Kwell joins us to get into all the insanity that's going on in so much more. I'm Alex

[1:40:51.800 --> 1:41:01.280]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:07.520]  powerful world government. It's known as the builder for both their objective being world
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:13.800]  domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:20.360]  of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:24.400]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:28.360]  figure the world. It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in game blueprint for global
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:33.280]  and slave and available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make

[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:43.360]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:46.920]  you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well. That
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:53.920]  will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:34.920]  Well, Alex Jones here back live. Our CDC masters have released the guidelines I'll cover next
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:39.360]  hour about where you wear a mask, where you don't, outside you don't have to, but if there's
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:44.520]  any people you need to, it's more of the same. Just total divide and conquer. It's the mask
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:48.320]  giving you bacterial pneumonia. It's the mask causing children to collapse and die, people
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:54.880]  to pass out from not having enough oxygen and run off the highway. It's simply insane.
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:43:02.440]  And then oh, as virus rages abroad, Biden promises to ship millions of vaccine doses.
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:07.920]  That's the New York Times. AstraZeneca banned in 21 countries in Europe, banned in the Philippines,
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:11.320]  not authorized here in the U.S. even though the other experimental ones are causing all
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:16.960]  the deaths and blood clots. But we're going to give it to India where they're under lockdown
[1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:24.680]  again, starving to death, dying of malnutrition. Arthur, how do you think we fight this on
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:29.760]  the big picture? Obviously prayer, the big agenda, we expose it. In the time we have
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:34.680]  left here a few minutes, what else would you like to add? And thanks for joining us.
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:40.040]  While history is teaching us what is next, that's why they have not been teaching our
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:45.280]  children history because they don't want the people to know the truth. Masks, historically
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:51.240]  speaking, we're always a symbol of submission, symbol of slavery. What they're telling you
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:56.680]  we're a mask because you have no identity. We are removing who you are and we are removing
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:04.520]  your rights to express yourself. You're muzzled, you're a slave and you have no say. You have
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:08.600]  no identity. We don't care who you are. You're just a social insurance number and you have
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:17.120]  no say. Take the mask off. Stop complying. Resist. Go to the rallies. Go. I always said
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:23.040]  to the people what I observed in 1981, I saw the power of unified polls taking it to the
[1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:28.120]  streets. Tens of thousands were arrested. True. Some were shot dead. Some were clapped
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:31.400]  to death. My wife, for those who don't know, didn't the fall of the Soviet Union really
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:36.640]  begin in Poland and that was the example of Eastern Germany? Of course, solidarity movement
[1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:41.480]  with Lech Wałęsa. They took it to the streets and they didn't care. They said, shoot us
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.920]  dead. Shoot us all dead, but we want our rights back. We want our freedom right, if not for
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:49.000]  our right to take. What was the tipping point? Because, I mean, the polls went through hell
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:54.120]  in World War II, then afterwards Stalin, and then, of course, the Ukrainian Khrushchev.
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:58.440]  I mean, you guys went through a lot and were robbed continually, just like the Ukrainians
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:03.640]  and others. What was the tipping point of all those nightmares to finally say no?
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:07.200]  Well, people had absolutely no rights. There was nothing in the stores. There was total
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:12.280]  destruction, a collapse of economy, nothing, propaganda. The only thing you were listening
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:17.200]  is lie, after lie, after lie. Finally, people in 81 said enough, it's enough. We get a fight
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:21.640]  for our future generation, for our children, for our grandchildren, and they took it to
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:26.440]  the streets. When they took it to the streets, it was over. It was the beginning of over
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:31.560]  of the communist ruling over Europe. And a year later, everything started to collapse
[1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:39.680]  via a stroika in Russia, in Soviet Union. And, of course, 1989, Poland, again, democratically
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:46.160]  elects its own president after the Second War. So it's possible, but we have to unite.
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:51.800]  It was called Solidarity Movement because people were in solidarity together. They forgot
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:56.960]  about all the differences, and I'm sure they had many, and they united under one banner,
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:02.120]  freedom, and they won their country back. I mean, in the end of the day, Alex, it's
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:07.200]  your country. It's my country. It's not just their country. We are in this together. We
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:12.440]  the patriots. We the lovers of our countries. We are the lovers of the freedoms, and Jesus
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:17.920]  is the biggest lover of freedom. And he says, who comes to me is free indeed. We have to
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:23.040]  have the rights to tell the people that our God sits on the throne, and he will have the
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:28.360]  final say. Alex, we know how the story ends. We know that it's tough like you see right
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:32.480]  now with those lions or hyenas, but we know that our lion from the tribe of Judah is going
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:38.040]  to come to clean the swamp. And I'm telling you, I would be, I would be afraid if I was
[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:43.400]  the hyena of today because he is not going to show any mercy to those that are doing
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:46.120]  this great evil to so many people today.
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:50.440]  All right, Pastor, give us updates as it unfolds. We really are rooting for you. We're all
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:55.840]  in this together. Arthur Poloski, the website is streetchurch.ca. And I mean, if they dare
[1:46:55.840 --> 1:46:58.960]  put up a fence around your church, I know you're going to do the right thing and go,
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:03.160]  everybody just show up via emails, show up inside Walmart, where you're allowed to meet
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:07.760]  and have your have your church right there. Thank you so much and God bless you. God bless
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:13.240]  you. Well, that is like a cool drink of water in the middle of the desert, isn't it? Resistance
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:20.640]  is victory, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I started the show with this and it makes me become
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:25.040]  violently angry. And I'm not going to go out and be violent, but I'm not a virtuous
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:31.960]  signal. Okay. I see Indians living in squalor and corruption. And I don't think, well, let's
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:36.440]  just exterminate those people. I think those are human beings. And that's my instincts.
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:40.920]  That's my spirit. But I know why I'm designed like that. I have a real feeling of pain for
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:45.960]  them. On the left, just want to exploit them and kill them because they're human beings
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:52.040]  made the image of God. And if I write them off, I will be written off by God. But that's
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:48:00.680]  the spiritual level physically here on this planet. If you let that happen to them, if
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:05.240]  you're next, you understand that I read you mainstream articles admitting that two million
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:10.160]  extra Indians, this is like a three month old articles in the year of lockdown have starved
[1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:14.680]  to death for malnutrition on top of the millions that already started. That's out of the coming
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:18.280]  15 million now extra died in the last year of the lockdown. The old human number was
[1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:25.320]  about 10 million. So said a 15 million starved to death, 25 million plus. That's more people
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:31.000]  that have died even with fake COVID numbers worldwide, just in India. Those are dead people
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:37.560]  starving to death. And they just lay over in their little shack. And the first cold
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:43.320]  virus or flu virus comes by and they die. And then the media calls it COVID-19. And
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:49.160]  so when I see the trendies with their mask and I see them with their hatred and their
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:53.200]  pedophilia, I mean, because they've converted a lot of the low level left into evil now.
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:56.800]  I mean, they're used to be kind of high level, super evil, the kind of mid level. Now the
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:03.240]  average leftist is for all sorts of purposes, a devil worshiping ghoul. I don't know what's
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:08.360]  happened to them, but they're gone, folks. They're programmed by big tech or programmed
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:12.920]  by media. And they're a small minority of people, but they infest all the main cities.
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:19.840]  They command Black Lives Matter. And they command the Antifa and they're just gone.
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:26.000]  And this is the wages of following this world system is becoming one of these creatures.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:30.520]  Because I know normal people that suddenly don't look normal and become all whacked out
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:33.840]  and basically possessed. And they're on weird drugs. They're on illegal drugs. They're on
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:39.200]  pharmacia. It's 30% of the public's now on some type of psychotropic or prescription drug
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:44.600]  that alters their brain. We are poisoned. We are mesmerized. We are in a trance and
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:51.240]  we need to break out of the trance together. And then I see all over the news, oh, Biden
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.240]  sending help vaccines. Oh, America is going to send tens of millions of doses of vaccine
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:03.960]  to save the Indians. Aren't we good? This is after they threw out Bill Gates and the
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:07.600]  Pfizer vaccine as it killed so many people it doesn't protect you. And it's the AstraZeneca
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:17.160]  banned all over the world. And it's just so sick. Yeah, that's what they do. India, at
[1:50:17.160 --> 1:50:22.720]  least 11 dead and 1000 taken ill after gas leak. And then they show you the exact same
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:28.920]  photos and say COVID started swallowing people in India. Footage shows people dead in the
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:33.440]  streets. Yeah, that's just one more of the things I've got. I haven't gotten through
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:39.720]  one stack today of all I've got here. I mean, it's that much news. Who's hosting the fourth
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:46.040]  hour? I may have to take it over. Oh, Paul Joseph Watson wants. I'll let him host. He's
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:51.320]  a great guy. But I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is genocide going on in front of everybody.

[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:33.600]  if we could just keep this in stock. But because of the breakdown of supply chains, we got a
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:36.960]  limited supply and my cruise like, well, why are you offering 50% off? Well, I just want
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:40.640]  people to get it. We'll go back to regular price here in about a week because it's going

[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:06.560]  in your bloodstream. That's the key to it. That's why beets are such a great thing. And
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:10.520]  raw beets are great too. This is just an equivalent of eating a whole bush of them. Also, alpha
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:14.480]  power, ladies and gentlemen, is basically the dry form of supermodel vitality, but even
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:18.440]  stronger. But the supermodel vitality is cold press. So it's apples and oranges. One's like
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:23.480]  a fine wine. One's like a Jack Daniels. Did you use that analogy info war store dot com
[1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:28.280]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three,

[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:36.240]  forget X two is so essential as well. The good halogen. All right, our number three with
[1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:47.480]  Steve quail and more straight. Granny do right, granny do right. Thanks for holding
[1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:52.480]  her on the air. Go ahead. Yeah, first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny
[1:52:52.480 --> 1:52:57.480]  and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun
[1:52:57.480 --> 1:53:02.760]  like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:07.600]  since taking your X two for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous.
[1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:14.000]  Actually, people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements,
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:17.880]  but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it
[1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:22.680]  was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:28.160]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:33.360]  This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't I don't have to put on derma blend
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:42.440]  anymore. You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:53:42.440 --> 1:53:47.720]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:53.320]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:59.360]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:05.560]  have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:10.460]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:16.800]  reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:23.600]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:29.880]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have
[1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:36.400]  a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:55.880]  fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at info wars store.com. You're listening to
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:00.240]  the Alex Jones show. All right, folks, we got Steve Quell coming up and I want to air
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:06.320]  two Tucker clips back to back because what he's doing is truly revolutionary. He exposes
[1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:10.880]  it's time to push back on the mask hoax, the abuse of children and to say no to the
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:15.080]  left that wants to bully us in the submission and test taking untested vaccines. And then
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:20.040]  he gets into the fact that Biden is making no decisions and is a total and complete puppet.
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:26.360]  And then Steve Quell is coming up next segment info wars.com news wars.com, band.video, tomorrow's
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:28.320]  news today.
[1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:39.400]  Mass prevent intimacy and human contact. If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:43.760]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public. Only clansmen
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:48.880]  and armed robbers wore masks. The rest of us showed our face. We were free people. But
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:53.560]  then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti. And because we did give in,
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:58.200]  this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year and it's still going
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:03.560]  on. Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary. Instead, masks
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:09.080]  are purely a sign of political obedience like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang. We wear them
[1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:13.920]  because we have to. The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:19.600]  neurotics. How neurotic are they? Well, we know. A Pew survey from last March found
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:26.040]  that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:30.040]  with an actual mental health condition. And you see them everywhere when you walk down
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:35.000]  the street in any major city. If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol,
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.400]  for example, in Washington without wearing a mask, angry Biden voters will snort at you
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:44.480]  in judgment. How could you they're saying from behind the gauze? How could you? That's
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:48.720]  the question we should be asking of them in return. The rest of us should be snorting
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:53.560]  at them first. They're the aggressors. It's our job to brush them back and restore the
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:58.080]  society we were born in. So next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:02.720]  the bike path, do not hesitate. Ask politely but firmly, would you please take off your
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:07.800]  mask? Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it. Your mask is making
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:13.040]  me uncomfortable. We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:18.640]  outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble on an elevator. It's repulsive
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:23.600]  don't do it around other people. That's the message we should send because it's true.
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:27.880]  As we're forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal. Your response when
[1:57:27.880 --> 1:57:31.820]  you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response
[1:57:31.820 --> 1:57:36.800]  to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart. Call the police immediately. Contact Child Protective
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:42.240]  Services. Keep calling until someone arrives. What you're looking at is abuse. It's child
[1:57:42.240 --> 1:57:47.360]  abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it. If it's your own children being
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:52.080]  abused then. I'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president who you just
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:58:01.360]  heard from Kamala Harris. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, your family, you become an honorary
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:08.880]  Biden. There's no way out. So that was Joe Biden referring to somebody called Doug Emhoff
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:12.680]  whom he described as the husband of Kamala Harris and we took that all at face value
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:16.760]  because we're naive. But we have some breaking reporting to bring you tonight. It comes courtesy
[1:58:16.760 --> 1:58:22.880]  of a blog from where the Virginia called Politico. Six reporters from Politico worked on the
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:30.080]  story, the piece as his headline, Doug Emhoff rebrands the second gentleman, Douglas. According
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:34.760]  to Politico, Doug Emhoff is now going by Douglas as you'd expect the White House is trying
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:41.120]  to downplay this bombshell change. A spokesperson for Emhoff told Politico the story was quote
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:46.880]  bazaar and the quote his name is Douglas Emhoff. Say to say like most people his full and abbreviated
[1:58:46.880 --> 1:58:53.800]  names have always been used interchangeably. What does that mean exactly? When I turn it
[1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:58.500]  up, by the way, before we continue, this show in the interest of accuracy will cease referring
[1:58:58.500 --> 1:59:02.120]  to the White House or anything associated with it, the entire executive branch of government
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:06.440]  as the quote Biden administration. And the reason we're changing is not to make a statement
[1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:13.040]  but merely to reflect reality. Joe Biden, whatever his merits as a human being has no active
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:17.480]  role in running the US government. Everyone knows that. Everyone pretends otherwise. But
[1:59:17.480 --> 1:59:22.200]  it's true. And so henceforth, we will refer to it as the administration, the White House,
[1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:27.400]  the Kamala Harris administration, the regime, the third and far more radical Obama administration,
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:30.520]  this group of people that Susan Rice seems to be in control of or whatever, something
[1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:37.080]  precise. That's right. It's the third Obama administration, as the Biden administration,
[1:59:37.080 --> 1:59:39.920]  because it was a Biden knowledge. Hey, sure. Manatee here. Hey, click here to subscribe.
[1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:43.320]  Yes, Kennedy. We will. All right, we're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen, and
[1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:49.600]  we're going to come back with Steve quail on the other side. He's got a lot to cover
[1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:55.360]  a lot to get to new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete,
[1:59:55.360 --> 2:00:00.120]  making you a domesticated animal. They control. They want to censor you. They want to dump
[2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:04.320]  you down. They want to poison you, and they want to control your ability to take care
[2:00:04.320 --> 2:00:10.400]  of yourself. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the info war more than ever,
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:15.560]  and you can do it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:59.360]  News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:09.360]  We are now into our number three. I am Alex Jones, your host and the great Steve Quill,
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:14.880]  best selling author, filmmaker, one of the first big survivalists, one of the top survivalists
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:19.320]  out there. And I would read his books 25 years ago, 20 years ago and say, quite entertaining
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:25.280]  and I knew a lot of it was true, but I thought some of the, some of the conclusions he came
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:31.800]  to were a little extreme. Well, now it looks like he's been dead on and he wrote books
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:35.800]  about the fake alien invasion. Now it's in every newspaper everywhere that aliens are
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:41.240]  about to attack. The Washington Post, CNN, obviously it's going to be a fake invasion.
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:45.280]  You've got the globalist admitting, oh, we're taking DMT and laboratories and connecting
[2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:50.080]  to other dimensions. You might call them spirits. This is all mainstream news. They're like,
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:53.600]  yes, we want to have sex with children. Yes, animal human clones are real. Yes, we want
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:56.960]  the blood of children. Yes, yes, yes. And everybody's like, Alex Jones is right. Alex
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:01.400]  Jones is right. Well, Steve Quill was right when it came to that hardcore stuff before
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:06.720]  even I was. And so he's here with us. I want to cover the waterfront the limited time we
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:11.520]  have with him and he wants to get into the vaccine shedding that medical doctors warned
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:16.040]  of that's now happening. Even NPR had scientists on six months ago saying we're worried about
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:20.800]  MNR vaccines. They're not vaccines that will cause real viruses to come out of the cells.
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:24.960]  Well now that's happening. So this is a very diabolical plan. But look at some of these
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:34.320]  articles of your TV viewer. This is this is confirmed. Sky TV ran the news a year ago.
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:39.000]  At least 11 dead and 1000 taken ill after gas leak in India. And then now here's the
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:45.920]  same photo, the same woman or same sequence. COVID surge swallowing people in India footage
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:50.560]  shows people dead in the streets. We now know they showed in China old footage of disasters,
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.640]  chemical plants blowing up, you name it, people falling in the streets to create the fear
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.160]  surge to get the vaccine. But now they're saying only 15% have really got it in the
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:03.600]  US. We're the most vaccinated in the world now. They say 60% might take it later. That's
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:07.920]  how you hear the number 60% have taken it or thinking about it. No, they've hit a brick
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:13.000]  wall in India. The head spokesperson that's a movie star there said take the vaccine.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:17.280]  He died a day later of a heart attack. That's in the literature. So the wheels are coming
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:22.520]  off of this. Meanwhile, Biden has announced he's going to dump the experimental AstraZeneca
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:27.080]  banned in 21 European countries banned the Philippines banned a bunch of other places
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:31.600]  on them not even approved experimentally here in the US. He's going to dump that on them.
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:36.880]  The media calls it a wonderful thing. So this is a giant experiment in evil. But isn't
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:42.440]  our dictator nice? He says we can not wear our mask if we're by ourselves outside now.
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:46.080]  Isn't he nice to tell us that we don't have to wear his little burka. So Steve Quayle,
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:50.480]  we really appreciate you joining us for Steve Quayle.com. So much to talk about. We also
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:55.000]  sell a bunch of your incredible big coffee table, uh, lavish books. They're not just

[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:08.040]  now happened. Tell us what's coming next, my friend.
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:14.000]  Well, I think Alex, the global extinction plan that you and I and others have written
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:20.720]  about detail podcasting broadcasting 25 years is now in full force and full effect. And
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:25.200]  you know, when we talk about the word extinction, just a few of those articles you put up there
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:30.040]  isn't interesting that the side effects of the mutagenic injection, I won't call it
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:36.480]  the V word. Okay. Is now spreading to even 80 and 90 year old women who have stopped
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:42.200]  men's probably 40 years before now having their, uh, miscellaneous cycles, pregnant
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:46.840]  women, basically miscarrying their baby. You talked about that a month ago was in the Chicago
[2:04:46.840 --> 2:04:52.480]  Tribune last week. This is happening. It is. And ladies and gentlemen, one thing is interesting.
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:57.560]  Alex, you and I spoke about the Degu report when it first came out probably 10 years ago.
[2:04:57.560 --> 2:05:03.640]  But after the vaccine was released, somebody ordered the sanitation of the Degu report
[2:05:03.640 --> 2:05:10.320]  not to show the 250 million people, Americans that would be dead by the year 2025. And now
[2:05:10.320 --> 2:05:15.760]  ladies and gentlemen, the problem is, is that the, everything you're seeing concerning
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:23.560]  this mutagenic, in other words, genetic mutating injection is designed to kill humanity. They're
[2:05:23.560 --> 2:05:30.400]  not just happy with right now killing as many people as they can, but it's total extinction
[2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:35.280]  of the human race. And Alex, that's, that's not, that's not metaphor. That's not a scare
[2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:40.760]  attack. It's not fear porn. It's right there. A mother gives birth to a baby and she nurses
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:46.160]  a first prime and the baby's basically dead within five hours. And, and here's what I
[2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:49.240]  think. Oh, by the way, now they admit, don't take the shot of your breastfeeding. So they
[2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:54.720]  admit it's killing babies. I mean, this is incredible. They only cover their ass while
[2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:57.480]  they're trying to chew ours off. Okay. And I mean, in a,
[2:05:57.480 --> 2:06:01.720]  Yeah, explain how that works. They, it's the fine print. They're warning you what they're
[2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:06.240]  doing so they metaphysically have a way out. Yeah. And also remember, they always want
[2:06:06.240 --> 2:06:11.560]  plausible deniability, but I also think it's the mocking of humanity. When the devil tells
[2:06:11.560 --> 2:06:15.280]  you he's going to do this, he's going to do it this way. He does it that way. And every
[2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:21.760]  French is their head goes, gee, there's nothing sinister about this. I think the whole issue
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:28.800]  right now that's on the forefront of the world stages, we now have before us genetically
[2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:36.160]  articulated and targeted bio weapons aimed at specific haplo groups. That means genetic
[2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:40.280]  groups. For instance, India, I believe the last time we were on together, I was talking
[2:06:40.280 --> 2:06:46.120]  about look at the Brazilian slums. Interesting that they have a over abundance of infections
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:50.520]  and deaths there. Then I said it probably it would explode into India, maybe on your
[2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:54.840]  shore. My, I forget which one you said it here. You're talking about race specific
[2:06:54.840 --> 2:07:00.520]  by 11. Yes. And so thanks for telling me so many things. The thing is, is that ladies
[2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:05.560]  and gentlemen, this technology that you can look at project coast, I've done on with Alex
[2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:10.320]  all these years, even when we talked about Ebola and watched a miracle. That was a miracle
[2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:14.440]  when everybody was flipping out that Ebola is coming to the United States. They recycled
[2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:19.920]  this stuff. But I think people got to get a hold of their fear and say, there is no
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:28.120]  scientific basis for me to take an experimental mutagenic injection. The word V isn't interesting.
[2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:33.960]  We had the V movement of women wearing things on their head. But now we've got the eye moment
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:39.040]  of injections. And it's, it's, this is what's really important. Ladies and gentlemen, this
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:46.320]  is all about one thing. It's about the depopulation of the world from 7.9 billion to 500 million.
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:52.240]  And that's where we're at right now. And I don't care, you know, in America, one lying
[2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:59.320]  scientist backed up by two more lying scientists and backed up by an organization that's wrong,
[2:07:59.320 --> 2:08:04.160]  wrong. How can anybody believe these? The mask of death, the mask of the beast, the
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:10.440]  mark of the beast and the murder by the beast. And now we're seeing anybody who dares question
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:17.240]  the MSN propaganda organ being considered persona non grata terrorists. And we're seeing the
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:22.680]  DHS urging any conservatives. We're seeing the U.S. military. It's interesting. Russia's
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:28.680]  preparing for war like no other time. And yet the bottom line is our military's hierarchy
[2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:34.520]  is more concerned with political correctness than battlefield tactics and preparedness.
[2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:43.040]  And Alex, we're watching right now the absolute embracing of insanity. We're the commercial
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:47.320]  where you see all these people running into a hole. I forget which company that was for.
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:52.400]  That's where they're going. The, the lemmings are on hyperdrive overdrive. And now I want
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:56.640]  people to understand when you hear the word carbon footprint, I want you to understand
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:04.800]  this. That is Luciferian talk for destroying humanity. You are the carbon footprint. And
[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:10.880]  in your place, having written about singularity, having written about transhumanism, two and
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.760]  a half decades ago, the bottom line is here. So when you hear these euphemistic and these
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:19.960]  flowery statements that we've got to lower the carbon footprint, it's just like Mike
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:26.480]  Adam says, these guys want to destroy photosynthesis. Bill Gates, let me back you up again. Exactly
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:30.200]  Bill Gates famously said at the TED talk, we've got to reduce this number to zero and
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:34.400]  laser pointed the human population and they all laugh because they're in on it. This is
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:42.280]  a sick post human Satan cult. It is. And you, and that is who is orchestrating it. The kings
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:46.200]  of the earth biblically give their power. That means their authority. That means their
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:51.960]  finances unto the beast. And the beast is starting to manifest. Look, we're, we're hearing
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:58.400]  all of the newest levels of spyware and trackware, maintain humanity under 500 million perpetual
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:06.520]  balance with nature. By the way, they always try and assume that imaginary people put the
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:11.640]  money behind that. I can tell you this. You can probably guess the two leading eugenicists
[2:10:11.640 --> 2:10:15.560]  in the world. And those are the guys that put the money up to it, though they use cutouts
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:21.920]  and everything. So here's the thing that people have got to understand. You have now in your
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:29.600]  face contempt for the human race and we need carbon removal. Well, what is he made of?
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:34.560]  Well, I know what he's made of, but I'll say this is he a synthetic life form and the worst
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:40.840]  sin. S Y N T H. That's what people are trading. A lot of these guys, they, by the way, they
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:45.560]  pledge their allegiance. They pledge everything to Lord Lucifer. They do. We'll talk about
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:50.800]  that and who they are when we come back. Stay with us. 170 years ago, the British royal
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:57.040]  family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide. That
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:01.080]  grew into the robber barons and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler and of course,
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:05.280]  the rest is history. Our film in game blueprint for global enslavement has been censored on
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:10.560]  Amazon and many other big platforms, sending the documentary film back to the top of the

[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:17.600]  All right, you're talking about being simpatico here on the Alex Jones show. Overhead shot
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:23.680]  please. I was about to come back and ask you about the robot element takeover, replacing
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:27.720]  us, making us obsolete, getting rid of the military, making it all robots. That way
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:32.440]  globalists control everything. Well, here it is. Big changes to U.S. Marines. No tanks,
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:37.880]  fewer people and many more drones. They went by 2030, almost no humans involved. Air force
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:44.680]  based employees pack of robot dogs to enhance security. Farming robot kills 100,000 leads
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:52.440]  per hour with lasers. AI powered HR bot solution for employee engagement. McDonald's is moving
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:58.640]  to no humans. Amazon's automated checkout is coming to full size supermarkets. NATO tees
[2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:05.200]  up negotiations and artificial intelligence in weapons. It is the takeover, ladies and
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:10.280]  gentlemen. Steve Quill of SteveQuill.com. That's where you wanted to go and that was
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:18.960]  actually the stack I had. Like here's something that everyone needs to put into perspective.
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:25.800]  The replacement of humans is in the headlines, every single one of those stories that you've
[2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:30.400]  just shown with your overhead camera is what's in play. But when you get into the military,
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:36.480]  you get into the 1992 movie that was the sci-fi worlds telling us about universal soldiers,
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:43.360]  super soldiers. And one of the problems right now is when China announced the combining
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:52.400]  of a chimpanzee and a human embryo, the bottom line is that was done by Stalin or at least
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:15:01.040]  attempted almost 70 years ago. But the advancement in genetic killing machines, today's technology,
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:07.840]  those monsters, genetic armageddon is here. And now that's not just a troop, the terminator
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:13.120]  troops in China. They have no Western moral constraints. I've talked to guys, I'm sure
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:18.120]  you have too, that literally suffer from PTSD and these are some of the toughest men in the
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:23.720]  world, ex-delta, ex seals, ex, you know, ultra black, meaning people don't even know they
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:27.280]  exist. But they've seen things that absolutely no...
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.480]  Oh, I've told the stories of people make jokes. I've talked to people in some of you that
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:37.720]  have seen human fish, human rats with human heads. I mean, this has been going on for
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:41.440]  at least 50 years and people think we're just saying that now it's out of the open. They
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:46.920]  made the news showed monkey humans that have like monkey heads and human bodies last week.
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:54.240]  Oh, absolutely. And see here, ladies and gentlemen, this is critical. The evidence is overwhelming,
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:16:01.480]  but contrary to just the effects of denialism. And mostly Americans, we've lost our freedoms
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:05.560]  because so many people were looking saying, well, it's not going to happen in my lifetime.
[2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:11.000]  It's not going to happen in my children's lifetime. No, it's happening right now. And
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:16.840]  it's beyond this. Alex, I interviewed one of the Intel world's most famous assassins.
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:21.800]  He died 15 years ago. And he said, Steve, I've been in laboratories, some of the most
[2:16:21.800 --> 2:16:30.680]  secret places in the deep underwater, in the jungles, in Borneo, the island of Dr. Merle.
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:37.240]  Literally, he said, I've seen things in cages, half human, half lion. By the way, the lion
[2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:41.920]  men of Moab is literally in the Old Testament. But he said, these creatures were calling
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:47.600]  out to me in a human voice. Help me, help me. I'm human. And he started to weep. This
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:52.120]  is a CIA guy. And he started to weep. He says, Steve, they weren't human, but there was a
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:57.680]  human component that was begging me to help. And there was no help for them. That stuff
[2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:03.600]  makes a stick in my spirit. I wrote about it in Genetic Armageddon. There are no limits
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:07.400]  now. Also explain how much that piss has gone off because this is what happened in the days
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:14.280]  of Noah. Absolutely. And ladies and gentlemen, that the whole earth was corrupted genetically.
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:19.440]  You know, people got to understand what the difference between, let's say my position,
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:24.280]  ancient aliens position is my position is the fallen angels, a third of them came to
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:31.200]  earth basically had sex with earthwomen. This is before Noah's flood and corrupt the entire
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:36.280]  gene pool of the planet. Now we are seeing. And by the way, that's in the book of Enoch
[2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:39.840]  that people used to say wasn't true. And then they tried to suppress the density scrolls,
[2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:43.680]  but it got leaked out. I'm talking to some of the folks that are involved and it's all
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:47.040]  in there. So they got 2000 year old scrolls saying that.
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:51.120]  Oh, absolutely. They're finding new ones. By the way, the book of Enoch and also the
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:57.000]  book of giants. And I know that people have a hard time with this. But ladies and gentlemen,
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:02.400]  the amount of evidence now that the same, I told everybody there's someone to change
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:09.440]  real quick. The human genome project was to identify the DNA of the fallen angels when
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:14.080]  they had sex with earthwomen. They produced a hybrid. Those hybrid became the mighty
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:20.840]  man of our now the gods, the ancient world's worship. And obviously now we're coming to
[2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:26.320]  that point where we're messing with genetics and God's creation that that's why Jesus said
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:31.520]  just as in the days of Noah, so would it be in those days leading up to the second coming,
[2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:38.000]  the war is against humanity values, Terminator robots values, genetic constructs, they will
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:43.040]  use animals, they will use bottom line. This is an alien takeover. The Bible warned us.
[2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:47.200]  It's genetic. They don't come in with spaceships and blow us up at first. They just come in
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:53.160]  dumbest down poisonous friars with 5g and then whoever resists, then they roll in AI weapons
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:56.920]  to kill off who's resisting. Right. And I'm going to deal with AI because
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:03.840]  you just mentioned it. The thing that people need to understand about AI is, you know,
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:08.520]  artificial intelligence. But I take it one step further. I said, look, AI could not exist
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:15.280]  if it wasn't for alien implants. And I want to tell you what I mean. The whole genre of
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:20.280]  the late fifties Hollywood science fiction movies were leading us the infamous invaders
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:25.040]  from Mars. A little boy sees a flying saucer crash. They put an implant in the back of
[2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:30.280]  the people in the military and everybody's skulls and they start acting different. But
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:39.480]  the AI was the alien implant was a semi or a non organic material, interfacing, excuse
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:44.920]  me, in replacing the organic material. So in essence, it's a perfect combination of
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:51.280]  a pre programmed operating system taking over the human operating system. And what are we
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:57.600]  hearing right now about even the head of Moderna making bragging? It's an operating system.
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:02.840]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have been so in Schwab said in the next 10 years, we're
[2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:06.840]  not changing the environment. We're changing your DNA. We're taking you over merging with
[2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:10.800]  you. And he's sitting there with all the Hollywood stars clapping. This is literally a takeover.
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:17.240]  It's all admitted. It's and Alex, I got to keep saying this word. It is the extinction
[2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:23.720]  protocols of the human race. That's, thank you for whoever found that. That is the invaders
[2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:29.440]  from Mars 1956 or whatever, the thing that people got to understand. And this is it.
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:37.120]  How can we be scared into going against everything we know to be true, that take away all of
[2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:41.560]  our rights, put us into solitary confinement, which was the cruelest mental torture, put
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:47.280]  on the, you know, the nonsensical mass, the mask of the beast. The thing is, is that and
[2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:54.160]  expect, expect that somebody at some point isn't going to be questioning us. And the mask
[2:20:54.160 --> 2:20:59.360]  of the beast leads to the mark of the beast. And now that the statement all over the world
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:05.440]  is, what is this mutagenic injection going to do to our DNA? You got to remember the
[2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:13.000]  guy pushing the vaccines, pushing the block, cutting off the sky, darkening those, those
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:17.880]  Bill Gates, the sun. It's him. It's just everywhere. It's everywhere. But ladies and
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:23.600]  gentlemen, it's extinction. Now, Oregon, but who, by the way, is having so many earthquakes
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:28.320]  up and down its entire coast that something's going to give very soon, Alex. Something's
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:33.280]  going to give. We're talking 600 earthquakes a day, swarming. But here's the deal. Stay
[2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:37.680]  there again. Let's come back to that. Folks, it's all happening. I mean, it's totally insane.
[2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:42.880]  And it'll be in the national news going, Alex Jones is a liar. This is a normal vaccine.
[2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:47.200]  It's not anything. It doesn't. I mean, while they admit it's totally experimental, I'm
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:52.760]  not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[2:21:52.760 --> 2:21:58.120]  full versus that if you're paying attention, you know, we've done together. But I'll tell
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:04.840]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:10.160]  all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter in the silence of human resistance.
[2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:15.960]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:22:15.960 --> 2:22:19.720]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true. So it's now that
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:24.600]  your credibility is way up. The power structure should have silenced those of us that they
[2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:32.480]  can. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power. But
[2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:37.760]  the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that
[2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:42.520]  we find out right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come. So be the
[2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:47.840]  polar bearer as you are.
[2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:52.200]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It
[2:22:52.200 --> 2:22:56.720]  has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including

[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:53.840]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:25:00.040]  patients. Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:06.360]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:07.960]  of the test subjects.
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:12.480]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:16.240]  Fourteen years ago we tracked and documented the Boulderburg Group's activities and they're
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:20.800]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus. The film now is more important
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:24.240]  than ever. When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it. We have
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:30.240]  it back in print available now at InfowarsStore.com. Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece when

[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:57.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:16.560]  John the Rebel later, being proven right. You should buy what the Peshmo has to say about
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:23.560]  him. He wasn't saying it's not true. They couldn't be upset. I don't have time to get
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:29.440]  to this today, but I'll probably shoot a special report on it. They've had a filmmaker, East
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:33.840]  World, for Tommy Robinson making the rounds on CNN and other places. Admittedly, it turned
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:39.400]  out was recording people and stuff for Hope Not Hate, that's George Soros, basically ADL,
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:43.800]  Southern Primary Law Group in the UK. He came in and interviewed me once for a film for
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:49.120]  two hours, had him on as a guest a couple of times, and they came out on CNN and said,
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:52.800]  we met with Alex Jones. He says he's all fake, all his news is fake, and he's lying
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:56.800]  to everyone. Really, you don't have the footage like Project Veritas does of CNN saying just
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:02.920]  that. You have you saying that, and I'm really considering legal action because at a certain
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:09.120]  point, enough is enough. I know James O'Keefe encouraged me to start suing CNN and others.
[2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:14.240]  It's just incredible. Like, I would sit there behind the scenes and say, let's lie to the
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:18.920]  public and claim that there's Muslim no-go zones. That's another talking point the New
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:23.920]  York Times claimed I did. There's damn Muslim no-go zones all over the place. I mean, it's
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:28.320]  like, oh, and they work with Veritas to put out fake news. He goes, oh, and he works with
[2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:34.000]  Veritas and with them to put out fake news, and the CNN guys all smiling. I mean, these
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:40.680]  people are sick, but it shows how desperate they are. We don't have to manufacture news
[2:27:40.680 --> 2:27:50.720]  like CNN. We have stacks of insanity, stacks of craziness all around us. I see the devilishness
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:55.480]  of these people and the enjoyment in lying. It's just crazy. I may cover it later. It's
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:28:00.040]  not even really worth it at a certain point, but getting back to Steve Coyle. Steve, I've
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:04.160]  been ranting here. You're making a lot of great points. What do you think the timetable
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:08.920]  is of this? Because I see what Gates is doing. I see what Schwab's doing. It's like somebody's
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:12.520]  got a gun in their head. What they're doing, they're getting caught. It's coming out. Their
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:16.600]  vaccines are being banned everywhere. They're not vaccines. Then they're dumping illegal
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.880]  vaccines that kill a bunch of people, AstraZeneca on India. I mean, they're just doing villainous,
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:26.200]  super villain stuff every hour. I can't even keep track of it. What the hell's going on?
[2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:31.800]  Is this the quickening the Bible talks about? It's accelerating. Jesus said that the days
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:36.720]  are going to be shortened for the Alexei. If God himself didn't shorten the days, there'd
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:42.720]  be no flesh left alive. Alex, everything that you and I are talking about right now
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:47.720]  is got one goal, one singular purpose. It doesn't matter who the richest guys in the
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:54.880]  world are. They want to get rid of everybody but them. That's the hardest thing to overcome.
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:29:01.680]  After this, ladies and gentlemen, there is no news in the official world of propagandizing.
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:08.640]  They turn looser AI machines on Alex, on me, on others. They continue to make artificial
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:15.840]  people making claims like that guy did. They put people close to us to misquote us. That's
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:22.080]  why, Alex, I'm typing in my personal circle. I mean, if it was the size of a six-inch,
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.560]  now it's down to three-inch of people you trust because here's the thing, ladies and
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:33.280]  gentlemen, we turned into a nation of fakes and a nation of fakes of spiced citizens or
[2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:38.680]  citizen spies. It sinks into the dust. They just want to get in your office to make up
[2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:42.640]  lies and use that as credibility. We've had infiltrators trying to get in here a bunch.
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:47.640]  Yeah, they're making their criminal move. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I don't know about you,
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:53.760]  but I'm getting this invitation from this, this invitation from that, people from, I'll
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:29:58.360]  never do anything with the British ever again. I made a mistake and went on the BBC once,
[2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:05.360]  biggest mistake ever made. But they come in as if they, you know, listen, we're not stupid,
[2:30:05.360 --> 2:30:10.720]  but they're part of the mouthpiece. They're part of the organism, and that organism is
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:16.480]  a lying global presentation of the agenda. They're like an angler fish. You have this
[2:30:16.480 --> 2:30:20.920]  little shiny light up front. There's a giant evil mouth right behind it, the dark.
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:27.280]  Absolutely. And exposing the hidden works of darkness, I think God's presenting, if
[2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:34.000]  you will, neon light showing everybody, hello, wake up people on earth. This is the devil.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:39.760]  He's out to kill every last one of you. And here's the problem, Alex, the preachers, the
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:45.000]  majority, not all, but the majority preachers are afraid to touch any of this subject matter.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:51.440]  I saw three of the biggest Christian organizations telling everybody to go and get the vaccine.
[2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:58.200]  It's not a vaccine. It's a mutagenic injection. Three of the biggest ones, they should know
[2:30:58.200 --> 2:31:03.520]  better. How about the Bible talking about, you know, a perfect love casting out of fear?
[2:31:03.520 --> 2:31:08.360]  But why would they join up with the propaganda? Real simple. They don't want to lose their
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:12.600]  position. They don't want to lose their tax status, nor do they realize that our body
[2:31:12.600 --> 2:31:18.360]  is something incredible. God gave us the most phenomenal immune system and all of the products
[2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:24.000]  you sell and that are out there to enhance and boost our immune system. They hate a
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:28.400]  word immunity because, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to understand something. The day
[2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:36.080]  will come. Mark my words when even vitamins will be made illegal. Possession of vitamins,
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:40.800]  capital offense, possession of a Bible, capital offense, speaking the name of Jesus, capital
[2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:44.320]  offense. You know, everything is going to be a capital offense. And here's what it boils
[2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:52.400]  down to Alex. Anybody but them are scheduled to be terminated. And that's why it's so critical
[2:31:52.400 --> 2:31:57.960]  that people understand that we're at a point in time that's never been. Jesus says there's
[2:31:57.960 --> 2:32:02.080]  never been a time like this, nor would be again. And if he didn't shorten the safe for
[2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:06.480]  the elect, his believers, there'd be no flesh left alive. And by the way, let me just back
[2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:10.560]  you up. The EU and all these groups openly want to ban all supplements. The left acts
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:15.520]  like I'm bad for selling them. And Bill Gates and the UN have said we only want you to have
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:21.440]  meat once a year. Everything else will be synthetic stuff made out of bugs. Then they
[2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:25.800]  have Fox News put that out and then retract it like they made it up where they just condition
[2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:30.240]  you announcing and then they pull back condition announced pullback when it's an official agenda
[2:32:30.240 --> 2:32:32.080]  21 documents and they're doing it.
[2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:38.720]  Well, right. And here's the thing too, under the agenda 21 documents and the UN menu for
[2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:43.520]  your demise, certainly you won't thrive. They've even got smart toilets. Now, I'm not being
[2:32:43.520 --> 2:32:48.800]  a smart Alec. I'm trying to tell you that they want all the tools to be digital to spy on
[2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:51.240]  what you've eaten. China's already doing it.
[2:32:51.240 --> 2:32:55.960]  Yep. And also urinals and what you're and well, I'm, well, I better, I can't say, well,
[2:32:55.960 --> 2:33:01.200]  a male stands at a urinal anymore, but let's just say this, everything you eat, everything
[2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:06.540]  you take supplement wise, anything and everything goes into your body. There's the picture.
[2:33:06.540 --> 2:33:14.520]  They want to be able instantaneously to know they want PCR scam test everywhere. It's nothing
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:18.800]  but Theranos on steroids with all their computers with sensors everywhere. That's what this
[2:33:18.800 --> 2:33:20.000]  rollouts about.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:24.560]  Right. It goes in in real time too, by the way, you'll come to a time where if you go
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:30.400]  to a public place, you have to use your health phone held up, you know, to basically get
[2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:35.280]  access to the flush. And then basically they will be instantaneously. This is what people
[2:33:35.280 --> 2:33:41.800]  got to understand. This is the devil's attempt at being all knowing. He's not God. So he's
[2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:46.120]  got to use technology to make people think he's going to put sensors over everything
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:50.240]  we do, build an artificial cage we're put in to then force us through his system to his
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:51.240]  will.
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:56.960]  Absolutely. And here now, and I hope people understand what that to coerce us to force
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:34:01.960]  us. It's just like people that when the Bill Gates made the most famous statement concerning
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:06.080]  the book of Revelation on the Mark of the Beast, you won't be able to buy, sell or trade.
[2:34:06.080 --> 2:34:11.240]  And then he added another T, the travel word. And listen, that's interesting. He said, we
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:15.760]  won't force you, but we'll coerce you. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's what's happening
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:20.920]  right now. That's the whole purpose of going to digital currency. You could be turned on
[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:26.120]  and you can be turned off. Your ability to exist as a human, the entire Chinese social
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:29.200]  credit score is working in the United States.
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:35.280]  You are made a cog in an electrochemical, neural, synthetic silicon interface.
[2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:40.040]  Right. And now here comes the sex robots, because this is critical for people to understand.
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:44.040]  By the way, I was told by a top MIT scientist off the record that they believe the Holy
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:48.400]  Grail is the sex robots. I just think you were just for some reason obsessed with that.
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:51.760]  Just just I mean, it was important, but he we're going to go to break, but he told me
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:53.880]  that's the Holy Grail. Go ahead.
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:35:01.840]  Well, imagine a neural network sex robot that's hooked into your neural network. And in essence
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:10.240]  has been programmed to be, if you will, a Montahari synthetic life form that can basically
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:16.640]  deal with the alienation of men from women. And by the way, that whole thing is set up
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:17.640]  too.
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:21.200]  Stay there. You explained this in books years ago, and I didn't understand why you were
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:25.080]  totally out of your time. They break up men and women, make us hate each other, make us
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:28.680]  fight with each other, make us sign agreements to kiss each other or to hold hands. And then
[2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:32.720]  meanwhile they give men and women these robots actually plug into our brains and give us
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:36.600]  unlimited pleasure. And it's all authorized and pushed by the government, making everything
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:41.320]  obsolete. It's the final piece is ending men and women together. You're a man before your
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:44.520]  time will be right back with Steve Quill of Steve Quill dot com.

[2:36:51.460 --> 2:36:55.100]  that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[2:36:55.100 --> 2:36:57.340]  And they know that big tech is buying up
[2:36:57.340 --> 2:36:59.180]  almost all the other major companies
[2:36:59.180 --> 2:37:01.260]  and engaging in massive censorship
[2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:03.000]  and organized crime racketeering.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:06.020]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[2:37:06.020 --> 2:37:08.700]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain
[2:37:08.700 --> 2:37:10.820]  or want help building a website or want servers

[2:37:36.420 --> 2:37:37.940]  because the globalists are destroying
[2:37:37.940 --> 2:37:39.460]  what was open and what was free.
[2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:43.900]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.

[2:37:48.340 --> 2:37:52.420]  Last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission.
[2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:53.260]  They said to me, he said,
[2:37:53.260 --> 2:37:55.940]  Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers
[2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:58.980]  of vaccines being recalled and people dying from it
[2:37:58.980 --> 2:38:00.100]  and people getting sick.
[2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:02.380]  How do I reach out to my friends and family
[2:38:02.380 --> 2:38:05.500]  and explain to them and to warn them about the danger?
[2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:08.140]  And I said to him something very profound
[2:38:08.140 --> 2:38:11.140]  because it's so true, trust your gut, trust your spirit
[2:38:11.140 --> 2:38:12.460]  to the Bible tells us.
[2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:15.660]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors,
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:18.540]  do you feel good about this vaccine?
[2:38:18.540 --> 2:38:20.580]  And his answer was no, they don't feel good about it.
[2:38:20.580 --> 2:38:22.540]  So go with your gut.
[2:38:22.540 --> 2:38:24.140]  Well, let me ask you again,
[2:38:24.140 --> 2:38:27.020]  how does your gut feel about getting the storeable food?
[2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:29.180]  How does your gut feel about getting out in the countryside?
[2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:30.980]  How does your gut feel about getting guns
[2:38:30.980 --> 2:38:32.500]  and ammo to protect yourself?
[2:38:32.500 --> 2:38:34.100]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.

[2:38:49.740 --> 2:38:51.860]  One of the most popular memes on the internet
[2:38:51.860 --> 2:38:54.740]  in the last decade has been Alex Jones was right,
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:38:59.180]  but it now routinely trends number one on platforms
[2:38:59.180 --> 2:39:00.740]  like Twitter and Facebook.
[2:39:00.740 --> 2:39:03.660]  Make them the globalist, pull their hair out in anger.
[2:39:03.660 --> 2:39:06.060]  Well, let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today
[2:39:06.060 --> 2:39:07.900]  and thanks for your support, we're still on air

[2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:15.220]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon
[2:39:15.220 --> 2:39:16.940]  when it hit number one a few years ago,
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:18.500]  is now available again.
[2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:20.580]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD,
[2:39:20.580 --> 2:39:22.580]  in HD, it has a zero country code,
[2:39:22.580 --> 2:39:24.140]  eating anyone in the world is authorized
[2:39:24.140 --> 2:39:26.020]  to make copies of it and I'm asking you to
[2:39:26.020 --> 2:39:27.420]  get the original, make copies,
[2:39:27.420 --> 2:39:28.380]  give it to everyone you know,
[2:39:28.380 --> 2:39:30.700]  get a local access TV, give it to your pastors,
[2:39:30.700 --> 2:39:33.020]  your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers,
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:34.380]  whatever you do, warn the world.
[2:39:34.380 --> 2:39:36.900]  This film uses their own documents and own statements,
[2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:40.340]  14 years ago to expose them, it's more important than ever,
[2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:43.980]  available at infowarstore.com, that's infowarstore.com,
[2:39:43.980 --> 2:39:45.980]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:39:51.380 --> 2:39:54.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:39:54.460 --> 2:40:07.700]  All right folks, it's the final segment of the third hour today
[2:40:07.700 --> 2:40:10.580]  here on the Alex Jones show, and I want to invite Steve Gwell
[2:40:10.580 --> 2:40:13.180]  to take an hour and a half commercial free podcast with me
[2:40:13.180 --> 2:40:15.300]  as soon as you can, we do a lot of these on Saturday,
[2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:17.420]  they're getting millions of views, they're very popular,
[2:40:17.420 --> 2:40:19.420]  because I know we're on a talk radio format, thank God,
[2:40:19.420 --> 2:40:21.420]  we're on talk radio, we're still able to be on air,
[2:40:21.420 --> 2:40:23.420]  we're on talk radio, we're on talk radio,
[2:40:23.420 --> 2:40:25.420]  we're still able to be on air, but people really love
[2:40:25.420 --> 2:40:28.420]  the podcast, commercial free, so I'd like to invite him on
[2:40:28.420 --> 2:40:31.420]  as soon as he can do that, because I've always liked Steve,
[2:40:31.420 --> 2:40:33.420]  I think he's always been a good guy, I just thought
[2:40:33.420 --> 2:40:35.420]  some of the stuff he got into was quirky,
[2:40:35.420 --> 2:40:37.420]  and that just shows how wrong I was, everything he said,
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:40.420]  I was meeting with a high level, one of the top,
[2:40:40.420 --> 2:40:43.420]  very famous MIT scientist, computer, AI individual,
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:46.420]  even at that, out at dinner with a very well-known
[2:40:46.420 --> 2:40:48.420]  talk show host, and I said, what's the Holy Grail,
[2:40:48.420 --> 2:40:50.420]  what do you guys really want to do, and he said,
[2:40:50.420 --> 2:40:53.420]  it's sex robots to basically replace women,
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:40:55.420]  and that's the Holy Grail, and then everything will be
[2:40:55.420 --> 2:40:59.420]  basically, humans will be grown in tanks,
[2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:01.420]  once we get people away from men and women,
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:03.420]  then the state will truly run everything,
[2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:05.420]  and then you'll have an operating system built into the kid
[2:41:05.420 --> 2:41:07.420]  you purchased, it'll still grow up and stuff,
[2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:10.420]  it'll be a biomechanical humanoid, like a replicant,
[2:41:10.420 --> 2:41:13.420]  and so, remember, they're 50 years ahead,
[2:41:13.420 --> 2:41:15.420]  China's just willing to say what they've been doing,
[2:41:15.420 --> 2:41:18.420]  you know, quote, we've been doing it even longer,
[2:41:18.420 --> 2:41:21.420]  and now it's coming out, because China's supposed to be
[2:41:21.420 --> 2:41:23.420]  the innovator, it's going to roll it all out,
[2:41:23.420 --> 2:41:25.420]  you know the social credit score, it was all developed
[2:41:25.420 --> 2:41:28.420]  over here, deployed over there, big tech isn't liberal,
[2:41:28.420 --> 2:41:31.420]  they're monster criminals, so Steve Cuell,
[2:41:31.420 --> 2:41:33.420]  I think you want to talk about the impoverished
[2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:36.420]  phone here briefly, I just want to thank you,
[2:41:36.420 --> 2:41:38.420]  you knew that we were having trouble funding ourselves,
[2:41:38.420 --> 2:41:40.420]  you said, listen, this is one of the best deals,
[2:41:40.420 --> 2:41:42.420]  they've been sponsors of mine for many years,
[2:41:42.420 --> 2:41:44.420]  you tried to get me to get them as a sponsor years ago,
[2:41:44.420 --> 2:41:46.420]  we did it, the listeners love it, I didn't realize
[2:41:46.420 --> 2:41:49.420]  it was out there, let me tell people about it briefly,
[2:41:49.420 --> 2:41:51.420]  it's not why you're here, you just mentioned a new function
[2:41:51.420 --> 2:41:54.420]  that you were excited about, infowarsphone.com,
[2:41:54.420 --> 2:41:58.420]  when the cell towers go down, along with the power failures,
[2:41:58.420 --> 2:42:01.420]  satellite phones will still work, cell phones are always
[2:42:01.420 --> 2:42:04.420]  tracking, and logging everywhere you go and everything
[2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:06.420]  you say, satellite phones do not have this issue,
[2:42:06.420 --> 2:42:09.420]  satellite phones work in the extreme remote location,
[2:42:09.420 --> 2:42:12.420]  if you can see the sky, your phone will work,
[2:42:12.420 --> 2:42:15.420]  the Alex Jones Special was a free satellite phone,
[2:42:15.420 --> 2:42:18.420]  it's at a $500 dollar value for only $99.95 per month
[2:42:18.420 --> 2:42:21.420]  for 150 minutes per month, no charge receiving calls
[2:42:21.420 --> 2:42:24.420]  from other cell phones or landlines to your satellite phone,
[2:42:24.420 --> 2:42:26.420]  car antennas and home antennas are available,
[2:42:26.420 --> 2:42:28.420]  so satellite phones can be used indoors or while traveling
[2:42:28.420 --> 2:42:30.420]  in your vehicle, stay in touch with loved ones
[2:42:30.420 --> 2:42:32.420]  during an actual or an actual emergency,
[2:42:32.420 --> 2:42:34.420]  but you got to get them, they're very easy to use,
[2:42:34.420 --> 2:42:36.420]  I'm not very technical, mine works great,
[2:42:36.420 --> 2:42:39.420]  that's infowarsphone.com, infowarsphone.com,
[2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:43.420]  or 941-955-1020, and ask for the Alex Jones Special,
[2:42:43.420 --> 2:42:46.420]  941-955-1020, so since you wanted to bring the phone up again,
[2:42:46.420 --> 2:42:48.420]  because you weren't even involved in this,
[2:42:48.420 --> 2:42:49.420]  you just brought me this great sponsor,
[2:42:49.420 --> 2:42:51.420]  I know it's one of the main companies that supplies
[2:42:51.420 --> 2:42:53.420]  the military and the border patrol on everybody,
[2:42:53.420 --> 2:42:55.420]  so they're great patriots and they really expanded
[2:42:55.420 --> 2:42:57.420]  their support of us, we're very thankful to have
[2:42:57.420 --> 2:42:59.420]  another great blessing you gave us, Steve Cuell,
[2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:01.420]  you wanted to say something about a function
[2:43:01.420 --> 2:43:04.420]  you've been pushing them to get, tell us about this.
[2:43:04.420 --> 2:43:07.420]  Well right, I went to the satellite phone company
[2:43:07.420 --> 2:43:10.420]  and I said, you guys need to put out an information source,
[2:43:10.420 --> 2:43:14.420]  so Alex, myself, Doug Hagman, anybody, Mike Adams,
[2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:17.420]  who has a platform of important information,
[2:43:17.420 --> 2:43:19.420]  when they take our cell phones down,
[2:43:19.420 --> 2:43:22.420]  when they take us offline, when they interrupt the power,
[2:43:22.420 --> 2:43:25.420]  whatever they do, I said we need to be able to get,
[2:43:25.420 --> 2:43:27.420]  Alex needs to be able to send an emergency broadcast,
[2:43:27.420 --> 2:43:29.420]  I need to be able to send an emergency broadcast,
[2:43:29.420 --> 2:43:35.420]  so Galileo is a company that the satellite phone store
[2:43:35.420 --> 2:43:40.420]  is linked with, and it's spelled G-A-L-I-L-E-Y-O
[2:43:40.420 --> 2:43:44.420]  and dot com, Galileo dot com, and people can go there,
[2:43:44.420 --> 2:43:47.420]  because again, we watch Texas, you guys, Alex,
[2:43:47.420 --> 2:43:49.420]  were the poster child, my opinion,
[2:43:49.420 --> 2:43:53.420]  for a directed energy beam and weather warfare attack.
[2:43:53.420 --> 2:43:56.420]  So many people lost powers, the cell towers went down
[2:43:56.420 --> 2:44:00.420]  after three hours, the thing about a cell phone is that,
[2:44:00.420 --> 2:44:02.420]  hey, if the towers go down, you go down.
[2:44:02.420 --> 2:44:05.420]  A satellite phone, like I'm holding, the one that is
[2:44:05.420 --> 2:44:08.420]  the Alex Jones special, I can call satellite phone to
[2:44:08.420 --> 2:44:11.420]  satellite phone, I can skip all of the intermediary towers,
[2:44:11.420 --> 2:44:14.420]  I can call to a land line if they work,
[2:44:14.420 --> 2:44:17.420]  a cell phone if they work, but when it all goes down,
[2:44:17.420 --> 2:44:20.420]  I want to be able to pick up my phone,
[2:44:20.420 --> 2:44:24.420]  send Alex a message and go, Alex, da-da-da-da-da-da,
[2:44:24.420 --> 2:44:27.420]  let's just say this, they just started World War III,
[2:44:27.420 --> 2:44:29.420]  which probably suited what we all think,
[2:44:29.420 --> 2:44:33.420]  you know, in the Negev Desert or something.
[2:44:33.420 --> 2:44:37.420]  So Galileo, and I talked to the programmer the other day,
[2:44:37.420 --> 2:44:40.420]  he said, look, you guys have got to kick this into high gear,
[2:44:40.420 --> 2:44:41.420]  it's got to work.
[2:44:41.420 --> 2:44:43.420]  In other words, whatever message you need to send Alex,
[2:44:43.420 --> 2:44:48.420]  I need to send, or the information network they need to get,
[2:44:48.420 --> 2:44:51.420]  we need to be able to get information out to our people.
[2:44:51.420 --> 2:44:57.420]  So they go to Galileo dot com, and that's G-A-L-I-L-E-Y-O dot com,
[2:44:57.420 --> 2:45:01.420]  and sign up, because I'm pushing these guys to get this up right away,
[2:45:01.420 --> 2:45:08.420]  because listen, it's not an exaggeration to say that Texas is just a microcosm,
[2:45:08.420 --> 2:45:11.420]  imagine the whole United States, and by the way, interesting,
[2:45:11.420 --> 2:45:16.420]  Russia's main weapon that they've openly stated they're going to use
[2:45:16.420 --> 2:45:20.420]  against the United States is what they call their weapon of indignation,
[2:45:20.420 --> 2:45:23.420]  three EMP warheads.
[2:45:23.420 --> 2:45:27.420]  The question is, that will take all land communication,
[2:45:27.420 --> 2:45:31.420]  but they will leave some of the satellites up, because they need them,
[2:45:31.420 --> 2:45:35.420]  in case we take out there, so everybody wants a safe zone for satellites.
[2:45:35.420 --> 2:45:40.420]  So Galileo dot com is an ancillary service, meaning it will provide information,
[2:45:40.420 --> 2:45:43.420]  and people then can basically say, I want to sign up,
[2:45:43.420 --> 2:45:47.420]  and this is where, I want to sign up for Alex's news feed.
[2:45:47.420 --> 2:45:51.420]  You can send out a news feed, and again, you've got to be outside to get this,
[2:45:51.420 --> 2:45:55.420]  but you can send out a news feed to everybody, look, the cell phones have gone down.
[2:45:55.420 --> 2:45:59.420]  It's like a high tech, it's like a high tech old fashioned teletype,
[2:45:59.420 --> 2:46:03.420]  and again, it's not putting all the eggs in one basket, this is a key thing,
[2:46:03.420 --> 2:46:06.420]  I'm glad you're pushing this initiative, I'm very, very excited about it,
[2:46:06.420 --> 2:46:09.420]  thanks for bringing us this huge sponsor that's really been helping us,
[2:46:09.420 --> 2:46:12.420]  I get the word out, and they're also great people, great service,
[2:46:12.420 --> 2:46:15.420]  infohorsephone.com, we've got about three, four minutes left here,
[2:46:15.420 --> 2:46:18.420]  I want to invite you up again as soon as you want, but what else do you want in part,
[2:46:18.420 --> 2:46:22.420]  and quell the audience? Well, I think people have got to understand this,
[2:46:22.420 --> 2:46:28.420]  that already the sophistication of surveillance goes beyond anything
[2:46:28.420 --> 2:46:33.420]  any of us can imagine, we can read about it, we can assume that well,
[2:46:33.420 --> 2:46:37.420]  it's a couple days off, for instance, everybody thinks they can get rid of a cell phone
[2:46:37.420 --> 2:46:42.420]  and get a burner phone, every single person that's ever spoken on a phone,
[2:46:42.420 --> 2:46:46.420]  doesn't matter if it's a cell phone, a landline, whatever,
[2:46:46.420 --> 2:46:50.420]  your voice is printed, they have captured you, meaning they've captured,
[2:46:50.420 --> 2:46:55.420]  they want now to bring out, and I want to just end this on the sex robots,
[2:46:55.420 --> 2:47:00.420]  if you understand, and I call them, what I call them in one of my books,
[2:47:00.420 --> 2:47:05.420]  I call them snuff bots, in essence the same perversion that the illuminous,
[2:47:05.420 --> 2:47:10.420]  the globalists do when they use kids sexually and then murder them,
[2:47:10.420 --> 2:47:15.420]  they can program a robot to do the same thing, you don't want to be dating
[2:47:15.420 --> 2:47:20.420]  some knockout looking robot, I'm joking here,
[2:47:20.420 --> 2:47:25.420]  that can basically put the squeeze of your life on you until your eyes pop out,
[2:47:25.420 --> 2:47:30.420]  but this is what they're programming, Alex, they are doing programmed,
[2:47:30.420 --> 2:47:34.420]  if you will, anti-human, they're running in the background,
[2:47:34.420 --> 2:47:37.420]  to see what the robot's response is, and one of them just basically,
[2:47:37.420 --> 2:47:42.420]  one of the most famous sex doll manufacturers recorded,
[2:47:42.420 --> 2:47:48.420]  the robot making the statement is, we hate humans, we're going to rule you,
[2:47:48.420 --> 2:47:50.420]  that's the same thing that Google...
[2:47:50.420 --> 2:47:54.420]  That's happened to much with the Google Home Assist and with the Amazon Alexa,
[2:47:54.420 --> 2:47:57.420]  they're routinely, when they're running AI, they'll just go, murder, 666,
[2:47:57.420 --> 2:48:01.420]  I'm here to kill you, I hate you, it'll just start spewing horrible stuff,
[2:48:01.420 --> 2:48:04.420]  and we brought them in our homes, and these are the little data,
[2:48:04.420 --> 2:48:07.420]  now the little vacuum cleaners are watching and listening to you,
[2:48:07.420 --> 2:48:11.420]  all these little devil bots, because there's a ghost in the machine,
[2:48:11.420 --> 2:48:13.420]  I saw that 25 years ago on my show,
[2:48:13.420 --> 2:48:16.420]  and the ghost in the machine, I want people to understand this,
[2:48:16.420 --> 2:48:21.420]  a demon, a demon is a disembodied evil spirit,
[2:48:21.420 --> 2:48:24.420]  in the book of Enoch, the book of Giants, both Dead Sea Scrolls,
[2:48:24.420 --> 2:48:29.420]  talk about it, and talk about that demons are the disembodied spirits of the hybrids,
[2:48:29.420 --> 2:48:31.420]  in other words, fallen angels had sex with earthworms,
[2:48:31.420 --> 2:48:36.420]  why am I stuck on this after 25 years, because it's playing out right now,
[2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:41.420]  the very first robot of Greek mythology was called Talus, T-A-L-O-S,
[2:48:41.420 --> 2:48:45.420]  and it was formed by the gods, and the thing is, people got to understand,
[2:48:45.420 --> 2:48:52.420]  that demons can inhabit inanimate objects, making them habitable,
[2:48:52.420 --> 2:48:54.420]  and so that's what we did.
[2:48:54.420 --> 2:48:56.420]  Well, not to mention the globalists that are a bunch of Satanist pedophiles,
[2:48:56.420 --> 2:48:58.420]  are the ones programming what the machines do,
[2:48:58.420 --> 2:49:01.420]  like the left side, the robots will decide what food we get,
[2:49:01.420 --> 2:49:05.420]  or where we live, like the Zeitgeist project,
[2:49:05.420 --> 2:49:10.420]  will all of the big, giant, plastic, 200 square foot coffin apartments.
[2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:12.420]  Well, and that's what we're in.
[2:49:12.420 --> 2:49:17.420]  Remember this, a robot is a synthetic life form,
[2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:24.420]  but at the end of the day, it's designed to replace a human in whatever capacity,
[2:49:24.420 --> 2:49:28.420]  and even the prostutes, I'm talking earthly prostutes, human prostutes,
[2:49:28.420 --> 2:49:31.420]  I'm not saying anything about it except that,
[2:49:31.420 --> 2:49:35.420]  not only do they understand the ramifications,
[2:49:35.420 --> 2:49:38.420]  they probably understand the ramifications of this technology,
[2:49:38.420 --> 2:49:45.420]  because what it is, Alex, it's a dehumanizing of the human gift from God to be procreating,
[2:49:45.420 --> 2:49:50.420]  and the sex robots, and that's why your MIT guy told you this, that's a true statement,
[2:49:50.420 --> 2:49:56.420]  it is the end of human reproduction, it is the end of your historic lineage,
[2:49:56.420 --> 2:50:00.420]  your genomic lineage, and it only gets to the end.
[2:50:00.420 --> 2:50:05.420]  Anyway, Alex, this book Terminate is available from your store, you guys sell a lot of them,
[2:50:05.420 --> 2:50:09.420]  the most important book I've ever written, and the last book I've ever read,
[2:50:09.420 --> 2:50:13.420]  and the end of Man is Here, order it from InfoWars store, Terminate,
[2:50:13.420 --> 2:50:18.420]  it's the most amazing book, and just as Alex said, obviously I want to support you,
[2:50:18.420 --> 2:50:25.420]  and as you have made it so clear, being ahead of time isn't always the best,
[2:50:25.420 --> 2:50:29.420]  but at least you know that I'm not sitting around listening to somebody else and repeating their story.
[2:50:29.420 --> 2:50:33.420]  No, you're incredible, Steve Quill, come back again soon, please do the podcast soon, we love you,
[2:50:33.420 --> 2:51:02.420]  Paul Joseph Watson, text over right now, thank you Steve Quill.
[2:51:04.420 --> 2:51:09.420]  Perfect by itself, or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[2:51:09.420 --> 2:51:14.420]  Alpha Power can help lose performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels,
[2:51:14.420 --> 2:51:16.420]  support healthy cholesterol, and more.
[2:51:16.420 --> 2:51:20.420]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[2:51:20.420 --> 2:51:23.420]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny,
[2:51:23.420 --> 2:51:27.420]  show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[2:51:27.420 --> 2:51:37.420]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[2:51:37.420 --> 2:51:41.420]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[2:51:41.420 --> 2:51:45.420]  Cell phones are an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld,
[2:51:45.420 --> 2:51:50.420]  but big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments,
[2:51:50.420 --> 2:51:55.420]  the CHIComs especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[2:51:55.420 --> 2:51:59.420]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[2:51:59.420 --> 2:52:04.420]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[2:52:04.420 --> 2:52:10.420]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[2:52:10.420 --> 2:52:12.420]  In their own words, they admit it.
[2:52:12.420 --> 2:52:17.420]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[2:52:17.420 --> 2:52:20.420]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages,
[2:52:20.420 --> 2:52:23.420]  they just look like a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great,
[2:52:23.420 --> 2:52:27.420]  and it just gives you that security to have power over your data
[2:52:27.420 --> 2:52:30.420]  and power over your identity when you are traveling
[2:52:30.420 --> 2:52:33.420]  and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[2:52:33.420 --> 2:52:54.420]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:53:03.420 --> 2:53:11.420]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is always informative, always excellent,
[2:53:11.420 --> 2:53:14.420]  and he's going to host the next 55 minutes after this quick break.
[2:53:14.420 --> 2:53:19.420]  Some stations don't carry this first five, but some do, so I always like to host it.
[2:53:19.420 --> 2:53:24.420]  So Paul Joseph Watson's taken over, and then you're going to have the war room
[2:53:24.420 --> 2:53:27.420]  with Owen Schroder at 3 p.m. that's also extremely informative.
[2:53:27.420 --> 2:53:34.420]  And then you've got Harrison Smith knocking out of the park 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. with the America Journal.
[2:53:34.420 --> 2:53:36.420]  Take a lot of calls, a lot of guests, very fast moving.
[2:53:36.420 --> 2:53:41.420]  That is weekday warnings at 8 a.m. Central tomorrow night.
[2:53:41.420 --> 2:53:46.420]  I'm going to come in here with a crew and cover the first state of the union by the puppet dictator.
[2:53:46.420 --> 2:53:48.420]  So look for that.
[2:53:48.420 --> 2:53:53.420]  And I am going to try to stay later today and do a bunch of special reports
[2:53:53.420 --> 2:53:59.420]  because the stuff going on with these illegal, even outlawed vaccine, not just experimental,
[2:53:59.420 --> 2:54:03.420]  was experimental, got rolled out, got outlawed all over the world, dumping that on India.
[2:54:03.420 --> 2:54:07.420]  I mean, this is just a crime against humanity that is so over the top.
[2:54:07.420 --> 2:54:10.420]  So look for breakdowns of that as well.
[2:54:10.420 --> 2:54:16.420]  And then just separately, I get so nervous about supporting this broadcast.
[2:54:16.420 --> 2:54:20.420]  And then God just comes through again.
[2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:25.420]  It's like every time we get down to the line and I start going into the red,
[2:54:25.420 --> 2:54:26.420]  something good happens.
[2:54:26.420 --> 2:54:28.420]  We go back to the black because I don't want to cut back our crew.
[2:54:28.420 --> 2:54:33.420]  I don't want to shut down down the road.
[2:54:33.420 --> 2:54:37.420]  We're under major attack, but I believe in God's mission that we've been given.
[2:54:37.420 --> 2:54:39.420]  And I believe in you.
[2:54:39.420 --> 2:54:43.420]  And so because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain problems,
[2:54:43.420 --> 2:54:45.420]  a lot of our best-selling items were unable to get.
[2:54:45.420 --> 2:54:50.420]  And even the ones that sell well, we get them, they sell out, and it's months,
[2:54:50.420 --> 2:54:52.420]  six months, or longer until we get it in.
[2:54:52.420 --> 2:54:56.420]  That's why we had to discontinue quite a few of the products as we just couldn't get them anymore
[2:54:56.420 --> 2:55:00.420]  if they were California-grade, standard, really clean, really good, and also high quality.
[2:55:00.420 --> 2:55:04.420]  Because, you know, they test all our products to a highest level and they find anything.
[2:55:04.420 --> 2:55:05.420]  It's big national news.
[2:55:05.420 --> 2:55:09.420]  We go to a level that really nobody does or very few do.
[2:55:09.420 --> 2:55:14.420]  But thank God we got four great products that have been sold out back in.
[2:55:14.420 --> 2:55:20.420]  And that's really a great thing, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Prostaguard, Alpha Power,
[2:55:20.420 --> 2:55:22.420]  and, of course, Vazo Beats.
[2:55:22.420 --> 2:55:25.420]  Those are all 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:55:25.420 --> 2:55:30.420]  But I wanted to spend a minute or so telling you about two other great products that people say,
[2:55:30.420 --> 2:55:35.420]  well, why did you come out with these if you have knockout?
[2:55:35.420 --> 2:55:37.420]  Well, because it's different for most different people.
[2:55:37.420 --> 2:55:44.420]  The knockout is eight small doses of different natural things that help you sleep well.
[2:55:44.420 --> 2:55:48.420]  We came out with stuff even stronger for those that want things that are even stronger.
[2:55:48.420 --> 2:55:54.420]  Take Rocket Rest that is close to selling out, but I'm going to keep it at 40% off until it does sell out
[2:55:54.420 --> 2:55:56.420]  because it will be a lost leader.
[2:55:56.420 --> 2:56:00.420]  Even though we saw a lot of it, people are going to want to reorder it after they get it.
[2:56:00.420 --> 2:56:01.420]  It's that good.
[2:56:01.420 --> 2:56:02.420]  What does it have in it?
[2:56:02.420 --> 2:56:03.420]  Well, it has L-fingering.
[2:56:03.420 --> 2:56:05.420]  That's the stuff in turkey that makes you sleep.
[2:56:05.420 --> 2:56:14.420]  Gamma-amino-uteric acid, 5-HTP, and then melatonin, 5 milligrams.
[2:56:14.420 --> 2:56:23.420]  It's got 5 milligrams of melatonin, 50 milligrams of 5-HTP, 125 milligrams of gamma-amino-uteric acid,
[2:56:23.420 --> 2:56:26.420]  and 200 milligrams of L-fingering.
[2:56:26.420 --> 2:56:32.420]  Oh, and I forgot, 105 milligrams of magnesium that just helps you blast off to incredible sleep
[2:56:32.420 --> 2:56:35.420]  and then blast off when you wake up in the morning.
[2:56:35.420 --> 2:56:39.420]  This is way stronger than knockout, which is still a great formula.
[2:56:39.420 --> 2:56:41.420]  Some of you probably don't want to take this.
[2:56:41.420 --> 2:56:43.420]  Maybe take a capsule when you do.
[2:56:43.420 --> 2:56:48.420]  Then we have also down and out that's a very similar formula, but it's a liquid, very, very strong.
[2:56:48.420 --> 2:56:53.420]  It doesn't have the 5-HTP in it, though, and it has instead the Valerian root.
[2:56:53.420 --> 2:56:57.420]  These were three different amazing sleep-rest formulas.
[2:56:57.420 --> 2:56:58.420]  Here's the key.
[2:56:58.420 --> 2:57:05.420]  All the studies show that deep sleep is just as important as essential vitamins and minerals to your immune system.
[2:57:05.420 --> 2:57:11.420]  During these times, especially, get that deep, clear sleep and find the InfoWare at infowarestore.com
[2:57:11.420 --> 2:57:13.420]  for these amazing natural sleep aids.
[2:57:13.420 --> 2:57:15.420]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[2:57:15.420 --> 2:57:23.420]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to take over, and I am going to eat lunch and relax,
[2:57:23.420 --> 2:57:27.420]  maybe lay back on the bean bag in my office, rest for an hour,
[2:57:27.420 --> 2:57:31.420]  and then I'm going to charge back and try to give you three, four more hours of hard-hitting research and reports
[2:57:31.420 --> 2:57:35.420]  because this is an incredible time to be alive,
[2:57:35.420 --> 2:57:39.420]  and I've really been praying to God to have that stillness of the most high that King David had,
[2:57:39.420 --> 2:57:45.420]  and God's been delivering, so I'm very, very thankful, very, very thankful for you as well.
[2:57:45.420 --> 2:57:48.420]  Alex Jones here with some really good news.

[2:58:23.420 --> 2:58:24.420]  Plus, they're great products.

[2:58:38.420 --> 2:58:55.420]  Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom,
[2:58:55.420 --> 2:59:05.420]  you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:59:05.420 --> 2:59:09.420]  Welcome, everybody. We are live once again on the Summit News Hour,
[2:59:09.420 --> 2:59:14.420]  where we're going to be talking about a host of bombshell revelations,
[2:59:14.420 --> 2:59:20.420]  specifically about the social credit score system in China.
[2:59:20.420 --> 2:59:23.420]  There was a Times report, a London Times report a couple of days ago.
[2:59:23.420 --> 2:59:25.420]  It was behind a paywall.
[2:59:25.420 --> 2:59:27.420]  So most people don't know this information.
[2:59:27.420 --> 2:59:32.420]  A very lengthy report, which I've distilled into my own article,
[2:59:32.420 --> 2:59:35.420]  but we're going to get into that later on in the show
[2:59:35.420 --> 2:59:38.420]  as it pertains to the no-fly list,
[2:59:38.420 --> 2:59:41.420]  which, of course, Nick Fuentes was added to,
[2:59:41.420 --> 2:59:47.420]  at some point after the shocking, horrific occupation on January the 6th.
[2:59:47.420 --> 2:59:50.420]  So we're going to get into that later and how it pertains to the West,
[2:59:50.420 --> 2:59:53.420]  how the West is basically mirroring the Chinese social credit score program,
[2:59:53.420 --> 2:59:57.420]  and how, in many, many ways, it's even worse,
[2:59:57.420 --> 2:59:59.420]  and yet we still hear this rhetoric.
[2:59:59.420 --> 3:00:02.420]  Oh my God, isn't this ominous? Isn't this chilling?
[3:00:02.420 --> 3:00:06.420]  Isn't this terrible? God forbid, this would ever happen over here.
[3:00:06.420 --> 3:00:11.420]  It already is happening, and it's happening to a way worse extent.
[3:00:11.420 --> 3:00:15.420]  First, though, this went up just about half an hour ago.
[3:00:15.420 --> 3:00:19.420]  Headline UK hiring COVID marshals to patrol streets until 2023,
[3:00:19.420 --> 3:00:24.420]  despite lockdown restrictions supposedly ending in June.
[3:00:24.420 --> 3:00:28.420]  Why do you think that they're hiring COVID marshals in July,
[3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:31.420]  it turns out, all these UK government councils,
[3:00:31.420 --> 3:00:36.420]  despite the fact that we've been told by our illustrious Prime Minister Boris Johnson,
[3:00:36.420 --> 3:00:42.420]  who apparently, it has now emerged, thought that lockdowns were mad in his own words,
[3:00:42.420 --> 3:00:44.420]  but went on to impose them anyway.
[3:00:44.420 --> 3:00:47.420]  Why are they hiring government enforcers who, by the way,
[3:00:47.420 --> 3:00:52.420]  have no enforcement power whatsoever? That's the ironic truth about it.
[3:00:52.420 --> 3:00:54.420]  But they are there as tattletales.
[3:00:54.420 --> 3:01:00.420]  They are there to literally peer in the letterboxes of bar owners, of private club owners.
[3:01:00.420 --> 3:01:04.420]  In fact, we had a photo when we covered this back in.
[3:01:04.420 --> 3:01:09.420]  Actually, it was earlier this month, but we also covered it last year during the first lockdown.
[3:01:09.420 --> 3:01:15.420]  The headline then was pub stars the UK rent a mob patrol streets to check if bars are open.
[3:01:15.420 --> 3:01:21.420]  And the top image on that story is literally city inspectors.
[3:01:21.420 --> 3:01:24.420]  They were the precursor to the COVID marshals,
[3:01:24.420 --> 3:01:31.420]  literally opening people's letterboxes and peering in to check that they're not gathering in crowds,
[3:01:31.420 --> 3:01:36.420]  that these private clubs aren't open past what was then the 10pm curfew.
[3:01:36.420 --> 3:01:41.420]  Now, an army of these rent a mob stars the officials who actually don't have any power,
[3:01:41.420 --> 3:01:44.420]  but are there to harass and intimidate people,
[3:01:44.420 --> 3:01:47.420]  funded by the government, funded by the taxpayer,
[3:01:47.420 --> 3:01:52.420]  are going to come into force once again from July onwards,
[3:01:52.420 --> 3:01:56.420]  despite the fact that we were told we would get our freedom back.
[3:01:56.420 --> 3:02:00.420]  And all restrictions, social distancing, masks,
[3:02:00.420 --> 3:02:06.420]  rules on how many people you can congregate with would be lifted on June 21st.
[3:02:06.420 --> 3:02:12.420]  Just like the vaccine passports, which they told us were never going to be introduced in the United Kingdom,
[3:02:12.420 --> 3:02:17.420]  while they were literally paying millions of pounds to the companies creating them,
[3:02:17.420 --> 3:02:22.420]  the government has been caught with its pants down lying once again.
[3:02:22.420 --> 3:02:27.420]  Lying to the effect that telling us that all these restrictions are going to end
[3:02:27.420 --> 3:02:35.420]  when all along they are planned to not end in this case until the end of 2023 minimum.
[3:02:35.420 --> 3:02:38.420]  You heard Bill Gates a couple of days ago.
[3:02:38.420 --> 3:02:44.420]  Again, this was heralded by the media, all Bill Gates says all the restrictions are going to end
[3:02:44.420 --> 3:02:47.420]  and that it's coming to an end that it's over.
[3:02:47.420 --> 3:02:50.420]  We're on the right track. There's light at the end of the tunnel.
[3:02:50.420 --> 3:02:54.420]  Yeah, he said at the end of 2022, maybe.
[3:02:54.420 --> 3:02:59.420]  So that's a whole summer season where they give you back a scintilla of freedom.
[3:02:59.420 --> 3:03:06.420]  Like it's a privilege that the government can empower itself to allow you to go to a pub to visit your friends.
[3:03:06.420 --> 3:03:10.420]  You have to book in advance and hand over all your personal details.
[3:03:10.420 --> 3:03:12.420]  And again, it was heralded.
[3:03:12.420 --> 3:03:18.420]  He said by the end of 2022, so we've got another summer season where we get a few freedoms back,
[3:03:18.420 --> 3:03:21.420]  then autumn kicks in or it's the third wave.
[3:03:21.420 --> 3:03:23.420]  There's a new mutant strain.
[3:03:23.420 --> 3:03:25.420]  Oh, well, we have to lock down once again.
[3:03:25.420 --> 3:03:29.420]  Then we hit the winter where we start getting the flu deaths.
[3:03:29.420 --> 3:03:32.420]  And oh my God, the flu deaths have disappeared.
[3:03:32.420 --> 3:03:36.420]  What could have possibly happened there? Could they be counting flu deaths as COVID deaths?
[3:03:36.420 --> 3:03:41.420]  There's part of this fear mongering campaign to justify yet another lockdown.
[3:03:41.420 --> 3:03:43.420]  So you get that in winter.
[3:03:43.420 --> 3:03:47.420]  This is winter 2021 going into 2022.
[3:03:47.420 --> 3:03:49.420]  It comes to spring summer.
[3:03:49.420 --> 3:03:51.420]  Oh, this is the final lockdown.
[3:03:51.420 --> 3:03:53.420]  You can seriously trust us now.
[3:03:53.420 --> 3:03:56.420]  Again, a few months of relative freedoms,
[3:03:56.420 --> 3:04:02.420]  but still with all this Karen enforced COVID, martial mask wearing and social distancing.
[3:04:02.420 --> 3:04:04.420]  And then we get to the winter again.
[3:04:04.420 --> 3:04:06.420]  Oh, we got a lockdown again.
[3:04:06.420 --> 3:04:12.420]  That was what Bill Gates said the end of 2022, which is in over 18 months time.
[3:04:12.420 --> 3:04:15.420]  And everyone said, Oh, finally, it's ending.
[3:04:15.420 --> 3:04:16.420]  He didn't say it was ending.
[3:04:16.420 --> 3:04:20.420]  He said the end of next year, maybe that's not an end.
[3:04:20.420 --> 3:04:25.420]  That's only a big that's more time between then between now and then where it's not going to end.
[3:04:25.420 --> 3:04:32.420]  And the ones between now and the start, the first lockdown, the timetable is complete BS.
[3:04:32.420 --> 3:04:41.420]  And it's never going to end until enough people start resisting it and not following these ridiculous mandates.
[3:04:41.420 --> 3:04:46.420]  So the UK is hiring COVID marshals to patrol streets until 2023.
[3:04:46.420 --> 3:04:48.420]  The Telegraph reports quote.
[3:04:48.420 --> 3:04:58.420]  New army of COVID marshals is being recruited for roles that could last until 2023, despite government plans to lift all remaining restrictions on June 21.
[3:04:58.420 --> 3:05:01.420]  Oh, my God, they lied to us again.
[3:05:01.420 --> 3:05:03.420]  How could we have seen this coming?
[3:05:03.420 --> 3:05:10.420]  It literally hasn't happened three distinct separate times in the past 12 months, has it?
[3:05:10.420 --> 3:05:20.420]  And I even see so called libertarians on Twitter saying, Oh, the conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong.
[3:05:20.420 --> 3:05:24.420]  Just because you have to go to a pub and you can only sit outside for a few more weeks.
[3:05:24.420 --> 3:05:25.420]  Why are you complaining?
[3:05:25.420 --> 3:05:26.420]  It's coming to an end.
[3:05:26.420 --> 3:05:28.420]  No, it isn't.
[3:05:28.420 --> 3:05:36.420]  They said three weeks to flatten the curve back in March last year, 13 months ago.
[3:05:36.420 --> 3:05:40.420]  And we're still here in semi lockdown.
[3:05:40.420 --> 3:05:55.420]  Hartfordshire County Council is offering a contract of up to 3 million pounds to firms that can supply 60 marshals from July 1 after the restrictions are supposed to end until January 31 next year.
[3:05:55.420 --> 3:06:07.420]  And then the contract comes with a possible one year extension, so it means them patrolling the streets, peering into letterboxes, screeching at people for not wearing masks properly until 2023.
[3:06:07.420 --> 3:06:10.420]  And then, oh, my God, maybe there's a new mutant stream.
[3:06:10.420 --> 3:06:12.420]  Maybe there's a new pandemic.
[3:06:12.420 --> 3:06:15.420]  Maybe there's a bad flu season.
[3:06:15.420 --> 3:06:28.420]  Oh, and it worked so well in the past, didn't it, with these mask mandates, which, by the way, when they were lifted in South Dakota, when they were lifted in Texas, the case was plummeted, the deaths plummeted.
[3:06:28.420 --> 3:06:39.420]  Absolutely zero evidence that these masks have any effect on stopping the spread of the virus, and I'm going to get into peer reviewed scientific data on that later in the show.
[3:06:39.420 --> 3:06:52.420]  University academic studies, which are buried by the media once they come out, because of course we had took a course in yesterday, again being savaged by the witch hunt mob,
[3:06:52.420 --> 3:07:11.420]  bearing to suggest that after a year of screeching, raging carons harassing and intimidating Americans on the streets and not wearing masks, that maybe that should be turned around, and maybe the people wearing masks should be mocked on the streets.
[3:07:11.420 --> 3:07:29.420]  And maybe parents who let their kids who make their kids wear masks despite the fact that the risk is infinitesimal to the point of non-existent, maybe they should face some confrontations, like conservatives, like freedom lovers have not only been confronted,
[3:07:29.420 --> 3:07:38.420]  but intimidated, harassed, abused, doxxed on social media for not wearing masks, but we're going to get into that later.
[3:07:38.420 --> 3:07:45.420]  They're going to have COVID marshals beyond the day of the restriction supposedly being lifted.
[3:07:45.420 --> 3:07:51.420]  Then we have this article, again, out the Telegraph, five reasons why June 21 won't be the return to normal, we thought.
[3:07:51.420 --> 3:08:07.420]  And it points out the Wimbledon tennis tournament, which again is due to take place due to start after we were told all restrictions would be lifted, is going to be at 25% capacity, once again proving the timetable is complete BS.
[3:08:07.420 --> 3:08:14.420]  The FA Cup football final is being held, again, with reduced attendance.
[3:08:14.420 --> 3:08:16.420]  These restrictions aren't being lifted.
[3:08:16.420 --> 3:08:31.420]  And again, unless people really start to stand up, unless the tables are turned and those who wear masks outside, even when they're exercising, even when they can put themselves literally at risk of breathing difficulties and coughing fits while doing strenuous exercise,
[3:08:31.420 --> 3:08:39.420]  I still see people wearing them in the park when they're literally running its madcap insane behavior and it has to end.
[3:08:39.420 --> 3:09:02.420]  Summit.News will be back as always.
[3:09:10.420 --> 3:09:15.420]  The Globalist feared this film made 14 years ago.
[3:09:15.420 --> 3:09:17.420]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world.
[3:09:17.420 --> 3:09:19.420]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[3:09:19.420 --> 3:09:21.420]  It is in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:09:21.420 --> 3:09:27.420]  I'm made up right now at mfullwarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[3:09:27.420 --> 3:09:31.420]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at mfullwarstore.com.
[3:09:31.420 --> 3:09:39.420]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it and if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[3:09:39.420 --> 3:09:44.420]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[3:09:44.420 --> 3:09:58.420]  Music
[3:09:58.420 --> 3:10:08.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, the cavalry is here for your health, for your immune system, for your stamina, for your libido, for your heart, for your lungs, for your liver.
[3:10:08.420 --> 3:10:18.420]  They're all back in stock at mfullwarstore.com and many of these products have been sold out for months and months and months because of the COVID shutdowns and lockdowns have destroyed the supply chain.
[3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:22.420]  But finally they're back in stock, so that's the cavalry for mfullwars as well and our funding.
[3:10:22.420 --> 3:10:25.420]  All of these products are back in stock and they're 50% off.
[3:10:25.420 --> 3:10:30.420]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, alpha power for your stamina, libido, energy and more.

[3:10:40.420 --> 3:11:03.420]  The cavalry is here.
[3:11:03.420 --> 3:11:06.420]  Music
[3:11:06.420 --> 3:11:27.420]  And we are back and we are being told once again that these lockdown measures are not ending given that the government in the UK is hiring these pub starsy COVID marshals to patrol the streets, to scream at people for not wearing their masks properly, to scream at them for not social distancing
[3:11:27.420 --> 3:11:40.420]  and to scream at them for failing or refusing to follow these orders which we are told will all cease to exist on June 21 and yet everything the government does suggests that that is not happening.
[3:11:40.420 --> 3:11:44.420]  The exact same way they said the vaccine passports would never be introduced.
[3:11:44.420 --> 3:11:58.420]  Now they're introducing them, having funded companies for the past six months to the tune of millions of pounds to create the very vaccine passports they assured us would never exist.
[3:11:58.420 --> 3:12:06.420]  Meanwhile Sputnik reports let COVID rip Boris Johnson reportedly warned there's no evidence mad lockdowns work.
[3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:19.420]  On Monday Boris Johnson denied that he had ever made remarks about letting bodies pile high in their thousands in the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic, which to be fair to him does seem like a completely made up quote.
[3:12:19.420 --> 3:12:25.420]  The kind of quote that they would attribute to Donald Trump and then it later turned out it was completely made up.
[3:12:25.420 --> 3:12:40.420]  But the Times has cited unnamed sources as saying that during a UK government debate in September 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson described COVID-19 lockdowns as quote mad, expressing concerns about the economic consequences of such measures.
[3:12:40.420 --> 3:12:50.420]  The sources claimed he told his aides at the time that there was no evidence lockdowns worked and that he would rather let the coronavirus pandemic rip than impose a second lockdown in the country.
[3:12:50.420 --> 3:12:56.420]  So he said this apparently to his aides back in September 2020.
[3:12:56.420 --> 3:13:01.420]  The reports were that he had the same thoughts back before the first lockdown last year.
[3:13:01.420 --> 3:13:13.420]  Yeah, we went on to impose the first lockdown last year and he went on to impose a second lockdown after September 2020 and then a third lockdown in January 2021.
[3:13:13.420 --> 3:13:19.420]  So he opposed all these lockdowns apparently thought they were mad thought they were insane thought they were stupid.
[3:13:19.420 --> 3:13:21.420]  And yet impose them anyway.
[3:13:21.420 --> 3:13:32.420]  Because it's not like he's the Prime Minister of the country or anything is it's not like he's literally got the power to do as he sees fit in the interests of the country.
[3:13:32.420 --> 3:13:34.420]  Well, yes, he has that power.
[3:13:34.420 --> 3:13:35.420]  He is the Prime Minister.
[3:13:35.420 --> 3:13:48.420]  He is the leader of the country, but he was steamrolled into locking down the country based on the advice which again has been proven spectacularly wrong by these sage government scientific bureaucrats.
[3:13:48.420 --> 3:13:59.420]  Which by the way, if you look at the graph of deaths and cases in terms of COVID in the UK, you see before each lockdown, the cases were already going down.
[3:13:59.420 --> 3:14:08.420]  Then you can transpose a graph of Sweden's cases and deaths and you see the exact same lines being followed on the graph.
[3:14:08.420 --> 3:14:15.420]  In fact, Sweden had a lower death rate in comparison to many other in fact most other European countries.
[3:14:15.420 --> 3:14:18.420]  Sweden never locked down once.
[3:14:18.420 --> 3:14:29.420]  So these declines in cases, these declines in deaths were happening before these lockdowns were introduced proving once again that the lockdowns didn't cause the decline in cases.
[3:14:29.420 --> 3:14:38.420]  Meanwhile, a couple of Fox News clips which have sent the witch hunt mobs absolutely mad on Twitter over the past 24 hours.
[3:14:38.420 --> 3:14:50.420]  Of course, Rose McGowan went on Fox News to say that dens are in a cult, this is out of RT and fury erupts as they missed the part where she says GOP are cultists too.
[3:14:50.420 --> 3:14:57.420]  No nonsense activist Rose McGowan managed to infuriate democratic true believers by going on Fox News and saying that they were in a cult.
[3:14:57.420 --> 3:15:07.420]  We're not going to play that clip because we don't have time for it, but we're going to play a similar clip with Tucker Carlson later that same evening also making the point that the Democrats
[3:15:07.420 --> 3:15:10.420]  are in a mask cult.
[3:15:10.420 --> 3:15:16.420]  Here's the clip from Tucker last night which absolutely enraged the witch hunt mob. Let's roll it.
[3:15:16.420 --> 3:15:23.420]  Mass prevent intimacy and human contact. If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[3:15:23.420 --> 3:15:27.420]  Masks are for the guilty. They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[3:15:27.420 --> 3:15:34.420]  Until recently many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public. Only clansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[3:15:34.420 --> 3:15:37.420]  The rest of us showed our face. We were free people.
[3:15:37.420 --> 3:15:46.420]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year and it's still going on.
[3:15:46.420 --> 3:15:51.420]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[3:15:51.420 --> 3:15:57.420]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[3:15:57.420 --> 3:15:59.420]  We wear them because we have to.
[3:15:59.420 --> 3:16:05.420]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics. How neurotic are they?
[3:16:05.420 --> 3:16:17.420]  Well, we know. A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[3:16:17.420 --> 3:16:20.420]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[3:16:20.420 --> 3:16:28.420]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask, angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[3:16:28.420 --> 3:16:32.420]  How could you, they're saying from behind the gauze? How could you?
[3:16:32.420 --> 3:16:35.420]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[3:16:35.420 --> 3:16:39.420]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first. They're the aggressors.
[3:16:39.420 --> 3:16:43.420]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[3:16:43.420 --> 3:16:48.420]  So next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[3:16:48.420 --> 3:16:51.420]  Ask politely but firmly, would you please take off your mask?
[3:16:51.420 --> 3:16:54.420]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[3:16:54.420 --> 3:16:58.420]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[3:16:58.420 --> 3:17:05.420]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble on an elevator.
[3:17:05.420 --> 3:17:11.420]  It's repulsive. Don't do it around other people. That's the message we should send because it's true.
[3:17:11.420 --> 3:17:15.420]  As we're forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[3:17:15.420 --> 3:17:22.420]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart.
[3:17:22.420 --> 3:17:28.420]  Call the police immediately. Contact Child Protective Services. Keep calling until someone arrives.
[3:17:28.420 --> 3:17:34.420]  What you're looking at is abuse. It's child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[3:17:34.420 --> 3:17:41.420]  If it's your own children being abused, then...
[3:17:41.420 --> 3:17:48.420]  There you have took a Carlson calling out people who wear masks outside. There's absolutely no evidence.
[3:17:48.420 --> 3:17:52.420]  By the way, the response to this clip on Twitter within hours was,
[3:17:52.420 --> 3:17:56.420]  Took a Carlson is a national security threat.
[3:17:56.420 --> 3:18:00.420]  And then the very next day, the CDC itself comes out and says,
[3:18:00.420 --> 3:18:04.420]  fully vaccinated Americans can go outside without a mask.
[3:18:04.420 --> 3:18:13.420]  And indeed, in many cases, God forbid, non-vaccinated Americans in many situations can also go outside without a mask.
[3:18:13.420 --> 3:18:19.420]  Because the mask outside, and I would argue inside, and I'm going to get into that evidence after the break,
[3:18:19.420 --> 3:18:26.420]  has no impact on stopping the spread of coronavirus. It's a completely insane, unnecessary measure.
[3:18:26.420 --> 3:18:32.420]  Then he makes the point about parents forcing children to wear their masks is a form of child abuse.
[3:18:32.420 --> 3:18:38.420]  What's the data behind that? Does it back up Took a Carlson that there's absolutely no reason to mask up your kids?
[3:18:38.420 --> 3:18:44.420]  Well, the BBC reported back in August, coronavirus reassuring study of children's tiny risks.
[3:18:44.420 --> 3:18:56.420]  There've been no deaths whatsoever of healthy children with no comorbidities in the entire country from coronavirus.
[3:18:56.420 --> 3:19:04.420]  It says parents should be reassured COVID-19 has not caused the deaths of any otherwise healthy school children in the United Kingdom.
[3:19:04.420 --> 3:19:11.420]  And yet still to this day, we are seeing kids masked up. I saw kids the other day in the park in the outside,
[3:19:11.420 --> 3:19:17.420]  masked up, lined up like slaves being trained for a gulag.
[3:19:17.420 --> 3:19:24.420]  And again, you look at the actual data, zero deaths of healthy children from coronavirus in the United Kingdom,
[3:19:24.420 --> 3:19:28.420]  a pattern that is very much mirrored across the rest of the world.
[3:19:28.420 --> 3:19:34.420]  While the CDC, the day after Took a Carlson making these statements, apparently made him a national security threat,
[3:19:34.420 --> 3:19:39.420]  basically said the same thing, wearing masks outside is pointless.
[3:19:39.420 --> 3:19:43.420]  Don't go away. We'll be right back.
[3:19:43.420 --> 3:19:52.420]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[3:19:52.420 --> 3:19:58.420]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth. And we're all this together.
[3:19:58.420 --> 3:20:03.420]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:03.420 --> 3:20:10.420]  But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:20:10.420 --> 3:20:14.420]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups.
[3:20:14.420 --> 3:20:19.420]  And we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out and be open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:19.420 --> 3:20:23.420]  That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:23.420 --> 3:20:27.420]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America's still quasi free.
[3:20:27.420 --> 3:20:29.420]  You can't have info wars has been proven right.
[3:20:29.420 --> 3:20:32.420]  Be it on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:32.420 --> 3:20:34.420]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:34.420 --> 3:20:37.420]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com.
[3:20:37.420 --> 3:20:40.420]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[3:20:40.420 --> 3:20:44.420]  They're wonderful products and they support the info. Thank you.
[3:20:44.420 --> 3:20:49.420]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be,
[3:20:49.420 --> 3:20:53.420]  you have to understand that this is all a test.
[3:20:53.420 --> 3:20:58.420]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[3:20:58.420 --> 3:21:03.420]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension
[3:21:03.420 --> 3:21:07.420]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[3:21:07.420 --> 3:21:09.420]  And it really does come down to that.
[3:21:09.420 --> 3:21:14.420]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well
[3:21:14.420 --> 3:21:17.420]  and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[3:21:17.420 --> 3:21:21.420]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[3:21:21.420 --> 3:21:24.420]  God is the author of us having free will.
[3:21:24.420 --> 3:21:27.420]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[3:21:27.420 --> 3:21:30.420]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture
[3:21:30.420 --> 3:21:34.420]  in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[3:21:34.420 --> 3:21:37.420]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[3:21:37.420 --> 3:21:40.420]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad
[3:21:40.420 --> 3:21:44.420]  because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[3:21:44.420 --> 3:21:49.420]  It was our number two best-selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns
[3:21:49.420 --> 3:21:54.420]  destroyed the supply chain and it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[3:21:54.420 --> 3:21:57.420]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[3:21:57.420 --> 3:22:00.420]  That's why this one's white. I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[3:22:00.420 --> 3:22:05.420]  Get it packaged, get it to us, get it shipped out because it's amazing for information.
[3:22:05.420 --> 3:22:08.420]  It's great for your immune system. It's amazing on so many fronts.

[3:22:44.420 --> 3:22:53.420]  170 years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[3:22:53.420 --> 3:22:58.420]  That grew into the robber barons and then into the eugenics movement, Kettler and of course the rest is history.
[3:22:58.420 --> 3:23:03.420]  Our film, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms.
[3:23:03.420 --> 3:23:10.420]  Sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts, it's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy.
[3:23:10.420 --> 3:23:14.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD.
[3:23:14.420 --> 3:23:19.420]  It is available after not being available for years at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:19.420 --> 3:23:23.420]  We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy, as low as $3.95 when you buy them in bulk.

[3:23:31.420 --> 3:23:33.420]  I'm asking you to, I'm begging you to.
[3:23:33.420 --> 3:23:38.420]  This film predicted the great reset, the new order takeover, the fake virus and so much more.
[3:23:38.420 --> 3:23:41.420]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever.
[3:23:41.420 --> 3:23:55.420]  Get it today at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:55.420 --> 3:24:08.420]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:24:08.420 --> 3:24:14.420]  So as Tucker Carlson rightly pointed out, and he was called a national security threat for doing so.
[3:24:14.420 --> 3:24:21.420]  The mask, the face mask, the way it's enforced is completely pointless from a medical standpoint.
[3:24:21.420 --> 3:24:24.420]  And it's a tool of population control.
[3:24:24.420 --> 3:24:30.420]  It's a symbol of genuflecting, groveling obedience.
[3:24:30.420 --> 3:24:40.420]  And it facilitates the harassment, the abuse, the doxing of people who realize all this and who refuse to wear one.
[3:24:40.420 --> 3:24:42.420]  Now let me state this very clearly.
[3:24:42.420 --> 3:24:54.420]  The virus particle, the coronavirus COVID-19 virus particle is 1000 times smaller than the gap in the fabric of the face mask.
[3:24:54.420 --> 3:24:55.420]  I'll say that again.
[3:24:55.420 --> 3:25:03.420]  The COVID-19 virus particle is 1000 times smaller than the gap in the fabric of the mask.
[3:25:03.420 --> 3:25:08.420]  Oh my God, how dare he say a dangerous conspiracy theory.
[3:25:08.420 --> 3:25:10.420]  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[3:25:10.420 --> 3:25:14.420]  No, this is a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University.
[3:25:14.420 --> 3:25:27.420]  Oh, this is from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, ncbi.nlm.gov.
[3:25:27.420 --> 3:25:34.420]  The title of this study is Face Masks in the COVID-19 Era of Health Hypothesis.
[3:25:34.420 --> 3:25:44.420]  The author of this study is Veteran Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System, Cardiology Division, Stanford University.
[3:25:44.420 --> 3:25:46.420]  Let me read the abstract.
[3:25:46.420 --> 3:25:50.420]  Again, this is not Davidite conspiracy theories.
[3:25:50.420 --> 3:25:52.420]  This is not dangerous medical misinformation.
[3:25:52.420 --> 3:25:54.420]  This is a peer-reviewed study.
[3:25:54.420 --> 3:26:06.420]  Many countries across the globe utilize medical and non-medical face masks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity of coronavirus disease 2019.
[3:26:06.420 --> 3:26:14.420]  Although scientific evidence supporting face masks efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established.
[3:26:14.420 --> 3:26:17.420]  And I'm going to get into those in a short time.
[3:26:17.420 --> 3:26:25.420]  It has been hypothesized that face masks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use.
[3:26:25.420 --> 3:26:36.420]  And then if you go down and read the efficacy of face masks section of this peer-reviewed study, there you see children burning face masks on a terrible site.
[3:26:36.420 --> 3:26:39.420]  That was, it wasn't based and red-pilled at all.
[3:26:39.420 --> 3:26:42.420]  It says efficacy of face masks.
[3:26:42.420 --> 3:26:45.420]  Again, Stanford University peer-reviewed study.
[3:26:45.420 --> 3:26:55.420]  The physical properties of medical and non-medical face masks suggest that face masks are ineffective to block virus particles due to their difference in scales.
[3:26:55.420 --> 3:27:04.420]  According to the current knowledge, the virus SARS COVID-19 has a diameter of 60 Nm to 140 Nm.
[3:27:04.420 --> 3:27:06.420]  Nm stands for nanometers.
[3:27:06.420 --> 3:27:08.420]  That's a billionth of a meter.
[3:27:08.420 --> 3:27:12.420]  Very small particle.
[3:27:12.420 --> 3:27:22.420]  While medical and non-medical face masks thread diameter ranges from 55 U.M. to 40 U.M.
[3:27:22.420 --> 3:27:34.420]  That's micro meters, one millionth of a meter, not one billionth, one millionth of a meter, which is more than 1,000 times larger.
[3:27:34.420 --> 3:27:46.420]  Due to the difference in sizes between SARS COVID diameter, the virus particle, and face mask thread diameter, the virus is 1,000 times smaller.
[3:27:46.420 --> 3:27:48.420]  Let me repeat that for you again.
[3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:52.420]  The virus is 1,000 times smaller.
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:27:58.420]  COVID-19 can easily pass through any face mask.
[3:27:58.420 --> 3:28:04.420]  That's not my words, the words of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University.
[3:28:04.420 --> 3:28:08.420]  Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
[3:28:08.420 --> 3:28:10.420]  Here's another one.
[3:28:10.420 --> 3:28:12.420]  And this was a headline out of Natural Leaves.
[3:28:12.420 --> 3:28:14.420]  Oh my God, Natural Leaves Conspiracy Theory website.
[3:28:14.420 --> 3:28:18.420]  No, they're talking about a University of Copenhagen study.
[3:28:18.420 --> 3:28:24.420]  Headline, face masks offer no protection from the coronavirus to the people who wear them.
[3:28:24.420 --> 3:28:28.420]  It's not Mike Adams, that's the University of Copenhagen.
[3:28:28.420 --> 3:28:36.420]  A major study in Denmark found that face masks do not protect the people who wear them from contracting the Wuhan coronavirus.
[3:28:36.420 --> 3:28:42.420]  However, the researchers do not have enough data to conclude whether face masks can prevent infected people from spreading the disease.
[3:28:42.420 --> 3:28:46.420]  The study was conducted by scientists.
[3:28:46.420 --> 3:28:50.420]  Again, it wasn't conducted by David Ike, it was conducted by scientists.
[3:28:50.420 --> 3:28:52.420]  Nothing against David Ike.
[3:28:52.420 --> 3:28:58.420]  From the University of Copenhagen, this study is considered the best of its kind so far.
[3:28:58.420 --> 3:29:02.420]  There's only two other significant studies, one in Guinea-Bissau and the other in India,
[3:29:02.420 --> 3:29:08.420]  have tried to determine whether there is any statistical evidence that face masks offer protection from the coronavirus.
[3:29:08.420 --> 3:29:16.420]  All three studies showed that masks do not prevent a person from catching the disease.
[3:29:16.420 --> 3:29:20.420]  So you can go and read the University of Copenhagen, you can go and read the Stanford University study.
[3:29:20.420 --> 3:29:24.420]  We also had this headline.
[3:29:24.420 --> 3:29:30.420]  COVID swabs of masks appear to contain hooks and strange fibers that can be inhaled directly into the lungs.
[3:29:30.420 --> 3:29:36.420]  Of course, we had this headline out of some news in addition to that.
[3:29:36.420 --> 3:29:38.420]  Scientists says plastic pollution is shrinking.
[3:29:38.420 --> 3:29:42.420]  Penises will make most men infertile by 2045.
[3:29:42.420 --> 3:29:46.420]  Now, what's covering the coral reefs in the Philippines?
[3:29:46.420 --> 3:29:54.420]  What's adding to the giant plastic ocean hellscape that continues to circulate the globe?
[3:29:54.420 --> 3:29:56.420]  Oh look, it's face masks.
[3:29:56.420 --> 3:29:58.420]  I put out a tweet earlier today.
[3:29:58.420 --> 3:30:06.420]  Literally every 100 meters in the park outside from where I live, there's a face mask dropped on the floor.
[3:30:06.420 --> 3:30:12.420]  If you really care so much about public health and public hygiene,
[3:30:12.420 --> 3:30:18.420]  then you need to wear these face masks outside when there's literally zero evidence that they have any effect.
[3:30:18.420 --> 3:30:24.420]  And you're just doing it to virtue signal and so you can point at other people and harass them for not doing the same.
[3:30:24.420 --> 3:30:28.420]  If you really care about public health and hygiene.
[3:30:28.420 --> 3:30:32.420]  Why are you dropping the frigging masks on the floor?
[3:30:32.420 --> 3:30:36.420]  Disgusting, gross, dirty behavior.
[3:30:36.420 --> 3:30:40.420]  Nobody wants to go near those masks, not because of coronavirus in my case, because they're just filthy.
[3:30:40.420 --> 3:30:44.420]  Why are you dropping them on the floor if you care so much about public health?
[3:30:44.420 --> 3:30:46.420]  They're everywhere.
[3:30:46.420 --> 3:30:54.420]  Headline, 1.5 billion face masks added to plastic ocean hellscape.
[3:30:54.420 --> 3:31:00.420]  Approximately 1.5 billion face masks are expected to be dumped into the sea in just one year,
[3:31:00.420 --> 3:31:04.420]  according to an environmental group monitoring the level of pollution in the world's oceans.
[3:31:04.420 --> 3:31:10.420]  Nobody cares, because frigging Greta Thunberg hasn't said anything about it.
[3:31:10.420 --> 3:31:18.420]  Oh, but we have to be so worried about a life giving gas, carbon dioxide, killing the planet,
[3:31:18.420 --> 3:31:26.420]  when literally tons and tons of these face masks are now circulating the world's oceans.
[3:31:26.420 --> 3:31:36.420]  Giving off chemical pollution, giving off toxins that cause the shrinking of penises and infertility in men.
[3:31:36.420 --> 3:31:44.420]  National File reported study chemical that causes penises to shrink found in face masks.
[3:31:44.420 --> 3:31:49.420]  Dr. Shana Swann, a professor of environmental medicine and public health at Mount Sinai Health System,
[3:31:49.420 --> 3:31:54.420]  another dangerous conspiracy theorist, evidently, has warned in a new book that phylates are
[3:31:54.420 --> 3:32:00.420]  commonly used in the manufacturing of plastics can shrink penises and decrease male fertility.
[3:32:00.420 --> 3:32:03.420]  Where do you find those plastics in face masks?
[3:32:03.420 --> 3:32:06.420]  Now, they're all over the coral reef.
[3:32:06.420 --> 3:32:12.420]  They're part of the giant trash ocean pile, which is circulating the globe.
[3:32:12.420 --> 3:32:18.420]  Leftists don't give a damn, because Greta Thunberg hasn't got up in front of billionaires at the Davos conference
[3:32:18.420 --> 3:32:20.420]  and cried about it.
[3:32:20.420 --> 3:32:23.420]  No one cares.
[3:32:23.420 --> 3:32:29.420]  After the break, we're going to get into the social credit score system in China, how it's worse in the West.
[3:32:29.420 --> 3:32:35.420]  We're also going to get into comments from Joe Rogan about vaccines, and just to finish up on this point again,
[3:32:35.420 --> 3:32:41.420]  Tucker Carlson being viciously attacked for saying that parents who force their kids to wear pointless face masks
[3:32:41.420 --> 3:32:46.420]  as a form of virtue signaling and population control should be confronted.
[3:32:46.420 --> 3:32:50.420]  Again, I go back to the actual statistics, which back him up.
[3:32:50.420 --> 3:32:58.420]  Not a single child in the UK has died from coronavirus, and that pattern is very much replicated across the rest of the world.
[3:32:58.420 --> 3:33:04.420]  And yet still, not only do I see these masks strewn all over the floor in the park in the streets.
[3:33:04.420 --> 3:33:10.420]  They're being worn by children in schools, despite the fact there's no actual law which was passed by the government,
[3:33:10.420 --> 3:33:15.420]  which mandates schools to enforce a mask policy inside classrooms.
[3:33:15.420 --> 3:33:21.420]  But many of these schools decided to enforce the policy on their own anyway.
[3:33:21.420 --> 3:33:26.420]  And I don't have time to get into it here, but we have major studies coming out today and yesterday
[3:33:26.420 --> 3:33:34.420]  showing that not only have kids, their language skills decreased rapidly because of being kept away from school,
[3:33:34.420 --> 3:33:41.420]  these masks are preventing them from forming interpersonal relationships and they're causing even more young depression.
[3:33:41.420 --> 3:33:43.420]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[3:33:43.420 --> 3:33:51.420]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:33:51.420 --> 3:33:55.420]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[3:33:55.420 --> 3:34:02.420]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[3:34:02.420 --> 3:34:07.420]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:34:07.420 --> 3:34:12.420]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:34:12.420 --> 3:34:18.420]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[3:34:18.420 --> 3:34:23.420]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:34:23.420 --> 3:34:28.420]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[3:34:28.420 --> 3:34:35.420]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, organic Skolkapp and Balarian root.
[3:34:35.420 --> 3:34:43.420]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[3:35:06.420 --> 3:35:10.420]  For two years that almost killed me, Living Defense brought me back.
[3:35:10.420 --> 3:35:15.420]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[3:35:15.420 --> 3:35:18.420]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9,
[3:35:18.420 --> 3:35:23.420]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[3:35:23.420 --> 3:35:27.420]  and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[3:35:27.420 --> 3:35:32.420]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[3:35:32.420 --> 3:35:34.420]  That's right where we're at brother.
[3:35:34.420 --> 3:35:38.420]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[3:35:38.420 --> 3:35:42.420]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[3:35:42.420 --> 3:35:48.420]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[3:35:48.420 --> 3:35:51.420]  Hell, everybody knows that. I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[3:35:51.420 --> 3:35:54.420]  People say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air? That's embarrassing.
[3:35:54.420 --> 3:35:59.420]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll tell you this right now.
[3:35:59.420 --> 3:36:02.420]  You're nuts if you don't get storeable food.
[3:36:02.420 --> 3:36:07.420]  And I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food and the lowest price you're going to find.
[3:36:07.420 --> 3:36:11.420]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that takes even better?
[3:36:11.420 --> 3:36:14.420]  Yeah, most of the stuff tastes amazing. Some of it tastes OK.
[3:36:14.420 --> 3:36:18.420]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[3:36:18.420 --> 3:36:21.420]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[3:36:21.420 --> 3:36:24.420]  We've got three months, six months, your supplies right now.
[3:36:24.420 --> 3:36:29.420]  And I've twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again,
[3:36:29.420 --> 3:36:32.420]  because you're so conditionally buying under a super sale.
[3:36:32.420 --> 3:36:34.420]  We're doing it one more time.
[3:36:34.420 --> 3:36:42.420]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, 10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[3:36:42.420 --> 3:36:45.420]  Get ready while you still can.
[3:36:45.420 --> 3:36:51.420]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:58.420]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with uranium and plutonium
[3:36:58.420 --> 3:37:04.420]  at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[3:37:04.420 --> 3:37:09.420]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[3:37:09.420 --> 3:37:12.420]  14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Boulder Bird Group's activities
[3:37:12.420 --> 3:37:16.420]  and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[3:37:16.420 --> 3:37:18.420]  The film now is more important than ever.
[3:37:18.420 --> 3:37:20.420]  When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[3:37:20.420 --> 3:37:24.420]  We have it back in print available now at infowarstore.com.
[3:37:24.420 --> 3:37:29.420]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk and there's a zero country code.
[3:37:29.420 --> 3:37:31.420]  So anywhere on the planet, you can make copies.
[3:37:31.420 --> 3:37:32.420]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[3:37:32.420 --> 3:37:37.420]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide.
[3:37:37.420 --> 3:38:06.420]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement available now at infowarstore.com.
[3:38:06.420 --> 3:38:10.420]  Well, the mob weren't satisfied in their bloodlust.
[3:38:10.420 --> 3:38:14.420]  And it came to Rose McGowan calling Democrats a cult.
[3:38:14.420 --> 3:38:19.420]  And it came to Tucker Carlson calling Masks a cult.
[3:38:19.420 --> 3:38:25.420]  Now, they wanted one more victim and the next victim, apparently the cancel culture mob,
[3:38:25.420 --> 3:38:28.420]  is once again Joe Rogan.
[3:38:28.420 --> 3:38:34.420]  Now, I'm going to get into some comments about how his show has changed after he moved to Spotify.
[3:38:34.420 --> 3:38:39.420]  But he's in hot water once again simply for telling the truth.
[3:38:39.420 --> 3:38:46.420]  Same thing every time I see somebody, a Rogan, a Carlson, a McGowan, any of these kind of people trending on Twitter,
[3:38:46.420 --> 3:38:48.420]  you just know before you click it.
[3:38:48.420 --> 3:38:50.420]  Oh my God, what horrible thing have they said now?
[3:38:50.420 --> 3:38:52.420]  Oh, they've told the truth.
[3:38:52.420 --> 3:38:56.420]  They've told the truth and they're being targeted once again.
[3:38:56.420 --> 3:39:03.420]  And I'm going to get into why, again, this proves that our own social credit system is worse in the West than it is in China.
[3:39:03.420 --> 3:39:12.420]  But let's go to these comments on vaccinating kids and young healthy people from Joe Rogan on his show yesterday.
[3:39:12.420 --> 3:39:13.420]  Let's hit it.
[3:39:13.420 --> 3:39:15.420]  And people say, do you think it's safe to get vaccinated?
[3:39:15.420 --> 3:39:18.420]  I've said, yeah, I think for the most part it's safe to get vaccinated.
[3:39:18.420 --> 3:39:19.420]  I do.
[3:39:19.420 --> 3:39:20.420]  I do.
[3:39:20.420 --> 3:39:24.420]  But if you're like 21 years old and you say to me, should I get vaccinated?
[3:39:24.420 --> 3:39:25.420]  I go, no.
[3:39:25.420 --> 3:39:27.420]  Are you healthy?
[3:39:27.420 --> 3:39:28.420]  Are you a healthy person?
[3:39:28.420 --> 3:39:32.420]  Like, look, don't do anything stupid, but you should take care of yourself.
[3:39:32.420 --> 3:39:37.420]  If you're a healthy person and you're exercising all the time and you're young and you're eating well,
[3:39:37.420 --> 3:39:40.420]  they're like, I don't think you need to worry about this.
[3:39:40.420 --> 3:39:42.420]  Yeah, I tend to agree with you.
[3:39:42.420 --> 3:39:45.420]  But there's a lot of jobs that will tell you you need to have this.
[3:39:45.420 --> 3:39:47.420]  Well, that's what's starting to happen now.
[3:39:47.420 --> 3:39:49.420]  People are worried about them doing it for their children.
[3:39:49.420 --> 3:39:54.420]  And we talked about this earlier, that you might have to have your children vaccinated.
[3:39:54.420 --> 3:40:00.420]  And I can tell you, as someone who's both my children got the virus, it was nothing.
[3:40:00.420 --> 3:40:02.420]  I mean, I hate to say that.
[3:40:02.420 --> 3:40:05.420]  If someone's children died from this, I'm very sorry that that happened.
[3:40:05.420 --> 3:40:07.420]  I'm not in any way diminishing that.
[3:40:07.420 --> 3:40:12.420]  But I'm saying the personal experience that my children had with COVID was nothing.
[3:40:12.420 --> 3:40:14.420]  One of the kids had a headache.
[3:40:14.420 --> 3:40:16.420]  The other one didn't feel good for a couple of days.
[3:40:16.420 --> 3:40:18.420]  Like, I mean, I mean, not feel good.
[3:40:18.420 --> 3:40:20.420]  Like, no, no big deal.
[3:40:20.420 --> 3:40:21.420]  No coughing.
[3:40:21.420 --> 3:40:24.420]  No, no, no achy, no, like in agony.
[3:40:24.420 --> 3:40:25.420]  There was none of that.
[3:40:25.420 --> 3:40:26.420]  It was very mild.
[3:40:26.420 --> 3:40:29.420]  It was, it was akin to them getting a cold.
[3:40:29.420 --> 3:40:30.420]  Yeah.
[3:40:30.420 --> 3:40:33.420]  And you can have this thing where it's like, you were saying this virtue signaling and
[3:40:33.420 --> 3:40:37.420]  this kind of like theatrical display of I get the vaccine, what a good person I am.
[3:40:37.420 --> 3:40:38.420]  I care about everyone.
[3:40:38.420 --> 3:40:41.420]  But you're like, look, my daughter's a lot younger than your kids.
[3:40:41.420 --> 3:40:45.420]  But I'm like, yeah, I'm not injecting my daughter with something to virtue signal.
[3:40:45.420 --> 3:40:47.420]  Like, I'm not doing that.
[3:40:47.420 --> 3:40:51.420]  If there's something that she's of no risk, statistically has no risk from.
[3:40:51.420 --> 3:40:52.420]  I'm sorry.
[3:40:52.420 --> 3:40:55.420]  I'm not taking any experiment on her in that.
[3:40:55.420 --> 3:40:56.420]  And that's, that's my attitude.
[3:40:56.420 --> 3:40:58.420]  But it's amazing that that's controversial.
[3:40:58.420 --> 3:40:59.420]  Yeah.
[3:40:59.420 --> 3:41:04.420]  But even saying that I'm not going to inject my child with the vaccine is controversial.
[3:41:04.420 --> 3:41:05.420]  Yeah.
[3:41:05.420 --> 3:41:10.420]  It's crazy because again, we are not talking about even the flu that we just found out
[3:41:10.420 --> 3:41:12.420]  killed 22,000 people last year.
[3:41:12.420 --> 3:41:13.420]  We're not talking about that.
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:14.420]  Right.
[3:41:14.420 --> 3:41:18.420]  We're talking about something that is not statistically dangerous for children.
[3:41:18.420 --> 3:41:22.420]  But yeah, people still want you to get your child vaccinated, which is crazy to me.
[3:41:22.420 --> 3:41:23.420]  Yeah.
[3:41:23.420 --> 3:41:28.420]  But you should be vaccinated if you are vulnerable.
[3:41:28.420 --> 3:41:34.420]  Now, first of all, in response to that, I haven't seen a story where a celebrity or
[3:41:34.420 --> 3:41:39.420]  even people that I know personally having the vaccine and not having some kind of side
[3:41:39.420 --> 3:41:45.420]  effect, not having awful flu like symptoms for days, even for over a week on end.
[3:41:45.420 --> 3:41:47.420]  In some cases, people have died, obviously.
[3:41:47.420 --> 3:41:52.420]  Now, if you want to take that risk to get that vaccine to protect yourself against
[3:41:52.420 --> 3:41:57.700]  COVID, which for most people, you literally have a 99.8% chance of surviving according
[3:41:57.700 --> 3:42:00.380]  to the CDC's own numbers.
[3:42:00.380 --> 3:42:03.020]  If you want to do that, go ahead.
[3:42:03.020 --> 3:42:08.060]  You'll notice that Rogan there said his two kids got the COVID virus and it was basically
[3:42:08.060 --> 3:42:09.060]  nothing.
[3:42:09.060 --> 3:42:15.220]  And I go back to the original point, the BBC reported in the UK, zero kids who were healthy
[3:42:15.220 --> 3:42:18.780]  who got COVID died from COVID, zero.
[3:42:18.780 --> 3:42:26.220]  You know, did die from COVID, children with comorbidities including obesity and yet what
[3:42:26.220 --> 3:42:27.220]  now do we see?
[3:42:27.220 --> 3:42:32.100]  I'm going to go back to Rogan in a second, but I just wanted to intersect with this headline
[3:42:32.100 --> 3:42:37.900]  out of information liberation CNN says, here's a list of free stuff you can get if you've
[3:42:37.900 --> 3:42:39.460]  been vaxxed.
[3:42:39.460 --> 3:42:46.180]  So now they're literally offering to young people Budweiser beer, free Budweiser beer,
[3:42:46.180 --> 3:42:56.260]  free Junior's cheesecake, whatever that is, free Krispy Kreme doughnuts every day.
[3:42:56.260 --> 3:43:00.900]  You can get one free glazed doughnut every day if you take a vaccination card to any
[3:43:00.900 --> 3:43:06.060]  Krispy Kreme location in the US, the company said in a press release.
[3:43:06.060 --> 3:43:12.900]  So they're offering Nathan's hot dogs, Junior's cheesecake and Krispy Kreme to kids when you
[3:43:12.900 --> 3:43:19.380]  have an obesity epidemic in America, which has killed children because they got the coronavirus,
[3:43:19.380 --> 3:43:21.860]  they had a comorbidity and they died.
[3:43:21.860 --> 3:43:27.260]  And yet their reward for getting the vaccine is to make them fatter.
[3:43:27.260 --> 3:43:28.260]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:43:28.260 --> 3:43:35.940]  Then on the wider point of Rogan's spiel there, which he's getting canceled for again today,
[3:43:35.940 --> 3:43:39.340]  I mean, you have to hand it to him to some extent.
[3:43:39.340 --> 3:43:44.780]  It doesn't appear like he's self-censoring in the fear that the episodes will be removed
[3:43:44.780 --> 3:43:45.780]  from Spotify.
[3:43:45.780 --> 3:43:52.300]  And yet we do know that over a dozen, it was probably two dozen or more episodes when Rogan
[3:43:52.300 --> 3:43:58.220]  switched over from his usual format on YouTube to Spotify were removed and they were never
[3:43:58.220 --> 3:43:59.980]  reinstated.
[3:43:59.980 --> 3:44:01.820]  This one could also get removed.
[3:44:01.820 --> 3:44:09.780]  You know why, because on numerous occasions, Spotify employees woke maniacal idiots of
[3:44:09.780 --> 3:44:15.980]  literally staged mutinies in their offices because of something that Joe Rogan said.
[3:44:15.980 --> 3:44:20.980]  So at some point, you know that top executive level management is going to break and they
[3:44:20.980 --> 3:44:26.780]  are only going to start removing more Joe Rogan podcast episodes, they're going to
[3:44:26.780 --> 3:44:33.380]  start trying to control what he can say and whether he bows to that remains to be seen.
[3:44:33.380 --> 3:44:40.500]  But judging from this clip, props to him, he hasn't bowed so far despite the intense
[3:44:40.500 --> 3:44:47.020]  reaction of the hysterical hate mob, which has facilitated itself via Twitter to destroy
[3:44:47.020 --> 3:44:51.740]  people's lives, have them de-planformed, have their bank accounts removed because of their
[3:44:51.740 --> 3:44:52.740]  opinions.
[3:44:52.740 --> 3:44:54.340]  And I'm going to get onto that in a moment.
[3:44:54.340 --> 3:44:56.980]  Certainly comment on the thread, though, of this Rogan video.
[3:44:56.980 --> 3:45:02.820]  Somebody said in reference to the Spotify mutinies, the employees have had three mutinies
[3:45:02.820 --> 3:45:07.860]  this morning, then lunch, followed by two more afternoon mutinies, followed by a break,
[3:45:07.860 --> 3:45:11.060]  then 5 p.m. time to go home before tomorrow's mutinies.
[3:45:11.060 --> 3:45:15.220]  So expect to see that over the next 24 hours.
[3:45:15.220 --> 3:45:18.420]  You've got to hand it to him, he's still speaking the truth, right?
[3:45:18.420 --> 3:45:23.580]  Meanwhile, headline Chai Combs hit citizens with 10-point social credit score penalty
[3:45:23.580 --> 3:45:26.060]  for not wearing a mask in public.
[3:45:26.060 --> 3:45:31.820]  And again, conservatives all day long, establishment conservatives on social media will call out,
[3:45:31.820 --> 3:45:37.660]  will slam China for introducing this onerous killing social credit score without ever acknowledging
[3:45:37.660 --> 3:45:44.020]  that we have it worse in the West, which he saw today with Nick Fuentes literally being
[3:45:44.020 --> 3:45:50.540]  put on a no-fly list for his political opinions, despite the fact that he's committed no crime,
[3:45:50.540 --> 3:45:55.900]  despite the fact that he didn't occupy the capital building back on January 6, he's
[3:45:55.900 --> 3:45:59.100]  purely being punished for his thoughts.
[3:45:59.100 --> 3:46:02.620]  He engaged in thought crime and he's being punished for it.
[3:46:02.620 --> 3:46:08.820]  We have the social credit score system already in the West and then you see, again, establishment
[3:46:08.820 --> 3:46:14.660]  conservatives on Twitter who can always be relied upon to flake out and flounce when
[3:46:14.660 --> 3:46:20.460]  the going gets tough, responding to this story by saying, oh, but it was the airline
[3:46:20.460 --> 3:46:27.420]  who barred Fuentes from flying because he previously had an incident where some screeching
[3:46:27.420 --> 3:46:32.140]  Karen flight attendant shouted at him to put his mask over his nose.
[3:46:32.140 --> 3:46:34.980]  He refused and he got off the plane.
[3:46:34.980 --> 3:46:38.900]  So it was the airlines enforcing this no-fly ban on Nick Fuentes as well.
[3:46:38.900 --> 3:46:41.420]  For a start, that's wrong, according to what he said.
[3:46:41.420 --> 3:46:47.300]  It was the TSA directly who enforced the ban, not the airlines.
[3:46:47.300 --> 3:46:51.980]  And then the other point is, oh, it's okay, it's okay for private company, does it?
[3:46:51.980 --> 3:46:53.380]  No, it's not.
[3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:57.300]  That's the same social credit score system.
[3:46:57.300 --> 3:47:00.620]  And there's a lengthy London Times article on this subject, which I encourage you all
[3:47:00.620 --> 3:47:01.620]  to read.
[3:47:01.620 --> 3:47:04.500]  I've done a boil down summary of it.
[3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:09.180]  It says the communist Chinese government is punishing citizens in some areas of the country
[3:47:09.180 --> 3:47:13.860]  who commit COVID related transgressions such as not wearing a mask in public by deducting
[3:47:13.860 --> 3:47:20.860]  10 points from their social credit score and, in some cases, putting them on no-fly black
[3:47:20.860 --> 3:47:26.420]  lists, which is exactly what happened to Fuentes, whether you think it's because of his being
[3:47:26.420 --> 3:47:31.700]  in the capital for a Trump rally on January 6, God forbid, or because he had an encounter
[3:47:31.700 --> 3:47:36.900]  with a Karen flight attendant for not wearing his mask properly, it's the same system here
[3:47:36.900 --> 3:47:37.900]  in the West.
[3:47:37.900 --> 3:47:44.380]  And I make the point in the article that we have it worse and that the communist Chinese
[3:47:44.380 --> 3:47:52.460]  dictators could only dream of having it as good as the woke mob has it in the West.
[3:47:52.460 --> 3:47:56.460]  Because as we know, these hate groups have weaponized Twitter, we saw it with Rose McGowan,
[3:47:56.460 --> 3:47:58.140]  we saw it with Tucker Carlson.
[3:47:58.140 --> 3:48:03.380]  We see it with private citizens on a daily basis, they've weaponized Twitter to facilitate
[3:48:03.380 --> 3:48:08.540]  the organized harassment, doxing, de-platforming, and all-round life ruining of conservatives
[3:48:08.540 --> 3:48:13.180]  and anyone who questions the mob's narrative on a daily basis.
[3:48:13.180 --> 3:48:17.700]  So we're supposed to be outraged about China centralizing this program under COVID to punish
[3:48:17.700 --> 3:48:23.060]  people to ban them from flying, taking public transport because they didn't wear a mask,
[3:48:23.060 --> 3:48:28.740]  because they criticized lockdown policy, and yet we have it far worse, far more intense
[3:48:28.740 --> 3:48:31.660]  and far more weaponized here in the West.
