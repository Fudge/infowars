[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:18.000 --> 00:34.000]  We are live. It is the last day of July, 2011. Next stop, 2012. And we're going to be live here as we are every Sunday.
[00:34.000 --> 00:57.000]  4 to 6 p.m. Central, 5 to 7 Eastern, 3 to 5 Mountain, 2 to 4 Pacific. And we have incredibly intense and important news and information that we're going to be covering today, obviously.
[00:57.000 --> 01:05.000]  And so I hope that you will stay with us through the two hours of the show today.
[01:05.000 --> 01:21.000]  I hope that you will take notes on the information that we are going to cover, because the different developments in our society are of the utmost importance, obviously.
[01:21.000 --> 01:35.000]  And as I do so many Sundays, when I tend to be more reflective, I'm going to attempt to not go into a bunch of ranting and raving today, but actually get into all of the news.
[01:35.000 --> 01:47.000]  Obviously, when we come back from break, we're going to get into the whole debt ceiling false debate that gets everybody to obsess on the credit rating.
[01:47.000 --> 02:04.000]  And on raising the debt and going into more debt, instead of asking why are we in this debt and where is most of the money actually owed and will the debt ceiling, or even making these paltry cuts the Republicans are calling for, fix things.
[02:04.000 --> 02:14.000]  And the answer is no. So we're going to be going over all of that. And we have the headlines here that top Senator Republicans with the Democrats are very close to a deal.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  On default, White House TOP discussed potential debt limit packed with 48 hours left to go.
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  But don't worry, the private rating agencies, S&P, Moody's and others are saying it doesn't matter.
[02:27.000 --> 02:37.000]  Either debt plan will make you lose your AAA rating and that's out of the Hill newspaper there in DC with the inside scoop from Capitol Hill.
[02:37.000 --> 02:49.000]  I want to talk about what a loss of AAA rating is going to mean because it's a foregone conclusion that the debt has been defaulted on the minute we signed on to that 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives.
[02:49.000 --> 02:59.000]  And so we'll discuss either way, no matter what happens, where this country is headed until we get out of the private Federal Reserve's control.
[02:59.000 --> 03:07.000]  And I've got a lot of news also on the economy that we're going to be going over today.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  Obviously, we're going to get into the latest on Fast and Furious. We're going to have a video report.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  It's going to be up on infowars.com and prisonpana.com by the end of the show today.
[03:19.000 --> 03:29.000]  I may even premiere that special report that we worked on Friday, Saturday and Aaron's up here on Sunday, completing it right now.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  Very powerful report.
[03:31.000 --> 03:39.000]  Video report to accompany this text report by Paul Joseph Watson and Aaron Dykes.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Exclusive ATF intimidates gun owners with home visits.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  And we're going to be going over this report obviously here on the show today.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  And we have another report here from infowars.com.
[03:55.000 --> 04:06.000]  Gun grabbers in Congress exploit Fast and Furious and introduce the flotilla of new victim disarmament, anti-second amendment, anti-freedom moves.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  So that's just some of what we're going to be going over in that area.
[04:11.000 --> 04:21.000]  And we are going to continue looking at some other news items dealing with how our young people are being basically implanted into the matrix.
[04:21.000 --> 04:30.000]  Facebook and Twitter are creating a vain generation of self-obsessed people with childlike need for Facebook.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Feedback type garbage.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  Warrant's top scientist.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  And that goes together with this French news agency.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  Xbox addict dies from blood clot.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Another one I never got to last week, but I'm going to cover today. We have time.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  Peer pressure causes people to literally alter their memories of recent events.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Why won't people wake up and face reality?
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's because of stuff like this.
[04:52.000 --> 04:59.000]  We're going to be going over all straight ahead.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  Hi, this is Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct.
[05:03.000 --> 05:10.000]  Babs, you work a lot with shipping and things are going absolutely nuts with this new independent smoth Patriot pack that eFoods is giving away.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  The way things are going, we're shipping thousands of these great little Patriot packs out.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  Just an example, Sherry from Arkansas made a $1,300 order.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  We shipped her five free Patriot packs, $750 more free food.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[05:27.000 --> 05:38.000]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country, so for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away $149 Patriot pack free.
[05:38.000 --> 05:47.000]  To order the best food on the planet, call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[05:47.000 --> 05:59.000]  A free 12-day supply Patriot pack with every $235 worth of food ordered, call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[06:17.000 --> 06:26.000]  48 hours out from a total default on the debt to the foreign governments and private Federal Reserve
[06:26.000 --> 06:35.000]  that have taken over this country through economic fraud and have engaged in a conquest that the British Empire couldn't succeed in,
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  that Hitler couldn't succeed in, that the Soviets couldn't succeed at.
[06:41.000 --> 06:50.000]  They have conquered us through fraud by stealth, but the moment you become aware of the private banking cartels' global government
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  that they're publicly admitting now they're setting up that you'll pay your VAT taxes too, your carbon taxes, and the rest of it,
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  the minute you're aware of it, then their power begins to wane.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  That's why the banksters are setting up a Homeland Security control grid in every country they're in
[07:07.000 --> 07:16.000]  under international agreements and rules to crack down and go after anybody that criticizes the private central banks running those nations.
[07:16.000 --> 07:24.000]  When you get the internal training manuals from England to Australia, from Germany to Canada to the United States, it is the same thing.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  The public is told to give your rights up because Al Qaeda is hiding underneath every table,
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  but when you get the actual manuals, it's people that don't want to give up their sovereignty to the global government.
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.000]  What is globalism? It is really less than the Fortune 100, 50 or so companies,
[07:43.000 --> 07:53.000]  and if you look at the board of directors of the Fortune 500 itself, it's almost completely owned and controlled by less than just a few hundred top managers
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  who work for less than 20 wealthy families, and we've made films on this and broken all of this down.
[08:01.000 --> 08:09.000]  And globalism, to give you just a snapshot example of what it is before I get into the debt ceiling and the gun grabbing
[08:09.000 --> 08:17.000]  and all the news that's taking place right now that's so vital, we've got to have the big picture and really pull back and see it in the context.
[08:17.000 --> 08:26.000]  As Carol Quigley wrote for the CIA in Tragedy and Hope, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's political mentor,
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  the people running this country want authoritarianism, and they know that if you only have one flavor of authoritarianism,
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  you'll wake up and fight it. If you have a simple dictator or a one-party oligarchy that's not hiding itself,
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  but if you control both parties or all three parties, like in the case of England,
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.000]  then you can have them fight over the power and fight over being the head ring-raith minions over the country
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  because there will be real rivalries and slight differences in rhetoric,
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.000]  but they're still beholden to the very same interests, kind of like a Don King boxing match where he owns both fighters
[09:05.000 --> 09:18.000]  and people pretty much won't even watch those heavyweight fights anymore that he owns because people know that it's as rigged as a slot machine in Vegas.
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  So that's what we're dealing with here, and let's take a microcosm example of globalism,
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  and I talk about this every week because it's in the news, and I know people are aware of this.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  It's not some more archaic example or an example that isn't as popularly known,
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  but you know about Obama giving out now more than 2,000 waivers to companies.
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  One waiver for McDonald's, over half million employees total, don't have to, or is it 400,000?
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  The point is hundreds of thousands of employees don't have to get insurance now.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  McDonald's doesn't have to pay for it, but then the McDonald's competition down the street,
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  some mom-and-pop outfit or some regional privately owned, a true free market group,
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  if these rules go into effect as they're supposed to at the end of this year,
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  you are going to have to purchase that insurance.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  And of course, you'll lay people off, you'll have less hours,
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  you'll cut the people that you get the insurance for's pay, but they'll have insurance.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  And the insurance companies, of course, wrote the plan on record.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  They get to force 35 million people that didn't have insurance to get it.
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  The feds get to then lower the standard of care, and computers tell doctors what procedures they can do.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  The literal death panels that was in the news this week in England, where they're not giving people cataract surgeries anymore.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  They're not giving them cancer surgeries.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  That's the National Health Service.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  But the profits for the private groups administering it, they go up in England, in Canada, and now here in the U.S.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  Oh, they take the money out of your check.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  Or in this healthcare system, your employer does, but you just get less care.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  But side issue, this is an example of how these monopoly insiders operate.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  So 2,000 major companies, and it's a list of people that have contributed to the Democratic Party.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  This is mafia government.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  They don't have to get insurance, but you do.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  Let me give you another example.
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  It was in the news again this week.
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  General Electric, the head of General Electric, heading up the President's Economic Council, deciding where the trillions in quote stimulus money go.
[11:26.000 --> 11:39.000]  And we already saw General Motors, over $4 billion total, a billion in change per country, or per region, over a billion bucks to send a new plant, part of the economic stimulus, of your tax dollars.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  You take your tax dollars, stimulate jobs, and a billion plus goes to build a factory in Brazil.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  A billion plus to build one in Eastern Europe, and a billion plus to move to China.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  And then it was in the news this week.
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  General Electric, who paid zero taxes the last three years on a row, just type in General Electric, paid zero taxes, will pull up.
[12:00.000 --> 12:12.000]  The headline from Friday, moving one of the last divisions they had in North America, U.S. and Canada, their giant X-ray manufacturing division, including government contracts for airports.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  That, both medical and security, that is moving to China.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  And guess what?
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  There's bailout money involved in it.
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  So you are literally paying to have your job shipped.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  And China has tariffs on us.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  They also keep their currency low, which is another tariff.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  This is how it works.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  They call it, oh, free trade, fair trade.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  And so what is Obama doing?
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  With the Republicans and the head of the Chamber of Commerce and the head of the different business leagues.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  What's the big national association of not manufacturers, therefore it to?
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  What's the national association that deals with business?
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  I forget.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  I saw him on the news Friday and saw the text reports.
[13:00.000 --> 13:14.000]  The point is all the so-called lobbies that are for jobs here in the United States, they are lobbying and saying how great this new trade deal with South America
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  and South Korea are to further move jobs.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  And months ago, I watched the congressional hearings on C-SPAN dealing with this.
[13:21.000 --> 13:32.000]  And I watched the different press conferences they had afterwards because C-SPAN comboed up congressional coverage and then cut to trade representatives in South Korea in joint.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  It was actually Obama and the South Korean president giving a press conference.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  And they were admitting that there was a trade deficit of four to one or more with South Korea.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  And he was saying these new deals, don't worry, you're going to fix that.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  And now there's been analysis done.
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.000]  And of course, it's going to make it even worse because the big insider mega corporations own the politicians here.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  And they also own them in South Korea and Mexico, China, the list goes on and on.
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  And so they can set trade deals up where there's extra taxes and regulations here.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  And where they even get a tax incentive to move to China or South Korea or Mexico.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  And so we've lost almost all of our industry.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And this is what globalism is.
[14:16.000 --> 14:25.000]  Henry Kissinger for Nixon and the different trade associations goes over to China, makes sweetheart inside deals,
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  where they can get goods made at slave labor prices that America could never compete with.
[14:31.000 --> 14:42.000]  But if that isn't bad enough, they then put regulations on US industries that they don't have in 160 plus third world countries in the list goes on and on.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  And so of course, all the jobs go there.
[14:44.000 --> 14:54.000]  Over 80% of our industry manufacturing has left in the last 30 years.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  Also, since 2001, the dollar has lost at least 40% more of its purchasing power.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  That's the federal government's own numbers.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  And so you add all of this together.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  What's their answer?
[15:08.000 --> 15:15.000]  Oh, we're going to come in now with carbon taxes only on the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand,
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  who are all under the very same strategy, having their own countries bought and paid for by the same mega corporations,
[15:21.000 --> 15:30.000]  sign government laws shutting down all activity in our countries, while the very politicians are owned by the mega corporations who own the industries
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  they've developed and invested in in the third world.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  That's a guaranteed investment boost because they've shut down all their competition in the West.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  This is crony collectivism by the elite.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  This is monopoly man.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  And this is how they rule us.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  This is how they dominate us.
[15:48.000 --> 15:55.000]  Alright, we come back. Now that we've talked about how this tilted playing table works, this red casino,
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  we're going to get into the so-called debt ceiling crisis and the gone-grabbing stay with us.
[16:00.000 --> 16:08.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  I can't stress this enough.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  That's End of America 3.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  You can get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[17:51.000 --> 17:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  Yet, you're copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[18:53.000 --> 19:02.000]  We're watching online right now in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.

[19:43.000 --> 19:53.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[20:14.000 --> 20:21.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of The Resistance.
[20:21.000 --> 20:31.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.000]  Alright, finishing up a simple snapshot analysis of globalism,
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  as it's much more complex and much worse than I'm even saying.
[20:43.000 --> 20:54.000]  The political traders for several generations in this country have been bought and paid for by some of the most wealthy families and corporations in the world,
[20:54.000 --> 21:02.000]  and they come in to democratic nations and use that system against the people with slick packaging
[21:02.000 --> 21:15.000]  to sell one-sided trade deals that then massively increase their profits in the slave factories and slave wage factories they own and control in the third world.
[21:15.000 --> 21:23.000]  And now they're trying to squeeze out that last 20% of manufacturing we've got, even as the service industry implodes,
[21:23.000 --> 21:33.000]  and they're coming in with 20 to 50% carbon taxes, California's passed it, starting next year it'll be 20% tax over a decade,
[21:33.000 --> 21:44.000]  50% tax on most human activity, paid to government, who then goes and signs deals with the big megabanks to go into more debt with them.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  And remember, it's debt made out of nothing.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  So this is a monopoly game, we're being economically conquered, and folks need to start getting a little bit more sophisticated
[21:54.000 --> 22:03.000]  and thinking about exactly how this works, because it's going to get a lot worse.
[22:03.000 --> 22:11.000]  I mean, when you see Bill O'Reilly up there saying, we've got to pay the debts we owe, we've got to have a national value-added tax,
[22:11.000 --> 22:18.000]  we've got to have national sales taxes, we've got to pay our bills, we've got to cut spending and raise taxes.
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an absolute historical fact.
[22:22.000 --> 22:34.000]  Every economist who has any brain knows this, that in every case from a more modern example a decade ago,
[22:34.000 --> 22:43.000]  Ireland to the 1960s, the John F. Kennedy, Kennedy in the highest tax bracket cut taxes by 50% and in the other bracket 35,
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  35% cut in taxes. Federal income taxes went down to almost nothing.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  And do you know what happened by the next year?
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  A doubling in tax receipts.
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.000]  Oh, in the next year another 50% increase, that's a 150% increase in two years.
[23:01.000 --> 23:07.000]  And you're like, wait, you cut taxes, more money comes in? Yes, it stimulates the economy.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  People start spending, they put that money back into hiring people, back into buying that boat, buying that house, buying that suit,
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.000]  buying that gold, buying that land, going on that vacation.
[23:20.000 --> 23:26.000]  Buying mama a Cadillac, like Elvis was doing back in the 60s.
[23:26.000 --> 23:34.000]  And that's what happens. And it's a fact. So why then, in the western world, would they want to raise taxes?
[23:34.000 --> 23:43.000]  Well, as George Washington said, and as many of our Supreme Court justices have seconded, the powered attacks is the power to destroy.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  And you've got corporate interests that are exempt.
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.000]  On average, the Fortune 100 pays 2.4% tax. In fact, folks won't believe that.
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  Well, you guys type in General Electric, paying zero tax, put that on screen.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  Then next say Google paid 2.4. And one of his London Guardian CNN will show it to you.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  But wait, there's more. Then they have all the heads of these companies, heads of Google, head of General Electric.
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  I've seen them on the news. Yeah, there it is, ABC News. General Electric paid no federal taxes in 2010.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  Sorry. And then their executives don't either because they sit on foreign boards and why they're exempt over there as well.
[24:23.000 --> 24:30.000]  But I digress now. They then have all these ABC specials, you know, this week on ABC with Christina Amanpour.
[24:30.000 --> 24:38.000]  And she interviews Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and they say, I'm not paying enough taxes. I want to pay more taxes.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  It's not fair. Raise taxes. Get the economy going.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  These are the people on record in the last 20 years that got the tax codes changed.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  I mean, did you know what was it 15 years ago or so? You can pull this up too.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  By the way, they just pulled up Bloomberg. Google 2.4% tax shows how 60 billion lost to tax loopholes.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  Bloomberg, October 21, 2010. I can show you a laundry list.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  The entire Fortune 100 pays almost zero tax. Some of their domestic employees do.
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  But they are exempt. See, if you're a domestic corporation, you have to pay it all.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  But they are international. They've written the laws. And so then they sucker you further.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  They come out with all these specials saying, we've given our money to charity and you find out it's tax-free foundations.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  They actually make giant profits and keep it. But just create new subsidiaries.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  Their tax-free foundations pay zero tax domestically when they operate.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, all of them.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  They're all part of the same club. They pay zero taxes.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Give a little money to the UN for population reduction and things, as they admit.
[25:46.000 --> 25:55.000]  And then their subsidiary corporations of Microsoft and the rest of it, they get the profit contracts.
[25:55.000 --> 26:04.000]  But the tax-free foundations do deals with multinational foreign corporations who then again are paying zero domestic tax.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  You see how that little scam works?
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  I could keep going on here if you'd like me to. But wait, there's more.
[26:12.000 --> 26:20.000]  This is the very same crew that are constantly in Time Magazine and the Economist Magazine and Newsweek
[26:20.000 --> 26:30.000]  and Financial Times of London and New York Times lecturing us about how America has greedy, greedy, greedy, evil rich people
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  and how these greedy, greedy, greedy, evil rich people aren't paying high enough taxes.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  And then when you see the legislation that their tax-free foundations lobby for,
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  it wants to take the highest federal income tax from 35 up above 40.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  But when you look at the loopholes the way it's written, somebody in a 35 is actually paying about 44.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  So if it goes to a 40 or 45, it'll be more like a 50.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  But wait, there's more.
[26:56.000 --> 27:03.000]  Then there's all the other taxes and property taxes and franchise taxes and state income taxes and environmental taxes.
[27:03.000 --> 27:13.000]  And that's why on average people making more than $125,000 a year in the United States pay over 70% in some form of tax.
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  Now Warren Buffett says it's greedy if you want to keep 30% of your money.
[27:19.000 --> 27:27.000]  A feudal surf in ancient Europe only had to pay 10 to 20% depending on what region, what error, what time.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  10 to 20%, 20 always cause revolts.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  20%, everything you produce goes to the king and his local nobles that collect it.
[27:35.000 --> 27:44.000]  So here in America, somebody paying, somebody making over $125,000 a year or a double income of a quarter million,
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  that's considered rich and you're paying above 70%.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  Now, there's this other myth that 51% of the country doesn't pay taxes.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  That's a complete lie.
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  And that's put out so somebody making $40,000 a year hears that and says, well, I'm paying no taxes.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  Really?
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  Do you know anybody who's were making $40,000 a year?
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  And they go, well, I get a refund check.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  What for $1,000?
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  Do the math on what's pulled out of your check, what 30% or so?
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.000]  I mean, you're talking $40,000 a year on average, you're probably paying $7,000, $8,000 just in federal taxes one way or another.
[28:21.000 --> 28:28.000]  Then there's all the state taxes and sales taxes and viral taxes and the hidden carbon taxes.
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  So you got the really rich people that have game the whole system every angle.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  They're exempt from all the real taxes and they're up there lobbying to raise taxes.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  Because they get most the government contracts, their corporate welfare whores,
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.000]  they own the private central banks that in the last three years got at least $27 trillion of American taxpayer money.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  They're all reporting record profits from stealing.
[28:58.000 --> 29:27.000]  We'll be back.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[29:31.000 --> 29:38.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye opener.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  I can't stress this enough.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:09.000 --> 31:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  Folks, this is Alex Jones.
[32:03.000 --> 32:08.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  Saving means to make money.
[32:10.000 --> 32:19.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[32:27.000 --> 32:35.000]  Calben Pure Soap is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[32:48.000 --> 32:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:18.000 --> 33:47.000]  Look, it's a law of history, it's a law of human nature that if you put up with corruption, you are going to be overrun by tyranny.
[33:47.000 --> 34:06.000]  And somehow, in the last 50 years or so, common sense that you've got to keep government small, you've got to not trust big government, you've got to be informed, you've got to defend liberty, you've got to guard your rights jealously.
[34:06.000 --> 34:18.000]  Those are all quotes from Thomas Jefferson and George Washington mixed together, you know, crazy people who founded the country and reason it's been so great, most wealthy, most patents, most developments.
[34:18.000 --> 34:25.000]  Just more real estate, not even that good of real estate, minerals, land, not as good as many other areas of the world.
[34:25.000 --> 34:34.000]  Mexico has tripled the resources conservatively according to CIA Factbook than we do here in the United States, but they're totally poor because they've got a tiny ruling class.
[34:34.000 --> 34:50.000]  But somehow they convince people, oh, there's no corruption in government, go to sleep, let them run it, give them a National Security Act in 47, show all these big megabanks that set up the CIA and through skull and bones so they can just do whatever they want.
[34:50.000 --> 35:00.000]  Ah, and when we find out they're bringing the narcotics in, they're laundering drug money, they're using government laws to shut down their competition, what do you expect?
[35:00.000 --> 35:12.000]  And I'm going to get into the whole debt ceiling situation, but I wanted to spend some time first just getting into what globalism is, how it's a bunch of powerful insiders using government to shut down their competition,
[35:12.000 --> 35:24.000]  and then getting half the population dependent on government in some form or fashion, and then every time the middle class doesn't want to have more of their taxes taken, more of their money taken,
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  they just threaten to cut off all the chicken feed to the general public who's now dependent and they start hopping up and down saying, give me more goodies.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  Well, even if they raise the taxes, even if they keep raising the debt ceiling, they're devaluing the currency.
[35:41.000 --> 35:58.000]  So the chicken feed social security you get, the chicken feed welfare card you get, the chicken feed that you're receiving, or your government paycheck, or your corporate paycheck from government contracts, it's shrinking because they're devaluing the denomination.
[35:58.000 --> 36:08.000]  You're like, well, they'll just pay us more in inflation. That's not happening. Wages have been going down for at least five years while the purchasing power of the dollar goes down.
[36:08.000 --> 36:19.000]  It's called a double whammy. And by the way, you're like, hey, don't compare social security to welfare. I agree with you. It's not. You did pay into it. They robbed it day one.
[36:19.000 --> 36:32.000]  When they set it up in the 36, they wanted to get you dependent. They wanted to get part of your paycheck and put it there so you'd always defend whatever the banksters did because you want the promise of getting your money back.
[36:32.000 --> 36:42.000]  You're being held hostage. Now, before I get into the whole debt ceiling, an incredible anti-second amendment treason. You heard me right. I don't use that word lightly.
[36:42.000 --> 36:54.000]  Treason and criminal felony actions by the White House that have aided and abetted in the murder of at least three Border Patrol officers and five police officers.
[36:54.000 --> 37:10.000]  I'm talking about fast and furious, huge developments across the country, but also exclusive scoop here in central Texas for multiple gun dealers about incredible harassment at the hands of the ATF and people buying guns are now being harassed.
[37:10.000 --> 37:24.000]  And the ATF is ordering them to do things outside of law. So that's all coming up. But I want to stop right here. I want to stop right here and just give listeners in Germany, in Japan, in Russia, in Mexico, in Brazil, in Chile.
[37:24.000 --> 37:42.000]  We got listeners all over the world. Number one on shoutcast, number one podcast, you know, coming up on three million listeners a day, not bragging, but it is a great accomplishment. It's actually scary. We have this many listeners because it's because I don't get butterflies going on here.
[37:42.000 --> 37:58.000]  I can go on national TV and walk out and talk to 10,000 people and I don't get butterflies. And that's not a good thing. I've done this so long so much that that I need those butterflies to realize just how how much responsibility we have here.
[37:58.000 --> 38:14.000]  But going back to what I was saying, I want to be careful here because I have a lot of sources in the city of Austin, in the media and government, and this affects everybody else around the world, whatever's happening here is happening in your town.
[38:14.000 --> 38:26.000]  We are per capita the wealthiest city in the United States. We're the fastest growing city in the United States. We're rated by Forbes and so many others as the unfortunate as the best place to live in the United States.
[38:26.000 --> 38:38.000]  I love Austin. I'm at Texan and it's my favorite city here. My mom's from Austin. I grew up in Dallas, but I've been here since high school. And I love it.
[38:38.000 --> 38:54.000]  But we have advocated our responsibility and let a bunch of morons, thugs and crooks run our city because we just let the politicians run it down there downtown.
[38:54.000 --> 39:08.000]  And I have made special reports. I've done countless radio shows in the last year on this subject. Well, not countless, probably 100 times I've talked about it four or five times the last few weeks.
[39:08.000 --> 39:20.000]  And that's Formula One. And this Formula One issue is a microcosm of everything I just spent the last 30 minutes, 35 minutes talking about.
[39:20.000 --> 39:33.000]  Where they pass government health care. It's actually doesn't cover preexisting conditions. It's written by the insurance companies. Wall Street Journal admits the head of the insurance company Lobby put out a statement.
[39:33.000 --> 39:44.000]  It's designed to cut the quality of care, designed to make you buy their products. And then all of the Fortune 100 insiders, they're exempt and given mafia waivers.
[39:44.000 --> 39:54.000]  That's total discrimination. But you're looking for discrimination on religion or race or something. You're not looking where it's really yet. The real discrimination is economic.
[39:54.000 --> 40:02.000]  Okay? I mean, if I've got to get my employees insurance, even though they don't want it, I've asked them before and no one wants it here.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  They get paid decent and they want to keep it and buy their own insurance or not.
[40:07.000 --> 40:15.000]  But here's the issue I'm getting. And you say, what does that have to do with Formula One? The point is this is the only issue. It's crony insiders. Nothing's going to be fixed.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  Don't raise the debt, raise the debt. None of that's going to mean diddly squat. It's all a distraction.
[40:24.000 --> 40:34.000]  I'm going to talk about the former head of the treasury in policy. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts calls it a total distraction in an editorial up at infowars.com.
[40:34.000 --> 40:44.000]  He's the father of Reaganomics. It means nothing. It's rearranging debt chairs. So no, the Tea Party's got it wrong and so does Obama.
[40:44.000 --> 40:52.000]  The Tea Party's got it more right than Obama. At least they at some level mean well, but perhaps we can impart to them what's really happening.
[40:52.000 --> 40:59.000]  But that's coming up. And then your call's in the second hour in the ATF News. But I want to get into this now.
[40:59.000 --> 41:21.000]  Before I even get into Formula One, when Dallas DFW Metroplex taxpayers, Arlington taxpayers paid out over a billion dollars to pay for the new Texas stadium or whatever it's called up there in Arlington,
[41:21.000 --> 41:30.000]  that's an example of everything wrong. If the NFL's so profitable, you shouldn't get any tax exemption.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  I'm always for cutting taxes, but not when the little guys always having his taxes raised because we don't have lobbyists.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  And by little guy, you can make $10 million a year and you don't have any pull in a state legislature, much less federally.
[41:43.000 --> 41:58.000]  Okay? Now there's trillion dollar outfits and they're slugging it out for influence. And if I don't pay my taxes, if I don't pay all of my property taxes that's rent on property I really don't own,
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  you know, 60, 70 years ago we didn't have property taxes, folks. So don't tell me, oh, we got to have it to pay for the schools.
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.000]  Again, this is how we turn into socialists, little cap domesticated rats and people don't even understand it.
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  We built this country without the IRS, without the income tax, without property taxes, without any of it.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  And it's always more and more and more as we get deeper into debt.
[42:19.000 --> 42:33.000]  So if I don't pay all my property taxes, they're going to go to court at the county courthouse, they're going to take my house and they're going to have a auction on the courthouse steps and they're going to take my house.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  And if I don't leave my house, if I squat in it, they're going to send police with a bullhorn and say, come out, Mr. Jones.
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  And after about five hours of this, they're going to send a SWAT team in to kill me. That happens every day in America.
[42:46.000 --> 42:56.000]  So next time you tell me, oh, you got to pay some money so that Jerry Jones can have a sports stadium, remember, remember, people are losing their houses every second.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  I'm going to get into Formula One on the other side.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[43:14.000 --> 43:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[43:24.000 --> 43:32.000]  And now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[43:51.000 --> 44:00.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[44:00.000 --> 44:08.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  We'll have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[44:24.000 --> 44:34.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[44:41.000 --> 44:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[44:48.000 --> 44:59.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[45:30.000 --> 45:40.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[45:53.000 --> 46:11.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[46:24.000 --> 46:38.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[46:46.000 --> 46:59.000]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.
[47:16.000 --> 47:43.000]  So, the number one way for the truly wealthy and rich in the world to make money is going in and buying your politicians and getting the politicians to exempt them from laws that the ultra-rich actually lobbied for in the first place, but only to shut down their competition.
[47:43.000 --> 47:52.000]  And when you understand that, now you have a true understanding. You are not going to hear Republicans tell you this. You're not going to hear Democrats tell you this.
[47:52.000 --> 48:01.000]  This is what the New World Order is about. A global, private, corporate government of control freaks who are the opposite of free market.
[48:01.000 --> 48:19.000]  There's a major headline playing by the NFL's tax-exempt rules. And if you scroll back to the top, I can give folks the source on that. Thank you. If you're a radio listener and you keep hearing me talk about showing you things, we're simulcasting all of this radio show at prisonplanet.tv.
[48:19.000 --> 48:34.000]  So, that's the non-profit quarterly playing by the NFL's tax-exempt rules. Oh, you didn't know it was tax-exempt, almost all of it. The players, they pay taxes, but see, ultra-rich brag, they write the tax rules. They don't pay diddly squat.
[48:34.000 --> 48:42.000]  And then when the ultra-rich start telling you to raise taxes to get the rich guys, oh yeah, please throw me in the briar patch. Give me a break. Let's go to the other article.
[48:42.000 --> 48:55.000]  Here's another one. Since I mentioned things on there, I like to source it. Forbes calls Austin number one boomtown. Okay, let's go now to Formula One that I raised here.
[48:55.000 --> 49:12.000]  Bernie Eccleston accused of bribery by German prosecutors. F1 Supremo alleged to have paid bribes to German banker. Banker organized sale of stake of F1 in 2005 is charged.
[49:12.000 --> 49:26.000]  There's also been some deaths, just like when Rupert Murdoch's being investigated. The chief whistleblower said, people are after me. I'm hiding in my house. Hitmen are coming. And then he's found dead. The police within minutes say no foul play.
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  Boy, it's like I call 911. Hitmen are coming. Save me, please. I'm found dead. Oh, please, nothing happened. Yeah, because the cops are the hitmen.
[49:33.000 --> 49:50.000]  Now, continuing here. Grow up, folks. Stop being naive schmucks, suckers, morons, marks. Get some street smarts. Get some history. Grow up. Listen, the founders weren't perfect, but they were geniuses.
[49:50.000 --> 50:01.000]  Foreign philosophers, historians have marbled the system they set up. Washington was offered kingship. He said, I'm leaving to go to the farm. I like jumping hedge rows and growing hemp.
[50:01.000 --> 50:10.000]  They set up a system that, if you executed it, creates absolute wealth and milk and honey. The problem is then, the great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.960]  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great
[50:12.960 --> 50:17.720]  grandchildren are a bunch of spoiled brats so a bunch of sharks come in take over the
[50:17.720 --> 50:22.080]  government and rob us and now we're imploding into a depression and the same sharks have
[50:22.080 --> 50:28.260]  new solutions to give them even more power to protect you now did you know that the
[50:28.260 --> 50:34.160]  F1 track is basically tax exempt because they're environmental zone that's right as long as
[50:34.160 --> 50:38.680]  they plant a few trees and have a quote community garden this is giant I don't know how many
[50:38.680 --> 50:42.240]  hundreds of acres facility it's even bigger than that I forget the number pull up the
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.040]  full acreage of that for me guys because they have a little garden and some trees they're
[50:46.040 --> 50:50.840]  tax exempt for enviro reasons see that's what the environmental movement's all about what
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.280]  type of toilet you can have a type of light bulbs you can have and then they could exempt
[50:54.280 --> 50:58.600]  you if they want oh we're gonna you know tax-free and then they're also still getting taxpayer
[50:58.600 --> 51:03.720]  money one way or the other just like Jerry Jones's billion plus dollar facility taxpayer
[51:03.720 --> 51:08.880]  paid for and they claim oh it brings jobs oh yes the overall income of this country is
[51:08.880 --> 51:14.000]  going down the dollars being devalued the insiders run things just like I told you naftin gap
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.640]  was gonna be great for the economy when it's a one-sided trade deal it's not really free
[51:18.640 --> 51:25.120]  trade or fair trade example of that it's not fair if we have hired taxes on our people
[51:25.120 --> 51:31.080]  than China it's not fair if we have environmental taxes and carbon taxes and they don't you see
[51:31.080 --> 51:36.720]  that's what tariffs are it equalizes and that's what built the country if you don't
[51:36.720 --> 51:44.280]  like tariffs you don't like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson you're a moron tariffs
[51:44.280 --> 51:50.600]  built this stinking country because it fosters trade inside and outside and it's a case by
[51:50.600 --> 51:58.640]  case basis that remember they told you don't worry don't worry will be a service economy
[51:58.640 --> 52:03.000]  after naftin gap first naftin gap wasn't going to deindustrialize this and then by a few
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.960]  years after it went into place in 94 everything was shutting down they said we'll be service
[52:06.960 --> 52:12.680]  now oh the service economy is falling apart we'll put that headline back up there F1 track
[52:12.680 --> 52:28.320]  owners get tax break for wildlife area that's 1100 acre 1100 acre property owned by circuit
[52:28.320 --> 52:35.720]  of the Americas and who owns that who owns that who owns that oh I'm sorry a guy that
[52:35.720 --> 52:41.000]  bought his daughter to giant mansions in the last few months he gave her $4 billion because
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.080]  he's got so much cash $4 billion he gave her $4 billion as a gift here's $4 billion to his
[52:46.080 --> 52:52.280]  22 year old daughter we can put her up on screen she bought $150 million dollar mansion
[52:52.280 --> 52:57.600]  another $90 million dollar mansion and of course you can this guy's got dozens of tracks
[52:57.600 --> 53:04.520]  all over the world and in every case it's tax-free and the government pays for it with your money
[53:04.520 --> 53:11.920]  I can barely pay my property taxes I can barely pay my employees and I and I give them raises
[53:11.920 --> 53:15.560]  I want to take care of them they deserve it and you know what if I didn't have to pay
[53:15.560 --> 53:19.480]  all this garbage I'd be investing it I'd be paying people more they'd have money to spend
[53:19.480 --> 53:27.720]  with your business but no Bernie Ecclestone this creature this this blob show his face
[53:27.720 --> 53:34.080]  for viewers there's his there's his little hussy daughter Petra Ecclestone from one

[54:15.840 --> 54:20.720]  tax exempt when I'm not because I'm not a big fat globalist like he is and then his

[54:58.920 --> 55:04.240]  she's privileged yeah you're more than privileged German prosecutors have alleged for the first
[55:04.240 --> 55:11.680]  time that Bernie Eccleston and a trust belonging to the head of the formula one family because
[55:11.680 --> 55:16.560]  they don't pay Jack squatting taxes a trust this how they all run a tax free trust paid
[55:16.560 --> 55:24.160]  almost 44 million in bribes that's 27 million pounds to a German banker in return they alleged
[55:24.160 --> 55:31.400]  Eccleston received 41.4 million in commissions from Bayron LB the German bank while a family
[55:31.400 --> 55:40.120]  trust company was paid 25 mil state prosecutors in Munich said Tuesday they have charged Gerhard
[55:40.120 --> 55:46.920]  Gilbroski the German banker who organized the sale of the F1 in 2005 the old taxpayer
[55:46.920 --> 55:53.840]  paid for and this is what I have to put up with is a you know what our city council isn't

[55:58.280 --> 56:05.880]  I mean they're just a bunch of social climate low IQ knuckle draggers who just sit up there
[56:05.880 --> 56:12.680]  and it's gonna be good for jobs it's gonna be great hey formula one makes such fabulous
[56:12.680 --> 56:21.160]  profits you pay for it it is immoral to take my tax money at the city and state level from
[56:21.160 --> 56:27.000]  property taxes education funds you name it and pump it into a guy who gave his daughter
[56:27.000 --> 56:35.040]  last year as a gift four billion dollars oh I know you've decided it's a good idea you
[56:35.040 --> 56:41.360]  little control freaks but if I came to your house and tried to come in and take one of
[56:41.360 --> 56:47.520]  your video games away you would physically assault me if I tried to if I tried to eat
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.920]  a bologna sandwich out of your refrigerator you'd call the cops and want me arrested
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.920]  but you want to come take money out of my bank accounts you want to destroy my capacity
[56:57.920 --> 57:04.760]  to own property through your stinking property tax to pay for Bernie Eccleston's garbage

[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.560]  face and then we'll get back to a system of great wealth but you know it's got to go
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.240]  through the total collapse first because we had the liberty so long we became fat dumb

[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.680]  being taught just like in third world countries with their obsessed with currency value and
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.920]  debt limits we've been maneuvered by a criminal class a criminal political class it's self owned
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:59.280]  by foreign banks we've been maneuvered now to the position where we're being told just keep raising
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.600]  taxes forever while you cut the services and pay everything to the offshore banks that set this
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.800]  fraud up who you don't know owe the money to or you'll have a total collapse and lose your
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.000]  debt rating and as ron paul has said and many others economist dr paul craig roberts former
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:24.320]  head of the treasury and many others have said it is all a distraction the foreign banks the big
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.720]  six that have taken over this country through their beachhead the federal reserve in 1913
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.000]  created and even the washington post reports this 1,500 trillion in derivatives and that was a year
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.080]  ago the numbers are bigger now it's a debt black hole hundreds of times all the wealth in the world
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:49.840]  you cannot pay it back it is a total fraud all the assets all the taxes all the everything in the
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:58.560]  entire us isn't even 100 trillion and we're told we owe these bankers 640 plus trillion washington post
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.600]  that is last number i saw 500 and something thousand per family that's if you average everybody

[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.760]  at the other one third of us and go and get ready we're going to butcher you and it's kind of like
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:41.840]  abel selling his inheritance for a bowl of porridge if the middle class doesn't get together and say
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.440]  look look here you can do the numbers that they've done the numbers if they took all the middle
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:54.080]  class's money it wouldn't pay for one trillion dollars it's less than one trillion nine hundred
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:05.600]  something billion you pull that number up folks it is it is time for people to realize this
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.840]  there is no paying it off there is no debt limit raise it don't raise it if the if the republicans
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.800]  came out and said arrest the head of the federal reserve arrest the private families for fraud as

[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.960]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.120]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.520]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.080]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.640]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:07.520]  three six five coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:17.920]  network network you know that's what's frustrating is that even when you're aware of corruption
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.120]  and aren't naive and fight it history shows as thomas jeverson said you still pretty much get
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:30.000]  run over and defeated and so many americans think it's cute to defend corruption and deny it's there
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.760]  and uh now we see all of our liberties all of our wealth all of our blessings draining out
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:43.200]  like a man who's had his legs cut off and blood's just spraying out pumping out he'll be he'll be in
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.080]  shock in 30 seconds he'll be dead in two minutes and the guy looks at you as the blood spraying
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:54.080]  out of his chopped off legs and says don't put turnikets on me conspiracy theorist it just
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:21:00.720]  blows the mind peter keith link steven gerry greg richard demothy allen garfield colonel sick carol
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.280]  i'm gonna get to y'all and i haven't even gotten into the atf news outside of law they're just
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:12.000]  restricting the second amendment now i mean you can't even make this up and we have inside intel
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.920]  directly from atf austin so i'll get to that in the last segment uh the the only piece of news
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.480]  i'm gonna hit on the debt limit is they're saying they've got a deal hopefully in the next 48 hours
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.760]  hopefully of the bankers and we're all learning about defaults and bankruptcy and that our futures
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.440]  tied to what bankers do not according to our industries or our ideas or how hard we work
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.840]  we're learning that we live and die by bankers that's what this is teaching us ahead of the
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.680]  total default and the depression and teaching us that not raising taxes enough is what did this
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:49.120]  that's what little geitner the crook and others have taught us and oh yeah he got some bailout money
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:55.440]  from the bailout money i'm continuing moody's neither debt plan will protect the nation's triple
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.680]  a rating oh what ron paul told us months ago what other economists told us years ago i'm afraid even
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.480]  if you do go deeper into debt you're gonna lose the triple a rating the triple a rating was gone
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:13.440]  over three years ago when they started monetizing debt over 75 of all the t-bills now are bought
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:20.160]  by the federal reserve you're like oh the bankers are helping uh yeah they buy them with fiat digital
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.280]  currency they make up that's taxpayer paid for and then they buy real assets for themselves
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:31.840]  yes they're really helping you i can oh they're gonna help you good don't worry uh reductions
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.320]  of the magnitude now being proposed if adopted would likely lead moody's to adopt a negative
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.760]  outlook on the triple a rating the credit agency said in a new report the chances of a significant
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.840]  improvement the long-term credit profile the government coming from deficit reductions the
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:54.240]  magnitude proposed is in either plan is not high moody's and s and purer's demand 100 cuts of
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:01.600]  everything old money paid to foreign bankers that's scambus and new taxes so they want higher
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.960]  taxes everything cut everything to them and then that's not enough nothing's enough everything
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:12.480]  because every daughter of these people has to have 56 000 square foot homes with helicopter pads of
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:17.920]  stolen money and they gotta they gotta hire mercenaries and armies and cops and and and all
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.400]  these major banks have gotten narcotics to launder they're hardcore mafia but they're
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.960]  wearing government outfits so you literally say take my daughter take my wife take it all and so

[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.280]  jim here in miami and i got to meet somebody who also works for a department of homeland security
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.440]  and i just got to talking with him because he showed up in his giant truck with all the information
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.760]  he was a banker protection enforcer a bank rape helper and and what did the bank raper helper say
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.400]  well i try not to go too heavy on him because i knew he was becoming a member at our very small
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.400]  gym and i was hoping maybe if i could get in with him i could get a lot of information but he just
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.960]  basically confirmed a ton of stuff that you're always talking about number one he's head of a
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:46.560]  one of 28 elite response uh task force teams where he runs the top five police and top five fire
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.400]  department guys from tampa down to the keys here and they confirmed they've got uh he didn't he
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.360]  didn't know what i meant when i said fema cams but he he knew that when i said relocation and
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.640]  tournament camps for emergencies he was confirmed there's two here like we don't have fema camps
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.360]  but we do have giant facilities where we lock up hundreds of thousands per city for political
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:13.680]  reasons yes we do have those but they're not camps be confirmed yeah we don't respond
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.240]  to any local authority we respond only the federal authority and he was kind of bragging
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:24.160]  he's like i pimp the cops i run the local chiefs it was so funny it was so funny he he
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.800]  i was coming out coming at it as i was like well i'm so interested tell me more about your job
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:34.800]  just so he wouldn't tell me about your power yeah exactly but then he was more forthcoming with the
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.840]  information and he confirmed that he confirmed that they're preparing they're not concerned
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.560]  about al-qaeda anymore he said it's and that's mourning actually cnn put out a piece about how
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  al-qaeda he's worried about those that don't like the bankers i i specifically said did you see the
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.120]  myak report and he again didn't really know it by name but when i started discussing things like
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.680]  you know gun owners returning veterans like yeah that we're really concerned about that
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.640]  we're really concerned about a new anthrax attack is what he said oh yeah which was publicly run by
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.960]  the government now admitted just telling me to drink more fluoride give himself lots of vaccine
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.320]  shots because he loves the government they're going to take good care of him don't worry he'll
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.000]  get what he wants in the end that's the good feeling about all this no matter they're bringing
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  america down burning they're going to burn right down with it by their own hand and he's on his power

[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.600]  to you out there that this time around especially with the wrong paul campaign it is so easy to talk
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:48.400]  to people it is so easy to walk up to people because one paul has predicted everything and he
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.120]  knows exactly he's been winning almost all the straw polls so fox news never mentions him and
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:59.920]  mentions all the little uh well they mention al gore's former chief of staff uh uh the the ultra
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.320]  conservative rick perry next they're gonna tell me bill clinton's conservative and of course the
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:09.440]  average moron conservative i get emails going he didn't work for al gore okay scumbag if you don't
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:15.280]  want to go check that out for yourself go ahead and uh let's talk about mitt romney who wrote the
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:22.240]  health care bill these conservatives are idiots oh they love it i'm sorry i apologize they just
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:27.200]  love bondage they hate their wives their children their cowards they love being con they love it
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.280]  they're gonna get it don't worry they're gonna get everything they want listen to this uh i i'm
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.400]  i'm part of the republican group down here in miami and with we have all the mayors and and former
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:44.160]  senator lemieux came in the other day to talk to us and whereas before ever uh myself my brother
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.680]  were like let me not boast my ron paul support whatever this time around we are dominating it
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.960]  we are dictating it when they mention rick perry we go al gore when they mention mid romney we go
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.720]  obamacare and when i'm trying to tell people out there we're listening to you this is not the time
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.360]  to be shy anymore and there's more of us out there than you think and as soon as you open your mouth
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.440]  you'll realize how many more people go yeah i agree and they didn't want to be the first one to say
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.360]  it so if you start saying things be confident be you know secure in what you're saying because you
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.520]  know you're right you know that information to back it up and if there's one thing that we can
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.360]  learn from the way you run things it's don't shy away from this stuff because you're gonna end up
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:27.280]  being right and no no no exactly look look 200 years ago if government acted like it was acting
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.400]  now people would be running around with torches and guns i'm not even saying do that because
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:38.000]  that's what they want the point is yelling and screaming is the minimum i can do here and and
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.040]  yes i hyperventilate yes i tell folks how i really feel because it's time to stop mincing words

[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.520]  are holding i had a lot of other news i didn't even get to uh tomorrow on the main weekday show
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.680]  because we're gonna have a special report completed by then air ends up here working on sunny to get
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.320]  it done with all the different video clips and documents and proof but you heard or you heard
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.560]  about the atf saying well if you sell two or more rifles to somebody call the police on them in fact call
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.080]  the atf on them you got to fill out this big form and got to call them and got to become our
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.080]  confidential informant it doesn't matter that whenever you buy a gun there's an instant check
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:11.600]  done a background check and what type of firearm you know rifle shotgun handgun you're buying it's
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:18.000]  just about we tell you to do things now that aren't under the law and you do them and of course it's
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.040]  the atf caught shipping close to 30 000 guns into mexico now we learned drug gangs around the country
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.720]  to knock out the other drug gangs that aren't laundering their money through the big banks
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.680]  you know so that's who runs the whole drug trade it's on record now they admit the marines and army
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.160]  grow the opium now at record levels come into your daughter's arm your son's arm but you know it's for
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.440]  freedom you're unpatriotic if you're against a captain america likes to deal narcotics and if
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.400]  you're not for it well you're with al-qaeda but oh i'm actually al-qaeda is now our ally in libya
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.960]  i'm sorry uh you're you're with george washington even worse worse than al-qaeda um but uh it turns
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:58.480]  out i talked to local gun dealers several of them and uh one of them called and talked to daniel
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.960]  jones the head of the atf here in austin who on record runs stings on gun shows with illegal aliens
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.000]  uh of course the same agency again caught shipping guns into mexico and then lying to
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.600]  congress about it to then blame the second amendment that was their plan and they don't care
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:20.320]  they've been caught that's the name of this it's uh what they call it hootspa arrogance bravada a plum
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:29.360]  they um they're still going ahead with outside of law but when i talked to one gun dealer he said he
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:36.640]  called um daniel jones the head of the atf in austin two weeks before receiving the letter
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.920]  to ask about news reports that president obama was going to order uh the investigation of citizens
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:48.000]  that bought two more rifles agent jones told him quote no that law didn't pass and we can't enforce
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.400]  something that isn't laws so don't worry about it of course the law didn't pass we have a link
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.360]  to that in the washington post but the atf later enforced anyway so i mean who needs congress to
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:04.160]  launch wars obama saying don't raise the debt ceiling and he will uh invoke the catastrophic
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.160]  emergency clause that suspends congress for six months oh they'll still sit up there and fly around
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:15.040]  their private jets and be exempt from all the laws they pass but he'll just do what he wants so uh
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.520]  um we'll be covering that more tomorrow here on the show for you
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.240]  uh let's go ahead and talk to keith in california go ahead keith you're on the air thanks for

[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:45.920]  um the property tax i'm concerned is it ron paul a proponent of property tax though ron paul's to
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:52.000]  get rid of the income tax or property tax from when i've seen him so um but i i think he said when
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.880]  he's asked about it federally he said there shouldn't be a federal property tax but that it's a state's
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.080]  rights issue just like on abortion see that's the constitution so he's saying constitution
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:11.120]  okay good is there any um information or books uh when property tax was established uh any history
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.360]  on that yeah i've looked all over the internet and i've never been able to find anything now i've
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.400]  looked it up uh just look search history of property tax and there really wasn't a property

[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.000]  this is our land
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.480]  these are our people

[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.680]  all right i'm gonna go back to steven jam and jerry greg richard garfield colonel six and carol
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:16.880]  and i'm out of control today you know there is a organized government disinformation movement online
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:22.080]  the white house science are admits it means public about it but it's gone on for decades
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:28.000]  i've interviewed former fbi agents who've admitted it to go out and attack anybody
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.560]  that speaks out the british government did it with the hot moscondi they did it with uh
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.880]  martin Luther king her in this country and they always tear down anybody that's trying to be a leader
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:44.640]  and anybody that tries to empower individuals and i'm not even comparing myself to those great men
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.520]  the point is they go after anybody and say they're not real look they did this look they did that
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:54.320]  or they're wrong about this they're wrong about that so in the interest of all this let's just
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:00.160]  say i'm discredited and i'm bad the dollar is being devalued they are creating cross human
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.000]  animal clones gmo and all the major studies is destroying our fertility you know diabetes has
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.720]  doubled in the last decade world government has been announced run by private bankers so i don't
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.920]  ever want to make the debates about alex jones like is alex jones for real that's like asking
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:24.080]  are you real look at the fruits of what i've done in 16 years a lot of good and some bad i've been
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:29.040]  like a bull in a china cabinet but my heart's good at the end of the day and sometimes i have
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:35.360]  moments of great clarity and you know complex elegance and beauty other times i'm ranting and
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.480]  screaming angrily i'm real and the system knows that believe it but they try to get folks all day
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.200]  to have more debates about alex jones which at the end of the day helps the radio show
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.280]  and what i'm doing in a way you know no no weapon formed against us so prosper
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:58.320]  all the attacks and lies and disinformation and twisting only helps us and that's one thing you
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.760]  know one reason i always try to be the very best i can because even trying to be truthful and honest
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.000]  i make mistakes and things and aren't perfect and i'm arrogant and worldly like everybody else
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:17.040]  but but i do realize that i now am you know to a great extent this figurehead for liberty
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:20.560]  you know one of only a few figureheads and i start thinking i better get in better shape
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.960]  or i got all these freckles from sun damage put makeup on but i never do you know i'm the figurehead
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.840]  i better start wearing suits more but at the end of the day you know what i'm just going to be who i
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.800]  am and uh i'm going to go out fish him with no sunscreen and burn my face off i don't care
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:38.560]  and you know what if i want to eat enchiladas i'm going to do it and i just don't care i just don't
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:44.720]  care it's the information that matters and uh i just want a future for my children and your
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:49.040]  children and we've all got to hang together or hang separate now i got to get to the other callers but
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:53.760]  steven in texas you know i don't like folks calling and saying i'm how great i am but you're saying
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:58.000]  your wife instinctively meeting me had a good feeling about me and you know there's a lot to
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.800]  be said for female intuition dogs love me i'll go to people's houses that usually have dogs that
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:07.600]  try to attack people and they're always going my german shepherd really likes you he doesn't like
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:13.360]  anybody or my pug always barks at people why is my pug like you so much because at the end of the
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:20.240]  day i am a good guy i am a loving jolly person but what i do doesn't stand at that point at the
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:27.440]  end of the day what matters is in the whole of my work is it overall truthful has it been accurate
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:33.440]  and unfortunately it has no one wishes steven that they've been wrong more than i do absolutely
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.640]  alex and again it's i've been a long time listener of you way back to i think it was channel 10 on
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:43.280]  cable access you're either before after the banana hat guy or something like that so anyway yeah
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:48.720]  operatives come from nowhere uh in like in a year like glen back and take over shon anity
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:54.160]  you know i've been in the trenches forever coming up yeah absolutely no but just to just to recap the
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.120]  quick story again my wife and i were having a good discussion a couple weeks after we had the
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:03.760]  rally at the capital and she said you know i asked her i said you know is alex just doing this for
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.920]  for profit and for ratings and whatnot she said let me tell you before you set up at the capital
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:12.480]  that day i knew that if i was screaming too loud enough i got a rest or something that i could hand
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.160]  our three-year-old daughter to alex and and she'd be fine so keep up the great work my friend you're
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:22.720]  doing a great job thank you so much i appreciate that that's another co until pro thing though
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.080]  that that and i know you're responding to it you know to say oh my gosh ron paul setting up a
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:34.400]  foundation to educate people asking for donations or my gosh this guy's selling a book the globalist
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:38.880]  now listen to me on this and i'm going to your other calls the globalist social engineers take
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:44.880]  our money build government schools and then do the exact opposite of what the parents want and
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:52.960]  what's common sense the government takes your money and then runs psa's brainwashing you
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:53:00.080]  the government takes your money and uses it against you and treats you like you're a slave
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:06.400]  then in the free market and you'll always see this in the media i've had nightline msnbc you
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.560]  name in here literally over the years more than a hundred tv stations they always say
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:15.520]  you're doing this to make money and i look at them and i go well i got into this to fight tyranny
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:19.600]  because i don't want to be a slave and i hate control freaks that's my instinct but i said
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:25.840]  yeah i do like making money hiring more people being successful being strong uh i wish i had
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:31.680]  more money to build more but at the end of the day the goal is not have a bigger house or a faster
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:37.120]  cooler car i'm very happy with what i've got but at the same time we do need some wealth
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.440]  be able to operate protect ourselves be successful see they're teaching you that you that you're

[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.920]  jerry in florida you're on the air go ahead mr jones good evening how are you good my friend
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:07.680]  welcome listen uh i'm gonna try to get this all out i i i really want to address i eat two to three
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:14.160]  million caller our listeners a day um well this show only has about a million on sunday okay well
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:21.440]  but um okay but more on the story i've been listening to you for the last three years almost
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:29.520]  religiously daily and in the very beginning as i'm sure most of your new listeners coming in i was
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:36.800]  one i i wanted in the worst way in the worst way to be able to bust you out you know for my own
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.960]  psychological now this guy's full of crap he's he's making money on the internet he's hocking
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:49.520]  he's hocking this you know and then you would come with the no go look it up go no right now
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.800]  this article go to google look it up and it sure enough it would be there well now here
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:01.680]  fast forward here i am three years later and and and you're you're right on all the time so
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:11.200]  my my my disgust is is in two parts one with the old listeners including myself uh in that us old
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:20.560]  listeners we know that you're not full of crap and so i think there's a there's there's a tendency
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:26.080]  for us to go well you know what i don't want to be the first guy out there to go get my head popped
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:31.520]  but i'm going to work from behind the scenes i'm going to notify my congressman i'm going to i'm
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:38.240]  going to paste email links here i'm going to tell people behind the scenes to get them on to you
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:42.720]  and then you know that and then you got the new listeners going all these guys will eat of it
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:49.280]  and they'll come to know eventually but my point is this we are the frontline we're all that there
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:56.400]  is left standing between us and and and i think that there's this general psychological uh view
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:02.720]  that well you know okay well maybe this guy knows maybe he's on to something maybe he knows something
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:07.840]  but the you know what as well but still is it i'm not hearing it still it's seen as just a
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.800]  still it's just seen as another show and well you know maybe people will do something about it
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:18.080]  exactly and other people sit there in nitpick all day and like well we have private recruiting
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:22.240]  stations overseas but not actual army recruiting stations so it doesn't matter that the biggest
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:27.440]  group of recruits is from overseas technically we don't recruit overseas so alex is wrong or
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:32.160]  technically this or that the point is we know our society is going in the wrong direction
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:37.200]  and all of the listeners should be engaged in activism every day if we're going to turn this
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.960]  turning around the good news is the world is waking up great job with the crew see you back next
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:48.640]  sunny four to six p.m. back tomorrow 11 a.m. central thanks for putting up with me i love you and i go fight tyrants
