[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:27.360]  Texas Alex Jones it is Friday November 20th 2009 we're gonna be live here for
[00:27.360 --> 00:31.280]  the next four hours and we're simulcasting from the very beginning of
[00:31.280 --> 00:35.920]  the radio show at prisonplanet.tv and living coat living color why am I
[00:35.920 --> 00:41.040]  doing that today because we've got the infomercial king and so much more the
[00:41.040 --> 00:46.480]  alternative a medicine king I mean you name it Kevin Trudeau people in the
[00:46.480 --> 00:49.360]  office when he's been walking around this morning or just staying there with
[00:49.360 --> 00:53.400]  their mouths hanging open he's with us in studio for the first hour because that
[00:53.400 --> 00:56.560]  was the only hour he could do he's a meeting with some scientists and
[00:56.560 --> 01:00.440]  researchers here in Austin as he travels around the country in the world
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.960]  investigating alternative treatments and cures so he's here with us in studio he
[01:05.960 --> 01:10.640]  has won his appeal against the federal government a big victory for free speech
[01:10.640 --> 01:15.440]  because he's one of the few Americans to ever have his books banned and to have
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.960]  his free speech banned by a federal court and of course they lost because we are
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.720]  saving this republic before it completely falls so we're going to talk
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.000]  about the food supply vaccines gold the inside info he has on that front how he
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.120]  won his appeal and where Kevin Trudeau is going from here and some of the
[01:33.120 --> 01:39.160]  amazing medical information that he's been discovering in his world travels
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.840]  then we've got Neil Fallon the lead singer and guitarist for clutch a lot of
[01:43.840 --> 01:47.720]  listeners of ours are fans I'm a fan their lyrics are totally anti-New World
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.120]  Order of course we know the mega death just named their new album after in-game
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.440]  we had Dave Mustain on to talk about that so the culture war is on and it's
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.640]  not left or right it's about liberty versus tyranny and then Bob Chapman with
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.400]  his once a week visit with us on the economy certainly an important discussion
[02:05.400 --> 02:09.040]  we're going to be having today and I got some bad news for you the good news is
[02:09.040 --> 02:13.000]  Kevin Trudeau's here the bad news we told you soon health votes set for
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.480]  Saturday night the debate starts they could pass it anytime next week ladies
[02:17.480 --> 02:22.920]  and gentlemen this is the criminal bankers hijacking another 17th percent
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.480]  of the US economy Kevin Trudeau thanks for being here with us be here it's good
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.320]  to have you we're about to go to break but in the two minutes we've got left
[02:30.320 --> 02:33.320]  tell folks about some of the info you're gonna be sharing with us today
[02:33.320 --> 02:37.600]  first thing is I have been really the first guy that the federal government
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.000]  said we want to take away his first amendment rights and they went to the
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.240]  judge and said we want his books banned this is what the federal government the
[02:45.240 --> 02:48.040]  Federal Trade Commission and the reason why they're trying to ban the books and
[02:48.040 --> 02:52.560]  they actually got the judge to to take me off television radio and the internet
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.480]  I could not I can't exercise my first amendment rights for three years was
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.360]  because 50 million people have purchased my books where I exposed the corruption
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.720]  in government and the drug companies the banking industry and the fast food
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.960]  industry and how it all works together with the media the good news is I won
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.760]  the appeal the appeals court vacated the 37 million dollar fine that the judge
[03:12.760 --> 03:17.040]  threw on me and they vacated the three-year ban but now we're back in
[03:17.040 --> 03:20.680]  court and now the Federal Trade Commission is asking the judge in their
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.880]  papers we want the first amendment rights for Kevin Trudeau taken away for
[03:25.880 --> 03:29.920]  life wow and it's it's really amazing so I'll be fighting that for probably the
[03:29.920 --> 03:37.120]  next year but when you say you're the first person in modern history I guess
[03:37.120 --> 03:40.320]  some of that happened during World War one with the trading with the enemy act
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.880]  to say silence this guy and I've read their court filings could spend all of
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.720]  the national news last few years for listeners that don't know where they
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.560]  really say you are enemy number one and must be shut down because they know they
[03:53.560 --> 03:58.320]  can knock off the king of alternative information on television and they can
[03:58.320 --> 04:02.200]  go after everybody else and what it says is it scares everybody else because of
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.560]  the attacks on me I don't mind the fight and luckily I've had the financing to
[04:05.560 --> 04:08.840]  spend the ten you know virtually tens of millions of dollars over the years
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.440]  fighting them but everybody else in the industry is just scared like rabbits so
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.240]  that they are going back into their holes so that the government is
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.680]  using this to scare everybody else and stop them from doing but they won't go
[04:20.680 --> 04:25.000]  after Pfizer I mean Pfizer was fined criminally four times four times and
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.840]  recently just find 2.7 billion dollars for criminal fraud in the marketing of
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.840]  their drugs that's not from page news no one even talks about it they were
[04:34.840 --> 04:39.560]  fined four times for criminal fraud but guess what not a single person at
[04:39.560 --> 04:44.400]  Pfizer was charged let's go over your case and how important this is for the
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.280]  First Amendment whether you love Kevin Jordeaux or hating and I haven't
[04:48.280 --> 04:54.920]  liked him you've got to ask yourself why is the government the media so so
[04:54.920 --> 04:58.240]  angry with this person and we'll discuss all that on the other side of this
[04:58.240 --> 05:04.000]  quick break the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.400]  the food they want you to eat will you continue to be their profit center

[08:01.200 --> 08:06.320]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[08:06.320 --> 08:13.400]  there's a war on for your mind on this Friday edition November 20th 2009 we
[08:13.400 --> 08:18.200]  have Kevin Fredo in studio and you know it's hard to put this guy in a box and
[08:18.200 --> 08:24.320]  say what he is he's done so much author lecture you know top infomercial guy on
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.320]  television and he has raised the ire of the federal government they said you
[08:29.320 --> 08:33.360]  can't sell your books you can't go on radio you can't go on TV you have no
[08:33.360 --> 08:37.600]  First Amendment well he didn't back off he's still gone on radio and television
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.840]  he came on this radio show and now he has beaten them with his appeal in court
[08:42.840 --> 08:47.120]  because it was so flagrantly unconstitutional and again whether you
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.000]  agree with everything Kevin says or agree with some of it or agree with a
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.040]  little bit of it or all of it all of us either hang together or hang separate as
[08:56.040 --> 09:01.400]  Benjamin Franklin said when the government and the media team up to come
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.560]  demonize somebody and say we must crucify them we must shut them down we
[09:05.560 --> 09:09.440]  must openly persecute them we must give them twenty five million dollars twenty
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.840]  seven million dollar fines we have a problem look at Merck knowingly putting
[09:13.840 --> 09:19.120]  out viox knowing it would cause heart attacks look at Merck with the Gardasil
[09:19.120 --> 09:22.760]  shots in their own trials and knowing it was causing autoimmune diseases and
[09:22.760 --> 09:26.560]  killing people now confirmed mainstream news we told you three years ago during
[09:26.560 --> 09:32.560]  the trials in 1981 Eli Lilly and Prozac they knew massive increases in
[09:32.560 --> 09:37.960]  suicide psychotic breaks homicidal mania now it's on the inserts twenty
[09:37.960 --> 09:41.440]  something years later 19 years later they've been forced to put it on the
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.960]  inserts so you have these big drug giants that want a monopoly and Kevin
[09:45.960 --> 09:50.360]  Trudeau's writing books about well-known alternative treatments and cures that
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.600]  are known in Europe and Asia and he's being demonized as the ultimate snake
[09:55.600 --> 09:59.280]  oil salesman when I've read a lot of his books I haven't seen all his material
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.320]  but a lot of it really looks you know legitimate from what medical doctors
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.920]  and others have said on this show but regardless even if he was wrong he has
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.480]  a First Amendment right if Kevin Trudeau is successfully destroyed by these
[10:11.480 --> 10:16.360]  people everyone else is next Obama's openly announcing wants to regulate and
[10:16.360 --> 10:20.640]  shut down the web for national security they're openly announcing they want to
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.840]  federalize all your local police the power structure the big fortune 100 want
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.480]  to consolidate the markets they want to shut down freedom of choice and that's
[10:30.480 --> 10:34.120]  why Kevin Trudeau is here today really on a crusade to fight this because he's
[10:34.120 --> 10:37.040]  one of the only people that's had the money to go after these people and he's
[10:37.040 --> 10:40.160]  one of the only people I've ever heard of in the last century who's actually
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.280]  had his books banned in the United States we're gonna talk about it all today
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.440]  Kevin when we hit that break he was starting to get into the criminal
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.520]  activity I mean Bayer knowingly shipping out over a million ampoules of factor
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.440]  rate knowing had HIV and hepatitis in it but they're not getting in trouble it's
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.120]  you because you're saying vitamin C is good exactly when I when I first did
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.120]  this I mentioned last time was on the show when I was calling it from Germany
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.960]  Sean Shanahan had hooked on phonics and 1989 teaching kids how to read because
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.600]  the school systems were pulling phonics out of the schools I introduced mega
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.440]  memory and I exposed that the Department of Education was getting school
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.680]  systems to get the kids on the drug Ritalin and they were giving $500 a
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.760]  month per kid who was on Ritalin and I said they're drugging the kids on
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.760]  purpose the school systems drugging the kids on purpose and I remember watching
[11:31.760 --> 11:36.520]  that when I was in college that's why you've been enemy number one all along
[11:36.520 --> 11:39.640]  because you immediately went after their drug into the kids and I see people
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.600]  understand I got the phone call the phone call was we need to have a meeting
[11:43.600 --> 11:47.200]  from the Federal Trade Commission and they said you have to stop talking about
[11:47.200 --> 11:53.320]  Ritalin that was a one-on-one meeting and I said that's the point of the mega
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.960]  memory program sure it improves your memory but I'm exposing the drug Ritalin
[11:56.960 --> 12:02.600]  and they said I will not back down and they said to me we will not back down
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.880]  either they sued Sean Shanahan with hooked on phonics bankrupted him they
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.080]  sued me I fought back basically won that but then they went on a crusade ever
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.400]  since to demonize me as the messenger but they never said that the mega memory
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.280]  program for example didn't work they never said that there are customers who
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.000]  bought mega memory and didn't get a refund and then when it came out natural
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.480]  cures they don't want you to know about that book which was number one on the
[12:27.480 --> 12:32.400]  New York Times best-seller list 26 weeks in a row in 2004 it was the number one
[12:32.400 --> 12:37.520]  selling book in America it outsold Harry Potter outsold the Da Vinci code when I
[12:37.520 --> 12:41.920]  came out with that book I exposed how the pharmaceutical companies were
[12:41.920 --> 12:49.320]  basically fraudulently lying to people about the research about the efficacy
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.800]  and safety of their drugs so what just came out yesterday that the that the
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.320]  pharmaceutical companies write these letters saying how good a drug is they
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.880]  go to the doctors at the medical schools the PhDs and say sign this letter make
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.560]  believe it came from you and we'll pay a hundred grand I exposed that in 2004 and
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.880]  now that's coming out that all the major boards pushing all the vaccines
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.400]  they're all on the payroll but they're not making a hundred grand now some of
[13:16.400 --> 13:19.680]  these guys are making a half million a year just to sit there and say you need
[13:19.680 --> 13:23.760]  this and and it doesn't include the the secret stock options and the warrants
[13:23.760 --> 13:27.320]  they're getting as well so that's why I've been pushing and that's why the
[13:27.320 --> 13:30.640]  federal trade commission which has a pretty good job in the media saying
[13:30.640 --> 13:34.880]  Kevin Trudeau is a snake oil salesman he's a convicted felon well you know
[13:34.880 --> 13:38.680]  what snake oil am I selling I'm not selling viox that seems like snake oil
[13:38.680 --> 13:43.120]  well they're trying to discredit you because I remember you've been doing
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.280]  this so long I remember in when I was a senior in high school then in college I
[13:46.280 --> 13:49.400]  be sitting around the door and watching you remember you talking about red one
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.480]  on TV and and going back through my memory you're one of the first people
[13:53.480 --> 13:56.600]  that really woke me up to that and now they admit it shrinks the children's
[13:56.600 --> 14:02.000]  brains and causes their heart to swell retards growth retards their
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.660]  psychological development their mental development everybody knows Ritalin's
[14:05.660 --> 14:09.440]  bad now and it was really Kevin Trudeau as one of the first guys out there and
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.560]  you talk a lot about fluoride in the water I talk about fluoride in the water
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.080]  we talk about the genetically modified food how it caused illnesses and
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.080]  disease the antibiotics and meat and dairy the bovine growth hormone and
[14:20.080 --> 14:23.680]  meat and dairy you know why do we have such obesity in America the report came
[14:23.680 --> 14:27.440]  came out two days ago that said in the next seven years over 50% of Americans
[14:27.440 --> 14:32.480]  are gonna be not just fat or overweight obese obese why is it rising when more
[14:32.480 --> 14:36.560]  people are on diet food more people are going to the gym ever ever before in
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.880]  America but the obesity rate and the overweight rate keeps going up and up
[14:40.880 --> 14:44.360]  and up and up well listen 50 60 years ago everybody working on our family
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.200]  farms I've seen photos of them an old new old old film footage they were all
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.000]  super skinny but they ate gigantic huge piling meals a lot of fat a lot of beef
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.400]  a lot of dairy a lot of carbohydrates no one nobody was it on diet food there was
[14:59.400 --> 15:04.200]  no light beer they were eating real beer they weren't on aspartame and splendor
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.040]  these chemicals are being specific and I've been in the meetings you know when
[15:08.040 --> 15:10.920]  I was involved in the marketing some of the stuff behind the scenes and
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.040]  developing some of the the mind-controlled advertising I was there
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.720]  you know how can we we say something to make it legal in the words but have the
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.400]  person's impression be what's not true that's how the marketing was done and so
[15:25.400 --> 15:28.880]  coming out and exposing this that's why I'm public enemy number one to the
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.080]  government especially the pharmaceutical industry you know when I went on Larry
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.640]  King I was booked on Larry King right after I did the today show with Matt
[15:35.640 --> 15:39.640]  Lauer I was on Matt Lauer live that right after I did the live show with Matt
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.480]  Lauer I got a cancellation from Larry King and Larry called me and said I'm
[15:43.480 --> 15:46.960]  really sorry and I have to tell you I was ordered to take you off the air
[15:46.960 --> 15:53.200]  because CNN executives do not want you live because you won't do what we tell
[15:53.200 --> 15:56.680]  you to say when I was on with Donnie Deutsch on CNBC first thing he said
[15:56.680 --> 16:00.560]  don't talk about the drug companies I mean so that's the problem well that's
[16:00.560 --> 16:04.240]  like 40% of their advertising yeah you can't go on there and I've been I've
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.160]  been offered deals just stop talking about fluoride stop talking about the
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.320]  drug companies and we'll give you a free pack I can't imagine the deals you were
[16:12.320 --> 16:17.920]  offered back when I was like on 10 radio stations in 98 99 I was approached by
[16:17.920 --> 16:21.160]  some of the biggest radio networks and they said point blank no more fellow
[16:21.160 --> 16:25.680]  reserve no more black helicopters no more New World Order you can be the next
[16:25.680 --> 16:29.560]  rush limbaugh how does you know a million the first year 15 million the next
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.640]  sound and I said I can't stop talking about the truth and now look at us all
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.240]  these years later House Finance Service Committee approves bill to audit the Fed
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.520]  rejecting Watts fake alternative in the house and votes to rein in foreign
[16:43.520 --> 16:49.200]  currency swaps so the beginning of the end for these people is now here the
[16:49.200 --> 16:53.040]  public now looks past Republicans and Democrats the puppets they're now seeing
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.200]  the power structure and it just shows that not selling out has now paid off for
[16:58.200 --> 17:02.480]  the truth and freedom we're not winning yet but we're beginning to get there and
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.520]  what's happening is you're seeing it as well the bigger voice you have and the
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.240]  more that people begin to listen to you that's when the attacks start oh my gosh
[17:11.240 --> 17:16.000]  I've got no exaggeration over 20 attacks the last two days CBS News Jerusalem
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.920]  Post George Soros media matters I mean it's just it's unbelievable correct so
[17:21.920 --> 17:25.480]  when you start having an influence that's when you get the attacks now my
[17:25.480 --> 17:29.520]  books at 50 million copies have been sold on TV I have more impressions than
[17:29.520 --> 17:33.960]  anybody else in the last decade even Oprah so I'm having a huge influence I've
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.480]  had over 70 million customers by my stuff I had three TV networks in Europe I
[17:38.480 --> 17:43.200]  had manufacturing facilities in China so I had a big influence and I'm having a
[17:43.200 --> 17:47.280]  big influence and that's one of the reasons why I'm the snake oil salesman
[17:47.280 --> 17:51.480]  I'm the fraudster I'm the I'm the person deceiving America talk about smoke in
[17:51.480 --> 17:55.080]  mirrors where all the people that have been deceived you know we're all the
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.760]  customers I mean remember Dr. Phil he wrote a book called the ultimate weight
[17:58.760 --> 18:01.720]  loss solution and the guy's chubby I don't know how we could write a book on
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.200]  the ultimate weight loss solution but it was fraud and what happened the people
[18:06.200 --> 18:09.800]  who bought it sued him there was a class-action suit and he settled for 10
[18:09.800 --> 18:13.800]  million dollars because he was deceiving the public look you can't sell 50
[18:13.800 --> 18:17.720]  million copies of a book and if you're deceiving the public not get sued but
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.120]  but regardless it's not the government to be the arbiter it's the losses it's
[18:23.120 --> 18:27.640]  not the government to be the arbiter to say Kevin Trudeau because I don't get
[18:27.640 --> 18:31.520]  all the big hubbub I mean I've read several of your your your books on
[18:31.520 --> 18:34.440]  cures you're not supposed to know about things and this is stuff that I've
[18:34.440 --> 18:38.320]  already heard 50 times from I'm not pooping your book it's just that it's
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.200]  stuff I've already heard from new from medical doctors not new it based on it's
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.120]  like oh get vitamin D get sunshine oh my god this is so evil nothing in there
[18:46.120 --> 18:49.600]  that they never attacked the message because the message is in everybody else's
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.560]  book maybe I presented it in a better way you put it on well on TV and and put
[18:53.560 --> 18:56.440]  in a nice book people are reading it that's the point people are reading it
[18:56.440 --> 18:59.200]  reading it but what the one thing in my book that's different than the other
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.880]  ones why the attacks is I expose big pharma no no that's it you give people
[19:03.880 --> 19:07.120]  solutions but then you also expose the problem that's correct that's the
[19:07.120 --> 19:10.000]  difference and that's the difference because they told me if I take that out
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.600]  there'll be no problem because they don't want alternative media to be
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.920]  activist and instead of just getting in a fetal position to their attacks you
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.080]  stand up and find correct now they didn't attack me on the debt cures book and
[19:21.080 --> 19:24.160]  the free money where I exposed the corruption with the banking industry
[19:24.160 --> 19:29.120]  because that was already going on at the grassroots level anyway so when I
[19:29.120 --> 19:32.280]  started exposing the specific corruption in the banking industry and how the
[19:32.280 --> 19:35.400]  consumers are getting ripped off like look at your credit card statement you
[19:35.400 --> 19:37.680]  know before we used to have user re-interest in that's when they went
[19:37.680 --> 19:40.280]  crazy yeah and I said look at your credit card statement and look at you're
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.240]  getting you paying 35 percent annual percentage rate that's before the fees
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.680]  if you add the fees in some people are paying 400 500 percent interest rates
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.320]  that's when they went crazy stay there let's explain because that's when they
[19:53.320 --> 19:56.080]  really dropped the hammer was when a couple years ago you came out against
[19:56.080 --> 20:00.880]  the banks right before the collapse Kevin Gerdo is our guest stay with us this
[20:00.880 --> 20:04.400]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[20:04.400 --> 20:08.360]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[20:08.360 --> 20:12.640]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how

[20:21.280 --> 20:25.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[20:25.360 --> 20:29.880]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[20:29.880 --> 20:34.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[20:34.040 --> 20:38.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[23:58.840 --> 24:10.480]  x-caliber dehydrator Kevin Trudeau the evil one according to the mainstream
[24:10.480 --> 24:15.320]  media is here with us and bottom line he has his first amendment right and you
[24:15.320 --> 24:21.040]  were getting into the latest cell though you launched a few years ago before
[24:21.040 --> 24:26.000]  the big bus came and they didn't like that explaining the usury the scams the
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.160]  loan sharking that was going on tell us tell us about that information that you
[24:31.160 --> 24:34.720]  put out yeah I knew this particularly because I actually sat on the art I
[24:34.720 --> 24:37.520]  told you this last time when I called him from Germany off the coast of our
[24:37.520 --> 24:40.880]  betas when we started writing the direct mail pieces to get people to get
[24:40.880 --> 24:44.080]  credit cards and we knew what was happening we basically were given a
[24:44.080 --> 24:47.880]  license to steal so my friends and I we own some banks so we were involved in
[24:47.880 --> 24:52.240]  this right from the giddy up but the idea was we charge fees because fees
[24:52.240 --> 24:56.640]  don't are not interest and we could charge anything a monthly maintenance fee
[24:56.640 --> 25:03.720]  an activation fee account review fee an over limit free anything any fee name we
[25:03.720 --> 25:07.540]  could come up with we would charge you and this is how when you add up the
[25:07.540 --> 25:11.680]  fees plus the interest we plus we've got the Congress to allow on credit cards
[25:11.680 --> 25:18.480]  because of the potential default rate to allow us to charge overstate caps so
[25:18.480 --> 25:22.520]  before you had usury interest it used to be like 20.74 interest rate if you
[25:22.520 --> 25:27.080]  charge more than that you were a loan shark now we could charge 30 40% right
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.320]  on your right on your bill 40% annual percentage rate we could charge you that
[25:31.320 --> 25:36.280]  which is virtually enslaving people because if you're getting charged 30 or
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.480]  40% annual percentage rate forget the fees but if you just charge that you
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.440]  can't pay it off if you pay your minimum balance just do the mathematics it takes
[25:44.440 --> 25:49.960]  30 years to pay it off so if you have a $5,000 balance with the 40% annual
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.520]  percentage rate and the minimum monthlies it takes 35 years to pay it off
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.800]  you're an indentured slave and you pay back $180,000 when you're $5,000 so you
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.160]  wrote a book exposing that you went on TV exposing that right then I was of
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.120]  course a violently attacked and now with with the herpes cure that I'm
[26:06.120 --> 26:09.800]  releasing talk about a violent attack I mean this is and then when the weight
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.600]  loss cure you know there's four more drugs being a few approved for weight
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.280]  loss you don't need any of them I lost 45 pounds and 45 days I've kept it off
[26:18.280 --> 26:21.520]  for four years hundreds of thousands of people have used that cure that was
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.840]  developed by dr. Simians in 1959 that I exposed in that book the herpes you do
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.560]  look super healthy we're 47 thank you very much the herpes cure that came out
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.000]  and I haven't been sick in 25 years I haven't even taken an aspirin in 25
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.080]  years and I'm not a fanatic I drink coffee you know I I have cheeseburgers and
[26:38.080 --> 26:41.840]  french fries I'm not like a you know a tofu burger eating you know raw food
[26:41.840 --> 26:47.440]  or anything so these things are the reason why the attacks come they're not
[26:47.440 --> 26:52.280]  coming from customers who buy it they're coming from the government who who has
[26:52.280 --> 26:56.240]  no complaints but it just shows you the power of the media you know it as well
[26:56.240 --> 27:00.880]  as anybody actually you are the king in terms of opening people's eyes to the
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.520]  truth you connect with your audience you're well read you have the data you
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.120]  have the documentation people trust what you say because what you say is the
[27:09.120 --> 27:12.960]  truth and you are doing just an absolutely brilliant job of getting
[27:12.960 --> 27:18.000]  people to see that they are being slowly enslaved but Kevin it's not that
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  hard I mean here's a microcosm example and I know you're a master of
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.320]  understanding psychology so explained to myself and everybody else what is the
[27:25.320 --> 27:30.240]  tactic where they say there is no world government Alex Jones is crazy here's
[27:30.240 --> 27:34.320]  200 articles a day announcing world government saying it's good what is the
[27:34.320 --> 27:37.840]  psychological system there what's here what are they going for here's how it
[27:37.840 --> 27:41.800]  works number one as Hitler said a big lie repeated over and over becomes the
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.040]  truth that's number one so you have to get a big lie and you're repeated over
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.080]  and over but secondly it has to come from what's called a credible authoritative
[27:49.080 --> 27:52.840]  force if you look at government buildings you have to walk up these
[27:52.840 --> 27:58.240]  stairs to get to the government official the king it's a power everything is done
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.720]  to elicit power on the individual and then they're up on a big die that's
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.400]  correct now this is done very scientifically and I know this because
[28:05.400 --> 28:08.880]  we were involved in how to get somebody to say something with higher authority
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.480]  so that you believe it you know the amazing kreskin yes okay he's a friend
[28:12.480 --> 28:16.800]  of mine that's called suggestibility so there's a lot of ways without putting you
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.840]  in a hypnotic trance to just do something that is a suggestion where you
[28:21.840 --> 28:25.760]  would make the person believe it yes or no here's a perfect example you go to
[28:25.760 --> 28:28.640]  your MD and he gives you a blood pressure medication or he gives you a high
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.040]  high cholesterol medication and I asked people who've read my book why you
[28:32.040 --> 28:36.240]  taking your high high cholesterol medication because I'm following doctors
[28:36.240 --> 28:41.960]  orders I go excuse me I didn't know the doctor gave you orders I thought the
[28:41.960 --> 28:45.080]  doctor was somebody that you hired to give their opinion it's a priesthood
[28:45.080 --> 28:49.200]  correct so people are brainwashed and they go like they snap out of the trance
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.760]  they go wait a minute you're right he's not giving me orders and as you know it's
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.800]  even come out now in mainstream news that statins are frying people's livers and
[28:57.800 --> 28:59.960]  have nothing to do with cholesterol I explain that my book is one of the
[28:59.960 --> 29:02.640]  biggest money-making scams at the pharmaceutical company have you heard
[29:02.640 --> 29:05.160]  where the federal government and the Japanese government want to put statins
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.320]  in the water of course yes let's get them in there and they in the reason is
[29:09.320 --> 29:18.120]  not to help you it's to if you it's we have to make human beings more trainable
[29:18.120 --> 29:23.360]  and and easier to control so how do we do it we put we spray the air we put
[29:23.360 --> 29:27.160]  things in the water we get you to take drugs and then we use television with
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.680]  mind control techniques to numb you down and affect the dip it actually affects
[29:31.680 --> 29:35.560]  the dendrite size in the brain and the neurotransmitter activity which is why
[29:35.560 --> 29:39.480]  kids today are virtually drones they just do whatever they're told from the

[33:37.480 --> 33:41.240]  one the herpes cure it's a hundred dollar value that we sell them it's all
[33:41.240 --> 33:45.040]  free they just pay one shipping charge so if they go to naturalcures.com they
[33:45.040 --> 33:47.600]  can get all the books a hundred dollars worth of books for free just one
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.680]  shipping charge I want to know about this herpes cure I mean that's something
[33:52.680 --> 33:55.200]  that's probably going to sell well let me give you the readest digest on this
[33:55.200 --> 33:58.760]  real quick the herpes virus is in the body when you when you in it eighty
[33:58.760 --> 34:01.920]  percent of people have the herpes virus either general herpes, colesers or
[34:01.920 --> 34:04.480]  shingles well I've heard it's the same thing that's on your lips yeah it's a
[34:04.480 --> 34:07.720]  herpes it is there's like eight different strains of herpetic viruses but
[34:07.720 --> 34:11.480]  these viruses are very bad because they get into the central nervous system and
[34:11.480 --> 34:15.400]  they really bring you down emotionally they affect metabolism weight gain
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.000]  irritability all types of problems and they get worse over time so if you don't
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.400]  get rid of it which you can't unless you do something it stays so the drug
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.040]  companies love this because they say there is no cure for herpes and people
[34:28.040 --> 34:30.960]  take a drug every day for the rest of the life to kind of reduce the outbreaks
[34:30.960 --> 34:36.560]  but in New Zealand and there was a doctor in Africa who developed a cure
[34:36.560 --> 34:40.280]  for malaria they figured out a way to cure completely eradicate the herpes
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.160]  virus it takes about 30 days it's very inexpensive and in 30 days you never
[34:45.160 --> 34:50.680]  have a breakout ever again and about 90 days later your body is completely free
[34:50.680 --> 34:53.920]  of the virus you can go to a doctor get a blood test and they'll run the
[34:53.920 --> 34:58.840]  antibody test 90% of the people show negative for the herpes virus and that
[34:58.840 --> 35:04.360]  is biologically impossible according to medical doctors but it is absolutely a
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.160]  breakthrough and I came out with this I don't sell it I don't sell any vitamins
[35:08.160 --> 35:13.040]  other companies sell it it's not patented so I have a report called the
[35:13.040 --> 35:16.960]  herpes cure where I give people this is where you buy it it's inexpensive and it
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.520]  works and that's how I can make those claims now the guy who sells it doesn't
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.240]  say it's a herpes cure because he'd go to jail because in America the FDA which
[35:26.240 --> 35:32.160]  passes laws people don't know that the FDA passes laws not Congress there's a
[35:32.160 --> 35:36.800]  million laws in America the FDA passed a law they wrote their own law and it says
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.720]  only a drug can be used to treat prevent a cure disease which means if I say an
[35:41.720 --> 35:46.880]  orange cures scurvy I go to prison that's illegal in America and it
[35:46.880 --> 35:51.720]  absolutely does cure it we know it does and we know that food for centuries has
[35:51.720 --> 35:54.560]  been the cure for disease we know for centuries the reason people got sick
[35:54.560 --> 35:57.840]  because they were malnourished what was the cure for every disease when when the
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.080]  guy came in all he's very sick give him food it was always feed him because food
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.840]  provides nutrients which allow the body to heal itself garlic the people that the
[36:06.840 --> 36:10.440]  minority groups today more garlic than other groups in Europe they didn't die
[36:10.440 --> 36:13.440]  from the black plague everybody else did correct so we know food and
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.160]  nutritional deficiencies cause disease and I eating and getting the proper
[36:17.160 --> 36:20.640]  nutrition you can basically cure yourself a disease we know now that
[36:20.640 --> 36:26.080]  toxicity from primarily from drugs both non-prescription and prescription cause
[36:26.080 --> 36:30.440]  disease and we know the drug companies lie about the efficacy of their drugs
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.360]  and the safety we know this I reported on it now it's coming out drug companies
[36:35.360 --> 36:39.080]  write letters saying how wonderful the drug is they go to a professor at the
[36:39.080 --> 36:43.120]  medical school and say sign this letter as if it's coming from you will pay you
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.000]  million you know hundreds of thousands of dollars that's fraud it's fraud it's
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.520]  payoffs and bribes they pay researchers to make up false reports on research
[36:52.520 --> 36:57.560]  about the efficacy cough syrup last year for years you know take your
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.000]  robot tussin take your whatever for cough suppressant now we find out that
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.440]  cough syrup doesn't suppress a cough it doesn't even work and now we find out
[37:08.440 --> 37:13.000]  that the cough syrup increases asthma and allergies in kids the Centers for
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.600]  Disease Control came out five days ago and said the number of children getting
[37:16.600 --> 37:22.360]  allergies is rising at an alarming rate a pandemic rate or an epidemic rate
[37:22.360 --> 37:26.720]  because in America and we don't know why well we do know why nutritional
[37:26.720 --> 37:29.920]  deficiencies and genetically modified food and all the chemicals in the food
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.320]  we know why so all these things are happening and people need to know that
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.360]  there are simple solutions to to you they don't think they don't have to be
[37:38.360 --> 37:41.680]  overwhelmed but they don't want that the establishment doesn't want that because
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.600]  obviously the sicker we are it's simple two plus two equals four they can sell
[37:45.600 --> 37:49.080]  us more of their deadly drugs exactly then we get sicker even more drugs if
[37:49.080 --> 37:52.680]  you never notice when a disease comes out to the forefront and it's on the news
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.080]  oh there's a new disease restless leg syndrome or there's a new disease you
[37:57.080 --> 38:02.760]  know acid reflux disease when it comes out guess what at the same time isn't it
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.600]  interesting that there's a drug already approved on the market right that same
[38:06.600 --> 38:12.000]  simple this is the medical tyranny they get everyone on drugs put chemicals in
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.440]  the food and water the GMO everybody gets sick and then the society goes
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.880]  bankrupt the government takes over health care and now the government is the
[38:19.880 --> 38:24.160]  arbiter of life and death this is the ultimate priest class wanting people
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.960]  dependent and we have the government textbooks the government documents we've
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.920]  covered them at nauseam how they would use the medical tyranny to carry out
[38:30.920 --> 38:35.960]  this forced population reduction and so how can we have a government you know
[38:35.960 --> 38:40.520]  writing textbooks like eco science with a white house science are saying they
[38:40.520 --> 38:43.520]  want to kill us through the vaccines water and food and then now we're going
[38:43.520 --> 38:47.800]  to trust only the approved drugs and products that come down from the
[38:47.800 --> 38:51.320]  eugenicists that say they detest it's comical and here's a good thing you know
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.000]  this new health care bill that's going through congress that became a thousand
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.440]  pages now it's 2,000 pages if people actually read it one of the things that's
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.720]  in there which people are even discussing is if this is past what's going to
[39:01.720 --> 39:08.320]  occur alex is when you go to your doctor a you are going to be required to go to
[39:08.320 --> 39:12.240]  your md not your chiropractor not your homeopathic doctor not the doctor of
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.920]  your choice you're going to be required to go to the government approved doctor
[39:15.920 --> 39:19.400]  which is the md that's number one you're required and they're going to decide
[39:19.400 --> 39:22.960]  what test you get and here's the thing when that doctor says here's your
[39:22.960 --> 39:28.720]  cholesterol medication and you say no I don't want that guess what you don't have
[39:28.720 --> 39:34.120]  a choice you have to take the drug and you have to buy insurance and have 2.5
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.520]  to 5% depending on your tax bracket taken out of your check that's only the
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.800]  beginning correct it gets it's basically mandating from cradle to grave what
[39:43.800 --> 39:48.160]  goes in your body what drugs and what surgical procedures and this is perfect
[39:48.160 --> 39:52.640]  in terms of controlling the population it is perfect it's exactly what why do
[39:52.640 --> 39:55.880]  you think this is being rushed through it isn't to protect anybody or help
[39:55.880 --> 39:59.600]  anybody it's to make sure that everybody now gets in line all the sheep will get
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.560]  in line and they get their drugs get their vaccines get their shots and it
[40:03.560 --> 40:09.800]  reduces for example plastics in the in drugs plastic bpa plastics are being
[40:09.800 --> 40:14.800]  put in drugs specifically for no reason but now we find out oh by the way that
[40:14.800 --> 40:18.880]  Kevin to does not just saying this that was all over the news this week that they
[40:18.880 --> 40:22.960]  don't know why all these different drug makers are adding toxic plastic don't
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.800]  know why well he it's very simple because they also just discovered and it was
[40:26.800 --> 40:32.360]  reported that these plastics feminized men and let me give you the definition of
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.960]  feminized it basically takes the initiative or aggressive nature away
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.760]  from the man it makes him more fat higher-body percentage of fat but reduces
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.400]  his initiative he has no more aggressive nature what are you doing you're
[40:46.400 --> 40:51.880]  making sure that your men don't revolt it is specifically done to reduce the
[40:51.880 --> 40:56.240]  person demands ability to fight back well that's I mean I could list them all
[40:56.240 --> 41:00.520]  here but that's an eco science that's in the Japanese government what seven
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.880]  months ago proposed putting comative drugs in the water and they're openly
[41:05.880 --> 41:11.000]  now broaching this because they're already doing it exactly so when people
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.760]  start saying for example when they come to me and go oh you're the snake oil
[41:14.760 --> 41:19.440]  salesman here's the book natural cures it's 597 page and you're against people
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.000]  drinking fluoridated water so you're bad exactly now in your in Europe by the way
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.560]  they don't have fluoride in the water because the the European Court actually
[41:27.560 --> 41:33.360]  announced that fluoride in the water is a deadly poison how do the French eat more
[41:33.360 --> 41:38.600]  unhealthy food smoke cigarettes and and and stay thin and stay thin and live
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.640]  longer here's the reason why the meat over there for example the cows eat
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.800]  grass they don't eat genetically modified corn the dairy products come from
[41:46.800 --> 41:50.160]  cows that eat grass not genetically modified corn the cows over there are
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.200]  not injected with bovine growth hormone the food over there is not genetically
[41:54.200 --> 41:57.800]  modified if you have a cucumber or tomato it tastes like a cucumber or
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.680]  tomato in America virtually all of our food supply has been genetically
[42:01.680 --> 42:07.120]  modified and the cows and the dairy has bovine growth hormone and this
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.360]  genetically modification by Monsanto primarily in Cargill is designed to make
[42:11.360 --> 42:16.280]  people fat and make people slower mentally and what's the one country in
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.840]  Europe that has the same statistics that we do when all the other European
[42:20.840 --> 42:24.840]  countries don't front healthiness it's England England has adopted this and
[42:24.840 --> 42:29.360]  they've got the same growth curve in diabetes and in cancer and in obesity
[42:29.360 --> 42:32.720]  and in everything well this is why national health care or national health
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.240]  insurance in America won't work if you go to Sweden or Switzerland for example
[42:36.240 --> 42:40.840]  where every single person has a insurance plan that the government pays for so the
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.360]  taxpayers put in first off they don't have any homeless people they don't have
[42:44.360 --> 42:47.360]  any people that aren't paying taxes everybody's virtually employed over
[42:47.360 --> 42:50.320]  there and especially in that let's say Switzerland but the other thing is this
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.000]  the people there don't go to doctors they're not very sick so if you were to
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.960]  take the the people in America and throw them over into Switzerland the rates
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.240]  that those Swiss pay in terms of national health insurance would triple
[43:03.240 --> 43:08.200]  because the people are sicker so over there the people aren't that sick in
[43:08.200 --> 43:12.160]  America they're all sick the other reason is the drug costs and the surgical
[43:12.160 --> 43:15.520]  procedures in America the drug companies charge anywhere from five to ten times
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.280]  more than they do in Sweden or Norway or Switzerland so when you go to a
[43:19.280 --> 43:23.240]  national health insurance here it is absolutely going to bankrupt this
[43:23.240 --> 43:27.560]  country but not really what it's going to do is it's designed to do two things
[43:27.560 --> 43:32.840]  to number one get people on drugs non-stop and number two get there in
[43:32.840 --> 43:37.000]  premium so high that we virtually turned them into indention servants now
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.560]  every American citizen has to work just to pay for the insurance premium now
[43:41.560 --> 43:45.880]  again we have the government documents we have the white papers in the US and
[43:45.880 --> 43:49.600]  England going back to the 20s Bertrand Russell and others HD well so they were
[43:49.600 --> 43:53.000]  going to do all this we've allowed this scientific dictatorship this
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.160]  technocracy to come in to set this up and it's clearly engineered by design a
[43:59.160 --> 44:03.760]  lot of the world is waking up to this Americans are waking up to this you
[44:03.760 --> 44:06.160]  know they're trying to set examples of people like Kevin Trudeau shutting you
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.080]  down but you're now beating them it does seem that the worm is starting to turn
[44:11.080 --> 44:15.960]  looking forward into the future near future mid future long term how do you
[44:15.960 --> 44:21.400]  see this battle this this revolution of ideas playing itself out well this is
[44:21.400 --> 44:24.400]  very interesting because there are multiple tracks that the power elite
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.480]  would like to go on they don't really care which which track or how it even
[44:28.480 --> 44:31.640]  skips from track to track they want to get to this end result we know what the
[44:31.640 --> 44:35.640]  end result is but the but the really interesting thing in today is because we
[44:35.640 --> 44:40.440]  have the internet we have the power to influence people like never before in
[44:40.440 --> 44:44.760]  our history and people like you who are out there exposing what's going on and
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.600]  giving people facts and people are now opening their eyes a little by little
[44:48.600 --> 44:52.320]  by little people who've read my book natural cures you know every single day
[44:52.320 --> 44:56.040]  someone comes up to me I was on the plane coming in from LA the pilot came
[44:56.040 --> 45:00.160]  out and he gave me a hug and he said because of you I'm still flying I said
[45:00.160 --> 45:02.800]  what do you mean he says well I got your book natural cures he said I had
[45:02.800 --> 45:07.200]  arthritis and because my arthritis was so bad the mobility of my hands in pain
[45:07.200 --> 45:11.120]  I couldn't run the controls I was going to lose my pilot's license but I learned
[45:11.120 --> 45:14.560]  about system or a Stoliate which is what I talk about in the book for cure for
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.160]  arthritis or at our room tour arthritis cure I use both of them 60 days full
[45:20.160 --> 45:24.720]  mobility my my hands actually almost flattened out again not perfect but no
[45:24.720 --> 45:29.680]  pain full mobility I still can fly because of you so we're having a positive
[45:29.680 --> 45:35.520]  impact on people one by one by one and I think I think we can win this you know
[45:35.520 --> 45:41.880]  when when the government becomes so much such a tyranny and they apply such
[45:41.880 --> 45:47.800]  controlling power those who can see it now really see it and I think that's
[45:47.800 --> 45:52.240]  going to make a big difference I agree it's just that we're not just saying
[45:52.240 --> 45:55.960]  this I'm sure everybody's already seen it in the news the announcements are being
[45:55.960 --> 45:59.320]  made that oh we've got to shut down the web for your safety and oh there's going
[45:59.320 --> 46:02.480]  to be a new gatekeeping web we can only visit certain sites or the government's
[46:02.480 --> 46:08.120]  going to put messages over people's websites in your browser and oh the NSA
[46:08.120 --> 46:13.280]  has a patch for wind you know for the new windows oh the NSA is taking over the
[46:13.280 --> 46:17.280]  internet I mean they're openly putting up trial balloons to shut down the web but
[46:17.280 --> 46:22.280]  I think the cliche of the genie being out of the bottle or or or the horse
[46:22.280 --> 46:25.800]  already leaving the barn I think that really plays in here but the
[46:25.800 --> 46:28.800]  establishment isn't going to give up without a fight correct now when I got
[46:28.800 --> 46:32.960]  sued for example by the FTC I got sued twice for false and misleading
[46:32.960 --> 46:36.880]  advertising both cases they were they dropped the case and they've had a sign
[46:36.880 --> 46:41.320]  there's no finding of any wrongdoing on Mr. Trudeau's part that's never
[46:41.320 --> 46:45.840]  published okay but that's the fact never finding of wrongdoing I've been held in
[46:45.840 --> 46:50.160]  contempt twice which I'm very proud of because that the court the judge ordered
[46:50.160 --> 46:54.800]  me to lie about my books and I said no I won't so I continued to say the things
[46:54.800 --> 46:58.600]  that I knew were true and that's why I was found in contempt and again most
[46:58.600 --> 47:02.880]  recently a 37 million dollar fine and banned which I won but 37 million I
[47:02.880 --> 47:06.280]  said 20 yeah no 37 but now I'm back in court night now here's what the I was
[47:06.280 --> 47:09.800]  in court two days ago so now the government said since my I won my appeal
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.480]  they're asking the judge forget the 37 now they want 46 million they want a
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.720]  46 million dollar fine and they said we want you to take away mr. Trudeau this
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.520]  is what the words are take away his first amendment rights for life because
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.760]  he's too dangerous to the American public how can they go into a court the
[47:27.760 --> 47:30.400]  federal government and say take away his first amendment rights and you well
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.600]  that's one question secondarily you made the point about how the FDA just makes
[47:35.600 --> 47:39.280]  its own laws here's a microcosm example in California
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.200]  Schwarzenegger couldn't get the legislature to pass a law to ban over
[47:43.200 --> 47:47.600]  40 inch TVs he just ordered the regulatory energy agency to do it and
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.640]  they said we're gonna put taxes on all TVs and we're gonna ban a bunch of TVs
[47:51.640 --> 47:54.920]  and that's just and that was in the news yesterday Jonathan Emored wrote the
[47:54.920 --> 47:58.360]  book right I think it was rise of tyranny I'm not sure the name of the
[47:58.360 --> 48:02.720]  book but he's a great attorney and he talks about how the Congress allowed
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.480]  all the alphabet soup agencies to pass laws without congressional approval we
[48:07.480 --> 48:11.040]  have one million laws in America we have more laws per person than any other
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.640]  country in the world we have more people in jail than any other country in the
[48:13.640 --> 48:16.000]  world we have the highest percentage of people in jail we have the highest
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.200]  percentage of convicted felons I am one we are a nation now virtually the
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.000]  number one police state in the world did you know that over 10% of Texans have
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.240]  warrants out for their arrest right now it's it's it's and people need to wake
[48:30.240 --> 48:33.240]  up now what's the answer I think the answer is real simple the good news
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.800]  people say to me aren't you concerned that all these people have taken the
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.440]  vibe the the vaccine the the swine flu vaccine aren't you concerned I says no
[48:40.440 --> 48:43.680]  because I'm not getting it and if somebody wants to be an idiot and go
[48:43.680 --> 48:46.880]  there and take the vaccine you know I tell them take a double dose just to be
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.760]  safe you know if you're that much of a moron take a double dose seriously I
[48:51.760 --> 48:54.880]  mean I'm trying to tell you but if you're gonna do it anyway go ahead you
[48:54.880 --> 48:58.640]  want to jump off the off the bridge good you want me to help you I mean if you
[48:58.640 --> 49:03.320]  that much of an idiot what can we do the good news is you know your family's
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.040]  protected I know my family's protected my friends are protected and if all these
[49:08.040 --> 49:12.400]  other people start doing all these idiotic things it's their own they have
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.760]  nobody to blame except themselves they have to take responsibility well he's
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.600]  very articulate and focused and that's why the establishment doesn't like him
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.560]  and they want to set the precedent to censor everyone else but you also made
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.360]  the point that they want to scare everyone well it's that chilling effect
[49:28.360 --> 49:31.680]  and that's what they're doing with with me they're saying you don't talk about
[49:31.680 --> 49:35.240]  the North American Union you don't read Ban Ki-moon when he's in the New York
[49:35.240 --> 49:39.560]  Times calling for world government you don't discuss this and and it's a
[49:39.560 --> 49:43.640]  message to those that are awake shut up or we'll come after you so it's a dual
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.040]  message and to the dumb down it's further yes children correct this doesn't
[49:48.040 --> 49:52.640]  exist and it was happening for example Time Magazine will not run an ad for my
[49:52.640 --> 49:58.600]  book they will not run an ad USA Today will not run an ad for my book many
[49:58.600 --> 50:04.240]  television stations will not run ads for my books so how do we shut the guy up
[50:04.240 --> 50:08.360]  and here's the next scary thing the government now is going to banks visa and
[50:08.360 --> 50:12.360]  Mastercard particularly as well as American Express and you're saying stop
[50:12.360 --> 50:14.880]  the merchant account shut off the merchant account of that guy who's
[50:14.880 --> 50:18.760]  selling books there was one gentleman I'm not sure where he was I've read about
[50:18.760 --> 50:22.640]  about this and he was selling a book hey the book you and I disagree with a
[50:22.640 --> 50:26.440]  hundred percent it's a crazy book but the point is he has the right to write it
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.600]  and he has the right to sell it but if it's against the government the
[50:30.600 --> 50:35.360]  government now orders the the visa Mastercard merchant accounts to shut him
[50:35.360 --> 50:39.000]  off so now we can't sell it so he can put up a website but he can't take an
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.760]  order so it's real simple to shut the guy up just turn the volume off this is
[50:42.760 --> 50:48.760]  21st century 2.0 book burning it is a hundred percent book burning the you
[50:48.760 --> 50:52.640]  you attack the messenger your ruinous credibility which they've done to me in
[50:52.640 --> 50:56.320]  a huge way but the good news is people see through it the more that they attack
[50:56.320 --> 51:01.120]  me the stronger I've become having her dough stay there we'll be right back this

[54:58.360 --> 55:02.280]  to support those of us that are being censored I'm being censored in a lot of
[55:02.280 --> 55:06.360]  ways they're trying to bully us off stations a lot of dirty tricks and you
[55:06.360 --> 55:09.400]  know that's the real mark of somebody who's a trailblazer and doing important
[55:09.400 --> 55:13.840]  work speaking of trailblazing for over a decade you've been talking about gold
[55:13.840 --> 55:16.960]  you've been talking about the manipulation of the banking systems
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.200]  you've been talking about the private Federal Reserve that's now coming to a
[55:20.200 --> 55:23.960]  head and you've been talking to a lot of high-power billionaires and people about
[55:23.960 --> 55:27.720]  what they're doing and their investments Kevin why do we see gold going
[55:27.720 --> 55:31.440]  above one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars well you know is when it was
[55:31.440 --> 55:33.880]  down to six and seven hundred bucks we were both talking about it we'll go over
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.880]  a thousand and everybody you know was was laughing at us were cooks but I
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.080]  remember when when Kramer went on television and he said to buy Bear
[55:41.080 --> 55:45.200]  Stearns before that about a week before me and a couple buddies were on the phone
[55:45.200 --> 55:48.360]  and we were looking at Bear and layman and we said you know these are these are
[55:48.360 --> 55:52.600]  fact about thirty one forty to one these are these are going down so we
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.360]  shorted those companies in a massive way and then then Kramer went on to TV I
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.720]  think was seeing NBC and he said buy Bear Stearns well after he did that I got a
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.320]  phone call from my buddy in Switzerland he says this guy a moron or is he is he
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.800]  it means is he completely idiot or is he just lying a sucker rally two days
[56:10.800 --> 56:14.840]  later if they went bankrupt Bear went down and so did layman within a week
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.840]  after he Kramer said this now we had already shorted it so we we had made a
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.000]  huge fortune on that particular do actually went down more than we had
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.320]  even thought but gold I had two guys call me one from his estate in Dominican
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.160]  Republic and one from Europe and one guy bought eight billion dollars that's
[56:31.160 --> 56:34.120]  with a B worth of physical hard gold over the last eight months all the
[56:34.120 --> 56:37.080]  elites are grabbing yeah and the other guy bought five billion and I said you
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.240]  know that's a lot of your asset percentage of your assets in physical
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.680]  gold why and here's what their answer was they said look if the Chinese make a
[56:44.680 --> 56:51.200]  particular move we could lose 30% of our of our value here which is okay because
[56:51.200 --> 56:56.480]  we still have the hard asset but if we go someplace else and we invest in
[56:56.480 --> 57:01.520]  equities or the real estate market we could lose virtually 70% or all of it
[57:01.520 --> 57:05.840]  so they were looking at now as opposed to trying to build build wealth they're
[57:05.840 --> 57:08.520]  looking at a very protection mode so what's happening some of the biggest
[57:08.520 --> 57:12.480]  players around the world that I know of you know are taking their billions and
[57:12.480 --> 57:17.920]  they're moving it into particular situations to protect based on some of
[57:17.920 --> 57:21.000]  the things that could happen and by the way you were talking about this last
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.720]  year here it is socio-tell general one of the biggest banks in France tells
[57:24.720 --> 57:29.560]  clients how to prepare for potential global collapse and they say basically
[57:29.560 --> 57:35.120]  get gold I mean this is really starting to happen this is getting scary it is
[57:35.120 --> 57:40.080]  but you know the good news is I think right now we're in a situation where if
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.240]  people have their eyes open and know some of the things to basically do this
[57:44.240 --> 57:47.520]  over the next two to five years is going to be one of the best opportunities
[57:47.520 --> 57:51.200]  for wealth creation for the long term that we will ever see in our lifetime I
[57:51.200 --> 57:54.720]  think this is a brilliant thing people just need to be aware of it you know
[57:54.720 --> 57:58.920]  you've heard about the law of attraction it's really a misnomer you
[57:58.920 --> 58:02.920]  really need to create wealth or make wealth not attract it that's really a
[58:02.920 --> 58:06.600]  misnomer because the people that I know at the highest levels they make and they
[58:06.600 --> 58:11.280]  create as opposed to try to look at this quote this is out of the London
[58:11.280 --> 58:16.120]  Telegraph if so gold will go up up up and the only safe haven from fiat paper
[58:16.120 --> 58:21.520]  currency private debt is also crippling so they're saying the only thing to do
[58:21.520 --> 58:27.760]  here is gold because every other currency may go down yeah and the currency is in
[58:27.760 --> 58:30.760]  real estate markets gonna crash I think it's it's gonna stay at par for the
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.040]  next two years it could go down another 25% for sure especially the
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.680]  commercial market I have friends who have buildings you know worth billions of
[58:36.680 --> 58:39.560]  dollars we're gonna break for one minute let's come back in our final segment
[58:39.560 --> 58:46.720]  and talk about that thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN
[58:46.720 --> 58:53.120]  live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[58:53.120 --> 58:57.400]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.400 --> 59:01.520]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[59:01.520 --> 59:05.440]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[59:05.440 --> 59:09.080]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:09.080 --> 59:13.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[59:13.640 --> 59:17.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.680 --> 59:21.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.480 --> 59:25.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:25.080 --> 59:29.400]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.400 --> 59:32.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[59:32.520 --> 59:36.240]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[59:36.240 --> 59:41.800]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[59:41.800 --> 59:46.560]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[59:46.560 --> 59:58.280]  1-877-327-0365 waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[59:58.280 --> 1:00:10.960]  network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:19.040]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:25.800]  Austin Texas Alex Jones well we've got the evil Kevin Trudeau with us it got
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:28.840]  I got a burn his books got a banning from speaking you can't have his first
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:33.680]  amendment this is exciting though specifically well first let's finish up
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:37.160]  with real estate but then what does it mean that you've won your appeal against
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:40.940]  the feds I guess it just means back in court all it means is now it went
[1:00:40.940 --> 1:00:44.000]  from the appeals court went back to the lower court and now the the government
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.840]  said okay well they overturned the judgment because they said it was wrong
[1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:51.920]  so now the judge has to restructure another another judgment because I was
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:55.760]  found in contempt and because I did the evil thing my evil my evil thing as I
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:00.360]  said the weight loss cure was easy that's why I was charged 37 million
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:04.720]  dollars because it was easy but isn't that double jeopardy that you keep
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:08.520]  winning winning winning winning winning yeah there's a lot of legal
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:11.600]  things this is a contempt hearing it's not in front of a jury I asked the judge
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:15.280]  please charge me criminally I asked him to charge me criminally I gave him an
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:18.720]  offer says charge me criminally in front of a jury and if I'm found guilty I
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:23.480]  will give away my first amendment rights I said that's my offer charge me
[1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:28.560]  criminally put me in front of a jury the judge left I says I'm willing to give
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:32.560]  you a deal here your honor charge me criminally criminal contempt and put me
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:37.400]  in front of a real jury because you know that they are not gonna say easy first
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:40.000]  off I got a hundred thousand people that said the weight loss cure was easy
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.680]  that's number one but here's the best part the judge said I read the book the
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:47.640]  weight loss cure and I don't think it's easy at all I said excuse me your honor
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:50.600]  he's now the judge of everything that's correct I said you know jury I said you
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.520]  read my book which is protected by the first amendment and you don't like the
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:57.000]  way it was written he said well I don't think it's easy I said did you do the
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.440]  weight loss cure in the book no how do you know if it was easy I says it and
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.240]  even if you did it it's irrelevant I said it was easy there's a hundred thousand
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:08.360]  other people that said it was easy it's subjective it's my opinion is protected
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:12.120]  by the first amendment he said no I think everybody who bought that book was
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:17.120]  defrauded and therefore I'm finding you thirty seven million dollars he says
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:21.960]  you're dangerous to society but the government can't find plaintiffs they've
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:25.880]  got to come after you themselves they get exactly there's no people out there
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:29.360]  there's there were tens of thousands of letters written to the judge from people
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:35.160]  said you insane I did the diet it was easy I lost a pound a day I kept it off
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:38.280]  it's the best thing that ever happened thank God for Kevin Trudeau and his
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:43.560]  books and the judge said well those aren't going into the record but this
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:46.800]  just shows you it's not about me it just shows you that if well it's about
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:50.320]  everybody it can happen to me it can happen to the next guy you know when
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:53.120]  the Gestapo went in and took your neighbor you said well they must have
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:57.800]  done something wrong guess what you're next you're next and that's what's
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:01.200]  happening in America you heard about the the feds going to the guy's house who
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:05.680]  was complaining at a town hall meeting and he was on Fox News and he said last
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:08.480]  night goons from the federal government came to my house at two thirty in the
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:12.160]  morning threatened me in my no no that that happened here that just happened
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:15.320]  that's happening to everybody's and let me tell you up until now no one has been
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:19.440]  decided why is area 51 why was Roswell why are these people afraid to say
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:24.000]  anything because they get direct threats why was Ross Perot dropped out of the
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  race threatened to kill his family and he said it right on national television on
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.640]  Larry King I've had people come to my house in the middle of the night I have
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:35.440]  a little bit of an advantage number one I won't get into it now but I have a big
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:41.280]  advantage of why I can't be attacked in certain ways but I the attack that's
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:46.320]  against me is by using the media to demonize me and get people to stop
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:49.640]  doing business with me on a big and trying to get the public to stop by my
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:52.640]  book they're trying to run a blockade against you a siege correct yeah it's
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:56.080]  like sanctions on Iraq for 18 years correct and you know the good thing is
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.360]  I know that what I'm doing is good my books hey you may read the book you may
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:03.320]  not like the book you may not believe what I say in the book but the point is

[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:19.600]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:25.000]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.920]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:34.320]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:38.040]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:42.000]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.640]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:12.080]  since 1991 yeah when I first heard I don't know five six years ago escape from
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:16.040]  the prison plan and I was like then I went and found out what year it came out
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:18.680]  and I'm saying wow these guys are really on the same page I didn't come out with
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.640]  prison planet till 2002 so maybe that song influenced me somehow and the
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:29.640]  band's been around for 15 years and it's just awesome and he's with us and you
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:32.080]  know reading the lyrics listening to lyrics I thought these guys know all

[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:40.480]  get Neil Fallon of clutch on and we call him up to get him on and it turns out
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.880]  that they are certainly aware of our work and so it's just really exciting to

[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:02.960]  information what is that song about well you did the literal kind of Genesis of
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:08.680]  that song goes back to where we rehearse in Frederick Maryland and in Frederick
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:13.360]  Maryland it's where the four Dietrich army bases and they do a lot of chemical
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:18.600]  weapons research and and storage there and it's only a couple miles from where
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:24.440]  we work so it's you know it's a pretty heavy presence and coming back from
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:27.680]  practice and listening to the instrumental version of that song I passed
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:31.880]  the bass and I was going to the beer store and there's a lot of ham radio
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:36.000]  antennas that I think probably go back to like civil defense in the Cold War and
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:42.840]  that's where the chorus came from any time I write a song I always kind of
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:48.280]  have a back story that maybe won't be apparent in the lyrics themselves but I
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:56.040]  think a lot of lyrics kind of talk about maybe the individual feeling so
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:02.400]  somewhat helpless or or fed up with powers that seem to be out of his or her
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:08.080]  control absolutely I think this that's this song isn't an exception to that
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:15.880]  rule your political views I mean break those down for us because you know the
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:19.280]  lyrics are really powerful and and and I was pleasantly surprised to find out
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:22.240]  you guys occasionally listen to the show when you're out cruising around on the
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:28.320]  turbos yeah we um there was a pretty when we were just particularly when we were
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:34.280]  in the van excuse me Tim our guitar player would download the podcast and
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:41.120]  we would listen to it because you got plenty of time to kill so that was a
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:46.960]  good thing so um politically and I consider myself a moderate and I know
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:53.880]  in the US that's not a popular thing because it kind of implies that you
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:59.520]  can't make up your mind or you're intellectually lazy but I said the
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:06.680]  extremes to me whether it's extreme left or extreme right is just it's just an
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:11.600]  easy way to think and it's a lot harder to kind of sift through everything and
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:17.400]  create your own opinion now I totally agree with you I totally I mean I call
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:21.000]  that shattering a left-right paradigm that the whole left-right thing becomes
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.920]  the entire universe of debate instead of hey I'm not looking at this entire
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:29.600]  system that you've laid out in front of me I want something more is that what
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:36.840]  you're saying yeah yes I think so it's um it doesn't really matter to me who's
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:44.400]  in in in the Oval Office or who controls the Senate or the House it's you're
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.640]  given a binary system of thinking and it really it disturbs me to hear the
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:55.680]  rhetoric that's going on in the country today to you know you're you're a
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:01.400]  socialist or you're a capitalist is is dumbing it down so much that the the
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:08.820]  public the mob is turning on itself absolutely the popular the elite are
[1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:12.840]  laughing all the way at the bank because they're not getting looked at so I
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:20.080]  really I really you know the New World Order to me is a lot like food it gets
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:25.240]  its power from a belief in it and these people are just people they put their
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:31.320]  pants on one leg at a time just like you and me and I think sometimes the
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:39.280]  lyrics can reflect a paranoia but I think it's important to be able to turn
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:44.880]  paranoia on and off because when you become a slave to it then rational thought
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:50.560]  goes out the window well I agree with you that the controllers just like our
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:53.560]  last guest was talking about government buildings are these big imposing
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:57.440]  structures you've got to go up the steps they're built like castles against the
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.040]  people you know when they play hell to the chief they point their cannon at you
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:05.520]  it's all about they're the authority they're invincible they're gods but you
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:08.960]  actually look at a g20 meeting of these bankers they're a bunch of potbelly
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:13.480]  demons they're not invincible and if we discover that they're not invincible and
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:17.400]  come together as the people instead of being turned against each other if we
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.480]  come together as black white Hispanic old young you know and stop fighting with
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:26.120]  each other and start talking about liberty versus tyranny we're going to
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:34.600]  win this thing yeah I mean well I think it's it's so emotional it's it's it's
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:39.160]  easy to get caught up in it and I when I when I talk about it in this kind of
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:43.360]  context this conversation that we were having I try to divorce myself from the
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:49.280]  emotions as much as I can because once you start getting red in the face then
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:54.280]  then reasoning and rationality go out the window and as you know this subject is
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:58.960]  pretty nebulous if there's a lot of people with ulterior motives you know
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:03.840]  one minute you could be talking about something like for example the melting
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:07.640]  point of steel and then two to three sentences later that same person is
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:15.000]  trying to tell you that Nicole Kidman is a reptilian overlord it's it's it's a
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.480]  very it's a minefield there's a lot of disinformation there's a lot of just
[1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:23.760]  cooking us out there but in some times you want to throw your hands up and say
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:28.000]  God she's I'll put my head in the sand and move out to the desert but that's
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.800]  really not an option is well that's a heavy point to make because I try to
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:36.440]  stick to what I can prove and I've seen the mainline system when they do cover
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:43.480]  conspiracy issues on TV or radio they like to mix tuba cabras space aliens
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:47.360]  things that can't be proven but are interesting in with the private Federal
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:53.360]  Reserve and so it's easy to just like sports or like women or partying and the
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:57.800]  whole world's designed to make you not want to look into reality because the
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:17:02.080]  full spectrum of reality is a lot more confusing and wild and a minefield as
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:07.320]  you said then just the tiny spectrum of leave it to beaver and America is all
[1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:14.160]  fine and everything's dandy and nothing is ever easy nothing's simple it's
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:20.160]  always more complicated we live in a world where it let's go like going back
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:27.240]  to the idea of socialism capitalism those are European 19th century socio
[1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:33.360]  economic theories that I don't think in the way that we understand them are
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:39.880]  applicable today because the world is changing so quickly it you once you
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:45.880]  define something it's changed and it's kind of like figure like trying to
[1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:53.880]  grasp the water and it's you know going back to what I said it disturbs me to
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:18:01.400]  see people kind of cashing in on keeping people busy thinking that way and you
[1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:04.440]  know when you say tuba cabras and space aliens I always talk about that in
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:09.000]  songs because it's great material but you know these are characters of our
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.640]  our myth-making process as we live but at the same time I think there's a
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:19.920]  seriousness to it sarcasm and humor is a great weapon and bullies don't like to
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:26.760]  be made fun of so you know I don't see myself as an expert in any subject I
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:31.240]  just have a lot of questions and no answers sure and I mean we have David
[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:35.640]  icon and people because I believe David really believes what he's saying and we
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:38.400]  do have a little bit of that as well because we want to just get people
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:42.200]  thinking for themselves and realizing there's a bigger world out there that
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:45.920]  there's more happening than what you just see on television or what your
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:50.360]  neighbors are doing I mean we're on a planet hurtling through deep space and
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:56.880]  I think if people just rediscover the magic of life the wonderment that that
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:01.760]  they'll stop letting Madison Avenue make them feel empty so Madison Avenue can
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:08.080]  then dump in their false template of control this is true I mean I think it
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:13.600]  in rock and roll I mean no it's theater and I think that all the world is a
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:21.680]  stage it is an awesome analogy or or parable if you will that it's easy the
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:28.080]  easiest thing to do is to shock people it bands make a living doing that
[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:34.320]  sometimes the easiest thing to do is to scare people it's much harder to kind
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:40.720]  of engage people in an intellectual process and you know maybe that sounds
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:45.880]  been too academic but the world's not gonna end in 2012 I'll tell you that much
[1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:51.320]  I absolutely agree with you in fact I'm making a film about how the
[1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:56.760]  establishment is trying to well I'll explain when we get back we have of

[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:43.240]  ladies and gentlemen Neil we were talking during the break what has your
[1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:48.040]  evolution in awakening to the whole world government structure been like
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:52.160]  when did you first start to question the nature of reality we live in and you
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:54.600]  were telling me you went through a process of really being paranoid and
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:59.600]  freaked out but now that you're not explain that to us well I think growing
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:03.160]  up I live in Maryland but for all intents and purposes that you know it's
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:09.240]  that Washington DC suburb so it's in my face every day Air Force one I see it
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:13.560]  once a week Marine one flies over my house I see signs for the CIA the NSA
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:19.200]  they're building a huge complex out in College Park called avatar and it's I
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.560]  think it really got to me you know in my 20s and I felt you know we're screwed
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:28.160]  there's nothing we can do bringing you know bringing your hands kind of a
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:36.800]  chicken little psychology and then I don't know exactly if there's a kind of a
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:42.200]  threshold moment or an epiphany but there's I'm reading an awesome book
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:46.600]  right now called politics and the occult and it's by the guitar player or
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:51.520]  former guitar player Blondie Gary Lackman and it's this real fascinating
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:55.960]  look into the occult in politics and there's a quote at the top of the book
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:01.480]  that I think kind of explains that and it's nothing could be more dangerous for
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:05.320]  the human race than to believe that its affairs have fallen into the hands of
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:13.040]  supermen and then for me that is the realization that as powerful as someone
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:23.920]  may be the blood runs red and the breath stinks too and I think it's much
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:29.280]  healthier to live with that in in your mind than to think there's nothing you
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:37.560]  can do and we're damned that's a very dark place to go and I I'm not gonna live
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:42.560]  that way I'm not gonna have someone tell me that the world is gonna go up in
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:45.480]  flames on a certain certain date because first of all there's no way you
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:48.680]  could know that because you're telling your God because you can predict the
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:53.920]  future and if that's the case well fix it fix everyone's problems right now
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:59.720]  and you know if I know I'm kind of rambling but you're not you're not in
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:04.680]  fact you know we didn't do a pre-interview and it's funny that you
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.760]  brought up the exact same things that are in my mind and at my core and that's
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:13.320]  what I try to teach people is that we all have incredible individual power and
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:18.720]  I think instead of saying the world isn't run by supermen I think the answer
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:23.440]  is we are all supermen and women like Gandhi said the potential of the human
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.960]  species itself and the elite know that they have to teach us that we're
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:32.040]  powerless because we actually have so much power they're actually individuals
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:36.440]  who have realized how much power this species has and are scared that we will
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:42.560]  realize that potential and will actually contend for designing the reality we
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:49.680]  live in yeah I agree and I think they try to prop themselves up with things
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:55.520]  like bohemian grove to instill a sense of mystery because if it seems
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:01.000]  mysterious and and and spooky then people are gonna believe that you you're
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:06.400]  mysterious and spooky but you know Walter Cronkite's voice coming out of
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:11.280]  a big plastic owl to me is kind of kind of laughable
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:17.880]  um so I and like going back to what I said you know I'm the I'm no expert on
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:23.280]  any of this it's it's a huge topic with a lot of gray areas that there's a lot of
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:28.000]  raw materials for for songs and hey when you listen to a song you you have your
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.160]  own subjective input into it and I think that's that's the fun part I'd rather
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:39.160]  be a I'd rather cheer people on than than beat them down what about escape
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:45.400]  from the prison planet that song came out with 95 96 yeah that was um our
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:49.400]  self-titled record was sort of a big changing point for the band both
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:55.160]  musically and lyrically and I'd started reading a lot about you know that
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:29:01.680]  that point UFO community conspiracy theories and and whatnot so the list
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:04.880]  there's so the lyrics are almost like a list of things that I was reading I
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:09.760]  remember back then before for the internet was really the entity that it
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:14.280]  is now there was these books written by um his name is valvularian they call the
[1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:20.680]  matrix and they were kind of like a compendium of the most bizarre conspiracy
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:25.400]  theories and just esoteric thought and spent a lot of time in the in the back
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:28.400]  of the band pouring over those things and I think that kind of worked its way
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:33.040]  into the song there we're gonna come back with escape from the prison planet on
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:37.800]  the other side it's clutch frontman Neil Fallon stay with us we'll be right

[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:09.200]  centralized on that that's pro-rock.com all right we were talking again
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:12.440]  during the break that's some of the best radios our discussions behind the
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:16.760]  scenes getting into the the occult you talk about it being voodoo voodoo is
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:21.660]  just a big mind game a scam making the poor Haitians believe that you know
[1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:24.880]  the politicians can make them die if they don't do what they say just with
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:31.600]  you know some gunpowder thrown into fire and you were talking about a book that
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:36.720]  you've been reading about the occult in politics and this is an occult empire
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:43.840]  give us your take on that well I did if there's if there is magic in the world
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:49.440]  I think it's language you can you can hypnotize people with language and
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:55.080]  clutch we've never we're not a platinum band we're not a gold record band we've
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:59.600]  had some pretty big shows and there have been moments on stage where I really
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:04.920]  felt whether it's real or imagined that I had 10,000 people in the palm of my
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:12.000]  hand and it's it's the most powerful drug you can imagine and I can understand
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.640]  how people get addicted to that whether it be politicians or musicians and I
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:21.880]  think that whether it's you know I think maybe that explains why some
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:25.160]  musicians get addicted to drugs because they want to maintain that that high all
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:30.440]  the time the politicians never get offstage they're always on it and I
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:42.600]  think the occult for it draws its power from the power of the human mind and I
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:50.640]  think a lot of these politicians try to imbue or we have up here as if they are
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:58.200]  larger than life either in their own mind or for our own benefit or or not
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:01.960]  benefit if you want to look at that way with these things that are hard to
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:07.480]  understand but you go down to Washington DC and it's a pretty imposing
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:17.200]  place it's a it's their their temples to to mortal men basically but again I'm
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:20.320]  rambling and I forgot the initial I forgot you're no no we're talking
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.040]  about the occult that's a great answer I'm actually you're really impressed it's
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:29.160]  thought-provoking the different points you're bringing up what does concern you
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:33.400]  most about this new order structure you brought up during the break
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:42.840]  privatization what what scares me is if people it at the end of the day the
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:47.200]  government is ours everyone that's elected as a public servant they need to
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.280]  be reminded that over and over and over again they're like they're like dogs if
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:55.720]  you let them up on the couch if they're gonna keep coming up on the couch you
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:03.280]  gotta remind me we pay their wages but if we start being so scared of
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.400]  being out of control we said well maybe it's best that companies take care of
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:10.800]  everything you all you've really done is you played a a shell game it's a three
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:18.880]  card Monty what what really scares me is the privatization of prisons of police
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:24.160]  forces because then they don't have to answer to us because they're their own
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:30.400]  entity and that's capitalism gone awry what you think it's piracy what you
[1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:36.960]  think of the hard and Montana situation I want to I've been trying to find out
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:43.440]  what's what's happened since it's that story at least from my own you know kind
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:47.600]  of half-baked research has kind of gone under the radar and it's hard to find
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:52.360]  out what the repercussions were let me give you the skinny on that the state
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:57.200]  was so corrupt that when people begged them to investigate they did a kind of a
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.760]  half-baked investigation and backed out they admitted he was a 14-time felon and
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:07.480]  had 20-something aliases and the local constabulary just wanted him to come in
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:12.120]  and start arresting the town to put him in the private prison to make them money
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:17.480]  they also wanted it to be a Guantanamo Bay and he's still visiting the town now
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:22.200]  scamming new people and it's really an example of the Emperor has no clothes
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:26.960]  even though they know the Emperor's butt naked they don't want to admit they were
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:31.760]  wrong because the boss hogs in that town are so criminal they wanted somebody
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:38.960]  to come in and literally help them bleed the public so you're basically it's
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:47.800]  just a glorified thug with a with a lot of money but I don't it's it's it's
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:53.360]  frightening to me that that could get as far as it did and by the way the head
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:56.320]  of the two rivers authority said he would do it again and then it was a great
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:00.560]  thing that they haven't even gotten in trouble and they're still trying it today
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:05.960]  and no one will stop them because and no one will admit they were wrong and it
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:11.200]  just shows how wide open to corruption we are it's like we have no immune system
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:16.360]  against it well it it's almost like this that what was going on with the last
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:22.480]  administration some things are so over the top in your face shocking that you
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:26.680]  almost believed it like it that you could say something so contrary to the
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:31.080]  logic that well that it's so baffling well it must be true or must be okay
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:41.920]  that was a a big Cheney special the if we allow that to continue if we're if
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:47.160]  we're so afraid of our government that we decide that the answer is corporations
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:51.160]  then I think we're at ultimately just playing their game well what's happened
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:55.240]  is corporations have come in created big government so they can get corporate
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:58.800]  welfare and now they're just saying hey get rid of government all together we
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:03.640]  will be your government that's all a king is is some war warlord who takes over
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.720]  your area and puts a crown on his head so everybody like monkeys bows down to
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:13.840]  them it's it's amazingly circular that that's almost you've you've gone back
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:21.440]  to feudalism but it's digitized digitized feudalism the government's like a dog
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:24.800]  getting up on the couch that's getting up at a I'm gonna steal all of this Neil
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:35.800]  this is great stuff go for it man I think going back going back to what I was
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:39.240]  saying about capitalism socialism because I've come to work right now when
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:45.200]  I'm in Europe I can see the news from afar and see maybe how the rest of it
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:51.320]  that the world might or at least Western Europe perceive the US situation and I
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:41:01.080]  talked to people who are in much more socialized governments than our own to
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:09.560]  sell out to corporations is would be I think that is the idea I think that's
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:12.680]  that at the end of the day you turn government into a corporation you turn
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:15.600]  corporation into a government and they meet in the middle and then we're all
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:21.880]  screwed absolutely I want to go to Tim and Chris and Freddy and others
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:27.080]  specifically calls for the lead singer the front man the founder of clutch 1
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:34.760]  800 259 9231 Neil Fallon is our guest in the last 20 minutes we've got here but
[1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:40.560]  before I go to these calls tell us about your latest album anything else you'd
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:45.200]  like to import impart to all your fans or new fans that are out there things
[1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:49.240]  that you're up on a soapbox reaching a couple million people what does Neil
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:54.560]  Fallon think is most important I think what is most important is to appreciate
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:41:59.840]  what you have and and we all have only have so much time on this earth and
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:05.840]  you got it you got to do more good than harm and I play in a rock band there
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:10.560]  it's a blessing I love doing it I love playing rock roll everyone else in the
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:16.560]  band does it to life can be tough so sometimes you just want to escape for a
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:20.960]  little bit and listen to some tunes and whether it be on your CD or at a live
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:25.160]  show and for us at the end of the day it's about having a good time we're not
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:30.200]  trying to lecture anybody we don't have any agenda even though sometimes these
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:37.000]  things creep in it's it's about having a good time and try to keep it simple in
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.800]  a complicated world what do you think of people like Ron Paul and auditing the
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:48.080]  private Federal Reserve I'm about as dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:54.800]  like macroeconomics but I think this is the more transparent anything is it
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:43:01.760]  can't be bad if in especially when it comes to money and auditing the Federal
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:07.080]  Reserve well I'm sure there's some you got an army of accountants have to do
[1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:13.360]  that but why not what what would be the harm just finding out the truth it is a
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:16.520]  little suspicious that they're fighting so hard to keep that from happening but
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:19.880]  the autumn of the Fed has cleared its next hurdle looks like it's probably
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:25.960]  gonna happen which again shows the people we're fighting are not invincible
[1:43:25.960 --> 1:43:33.640]  no you know we paid like a we paid our wages and it's that invokes is what they
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:40.200]  live for and if enough people speak out for whatever you know they they believe
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:45.200]  in or are against they will eventually listen they they work for us at the end
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:51.160]  of that it's that simple Neil Fallon's our guest let's go to some of your phone
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:55.400]  calls let's go to Chris calling in from Germany first you're on the air with
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:01.160]  Neil Fallon go ahead hey what's going on Alex and thanks Neil for putting out
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:07.680]  your music grew love it got hooked our own since friends from Ohio got hooked
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:11.080]  on but I will be seeing your show tomorrow night in Frankfurt for sure
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:15.600]  oh are you in the shirt you're in the service out there no no no it used to
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:21.880]  be but now I'm here on my own what do you do in Germany um right now just
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:27.920]  actually working as those in logistics but we'll see how things go I'd like to
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:31.920]  stay in Germany seems like things are a little bit better here than the states
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:37.600]  but at the second hand feeling like leaving my brothers and sisters behind
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:41.520]  yeah that's pretty sad when Germany's better in the u.s. I'm not saying it's a
[1:44:41.520 --> 1:44:45.640]  bad country it's just sad for people to say man Germany's a lot better than the
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:51.160]  United States is for people that I'm exactly exactly it's pretty sad a lot
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:54.480]  of friends like well we're jealous that you're over there it seems like it
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:58.320]  things are getting ten times worse here well that's unfortunate do you have any
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:03.560]  questions or comments Chris for Neil Fallon well I'm fairly new a fan of
[1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:07.360]  clutch and if clutch is a big supporter now it's shown that I'm a big supporter
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:11.160]  of clutch well they certainly tune into the show some and we have some of the
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:14.680]  same view so it's good to have them thanks Chris Tim in New York Tim you're
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:20.640]  on the air go ahead hello Alex hey buddy yeah you're a big fan and I just said a
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.200]  quick couple things to say one is on clutch gonna be playing in the states
[1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:29.800]  here when he comes back and um and I just wanted to know what they think about
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:34.720]  a system of a down band of that nature do they are they aware of their message
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:40.400]  and things of that nature the short answer to your first big question is
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:45.360]  yes we got a short run around Christmas time in the Northeast we're playing in
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:49.440]  Sayerville New Jersey it's in North Jersey I don't know where you're in New
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:54.200]  York at the cross the plane and once they were playing in Buffalo as well and
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:59.120]  Boston and Washington DC and Charlotte North Carolina after that about too much
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:03.200]  touring in yeah we know a system of down good friends of ours we did a couple
[1:46:03.200 --> 1:46:09.360]  tours with those guys and we should we run into them every once in a while all
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:12.800]  right well thank you very much Alex keep up the good work and I hope to catch
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:17.960]  you in Buffalo now all right all right fantastic let's talk to Freddy in Vegas
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:23.400]  Freddy you're on the air with the lead singer of clutch go ahead hey Alex big
[1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:30.680]  fan just had a couple questions first off I just wanted to say thank you very
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:35.120]  much for everything you do before I started listening to some of your
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:42.120]  movies and your radio show I was just very very I just very very mixed up and
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:46.120]  I just I didn't really understand the society I lived in and a lot of things
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:49.480]  didn't make sense and I was always in a state of like you know what the hell's
[1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:53.520]  going on and once I started listening to you everything started making sense and
[1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:59.360]  I'm like wow this is like a big scam that's my main message is I don't claim to
[1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:03.200]  have all the answers but I know what we're being fed by mainline media and
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:07.600]  government is almost all spin and lies and the reality that we think we're
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:13.120]  living in is a fraud and I I actually don't like getting up in front of crowds
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:18.320]  I liked it a little bit maybe 14 years ago what I like is seeing other people
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:23.840]  fight tyranny other people grow other people learn that they are supermen you
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:28.960]  see that's my view I get off on unlocking minds because I'm actually not
[1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:33.200]  unlocking them I'm just showing people that there's a bigger universe around
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:42.600]  them what's your take on that statement Neil yes I mean if it's you can't do
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:45.120]  anything for somebody you kind of have to show them the way and they have to
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:48.720]  walk their own voyage and you have to go through the dark night of the soul
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:55.680]  sometimes to see the light of day and that's just life and you'll never stop
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:02.600]  learning they'll be good days and will be bad days but it that's the reward will
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.760]  be much better because if you just live your life you know in some kind of
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:11.960]  Norman Rockwell fantasy land well then well that's just kind of tragic well
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:17.280]  that's my bottom line is that I wasn't unhappy as a teenager in college but I
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:22.240]  something was missing and the something that was missing was that I was living
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.840]  this limited life in this limited spectrum and now I am so fulfilled it's
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:31.720]  almost like torture sometimes not being able to turn off the information not
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:35.400]  being able to turn off the understanding I mean sometimes I kind of
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:39.840]  wish I could go back in the matrix but then I remember how bad the matrix is
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:45.880]  but it's still it's very fulfilling almost too fulfilling Neil do you ever
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:52.360]  feel like that absolutely I mean I'm a bit of a news junkie and sometimes you
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:58.040]  kind of overload yourself and it's just too much for you to wrap your head around
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:04.080]  and you could get that I think the information age is a blessing and a
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:07.320]  curse it's a blessing because there's information and you can communicate
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:11.280]  across the world instantaneously just like we're doing now but at the same
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:15.720]  time it could be almost schizophrenic with this kind of collective consciousness
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:19.920]  it's like voices in your head sometimes but it's important just to take it you
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:24.400]  know one step at a time and try to be as rational reasonable and as focused as
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:28.480]  you can be and exactly exactly because you've got the people that are fully
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:32.280]  buying the mainline propaganda then you've got people kind of in the middle
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:36.040]  who are just questioning everything then you've got all the crazies who believe
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:41.400]  anything and everything and are kind of mean and and really just nasty I do see
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:46.400]  it's almost toxic like people woke up but then they fell into a black hole do
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:50.720]  you see where I'm going with that Neil it's yeah there's a lot of people that
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:54.680]  already have you know ulterior motives they already decided what their views
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:57.800]  are they're just going to use the information to cater and enforce their
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.160]  views they're going to only accept what props it up and they will deny anything
[1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:08.960]  that puts it into question for example Charles Manson already had his mind on
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:13.160]  murder when it you just took the justification of the Beatles song
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:18.920]  Helper Skelter to give him some kind of rationale in his in his peering about
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:24.480]  it and there's a lot of people that are suffering from the same thing well I've
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:28.160]  already decided this person or that groups to blame and I'm only gonna listen
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:32.560]  to that but you can't do that because at the end of the day you're just falling
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:38.840]  into another matrix absolutely people in the conspiracy world love to say it's
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:43.360]  this group or that group but only obsess on that and they're in another tonal
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:47.600]  vision system another rat hole of the matrix you could say man this is an
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:51.800]  amazing thought-provoking interview I knew it because his lyrics are so
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:57.320]  powerful he's Neil Fallon it's clutch ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back

[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:15.240]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and

[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:19.840]  I was just talking to Neil Fallon he says it's such a huge topic an hour goes
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:22.520]  by in just a few minutes it seems because you just scratched the surface
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:26.480]  but we're almost out of time we'll definitely have him back up and I was
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:29.200]  just talking to him we're gonna work on getting system of a down on in the next
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:33.080]  few months here we're really expanding the show mixing it up a bit not just
[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:38.000]  Alex Jones up here preaching I want to try to jam in a few calls but it seems
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.040]  like a lot of people are waking up Neil are you seeing that with other musicians
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:48.320]  you talked to yeah in the rock world this is this is a topic that's I think
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:53.800]  always been on the radar maybe starting out with punk rock and maybe it's the
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:59.080]  mind of you know kind of the artist is always looking for a deeper reality
[1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:02.720]  whether it be through painting or writing or music and because of that they
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:09.000]  maybe are inclined to look as they're a deeper reality of politics and the rock
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:15.320]  musicians I get virtually every one of them discusses this thing in one form or
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:18.880]  another and there's a there's many different opinions as there are musicians
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:24.520]  but um it's out there and you hear the music you just got to go go looking for
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:28.680]  you're not gonna hear it in top 40 music it's not gonna be something that you
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:33.200]  see in the Billboard charts but there is a lot of it out there if you start
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:37.240]  looking well not tuning our horn but you've volunteered in the break you said
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:40.880]  you'd be surprised how many musicians are aware of your show that you were
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:44.200]  saying some positive some negative I would actually love to have the
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:49.840]  musicians on the disagree with me um that's good you know it's important to
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.120]  have civil conversation and if someone disagrees with me I'm not gonna get
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:57.640]  upset and take that as an affront I think you probably feel the same way no
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:01.840]  no I find it more thought-provoking it's that's the only way you're gonna learn
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:06.920]  if you're always preaching to one's own choir it gets real boring and I've
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:11.960]  learned a lot from people that I thought I always disagreed with and I think
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:18.400]  convictions can sometimes be an excuse for the simple-minded that it's the more
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:21.880]  you learn sometimes unless you know you you're always my opinions always change
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:26.320]  with the things that I include in life touring the world is a great education
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:32.400]  and I'm not gonna stop learning until you know the day I kick it and I make no
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:36.360]  apologies for that let's take one or two more calls here with the lead singer

[1:57:05.380 --> 1:57:10.600]  air go ahead hey well I speaking of disagreeing I mean I want to disagree
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:15.440]  with something you said a little bit ago Alex you know you were talking about a
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:20.520]  green with Neil on his outlook whereas with your sponsors and your shows I
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:25.280]  mean we've been talking about that this thing that we know as society is is
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:29.400]  coming to some type of closure and to continue to say that we are going to win
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:33.400]  this thing yet come on the air with a red alert broadcast at times that you do
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:38.320]  freaking people out selling survival supplies and everything I mean you can't
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:42.720]  have it both ways okay listen listen I appreciate your call and that's a I mean
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:45.520]  I could debate that for hours with you in fact put him on hold and I'll talk to
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:48.200]  him when we come back before Bob Chapman comes on we're just got about a
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:52.920]  minute left here I'm saying we I really believe what I'm saying I mean I said
[1:57:52.920 --> 1:57:57.120]  better buy gold when it was 300 it's a thousand now I mean yeah of course we're
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:00.880]  funding our operation but I only do what I morally believe and I was talking to
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:04.960]  Neil during a break you must understand what he said I mean Neil in closing you
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:08.680]  were explaining there's a difference between being concerned and then coming
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:16.600]  in and acting concerned I mean is that the way you said it I understand I
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:22.280]  understand Scott's point and I think it's important to differentiate between
[1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:26.880]  pointing something out that's scary and then trying to scare people in order to
[1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:31.800]  sell something that the ladders are unacceptable absolutely the only thing
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:34.760]  we're trying to sell here is freedom and we need to get scared of the New
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:38.160]  World Order so we get up off our butts and fight it Neil let me say about here
[1:58:38.160 --> 1:58:41.960]  during the break we'll be right back next hour with Bob Chapman awesome radio

[1:59:53.200 --> 2:00:01.160]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:00:01.160 --> 2:00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:20.160]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.160 --> 2:00:26.720]  Alex Jones I think what a lot of people do is they look at things two
[2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:33.560]  dimensionally in a very simplistic way when I learned the federal government
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:38.600]  was preparing mashed raves and for martial law in January and we
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:44.280]  interviewed emergency managers from major towns around the country I said I
[2:00:44.280 --> 2:00:47.480]  don't know this is gonna be a real flu outbreak or a cover for something but
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:51.440]  they're deploying north com they're getting ready for this in January and I
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:56.680]  was on record and I am legitimately concerned I have storeable food I have
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:01.000]  a place to go in the countryside I lock my doors at night because I don't want
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:04.880]  my children to be killed if we ever get burglarized I put seat belts on my
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:08.720]  children because I don't want to flip the car if we have a wreck and have them
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:14.840]  die and so to sit here and say we don't have a world government forming or
[2:01:14.840 --> 2:01:18.560]  eco science written by the White House science are doesn't say they want to
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:25.600]  poison the water to sterilize us fear mongering is the government saying
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  al-Qaeda is going to kill you if you don't give your rights up and let us
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:37.840]  body scan you so it is a you know the difference is I am true at heart and
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:46.080]  what we talk about develops and has major gravitas and I'm here warning the
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:49.720]  alarm bell I mean if I was you know ringing a bell as an enemy was coming
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:53.200]  up to the gates it wouldn't be fear mongering if somebody breaks in my
[2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:57.080]  house and the alarm goes off and that's happened before I mean that that that
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:02.760]  alarm isn't fear mongering and you can take or leave what you want from this
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:10.360]  radio show but I am proud of what I do I mean I've done two hours actually haven't
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:13.120]  plugged any products and I should because that's how we fund our operation
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:17.800]  I'm proud of what we do I believe the Republic is falling being conquered by a
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:24.480]  foreign corporate takeover and I've busted my butt making a film and put it
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:27.240]  out on the internet for free I hope you look at the DVD to support us it's in
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:30.520]  higher quality or they get a prison planet dot TV membership we got five
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:34.080]  months free right now that's how I support what we're doing this is all
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:40.280]  very expensive so get the DVDs get the material and info wars calm I won't
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:45.840]  allow the Psyop to work on me that I'm not supposed to fund what we're doing
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:49.640]  we're not funded with your tax money or George Soros money we're funded by
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:55.440]  people support and just like the founding fathers were funded by the
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:03:00.880]  colonists support and so I will now go to Scott in California had to cut him
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:05.200]  off was the end of the hour and our guests had to go Scott I think you're
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:10.760]  simplifying the message when I come up here a few times a year and say red
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:18.440]  alert you know I got secret documents from upstate New York which later came
[2:03:18.440 --> 2:03:21.920]  out mainstream news that they were saying get ready for millions dead and I
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:25.600]  said I don't know what's going on with this but this is a red alert and then
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:32.840]  the flu hype did come months later we were right I mean I genuinely am worried
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:37.200]  about my family and we need to get people up off their butts to be concerned
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:41.160]  and to and to be upset I mean they're trying to pass government health care
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:44.920]  this week they're trying to pass cap and trade I mean world government's being
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:51.240]  announced what did I fear monger about what is it true go ahead Scott thank you
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.280]  tell me you got one minute tell me tell me man I'm I'm for real you don't have
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:04:01.480]  to let me tell you yeah I did not say that you were fear mongering I didn't
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:04.920]  use those words I think you've been telling the truth but I think that your
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:09.200]  message has been changing its shape the more success that you've been gaining
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:12.480]  and the more that you say that we can win this thing we're not going to win
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:16.680]  this thing until it completely comes down and so that's when we start over
[2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:19.920]  like microvaro says we need to be thinking about what we're doing beyond
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:23.720]  this government and the more it seems like you're trying to that that the
[2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:28.800]  info wars empire rises it becomes about self-preservation and now we can win
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:32.320]  this thing we're not going to win this thing right now people wait a minute
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:35.920]  wait a minute I'm gonna hold you over with Bob Chapman he's been on hold so we
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:43.240]  could go over this my empire it isn't rising monetarily where we were two
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:47.520]  and a half years ago three years ago now the empire is rising and reaching
[2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:53.480]  people which is actually scary for me and people have to be told we can win
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:59.080]  that's how you win wars is morale look I only tell what I believe is the truth
[2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:05.280]  am I perfect created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they

[2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:13.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:20.600]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:27.880]  alex jones 40 plus years ago but g edward griffin and others bob Chapman
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:33.520]  published books wrote books he's given thousands of speeches he's done tens of
[2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:36.660]  thousands radio interviews I know it's thousands a year it is three or four a
[2:08:36.660 --> 2:08:42.560]  day and we've been right about everything we've covered you can go back
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:46.880]  and read stuff Bob wrote 40 years ago and it was like a crystal ball looking
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:50.760]  into the future because we read globalist documents I told you they're
[2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:54.520]  gonna bring the health bill to a full debate they've been telling you for a
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:58.840]  month that they aren't now they are this Saturday two weeks from now they're
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:03.400]  scheduled to bring the greenhouse gas tax to a debate we may be able to beat
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:08.080]  it but we have to believe we can beat it and admit it's a threat now I
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:13.160]  misunderstood what Scott was saying and I don't exactly understand it I mean I
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:18.480]  really believe we can beat this and I believe I know the christian church is
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:22.280]  the last hundred years got taken over by the skull fill Bible it told them we'd
[2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:27.040]  all be raptured out no one had to fight evil render under Caesar and submit to
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:31.520]  government and so we can get past that mind control and get people to believe
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:35.520]  they have power I don't believe we're Superman I don't believe the elite are
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:40.680]  Superman but at the same time I believe that we all have amazing potential
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:45.560]  within us so I'm trying to teach people the elite aren't as powerful as you think
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:49.080]  and you're more powerful than you think and I just think we have a really
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:57.080]  positive message a lot of people build straw men and just constantly attribute
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:01.760]  things to me that I haven't done or said or distort what we're saying and it's
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:07.200]  not about Alex Jones I'm here going look mankind moon secretary general the UN
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:11.040]  is in the New York Times calling for global government and saying the the
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:15.160]  carbon tax will fund it look Al Gore's made a billion bucks off this he's a
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.720]  scammer and and and then so many people as I try to point out how popular the
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:26.200]  truth is I understand how societies operate now history works and I try to
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:30.960]  have actors and rock stars and and and people on who are waking up or have been
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:35.320]  awake for a long time to show you that we're really the majority and then it's
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:40.320]  like oh look Alex it has a movie star on or a former governor or a I mean I've
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:43.800]  studied history I know how to win against these people that's why they're
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:47.560]  saying I'm their number one enemy that's why they've got attack pieces going
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:52.320]  against me that's why we've got dirty tricks going on and somehow there's
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:57.560]  this Madison Avenue implanted envy in some of the I'm not saying Scott saying
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:03.160]  that with some people that there's this perception that it's fun for me to be the
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:06.440]  great Alex Jones and I hate to even say that but that's what the media is built
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:11.240]  that's what the public sees people think I'm like the elite they think I'm
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:15.440]  Superman they think I know everything and I'm tracking everyone know I know the
[2:11:15.440 --> 2:11:21.120]  general systems of the New World Order I know their formulae and I'm trying to
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:25.040]  teach people my perspective doesn't mean I have all the answers I try to have all
[2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:29.200]  the other experts who are true experts on who have track records of being right
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:34.280]  like Bob Chapman I mean we have economists on and we have congressmen on
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:40.040]  and we have artists on and we have just this huge spectrum of people who are
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:44.240]  standing up for goodness and I use my discernment for who I bring on the air
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:51.360]  and who I try to support and and and and it's just so frustrating to see that
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:56.280]  look a large portion of the internet now spends their time not fighting the
[2:11:56.280 --> 2:12:00.440]  fellow reserve looks like we're gonna get the audit start it's going through my
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:04.000]  god this is beautiful and instead it's like oh that's just a whitewash now
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:07.880]  we'll never defeat the Fed you audit the Fed it's the beginning of abolishing
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:13.800]  them I mean how can people not see that we're making headway Bob Chapman I
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:16.720]  appreciate you holding while I was ranting I'm gonna go back to Scott but
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:21.040]  you were on hold you heard Scott what did you extract from what he was saying
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:26.280]  and what's your message to everybody out there about is it bad for me to say
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:30.760]  we're starting to win we're starting to I mean it's the truth all I do my job's
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:35.360]  easy you know they say there's no mercury in the shots I go here's the insert it
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:39.200]  says it has mercury they say there's no world government I pull out a UN
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:42.800]  document where they say world government I mean I mean all I am is
[2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:48.440]  somebody trying to save my country I mean I I guess they can't believe that
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:53.240]  anyone legitimate and wholesome could actually be affecting change because they
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:58.160]  don't believe in themselves they don't know that they if they started 14 years
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:02.160]  ago doing what I'm doing they could have had a great effect to instead they
[2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:09.960]  sit there bitching and griping about me Bob what are you right and needless to
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:15.000]  say I put up with it for years but you know a very successful man once said to
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:19.160]  me when you're in first place everybody wants to knock you down and it's true
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:24.920]  it's it's envious this jealous jealousy and it's something that I never thought
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:32.120]  I'd ever run into but I have and and and sadly it's been about with people who
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:39.320]  I've known quite well and I I just can't figure man kind out here we are and we
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:47.840]  are making a big big inroad in what these people are doing with this passage
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:57.320]  coming up of 1207 and 604 is a money monumental achievement it's what many
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:04.120]  men and in myself have fought for for 50 years it's the beginning of the end of
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:09.360]  the control of the Illuminati and they know it and they're furious and that's
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:13.760]  of course why they attack you I don't have the visibility you have and so I
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:17.520]  don't get attacked as much although the government for doesn't like me very much
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:24.280]  but just to give you an example I was on the show yesterday and they have these
[2:14:24.280 --> 2:14:31.800]  rating systems by how many programs talk programs are on in an hour and and I
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:37.520]  was rated there was a rush and Hannity and and Laura and somebody else I was
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:43.920]  rated number five now that's out of 50 people and they come back and said who
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:51.200]  is this guy and be as it may the point is we are making inroads people are
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:55.440]  listening to us because we're telling the truth well Bob let me stop I mean I
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:02.360]  mean we should be a Bob Bob I agree we should be figuratively popping champagne
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:07.960]  running but we can't because the fight continues we're actually starting to to
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:13.680]  turn the corner here we can see the corner we're approaching it and we
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:17.520]  should be popping champagne running around the streets we've gone from no
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:23.440]  one knowing the feds private maybe 1% to almost 80% now in polls it looks like
[2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:27.680]  we're gonna get the audit of the Fed and suddenly there's this chorus bitching I
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:31.640]  think a lot of that is staged being put out and then other weak-minded people
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:36.240]  parrot it it's like we're supposed to lose we're supposed to never have any
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:41.760]  they have a loser defeatist attitudes I mean Bob are you not I mean I know you're
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:46.640]  excited you've been fighting for 40 plus years against these bastards you they've
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:50.000]  run you out of the United States you don't even live here anymore you've
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:54.080]  been fighting them and now we're having some success and everybody's mad about
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:59.600]  it well there are some people who are mad and again it's envy and jealousy and
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:03.800]  and what didn't you do it better or what didn't you use this method and you're
[2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:07.360]  always going to get it I don't I don't let it bother me anymore maybe it's
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:15.040]  because of my age you know my son is in daughter are your age and so my
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:20.160]  perspective is a little bit different in as much as I I have found that over the
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.160]  years that don't get excited be patient in any annual win and you just got to do
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:30.440]  the right things and Alex you're doing all the right things and so don't get
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:35.200]  upset about it well it's just Bob Bob you don't want to waste your time in
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:40.800]  these people that's my feeling Bob listen I agree with you I agree with you but
[2:16:40.800 --> 2:16:43.960]  we don't screen calls and I don't think Scott's a bad guy we'll go back to him
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:48.600]  in a moment give him one minute to counter respond I'm not mad for me I'm
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:54.040]  mad for him I mean I know a large portion of people a large minority of
[2:16:54.040 --> 2:16:59.160]  our awakening our movement just have spent too much time on negative message
[2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:04.160]  boards and they just I guess I'm somebody in life who got the best-looking
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:09.080]  girl in school over and over again I guess I'm somebody I'm not bragging who
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:13.080]  when the big 250 pound muscle guy attacked me I beat the hell out of them I
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:17.280]  guess I'm the guy who who who went down and beat bills at this Texas
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:21.760]  legislature I guess I have succeeded in life you've succeeded in life and some
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:26.320]  of these people just can't get it they just cannot understand that they could
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:32.280]  succeed if they decided to succeed Bob and that's true because most of them
[2:17:32.280 --> 2:17:36.640]  have the equipment all they have to do is discipline themselves and set their
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:41.720]  goals and go ahead and get them but you got to stay with it well I apologize for
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:44.160]  averting for the rest of the hour I want to get into the economy and your
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:47.640]  expertise and how glorious this is that it looks like we're able to audit the
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:51.800]  Fed and even if it doesn't succeed though it looks like it will next time it
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:57.640]  will we're fighting we're engaging we're resisting resistance is victory but
[2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:04.400]  Scott in California go ahead you can have the final say on this thank you well
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:08.560]  with just a minute going back to what you guys said let me use the Fed
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:14.200]  specifically the last major election we have the presidential election Bush's
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:19.360]  numbers Congress's numbers were in the tank and yet oh we thought for sure that
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:22.640]  that the house was going to be cleaned and everything because people had had it
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:27.520]  they wanted something new yet all the incumbents got back in and it's the same
[2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:32.120]  old people and so we've been talking about that this system is a mess and
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:37.000]  that things are going down this audit the Fed bill if this is not going to
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:42.280]  happen it's it that if you if it goes down look for it's a major false flag
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:47.080]  warning and so the system is controlled by the same old people and they didn't
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:52.400]  just have a road to Damascus moment they the masses are yes they are waking up
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:57.040]  Alex and Bob but they're saying how did we get here and that's how they're
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.800]  stumbling upon you guys but the fact of the matter is is that the system is
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:04.160]  still controlled by the same player listen I appreciate your call look you
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:10.120]  look it's a process Rome wasn't built in the day we're not gonna beat this in a
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:16.600]  day and so you're not understanding what we're saying the Fed is fighting this
[2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:20.760]  audit with everything they've got they tried to strip it this is not a staged
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:26.000]  event is it Bob we have crossed the Rubicon and they better get on guard
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:32.120]  hell yeah man this excuse me I'm gonna we're in a war here folks and just because
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:36.200]  I'm manning a howitzer blasting enemy tanks don't come up and gripe at me
[2:19:36.200 --> 2:19:41.880]  because I got grease all over my face I mean I just I don't understand it look
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:46.400]  people you got power we can cause a revolution of understanding and
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:50.920]  awakening we're standing on people's shoulders like Bob Chapman but you've
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:56.320]  got to understand that to dream is destiny to take action is destiny and
[2:19:56.320 --> 2:20:03.520]  that resistance is victory of the 3 million plus edible food plants that

[2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:09.000]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:16.080]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I'm not gonna
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:19.960]  disrespect Bob anymore taking up time on this other subject because I want to get
[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:23.000]  into all the important news and information he has for us in the
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:28.760]  balance of this hour but understand it's an illusion that the elite have all
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:33.840]  this power just like our guest last hour was saying that's the key and so many
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:37.560]  people in government are serving them because they believe it's an invincible
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:42.640]  so they rationalize serving it and go along with it when we point out that we
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:47.080]  are waking people up at record levels exponentially I mean the growth curves
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:51.520]  like that took 30 40 years to get to here now in a couple years we're going
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:57.240]  straight up we have to realize it's a bunch of Bernard made off Ken lay types
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:25:01.800]  running this and they're slick but they're not invincible and we have to
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:07.200]  have a positive attitude I mean I know a lot of the conspiracy mongering is
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:11.200]  overboard because so much of it is directed at me and it's all made up
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:15.280]  people can't believe that I'm legitimate and real that this could be
[2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:19.240]  happening it's happening because there are good listeners out there taking
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:24.320]  action you are the power Bob Chapman any final comments on this and I want to
[2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:27.760]  get into what's happening to the dollar what's happening to gold and anything
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:33.320]  else you think is most important dollar gold the future of our economy in the
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:42.440]  world a lot is going on what are you most concerned about right now I think
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:49.800]  it's the continuum of manipulation in the markets and we're seeing the
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:55.160]  tremendous amount of money that's flowed to major banks and brokerage houses
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:25:59.520]  insurance companies not only in the United States but worldwide and they use
[2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:07.440]  part of this money and some instances perhaps a majority of it to execute in
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:12.520]  the market what the head wants them to do or the Treasury and then of course comes
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:16.360]  through the working group and financial markets you use them instantly
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:21.920]  you have a strictly known as the plunge protection team and I think that we no
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:25.440]  longer have a free market not only in America but throughout the world is
[2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:29.840]  something that we've got to change we've got to stop the revolving door from
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:35.360]  Wall Street and the banking industry and insurance into Washington and how are
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:40.480]  going to do that I don't know quite as yet and I don't know that we will ever
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:44.560]  completely be able to stop what they're doing but we're sure going to give them
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:49.840]  a bad time and you know it comes full circle of what to what we were talking
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:55.400]  about early in the program and that is look you know what else you got to do
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:59.240]  lay down and die no we're going to fight them because what they're doing is
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:03.800]  wrong they're stealing from everybody and so to come back we got to stop the
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:09.320]  manipulation we got to make people understand that the stock market is
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:16.640]  selling at four times what it should be and that's a result of that money that
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:21.920]  the Fed creates out of thin air it's called monetization and that money
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:27.600]  goes into the system and the Fed gets on the phone every morning at 7 30 has a
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:33.320]  conference call with the 21 dealers and says okay JP Morgan Chase you're going
[2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:37.120]  to make the financials go up today and you over there at Goldman Sachs are
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:41.320]  going to short the gold stocks and you over there at Citigroup you're going
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:45.920]  to do this that the other thing and it actually goes on I mean this happens
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:51.160]  what did you think what did you think of the now four-part series of McClatchy
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:55.680]  newspapers it's as if you wrote it explaining how Goldman Sachs engineered
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:59.880]  the collapse told people by housing when they were betting against it to destroy
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:04.960]  Bear Stearns that you said was an inside job now that's coming out I mean that is
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:10.920]  incredible well you know when you've been there for years you you understand the
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:18.920]  mindset and there are people who don't care how they make money and they want
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:23.520]  to accumulate as much as possible because it's their way of keeping score
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:28.240]  they don't care that much about the money it's a power and agendas and they
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:32.560]  can beat on their chest like a baboon or or any other human they're hyper
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:37.000]  competitive they're hyper competitive they are and that's not bad but the point
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:41.720]  is they they rather wreck the whole system and be sitting on top of pile of
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:48.120]  rubble than be part of a beautiful utopia yes and and of course every one of
[2:28:48.120 --> 2:28:52.960]  them that makes these kind of decisions that's been very successful they get
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:58.120]  sucked into the venue or perhaps very voluntarily go into the venue of World
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:02.440]  Government and that's the bottom line with this whole group I mean you can see
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:07.760]  it on CNBC I I've actually I saw an argument this this morning between Steve
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:13.680]  Leesman and and and Joe and Steve's isn't you know he can't do that and Joe
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:19.480]  being the apparent very liberal person says well you can and I you know they're
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:23.360]  even going after each other now because they're very frustrated they got the
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:27.280]  market up this far and they should be very very happy about it and they're not
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:32.520]  what the reason is I don't know and I don't care all I stay there Bob stay

[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:26.880]  tomorrow the new one's coming out so be sure to do that with our guest Bob
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:30.080]  Chapman okay Bob I'm gonna try to sit back and shut up now because I have a
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:35.280]  lot of questions for you get into where you see the economy going the real 20
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:41.360]  percent unemployment where Obama's going the health care bill all of it Bob
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:48.260]  Chapman. Well first of all the economy if they do not have a stimulus package
[2:36:48.260 --> 2:36:54.320]  additional next year and the banks don't loosen up making loans and 90% of
[2:36:54.320 --> 2:36:58.920]  their loans go to small and medium-sized businesses and those loans have dropped
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:05.580]  16.2% year-on-year if they do not have stimulus and they've they don't have
[2:37:05.580 --> 2:37:12.840]  increase in loans to the tune of about 1.4 trillion 1.6 trillion somewhere in
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:18.640]  there then the economy is going to start to swoon again and that means that the
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:25.200]  Fed will be the last bastion of trying to keep the undertow of deflation under
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.680]  control by creating money and credit and they'll always over create and you
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:34.560]  can't blame them for that because they want it to be successful and so
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:41.680]  consequently number one with no stimulus we will probably see unemployment
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:48.080]  grow next year to 24 25 percent from 22.2 percent and John Williams has it at
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:55.280]  22.1 percent so we're on the same page on that and that will extend further out
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:38:00.960]  into the following year which will be 2011 and it'll get worse and I would
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:06.080]  imagine without the stimulus and would all increase lending that we'd be going
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:16.240]  to 25 then to 30 to 35 percent and if they do have the stimulus and that will
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:23.040]  allow unemployment to stay somewhere between 22 and 23 percent and that'll
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:28.200]  last about another year so we'll say a year from June the effects of that will
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:32.280]  help but what they're faced with and of course that would include the increase
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:36.800]  in loans as well but what we're faced with here is it's not solving the
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:42.400]  problem and the problem is we've got to get rid of the dead wood we got to get
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:49.720]  rid of all of the bankrupt banks and insurance companies and brokerage firms
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:56.280]  and other corporate entity entities they have to be allowed to fail under our
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:02.360]  system all of this will continue to put pressure in the dollar I think before the
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:08.920]  end of the year the dollar will on the USDX test 71 18 or somewhere between 71
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:16.640]  72 it'll rally back to 76 or 78 go back down and test again and break because
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:21.160]  they have no intention of saving the dollar they stand up there and say we
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:26.480]  want a strong dollar they don't mean that they want the dollar week because it
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:32.440]  makes them more competitive and it'll give them maybe one half of 1% or 1% of
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:37.400]  increased GDP by having the dollar at a lower level and they now reverse the
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:42.440]  carry trade but you just dropped that bombshell you're saying from the way I
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:46.640]  heard it sometime next year they're gonna let the dollar completely slide
[2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:57.960]  how low well on the USDX which is 75 50 approximately right now down from 89.5
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:05.200]  not too long ago beginning of May I think that during the second quarter of
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:15.200]  next year that the dollar will break down and first at 65 60 55 50 and it
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:20.440]  could go to 40 and so about a 50% retraction from where we are now in the
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:26.120]  value and purchasing power of the dollar and of course in the meantime they're
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:31.760]  gonna they're gonna be planning to have another Smithsonian type meeting like the
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:36.720]  plaza recording 85 the Louvre recording 87 and what that means is all the
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:40.520]  countries are gonna get together and they're gonna revalue and devalue all
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:44.600]  the currencies against it one another and they're also between countries gonna
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:48.360]  write off two-thirds of the debt just like they did in the experiment in
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:55.720]  Argentina in 1999 2000 okay let's explain what that will do to Main Street and to
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:41:02.640]  real estate starting with let's say somebody's got a $500,000 house
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:07.880]  inflation would actually be good for them paying it off except that we're
[2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:15.440]  gonna have a depression in Main Street so you've got rising prices but it's
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:20.080]  harder to actually make the money will the federal government try to go in may
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:26.000]  wave a magic wand and when you have a devaluation of the currency then boost
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:32.600]  the price of the loans on the houses so we'll sell a $500,000 house note now go
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:38.080]  to a million or I mean how is that gonna work well I don't think anybody knows
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:47.240]  outside of the insiders and what my guess is logically if the dollar is
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:52.040]  devalued three old ones for one new one and I and I think that's a good
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:57.280]  perspective I think it could be close to that then one would assume that a
[2:41:57.280 --> 2:42:00.440]  hundred thousand dollar mortgage will become a thirty three thousand dollar
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:03.800]  mortgage the man is making a hundred thousand you would start making thirty
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:07.320]  three thousand a year the people who have retirement and social security
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:11.240]  instead of getting a thousand dollars a month they get three hundred thirty
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:16.480]  dollars a month that would be logic but if these people behind the scenes want
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:20.960]  to bust everybody they would keep it up the other level and everybody would be
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:24.760]  broke and then they have everybody running around with pitchforks only
[2:42:24.760 --> 2:42:30.200]  tonight to nowadays we have better weapons than pitchforks but that's
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:35.560]  that's the the logical sequence of event the way it should happen. Well here's
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:40.480]  the problem we had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on a few days ago and he's gone
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.040]  from saying I don't know if we're gonna have dollar death and a depression too
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:50.080]  yes we're going to have it the question is is it a year from now or five years
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:56.760]  from now and he said it's going to be road warrior he said it's going to be
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:43:03.840]  what Gerald Salenty is saying he's saying under the current course the
[2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:07.720]  establishments under and he said there's almost no way to get off of that even if
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:14.960]  they tried that it will be middle ages like that's pretty scary coming from
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:20.040]  somebody listed as one of the top seven economists in the world by Forbes. Well
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:25.840]  I've been writing about it since 1968 and in that particular venue and so has
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:31.000]  Ned Griffin and so didn't Gary Allen and so didn't Alan Stang and with the
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:36.760]  films and records done by Anthony Hilder and so to us it's nothing new but to
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:43.000]  everybody else it is and yes that distinct possibility exists and that's why
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:46.480]  when people ask what do I do you go out and get dehydrated and freeze-dried
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:51.240]  foods you get a filter and you find something that you can use to defend
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:55.760]  your family because it could get that nasty and if you got money left over you
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:59.360]  go out and buy gold and silver coins and if you get lots more money you buy
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:04.920]  gold and silver stocks and that's it that's the only defense that you have to
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:09.240]  try to help yourself okay well let's navigate other people and hopefully
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:13.600]  they'll come along too but don't expect more than one out of a hundred to
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:19.840]  listen. Well earlier in the show I read a London telegraph headline here on air
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:25.320]  saying that the big French bank is basically telling their investors
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:33.160]  prepare for total absolute economic collapse and so we've gone from will
[2:44:33.160 --> 2:44:38.520]  the dollar die to when is it going to die and we've gone from there could be a
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:43.960]  total collapse to when is the total collapse coming is there any way to
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:48.120]  navigate out of this and what do you think the establishment is planning to
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:55.120]  do? Well I think we get a 1207 pass we immediately start the audit of the Fed
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:00.880]  we immediately see within five or six months what the Fed has been doing since
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:06.840]  1913 which is looting the American public and enriching themselves with not
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:10.560]  only money with power and we get rid of them and if we get accomplished that
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:14.640]  within a year or year and a half then we would be able to go to the people and
[2:45:14.640 --> 2:45:18.600]  say look this is what the problem is these are the guys that did it this is
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:21.880]  why they did it and this is why we're not going to put up with it anymore and
[2:45:21.880 --> 2:45:25.320]  so this is what we're going to do we're going to purge the system of all the
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:29.160]  losers and we're going to have a depression it'll probably last three to
[2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:33.120]  five years it's going to be miserable and we're going to do our best we can
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:37.600]  that we can to help everybody but we've got to live through this and
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:42.160]  there's no other way and once it's cleared away we'll be able to create a
[2:45:42.160 --> 2:45:47.340]  new and hopefully more vibrant America and that's the only real chance that we
[2:45:47.340 --> 2:45:52.320]  have and that's why this legislation was so important it's the most important
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:58.040]  legislation perhaps in the last hundred years. Absolutely because it identifies
[2:45:58.040 --> 2:46:05.440]  the real the real problem but and the culprits the culprits so we can remove
[2:46:05.440 --> 2:46:09.600]  the cancer that's already eaten us up but if we don't go in and have this
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:14.720]  emergency surgery we know it's over if they stay in power if they're not brought
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:19.280]  to justice if they're able to carry this forced vertical integration this
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:24.360]  looting through what will things look like and when do you think it's going to
[2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:30.520]  start descending into total bedlam? Well the devaluation of the dollar which is
[2:46:30.520 --> 2:46:36.080]  probably a year and a half away will be step number one I would expect at that
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:41.880]  time or shortly thereafter the the injection of money and credit
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:47.320]  monetization the effect of that would start to wane and we would have
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:52.320]  inflation perhaps a 30 or 50 percent maybe a lot more I try to be conservative
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:58.200]  because when you sometimes state facts that could the things that could be
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:02.840]  facts people don't want to believe you because it sounds so outrageous well I'm
[2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:08.560]  living in an outrageous world for a long time but anyway that would be the
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:13.240]  catalyst the beginning of the depression so to speak and then you know we we
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:18.560]  spend a tremendous amount of money on our military forces overseas and all of
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:22.360]  these things that they've got us involved in that would cease because the
[2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:26.680]  money wouldn't be there to do that anymore and then these people would be
[2:47:26.680 --> 2:47:31.720]  coming home adding you know four or five million people to the workforce and at
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:36.480]  that time we'd probably have 50 or 60 million unemployed and that's not going
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:42.760]  to help but there's not much we can do about that I mean we got it we have to
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:49.520]  deal with the cards that we've been dealt and you know it's so true my nephew's
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:55.480]  just retired as the assistant chief of police in a large city in America and he
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:48:00.360]  always said to me look you know you deal with what you've got you fight back
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:04.680]  with what you have and that's all you can do as a human being and he's right
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:10.720]  and so that's what we have to do as a people and we are a people where we're
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:15.920]  different than everybody else we come from a warrior caste people who came
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:19.680]  from all over Europe and then they came from Asia and then they came from
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:25.000]  Central and South America because they wanted better jobs and more freedom and
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:29.760]  for some time they had that but we have to deal with our problems that we've
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:34.600]  got that have been created by the people who call themselves our masters well
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:38.680]  they're not our masters and they're certainly not mine well Bob I want to go
[2:48:38.680 --> 2:48:42.720]  back to I want to go back to the positive things we see that are happening
[2:48:42.720 --> 2:48:48.040]  two years ago they were worshipful of Fed chairman worshipful of Treasury heads
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:54.240]  worshipful of Goldman Sachs heads now Republicans and Democrats genuinely
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:58.920]  treat them with contempt call them crooks call them criminals Rush Limbaugh is
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:02.440]  calling Al Gore a New World Order criminal actually have the transcript now
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:08.920]  but we need to play that next hour the audio of that and saying Al Gore is a
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:14.200]  criminal so the bankers I have the transcript so the bankers can take over
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:19.000]  our economy I mean whether whether Rush Limbaugh is good or bad he's now
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:24.400]  being forced to actually come out and tell the truth or he will lose all
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:31.320]  credibility and you know won't even be in the game anymore I mean we we really
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:35.760]  because you and others planted the seeds decades ago of truth weak we caused
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:42.040]  that absolutely we caused it and I think it's wonderful and I want them on at
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:45.640]  our side and I want them telling the truth because I want to get this thing
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:49.280]  over with before I kick the bucket
[2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:55.080]  well you're absolutely right Bob I mean we really are affecting change and
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:49:58.600]  we're in the battle and I guess we've just got to be here and explain the
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:02.720]  bankers of the criminals they've got to be brought to justice whatever solutions
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:07.240]  they give us are just more power for them and as long as we just are the last
[2:50:07.240 --> 2:50:11.280]  men standing telling the truth throughout this crisis there's no way
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:15.840]  they're gonna come out on the end of this Bob that's right and I knew that
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:20.480]  from the very beginning for the same reason that you did my favorite subject
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:26.360]  was history and I read and read and read I must have read the rise and fall of
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:32.000]  Roman Empire that seven volumes I must have read it 20 times because to me it
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:39.560]  was exciting but I learned what the culture of people is absolutely we're
[2:50:39.560 --> 2:50:44.480]  gonna take phone calls with Bob Chapman when we get back and I'm gonna find out
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:46.960]  if he's got other interviews coming up maybe I can twist his arms a little bit
[2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:50.400]  with us into the next hour and then ask Bob other issues he wants to talk about
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:54.360]  what he thinks is important in the news we haven't even gone there yet but here
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:59.200]  it is Societal general tells clients how to prepare for potential global

[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:21.880]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[2:52:21.880 --> 2:52:27.080]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:31.640]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:22.920]  coming up I'm gonna play part of what Rush Limbaugh had to say that there's
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:27.080]  several times he talked about prison planet dot com yesterday and called
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:32.600]  Al Gore crook and talked about bankers over in Europe wanting to loot us and
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:37.760]  rob from us in the UN wanting attacks I mean that's what it is see Limbaugh can't
[2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:43.800]  ignore this anymore and now the globalist have tried to deny deny deny deny
[2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:48.400]  deny this was being set up so they could build it and not have opposition but now
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:52.440]  that they're coming out in the open now the fight is on and our credibility is
[2:54:52.440 --> 2:54:56.800]  going up their credibility is going down so Limbaugh and Beck and all of them
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:00.480]  have jumped on the bandwagon and I say fine now you know they're co-opting our
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:03.520]  message and you know in three years when a Republican gets in they're gonna
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.120]  forget about all this that won't matter because then all their listeners will
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:12.600]  know the truth and the realignment towards a libertarian constant liberals
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:16.160]  and conservatives are waking up and becoming freedom lovers they're
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:20.960]  shattering paradigms right now and this is so exciting I mean I see the
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:23.720]  leftist sites attacking me in their comments a lot of them are like well
[2:55:23.720 --> 2:55:27.520]  Alex Jones attack Bush no this is about corporate corruption not about left and
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:31.640]  right people really are waking up and I hate to keep beating that drum Bob but
[2:55:31.640 --> 2:55:38.000]  this is so exciting it is and you know it's so visible now you know I don't
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:45.560]  have a show and I can come in fifth out of 50 obviously people are thirsting for
[2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:54.640]  the truth and that's just terrific and it's it's it makes me very happy absolutely
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:55:58.480]  it's it's it's so exciting Bob I want to come back and start the next hour you've
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:01.760]  agreed to stay with us another 20 minutes we'll talk to Martin in Spain
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:07.320]  Maria New York Pat New Jersey Charles Texas Jerry and Indiana and others for
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:10.040]  Bob Chapman our guest but Bob in the three or four minutes we got left in the
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:15.360]  shower other stuff in the news that you think's important well I think one of
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:19.520]  the most important thing is gold and I'll get quickly into it they have been
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:24.840]  trying to put gold down all week because the gold and silver silver options
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:29.320]  expire on Monday and they don't want them to expire in the money and they have a
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:34.720]  lot of them at 1120 in the money and so they are trying to make the price go
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:38.960]  down and it's illegal but they do it anyway well they can't get it down right
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:43.720]  now gold is up again seven to eight dollars in the December month which is
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:48.480]  still trading and that is the big month and it's the biggest month of the year
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:54.160]  actually and so they have been totally unsuccessful in the bullion and the
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:58.760]  futures market of putting gold back down again and when Monday's over again
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:57:05.080]  gold is going to vault again now what the alumnus are doing right now as well
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:11.080]  in order to psychologically disjoint people and this is very important for
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:14.960]  people who own gold and silver shares they are trying to knock them all down
[2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:20.760]  now right now there is a group and they have been putting together this
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:25.000]  propaganda campaign about how the shares are going to go down
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:33.720]  Barclays Goldman Sachs Jimmy Rogers and George Soros they're saying they're
[2:57:33.720 --> 2:57:38.680]  going to go down why I'll tell you why because and we have this statement for
[2:57:38.680 --> 2:57:44.400]  the last quarter Goldman Sachs probably is short one of the major gold
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:51.200]  stocks just one five million shares well what does that mean that means about
[2:57:51.200 --> 2:57:56.120]  five billion dollars that's a lot of money and so this is what's going on in
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:57:59.600]  that market and if you understand it and you get a hold of the international
[2:57:59.600 --> 2:58:05.680]  forecaster all every week you're going to know what's going on but they it can't
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:10.840]  work and I'll tell you why because when you're sure to stock you sell it hoping
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:15.760]  it'll go down and in selling it someday you got to buy it back again and they're
[2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:20.200]  going to have to cover their shorts and once they start this thing is going to
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:26.920]  vault because gold's going considerably higher here maybe the 1325 or 1250 or
[2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:33.160]  1200 somewhere up in here but when it goes there the shares have to go up and
[2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:38.240]  they have to cover okay we'll be back in 70 seconds for the final hour of this
[2:58:38.240 --> 2:58:45.520]  Friday edition America's number one stories for independent talk radio for

[2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:13.560]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:59:13.560 --> 2:59:18.280]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:59:18.280 --> 2:59:22.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:25.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:57.680]  seeing a big awakening in Spain right now well right now we started on the
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:00.800]  16th of November we started with the campaign of the
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:06.800]  vaccination right now with the vaccines and well people is obviously waking up
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:11.760]  and in Spain most of the people know that there's something wrong here because
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:18.280]  we bought actually 32 million vaccines okay and we are just 44 millions in
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:24.320]  Spain the population is 44 million and the government bought from the from the
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:29.000]  companies about 36 million and they only need to vaccine to vaccinate no
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:34.240]  vaccine 10 million people so the rest of the vaccines although we actually spend
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:39.240]  the money buying them are gonna go to you know to Africa and all the places
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:43.120]  where you know they don't need it they don't want it and they can get it so
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:47.560]  basically the people here is now starting to ask you know what's going on
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:54.480]  and actually there was a news about new bulletin that's how you call it I believe
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:03:01.040]  yes that yeah on our Supreme Court it's a group of people right now suing for
[3:03:01.040 --> 3:03:06.720]  damages because of the you know 59 families that have problems here of all
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:11.760]  teaching and problems with the vaccine and they the actually the
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:20.200]  Supreme Court here in Spain actually admitted a you know these
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:29.520]  families suing the the the main companies they admitted damages exactly
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:34.520]  so these actually the 59 families are gonna be able to sue the pharmaceuticals
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:37.480]  because of the problems they have with the vaccine here in Spain so that's
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:41.360]  good good do you have any questions for Bob Chapman because this is exciting news
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:48.160]  from Spain yes sir I wanted to ask Bob just I have a mortgage and actually my
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:53.720]  mortgage is consist of I buy with euros I buy different different I have to pay
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:03:58.240]  every month you know in a different currency so right now I'm thinking on
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:03.760]  on buying with euros a dollar so I'm gonna I wanted to ask him what he thinks
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:09.520]  the trend between you know the the the trend between euros and dollars is
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:13.880]  gonna be for the next year so I think the dollar is gonna go down but then
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:17.760]  it's also gonna suck the euro later but Bob tell us what you think you know I
[3:04:17.760 --> 3:04:21.920]  think that's going to happen and you have to watch him all all the currencies
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:28.080]  against gold and that's the important thing and but the euro will will will
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:34.200]  stay on a scale of 10 the 10 being worst the the British pound and the United
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:39.520]  States dollar are gonna get slaughtered where does the euro stand in that probably
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:44.480]  around a six or a seven what is the Canadian dollar stand probably around a
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:50.120]  five the Swiss Frank probably around a five and so those are the gradients and
[3:04:50.120 --> 3:04:56.200]  so the euro should get stronger against the dollar and I think that will
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:05:00.080]  continue for at least the next couple of years all right thank you so much from

[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:24.920]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:30.880]  in the same breath I'd like to say Alex congratulations and my sympathy on being
[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:36.960]  enemy number one out there have to say the the misguided agenda the powers that
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:42.120]  be a really underestimated the ability for the people to overcome all their
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:47.000]  poison food and water in that people and kids and that's the key our teens and
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.920]  our kids and our young people are awakening and I've been aware of this
[3:08:50.920 --> 3:08:55.040]  stuff for years and been called crazy and now that the hammers falling people
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:08:59.800]  are going what was that you were saying tell me again people we've been under
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:03.920]  attack yeah let me be clear let me be clear it isn't hype and I know
[3:09:03.920 --> 3:09:08.760]  everybody sees this for themselves it isn't we're a patriot t-shirt out in
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:11.640]  public and see how many people come up to you and pat you on the backer want to
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:15.760]  hang out with you or want to get involved with you in action I yeah for
[3:09:15.760 --> 3:09:18.120]  years I've been saying there's an awakening because every year it gets
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:24.520]  better but now it's just exponential go ahead so you know I think people are
[3:09:24.520 --> 3:09:28.080]  coming and saying we want to be part of the solution so what we're doing is
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:33.080]  we're gathering community and I and I have a good bunch of people that and
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:38.040]  it's getting bigger and stronger that we're getting together and developing
[3:09:38.040 --> 3:09:43.200]  ways to survive and meet our everyday needs to be an intra-dependent within
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:48.280]  our own little community and Alex we're on it we're mobilizing we have a plan to
[3:09:48.280 --> 3:09:52.880]  hold our county legislators accountable and I don't know about other counties
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:57.600]  but our county has home rule and we expect these people to use it and we
[3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:02.000]  want to create a bubble for a little protection for ourselves and I have a
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:05.760]  question oh if it does come down to it which it's looking at the writings on
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:09.680]  the wall it certainly may there's there's little dials that can be turned in
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:15.200]  the military sector in the medical sector and in the economics sector and
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:18.520]  it's not going to take much and we're gonna we're hitting martial law I can
[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:22.880]  smell it you know and I've been smelling it and the odor is getting stronger so my
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:26.000]  question to you because I'm just a little country girl out in the backwood
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:30.640]  but still that long arm is coming out and it's ready to tap me on the shoulder
[3:10:30.640 --> 3:10:36.480]  and I know it so is there any safe place on this planet is there all right
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.600]  Maria I hear your question let's ask Bob Chapman that Bob we're all gonna get it
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:47.440]  and it'll be in varying degrees the United States in Europe will probably
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:53.240]  suffer the most economically financially and in the event of martial law we might
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:59.760]  get down to the road warrior level you know it's interesting that the second
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:04.680]  and third worlds probably won't be as affected as we are yes they're gonna
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:11.320]  have a hard time but you know people don't realize in America that people in
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:17.640]  Asia and in Latin America they pay cash for their homes for the most part like
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:23.400]  99% so they don't have this burden that we have in the United States in Europe
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:29.040]  of having leveraged home so they're not gonna be as in data shape financially as
[3:11:29.040 --> 3:11:34.120]  one might think they would be and a lot of that's because they've been scammed
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:37.680]  before repeatedly they're totally wise I mean you think there's an awakening in
[3:11:37.680 --> 3:11:41.000]  the US ladies and gentlemen the awakening other parts of the world is
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.920]  even bigger because they woke up a long time ago let's go ahead and talk to Pat
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:11:50.080]  in New Jersey Pat you're on the air with Bob Chapman
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:09.000]  hold on a minute sir are you on a head a headset or something no
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:15.400]  okay can you hear me yeah go ahead yeah I just think that you know that the
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:19.240]  world isn't ready politically to accept anything other than democracy and as
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:24.640]  long as 10 or 15 percent of people have a clue and start talking about it I
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:29.880]  think that there's there's no way that politicians and corporations could
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:35.720]  could resist that force but I also just I had two recent run-ins with the New
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:42.080]  World Order one was that my family has a Christmas tree business in New Jersey
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:47.840]  we have to get a permit for every year and when I went to apply this year we
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:52.680]  have to get a state police background check and they actually referred me to a
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:58.440]  private company to get fingerprinted let me stop you and comment on that first
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:03.800]  it was school teachers then realtors then people in banking and now just all
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:07.960]  over the country they say oh you want to have any business you've got to be
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:13.160]  fingerprinted you're all criminals this is Patriot Act compliance and it's
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:17.640]  totally unconstitutional and a fraud and a lot of times it's just bureaucracy
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:20.520]  they're just ordering you to do this why are they saying you've got to be
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:24.880]  fingerprinted for a Christmas tree business it's a peddler's permit you
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:28.280]  have to get every year and you you have to get fingerprinted every year even if
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:32.080]  they have your prints on record you have to go in and make an appointment with a
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:37.560]  private company called Sagomorfo the European company that you have to go
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:40.720]  to and they fingerprint you and then they have you know they own your
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:45.320]  fingerprints and if I don't do this you know we can't have the lot we're gonna
[3:13:45.320 --> 3:13:49.080]  have some you know official comment and shut down our lot if we don't have the
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:52.960]  occupancy people need to fight that I mean home of the free land of the brave
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:57.320]  thumb printing you know they do you take your kids to the airport body scanners
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:03.960]  record their naked bodies this isn't freedom Bob Chapman absolutely and do
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:08.640]  what Alex says after you get your permit and then start working with your
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:14.400]  your congressman or your local people who are in charge of that and say look
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:19.360]  we shouldn't have to do this let's put a stop to it and work on it I mean think
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:24.440]  about it thumb prints to sell Christmas trees and it's just disgusting and I
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:29.760]  know you I guess you have another story Pat about big brother I do I was in
[3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:34.320]  Philadelphia with my dad we were there having lunch you know it was raining
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:38.520]  we're walking in business suits and we're walking down the street and the
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:41.880]  security guard and we're right in front of Independence Hall like directly in
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:45.440]  front and a security guard starts yelling that's telling us to get out of the
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:49.360]  street so we step over this chain that is in front of Independence Hall but it
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:54.000]  still seems like just the sidewalk there and the guy who runs up to us and he
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:58.840]  says you know whoa whoa you have to go out the exit and I and then you know I
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:04.280]  said what I'm on the sidewalk where am I supposed to exit it said sir go out the
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:08.840]  exit you just kept saying that and then he says sir this is government property
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:13.320]  I need you to step out the exit right now and so I said oh government property
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:18.200]  who and meet so I got it will go and me my dad start walking towards the exit
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:23.560]  and then the guy the guy grabs my shoulder and he's like oh whoa wait a
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:29.400]  second you wait right here and he blocked me in my dad from walking and he
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:33.480]  said you know you need to learn some respect you need to learn to stop
[3:15:33.480 --> 3:15:37.240]  running your mouth and he started physically blocking us and grabbing
[3:15:37.240 --> 3:15:43.160]  both of us pretty big guy and yeah I'm like you're on my kindergarten teacher
[3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:47.040]  you know I'm allowed to talk back to you if I want are you a cop that I couldn't
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:51.040]  tell you that I'm a big raincoat and he was a private security guard at
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:55.480]  company let me let me stop you this is the nature of tyranny CNN had a big
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:16:00.400]  headline the AP reported on it how a woman in China a CNN reporter was wearing
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:05.440]  a Obama as Mao and they arrested her and said it was disrespectful of their
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:11.280]  great murdering leader and that's what America is everywhere I go you can pull
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:14.320]  a camera out 200 yards from the Washington Monument you can be in
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:18.760]  downtown Austin cops walk over and say why do you have a camera and it's the
[3:16:18.760 --> 3:16:23.120]  same thing with security guards they've been told to brutalize you and to treat
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:28.360]  you like slaves I watch him in DC and New York treat families like their scum
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:33.840]  and this is the nature of a police state where they give you orders to that you
[3:16:33.840 --> 3:16:37.840]  can't follow they say take the exit you go where's the exit I said exit I'm
[3:16:37.840 --> 3:16:42.400]  about my guys were in a city park a quarter mile from the Federal Reserve
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:47.800]  shooting a shot of it from the horizon the security guards was on YouTube in
[3:16:47.800 --> 3:16:53.440]  Kansas City came to them off of their jurisdiction put their hands on their
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:56.880]  guns and said I'm gonna arrest you if you don't leave and they were on the
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:17:02.200]  sidewalk at a city park and so there wouldn't be trouble they left and they
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:07.720]  got off on the power trip Bob Chapman I mean this is the Soviet Union there's
[3:17:07.720 --> 3:17:12.640]  no doubt about it it's probably more like East Germany used to be the
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:18.640]  stars he was probably worse than the KGB and as it turns out after the wall came
[3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:23.320]  down and you know half the people in the country where we're spying for the
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:28.240]  government on the other half and and and that's that's the next step we'll have
[3:17:28.240 --> 3:17:32.560]  everybody spying on everybody it's just like the Hitler young are all over again
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:37.160]  hey how did this end though I mean he got to have his power his enjoyment I
[3:17:37.160 --> 3:17:41.520]  mean how did this end did you learn to worship him no so I said are you a
[3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:44.800]  police officer because if you're not you know I'm gonna keep walking you asked
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:48.760]  me to leave and I'm leaving you're not gonna detain me for you know using the
[3:17:48.760 --> 3:17:52.880]  wrong tone of voice with you and he keeps blocking me so I said you know
[3:17:52.880 --> 3:17:55.800]  show me your badge if you're a cop otherwise I'm gonna put my hands behind
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:59.600]  my back I'm gonna walk that way if you step in front of me I'm gonna know you're
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:03.240]  gonna get pushed so I just did that I just put my hands behind my back they
[3:18:03.240 --> 3:18:09.160]  couldn't say I hit him and I just walked out and and then this other guy comes
[3:18:09.160 --> 3:18:13.720]  up his his backup who we called when I was standing there another private
[3:18:13.720 --> 3:18:17.320]  security guard and he says whoa whoa where you think you're going you know
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:22.480]  you can't can't talk to talk to my guy like that and then you know within
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:26.040]  seconds these three part and this is on the steps of independence all it's just
[3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:32.240]  the irony is insane and then seconds later these three-part police come up
[3:18:32.240 --> 3:18:37.000]  and they're like you just hold it right there to me and my dad and my dad put his
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:41.280]  hands up just to try to explain and the park police are like whoa so put your
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:45.880]  hands down and stand still like nobody moves no no it's it's a religion of
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:50.440]  them training us that they are gods we are slaves and that happened to me in
[3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:54.920]  DC I'd be walking down a park and taping it say hey stop right there
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:59.280]  security guards and I would just say hey buddy you can beat the rap but you can't
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:02.560]  beat the ride you go ahead and set me up but I'm gonna personally sue you
[3:19:02.560 --> 3:19:07.480]  criminal and those scumbags were back down instantly because they're cowardly
[3:19:07.480 --> 3:19:14.240]  hateful Nazi trash that hate America now how did this end this is about the end
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:18.360]  how did it end up so I explained it I was like you know this guy is on a
[3:19:18.360 --> 3:19:21.640]  power trip over here he told me to leave and I left and he didn't like the way I
[3:19:21.640 --> 3:19:25.880]  talked to him so he stopped me you know they immediately started back peddling
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:30.880]  and you know justifying he said oh it's that long day a lot of people know he's
[3:19:30.880 --> 3:19:36.520]  a scum filth coward with a deformed fluoride tiny rotten brain who loves

[3:23:01.560 --> 3:23:06.440]  hi this is Steve Shank Alex and I have talked about food security for your
[3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:10.840]  family for years now we're into the holiday season the happy time of year
[3:23:10.840 --> 3:23:14.720]  when friends and family come together and food is always the expression of our
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:19.480]  shared love and caring this year the e-foods holiday special food supply has
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:23.720]  the two things that you've asked for most easy to make prepared meals that
[3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:28.120]  taste great and a smaller than one-year supply for greater affordability I don't
[3:23:28.120 --> 3:23:32.040]  have to tell you that the troubled times and loss of freedoms that we only
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:37.840]  anticipated in 2008 have arrived in our lives with a vengeance this holiday
[3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:42.400]  special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours and comes with
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:46.520]  a free seven-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate call
[3:23:46.520 --> 3:23:55.680]  800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com that's 800-409-5633 we
[3:23:55.680 --> 3:24:02.760]  here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace security and plenty this holiday season
[3:24:04.760 --> 3:24:10.080]  I'm gonna cover Rush Limbaugh plugging prisonplanet.com yesterday and his
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:15.640]  attack on Al Gore I noticed he had prisonplanet.com at the top of his site
[3:24:15.640 --> 3:24:19.840]  then he had a photoshopped image this image right here zoom in on it I should
[3:24:19.840 --> 3:24:25.400]  have printed this I think I did at my house for people watching on prison
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:29.760] planet.tv they could see with the document cam right here he took
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:35.960]  prisonplanet.com off of there so I I know rush has talked about prisonplanet.com
[3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:40.600]  in a bad light before I wonder why he plugged it and then then removed it
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:45.440]  that's interesting the only reason we're covering this is we got Glenn Beck and
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:49.520]  and and all the mainstream media getting really mad when their guests bring me up
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:53.200]  on their shows because these guys have denied world government for so long now
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:56.880]  they can't deny it any longer I wanted just for the next four minutes then
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:00.240]  we're gonna come back and cover the Limbaugh situation and more I wanted to
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:05.920]  bring Ted Anderson up because gold is way up there still and Ted is about to
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:09.280]  run out of the gold he bought at the thousand fifty dollar level that's when
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:13.680]  he bought into the market so that 90 plus dollar savings in the markets being
[3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:18.200]  passed on to you and gold's staying up there high and so he's gonna run out of
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:21.640]  this soon and it's gonna go up again we've told you this when it was 300 and
[3:25:21.640 --> 3:25:25.640]  went up to 350 we said hey he's got at the lower price when it was 400 we said

[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:15.000]  run short all of those buffaloes that we talked about yesterday they're gone it's
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:20.120]  been a per you know Alex it's just a hot market the gold markets up today it's
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:26.680]  it's been as high today as 1151 dollars and you know I just need to say you need
[3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:30.080]  to get moving on this golden silver thing if you've been thinking about it and
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:35.400]  wondering what to do I would not wait a whole lot longer I mean Alex the people
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:38.960]  that took advantage of these specials that we've been doing over the last year
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:44.920]  year and a half even you know they're looking at a 1015 even 20% profit and I
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:48.320]  don't know how you can go wrong with that I mean it just really has been real
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:52.960]  strong and right now at this particular time everybody knows that the United
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:57.880]  States dollars going south and that gold and silver is going north and I just need
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:27:01.560]  to tell you if you're sitting in the bond market you're sitting in the bank you
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:06.360]  have annuities I mean there's just a whole long line of investments that you
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:11.080]  can get hurt with if you're sitting in this fiat paper currency we are just
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:14.760]  sitting you know the United States government wants to bail itself out by
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:18.920]  printing money and we do not have an equal expansion and productivity and
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:23.440]  that means inflation and that is going to be tough on people it's going to be
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:26.920]  really hard on people that have very little and for the people that have been
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:29.960]  saving all their lives are going to lose a lot of money real fast and it just
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:34.840]  doesn't make sense I mean you can easily buy some gold and silver set it aside
[3:27:34.840 --> 3:27:39.080]  put it away for insurance purposes and if everything goes to pot and the you
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:43.200]  value the dollar goes down you're going to have something that's holding on to
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:51.160]  that value absolutely and folks can call Midas resources right now at 800 686

[3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:41.960]  start gave him his job put him where he is Roger Ailes of Fox News he has
[3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:48.160]  repeatedly over the years attacked prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[3:33:48.160 --> 3:33:53.200]  saying that world government doesn't exist there's no new world order no carbon
[3:33:53.200 --> 3:33:57.480]  tax none of it I don't want to fight with rush Limbaugh I agree with him on the
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:01.760]  second amendment and a lot of issues I certainly agree with him in many areas
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:08.640]  more than I agree with Barack Obama but it's Republican in name only but I have
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:13.480]  to respond to rush Limbaugh yesterday off and on throughout the show he plug
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:18.480]  prisonplanet.com the top of rush Limbaugh.com for about seven hours
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:24.320]  yesterday was prisonplanet.com like we have screen shots of that here I want
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:27.960]  to show everybody I've actually been doodling on this screenshot unfortunately
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:32.360]  but everybody can everybody can look at it here some of my doodles because I
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:36.040]  didn't know he was going to remove it all and it says prison planet with
[3:34:36.040 --> 3:34:43.400]  hurricanes at 30 year low Gore turns to Photoshop and then later in the day he
[3:34:43.400 --> 3:34:48.920]  made it a smaller headline and had this page this archive of his transcript with
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:53.720]  this image but it said prisonplanet.com at the top and I didn't know that rush
[3:34:53.720 --> 3:34:59.200]  would censor himself or edit himself or put it in the Orwellian memory hole I'm
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:03.480]  sure somebody got a screenshot of it we didn't I just have this latest print out
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:08.760]  he removed prisonplanet.com from the image that they photoshopped of our
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:13.480]  news article with with with rush standing over it that give folks a close
[3:35:13.480 --> 3:35:19.400]  shot everything in this is the same except that it had prisonplanet.com at
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:24.480]  the top it had the header of our website and he plugged prisonplanet.com in the
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:29.880]  transcript that has now been removed so this morning I was going to come on air
[3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:35.400]  today and marvel at why would rush Limbaugh after attacking prisonplanet.com
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:39.720]  specifically and myself more than a dozen times over the years that I've
[3:35:39.720 --> 3:35:45.640]  heard I don't listen to rush a lot I'm on at the same time as rush I haven't seen
[3:35:45.640 --> 3:35:49.760]  rush Limbaugh say Ron Paul's dangerous Ron Paul's bad his supporters should be
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:55.160]  arrested I haven't seen him say the bailouts are good he was never against
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:59.600]  Ron Paul he was against the bailouts from the beginning I think rush Limbaugh is a
[3:35:59.600 --> 3:36:03.480]  lot better than Glenn Beck Glenn Beck said he was for the bailout we had to
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.240]  do it later he said he never said that even though we have the video clip he's
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:11.080]  badmouth Ron Paul now he says he likes him but just a month ago called him a
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:15.560]  kook again on his radio show I don't want to fight with Glenn Beck I don't want
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:20.280]  to fight with Glenn Beck listeners that's not good for my radio show that's a
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:24.360]  lot of my audience is libertarians and conservatives that are waking up but I
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:29.760]  have to tell the truth when Glenn Beck comes out and flip flops and Benedict
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:33.960]  Arnold's against the only real Americans we've gotten Congress like Ron Paul
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:38.520]  and then acts like he's friendly later to co-opt our movement and our tea
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:46.920]  parties it is extremely upsetting to me very very upsetting but now this whole
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:51.720]  rush Limbaugh thing I was like why is rush Limbaugh his top story for half the
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:57.640]  day prisonplanet.com you go to the article it's my picture my face over
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:04.600]  there everything Limbaugh knows who my my sights they all know Glenn Beck a few
[3:37:04.600 --> 3:37:08.840]  days ago I got mentioned on his show on TV he turned red in the face looked
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:15.360]  really upset sort of shaking his head why did Limbaugh do this well now the
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:19.440]  media is picked up on the fact George Soros front group media matters they'll
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:26.880]  be the arbiter they'll be the media watchdog group by the crook in chief you
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:30.720]  know one of Obama's biggest supporters one of the biggest frontmen for this
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:34.200]  global government I mean I've seen five articles six articles last week he's
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:38.680]  been on Lair News Hour Bill Moyer CNN calling for New World Order calling for
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:44.080]  world government Soros came out and attacked Limbaugh for plugging me because
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:48.600]  they're afraid of my information that's real and could save this country true
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:53.280]  constitutionalism taken over the Republican Party they want to keep it
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:37:57.480]  blue blood and CIA and they're afraid that their listeners and their
[3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:01.160]  supporters are going off the fake Republican Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:05.160]  reservation but I will say Limbaugh analyzing him is not one-tenth as bad
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:09.520]  as Glenn Beck that's what makes them dangerous though as they pose as us
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:16.760]  they're right on so much but only right so far so they can betray us now about
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:20.840]  ten minutes ago I said oh print me the Rush Limbaugh transcript off the site
[3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:26.720]  and they said it's gone prison planets gone the photoshop they did of the
[3:38:26.720 --> 3:38:32.000]  prison planet website is gone it's all gone it's all gone I was getting email
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:35.520]  saying your nuts Rush Limbaugh didn't talk about prison it's not like who he
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:39.960]  talked about a big deal it's a big deal in that he would do it but not a big
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:44.880]  deal to be on the site info wars.com prison planet.com go to Alexa.com and
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:49.400]  compare Rush Limbaugh.com to prison planet.com or info wars.com both of my
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:54.600]  sites completely dwarf them in fact do that guys go to Alexa.com and at the
[3:38:54.600 --> 3:39:04.360]  top it says put in your URL put in info wars and then beside info wars it says
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:09.680]  compare site put Rush Limbaugh in and it will let you compare the graphs and you
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:14.520]  will see we absolutely dwarf what Rush Limbaugh it's kind of like big
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:20.760]  newspapers that are maybe 50 times smaller than info wars.com they might
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:24.080]  make a hundred million dollars a year whereas the website doesn't make a
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:29.560]  million it's all perception that they're the big authority they're the big see
[3:39:29.560 --> 3:39:33.400]  that's why number one I'm a moral person number two I never sold out to any of
[3:39:33.400 --> 3:39:38.680]  these people because why it's all an illusion I want to be real I want to
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:47.720]  have real change I'm into real freedom but to have Rush Limbaugh edit this hey
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:52.520]  Aaron come on in here maybe you can show him how to do it come on in here oh look
[3:39:52.520 --> 3:39:58.520]  up put that up on screen we've got the Photoshop side-by-side Rush Limbaugh
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:03.360]  sensors mentioned a prison planet from his own archives and then you can see
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:07.680]  the original prison planet Photoshop you can see the new one they did but then he
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:12.120]  also took the term prisonplanet.com out of the transcript we're going to play
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:16.160]  the actual audio here in a minute it's very used to document this but Aaron you
[3:40:16.160 --> 3:40:18.560]  use Alexa sometimes if they don't know how to use it they're going to have
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:22.800]  trouble you just go to Alexa it says here it says put your URL in here put
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:28.720]  info wars.com in it'll pull up a graph of info wars.com put up the max graph
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:33.200]  click max and it says compare sites and then put in and then put Rush Limbaugh.com
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:37.840]  next to us and show him that graph yeah no problem by the way I have the
[3:40:37.840 --> 3:40:42.280]  screenshot from when it was the top headline yesterday good give that to
[3:40:42.280 --> 3:40:45.400]  Paul give that to Paul awesome but just go out there and I'm not saying you guys
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:49.760]  don't know how but Alexa is weird if you don't know how to use it okay oh so you
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:55.920]  already have it okay so so for viewers first put up no no no I know but I'm
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:41:00.360]  saying first put this up for everybody I want to put that up for everybody so
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:04.960]  they can see so they can see the so they can see the photo shop for
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:13.080]  everybody or Eric can go do it and send you a screenshot that's the way to do it
[3:41:13.080 --> 3:41:19.960]  then but but again this is real radio this is not scripted we're here radio
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:24.920]  slash TV reaching millions of people a week on the system scared so I don't
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:29.480]  know how Limbaugh would know that was us put it up and then censor it maybe
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:34.800]  hires up who control it said take it off because they're very scared of
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:40.800]  legitimizing us let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson Paul Watson this story just
[3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:47.360]  gets crazier and crazier doesn't it yeah it's definitely interesting how it was
[3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:53.880]  up there for so long before they removed it now I mean Limbaugh attacked us and
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:42:01.560]  mentioned us by name in I think it was 2007 remember when the drunk football
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:08.160]  player crashed a private plane into the New York apartment block and we wrote a
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:14.600]  story explaining how Fox News and the neocons were exploiting it to remind
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:19.000]  people about 9 11 then the next day Limbaugh attacked us for that and
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:23.880]  mentioned us by name so he knows who we are I mean when he ordered his webmaster
[3:42:23.880 --> 3:42:28.120]  to link to us right at the top of his website he knew who we were he knew what
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:33.840]  the website was then it was up there all day and as he said media matters and
[3:42:33.840 --> 3:42:39.480]  other liberals start picking up on it and using it to attack Limbaugh saying
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:46.200]  he's now associated with us and then today we look back in the archives and
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:52.440]  the date is the 19th for yesterday and he's removed the image of Prison Planet
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:57.840]  he's removed the article link he changed it to a newsbusters link which is
[3:42:57.840 --> 3:43:02.800]  essentially the same story and he's even edited his own transcript to take out
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:07.840]  the part where he says prisonplanet.com which is it's proven that he said that
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:15.000]  because we've got the YouTube so I mean I think he probably him or is the people
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:20.520]  who run his website started getting a ton of emails yesterday afternoon from
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:27.360]  these free republic type neocons who really hey I got and any Alex Jones
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:31.440]  material is aggressively banned from free republic and those kind of websites
[3:43:31.440 --> 3:43:37.160]  and he just probably got a lot of emails and eventually just said remove it and
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:42.120]  it's gone it's memory holes but see all free republic and rush Limbaugh and
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:46.640]  people are doing by being neocons is making themselves obsolete and and not
[3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:51.280]  even pertinent in the debate I mean Limbaugh and others are still saying
[3:43:51.280 --> 3:43:55.000]  there's no world government when it's openly being announced all we're doing
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:43:59.040]  is covering what's really happening and we don't want to be enemies with any of
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:02.960]  these people and we understand they're part of the fake right wing you know
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:06.680]  that has to try to keep conservatives and libertarians on their reservation on
[3:44:06.680 --> 3:44:11.040]  their plantation but work we're here to bring liberty we're here to unlock
[3:44:11.040 --> 3:44:16.200]  minds and we're here to expose the fact that our republic is falling and
[3:44:16.200 --> 3:44:21.120]  imploding and I want to encourage rush Limbaugh listeners and supporters to
[3:44:21.120 --> 3:44:25.560]  come find the real deal here I mean we're no compromise for this country and
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:28.880]  freedom and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and we're not going to
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:33.000]  attack Ron Paul and stab him in the back we're the real deal and and don't
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:36.800]  allow yourselves to be co-opted by Rush Limbaugh but I think this is really
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:40.600]  blown up in his face and Paul I appreciate you joining us we're going to
[3:44:40.600 --> 3:44:44.220]  play this YouTube audio I know you've got it linked up in the story at
[3:44:44.220 --> 3:44:47.720]  prisonplanet.com it'll be up there throughout the weekend for listeners
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:51.520]  tuning in on other stations during the rebroadcast this weekend at
[3:44:51.520 --> 3:44:56.080]  prisonplanet.com thank you so much Paul anything else you want to add okay
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:45:01.400]  thank you let's go ahead and play the audio slash video somebody at YouTube
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:07.960]  took the audio from Rush and and added added video to it and I think it's
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:13.560]  very very informative so here it is ladies and gentlemen I have something
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:18.460]  we're going to post this at rushlimbaugh.com immediately a webmaster is
[3:45:18.460 --> 3:45:25.520]  waiting on it Al Gore has a new book out it's called our choice a plan to solve
[3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:35.920]  the the acclimate crisis and this this book according to our official
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:41.120]  climatologist here Dr. Roy Spencer University of Alabama at Huntsville
[3:45:41.120 --> 3:45:48.520]  formerly of NASA Dr. Spencer tells me that this Gore book is a metaphor for
[3:45:48.520 --> 3:45:54.720]  his twisting of reality to suit his needs he took some NASA imagery of the
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:45:59.440]  earth and photoshopped the following into it and we've got what a website
[3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:05.200]  here with both pictures the original snapshot of the earth from NASA and in
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:10.360]  a way Gore photoshopped it and here's what's on the picture that's photoshopped
[3:46:10.360 --> 3:46:16.520]  for hurricanes that were not there the hurricane closest to Florida is spinning
[3:46:16.520 --> 3:46:21.760]  in the wrong direction the hurricane off of South America is almost on the
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:28.360]  equator which is physically impossible for hurricanes all of the sea ice in the
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:36.240]  Arctic Ocean is removed but snow cover over Canada and Alaska remains Cuba in
[3:46:36.240 --> 3:46:42.200]  Gore's photoshopped picture of the earth Cuba doesn't exist it is not there
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:49.840]  Cuba is totally underwater which would require a sea level rise of over 6,000
[3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:56.040]  feet which means Denver would be underwater as well if Cuba is underwater
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:02.240]  so so would be Denver now half of the Greenland ice sheet is gone but it's
[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:05.800]  out of the center the thickest part rather than around the edges where it's
[3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:10.480]  the thinnest it's a joke this man is an absolute joke he's photoshopped a
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:14.960]  picture of the earth and the website where this is taking place is
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:19.400]  prisonplanet.com that's where we have the pictures side-by-side from Gore's
[3:47:19.400 --> 3:47:24.240]  book our choice two kilometers or so down in most places there are these
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:28.560]  incredibly hot rocks because the interior of the earth is extremely hot
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:32.760]  several million degrees I took the initiative in creating the internet
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:44.240]  prisonplanet.com prisonplanet.com prisonplanet.com and now rush has made
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:48.920]  it even bigger boo boo by expunging it and we're getting emails saying we made
[3:47:48.920 --> 3:47:53.760]  it all up that's a fake rush Limbaugh okay whatever you want to believe that
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:57.200]  that's fine you gotta love how these neocons come up with wilder conspiracy
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:01.760]  theories than we ever could we only cover what's really going on here that's
[3:48:01.760 --> 3:48:08.640]  all we do and we're like oh rush maybe waking up oh good for him because it
[3:48:08.640 --> 3:48:12.560]  goes on you can go to rushlimbaugh.com and get into his archives and listen to
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:19.320]  it all he goes on I'll cover this more on the Sunday show to call George Soros
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:24.000]  and the European Union pushing this global tax a bunch of crooks they're all
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:29.280]  a bunch of crooks that's a quote I'm reading it right here billions of
[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:32.520]  euros are at stake in the negotiations yes billions of euros are at stake
[3:48:32.520 --> 3:48:36.960]  meaning who is going to get what from the slush funds that have been created
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:41.040]  extensively for cap and trade and to stop global warming they're all a bunch
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:44.960]  of crooks and he goes on to call them criminals good job Limbaugh don't be
[3:48:44.960 --> 3:48:50.160]  ashamed of finally doing something right it's their crooks they're not idiots
[3:48:50.160 --> 3:48:53.720]  that think the earth is warming and oh they're a bunch of environmentalist
[3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:58.360]  wackos if you think Gore making a billion bucks before he even launches
[3:48:58.360 --> 3:49:05.280]  this wacko okay no they're not wackos they're crazy like a fox and you know

[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:15.920]  Newscore clips where they're admitting they're implanting messages in the
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:19.320]  media look at this they went to Alexa comm and it's like this on every

[3:50:31.440 --> 3:50:36.400]  government it was his job to keep you asleep while all of this was being built
[3:50:36.400 --> 3:50:41.400]  and now he's trying to take on some of our political coloration to stay
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:47.440]  relevant okay we're the future Limbaugh and you know it and Glenn Beck knows it
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:51.920]  and if you want to be the future wake up and become a patriot but you can't do
[3:50:51.920 --> 3:50:55.920]  that you can just act like it enough to fool people because you're a creature of
