[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:38.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.000]  citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us
[00:43.000 --> 00:51.720]  each day I've seen the courage of parents students pastors police officers
[00:51.720 --> 00:57.760]  all over this country who say we are not afraid and I intend to keep trying with
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.320]  or without Congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent
[01:02.320 --> 01:06.840]  Americans in our movie theaters and our shopping malls or schools like Sandy
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.040]  York
[01:11.040 --> 01:21.920]  the state of the dictatorship with the trader in chief the the saboteur in
[01:21.920 --> 01:30.240]  chief what's the best way to describe it the subversive in chief notice how
[01:30.240 --> 01:34.760]  everything he says it's the complete opposite we are not afraid which invokes
[01:34.760 --> 01:39.160]  fear of guns which is all they do is fear monger about guns all of his
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.920]  surrogates all the establishment oh my gosh gun violence is up oh we're all
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.880]  dead oh it's the number one cause of death oh it's so evil I think it's
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.040]  actually like last time I checked in the world Almanac for last year it's like
[01:52.040 --> 01:58.960]  the 15th cause of death in the US and it's down by 51 percent since 1992 FBI
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.720]  unified crime statistics I mean this is all on record overall crimes with guns
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.080]  just violent crimes down 51 percent of guns it was 61 percent I mean that's
[02:11.080 --> 02:15.560]  even mainstream news after we put the numbers out took the numbers the
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.600]  just department had put out via the FBI early last year and then dissected it
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.240]  and then the media finally picked up on it la time said gun crime plunges but
[02:26.240 --> 02:33.800]  public perceives that it's escalating because it's all a giant con game and we
[02:33.800 --> 02:40.080]  did live coverage of it it's been archived up to prisonplanet.tv we have a
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.160]  great cruise to like 11 o'clock last night getting it all done and of course
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.640]  it was like a two plus hour special marathon news transmission so it for
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.720]  some reason didn't encode right and get uploaded but it's now available if you
[02:53.720 --> 03:01.200]  missed the live transmission from 7 o'clock last night until about 9 30
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.480]  central so I guess it was two and a half hours if you missed any of that it is
[03:05.480 --> 03:11.880]  now up at prisonplanet.tv and with our very small crew they did a superb job
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.600]  not just the reporters not just myself but the people behind the scenes like

[08:43.040 --> 08:50.120]  if memory serves I believe that's how the tale of two cities began so you guys
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.400]  pull up the first page of a tale of two cities I want to actually read that
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.560]  because there's more there's more to that quote by the way ladies and gentlemen
[09:00.560 --> 09:07.480]  it is not the sunshine summer patriot that we need here that goes to the
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.240]  football games and waves American flags having no idea what that flag
[09:11.240 --> 09:16.880]  symbolizes and I'm not knocking people that like the American flag it is people
[09:16.880 --> 09:21.840]  that recognize what the flag symbolizes not what it's been expropriated for not
[09:21.840 --> 09:25.200]  what it's been captured not what it's been used for but it's those that
[09:25.200 --> 09:29.600]  recognize that compared to every other system it's been the best and that's
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.240]  why the true Americana system is under attack and people ask who I am and what
[09:35.240 --> 09:42.200]  I stand for I am a constitutional libertarian freedom lover who is a human
[09:42.200 --> 09:48.560]  empowerment activist and I don't like thugs and psychopaths and goons and
[09:48.560 --> 09:54.700]  tyrants and gangs and usurpers anymore than if I was out on the African
[09:54.700 --> 10:02.600]  plane I'd like a pride of lions trying to eat me I am not food I am not here for
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.480]  a predator class to feed on and like to and keep in the dark and feed me you
[10:07.480 --> 10:14.280]  know what like mushrooms that's an old politician saying from 80 years ago
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.760]  that what do you do with the public you keep them in the dark and feed them
[10:19.760 --> 10:26.960]  horsemen are like mushrooms a tale of two cities since I just mentioned that
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.760]  chapter one the period book one recall to life it was the best of times it was
[10:35.760 --> 10:39.760]  the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.120]  it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season
[10:46.120 --> 10:50.000]  of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.560]  winter of despair we had everything before us we had nothing before us we
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.040]  were all going direct to heaven we were all going directly the other way in
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.040]  short this period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest
[11:05.040 --> 11:10.880]  authorities insisted on being received or good or for evil in the superlative
[11:10.880 --> 11:18.720]  degree of comparison only that's people used to just read whole books written
[11:18.720 --> 11:24.080]  that well don't you wish you could talk like that right like that you think
[11:24.080 --> 11:27.520]  we're getting better we get more so overall it's the best of times worse
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.080]  of times we're getting better in some ways but the goal of the social
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.400]  engineers because really it's easier to make something ugly it's easier to pull
[11:35.400 --> 11:42.480]  something down it's easier to cheat they then claim that this is their system of
[11:42.480 --> 11:49.000]  subversion and then their system of destabilization and then their system of
[11:49.000 --> 11:57.280]  crisis implosion and then reorganization and the truth is you guys
[11:57.280 --> 12:03.800]  don't reorganize anything the truth is you wreck stuff and then you feed on the
[12:03.800 --> 12:11.160]  incredible wealth of the human spirit ingenuity and mind and then claim that
[12:11.160 --> 12:18.000]  you have directed and built everything when the truth is you have just plowed
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.400]  through the human psyche and civilization causing irrevocable damage to the
[12:22.400 --> 12:29.840]  DNA the very fabric of the human biosphere for thousands of years the
[12:29.840 --> 12:36.320]  predator parasite psych psychopath malfunctioning class are mentally ill
[12:36.320 --> 12:44.280]  and are a cancer it's really very very simple okay so you're not superior you're
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.680]  not better than us those of us that do have empathy those of us that are nice
[12:48.680 --> 12:54.120]  those of us that like other people being successful just because we don't have a
[12:54.120 --> 12:58.920]  desire to run everything does it mean we are losers in your whole social
[12:58.920 --> 13:08.560]  Darwinistic facade the truth is you are a bunch of
[13:08.560 --> 13:19.760]  kleptocratic obsessive-compulsive megalomaniacal preening drooling
[13:20.200 --> 13:31.160]  spiritually dead individuals I was watching last night live during the
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.280]  state of the Union a lot of you are watching and we simulcast it on the
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.840]  info wars nightly news and info wars news dot com prison planet TV in a two
[13:39.840 --> 13:44.360]  and a half hour special live news last night with Liam McAdoo jicari Jackson
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.680]  David Knight and yours truly Alex Jones and it's now up on prison planet TV for
[13:49.680 --> 13:58.200]  members in full but the point is I have never seen a more demoralized weak
[13:58.200 --> 14:13.440]  wraithlike-looking group of assembled evildoers twisted skexie-like really
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.480]  apparitions and then you and then I could see a few congressmen and women who I
[14:18.480 --> 14:23.240]  know are good people at least halfway good in the political system even the
[14:23.240 --> 14:27.360]  political system knows how to manipulate the false political paradigm that has
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.040]  some truth in it but not much and they're able to swim in that false
[14:33.040 --> 14:39.000]  projection but they're really naive the political class is naive to a great
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.840]  extent and the reason we're have able to have such headway is they're in it and
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.360]  they're immersed in the compartmentalization and they hear shows
[14:47.360 --> 14:51.400]  like this one and they see the analysis we put out that's why Congress does
[14:51.400 --> 14:54.760]  pick up on what we say that's foreign governments do as well that's all on
[14:54.760 --> 14:58.280]  record Russian government Syrian government US government the Pentagon
[14:58.280 --> 15:02.200]  Pentagon more than anybody because they're trying to make sense of it of
[15:02.200 --> 15:10.880]  this twisted multi-layered attack from all sides full spectrum dominance
[15:10.880 --> 15:18.840]  program that is really just the devil's program put out by the devil stud to
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.280]  kill still destroy there is no rhyme or reason to it at the end of the day it's
[15:23.280 --> 15:30.200]  not just about power the incredible emptiness of raw power is is a gulf to
[15:30.200 --> 15:37.400]  behold it is absolutely cold and to someone that doesn't lust after it very
[15:37.400 --> 15:43.080]  very empty but I was watching last night as Obama came in and as Democrats
[15:43.080 --> 15:49.520]  and a lot of Republicans groveled to him and would see the TV camera and get all
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.640]  excited you could tell or flushing in the face that they ran for office for
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.400]  mayor or county commissioner and then the state house and then to get into the
[15:58.400 --> 16:04.080]  house of the Senate these people have spent 30 40 years getting into a power
[16:04.080 --> 16:10.200]  position so they could bid rig and run scams and insider trade and exempt
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.720]  themselves from the law so that they don't want power so they can protect
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.160]  their family or so they can have a big private jet or so they can you know you
[16:18.160 --> 16:25.760]  have some excuse for wanting to be rich itself a prison they absolutely want to
[16:25.760 --> 16:32.920]  perch like peacocks or cockatoos in a tree showing off their feathers it is so
[16:32.920 --> 16:41.040]  primitive it is so pathetic and it is scary to realize we are ruled by that
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.960]  and political membrane that the special interest use as a facade so that they
[16:46.960 --> 16:53.200]  don't get the blame for their programs and to just a look at that collection
[16:55.640 --> 16:59.880]  this is the only description I have they had a mummy exhibition down in San
[16:59.880 --> 17:03.760]  Antonio a few years ago and I was down there with my wife and children and my
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.720]  wife said I don't want to go to that that sounds gross I thought no no was
[17:07.720 --> 17:10.940]  advertised as Egyptian stuff I wanted to see the Egyptian that's the Egyptian
[17:10.940 --> 17:15.440]  mummies in New York and Dallas and places and I was in the scene of the
[17:15.440 --> 17:20.640]  mummy I was into no it was a collection of dead bodies they had a Nazi
[17:20.640 --> 17:23.600]  collection there with his top Nazi general was obsessed with dead bodies
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.280]  and had all these mummies and and then they had stuff from Europe just 200
[17:29.280 --> 17:32.560]  years ago and they had Egyptian mummies and then they had dead babies and
[17:32.560 --> 17:37.920]  everything and and I almost vomited when I got out of there in fact we went
[17:37.920 --> 17:41.960]  through it as quickly as we could and everyone else was about to vomit in
[17:41.960 --> 17:50.480]  there and when I was looking at those people last night I almost vomited I
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.880]  almost threw up I actually had vomit come up in my throat when I was looking
[17:56.880 --> 18:01.520]  at the weird narcissistic eyes and the little vampire smiles and the little
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.880]  and then all the pedophiles and pervs and all of them and I was having like
[18:05.880 --> 18:10.040]  flashbacks to those mummies and I was like and then Mackity was right beside
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.840]  me I want to vomit in front of her and I was physically physically becoming ill
[18:14.840 --> 18:21.640]  looking at this pile this pile it's like there's famous footage of Herman
[18:21.640 --> 18:26.840]  Guring the head of the Luftwaffe and a bunch of other stuff you know the big
[18:26.840 --> 18:32.600]  fat Nazi German the World War one ace heroin addict and they're in there with
[18:32.600 --> 18:39.040]  the Warsaw Pact and that was before that's selling out selling out Poland
[18:39.040 --> 18:43.000]  with the Russians and they're all rubbing their hands together and smiling
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.840]  like little piggy dolls and you know I could see that footage it's famous
[18:47.840 --> 18:52.280]  footage when I was a kid it was funny look at those stupid dictators it wasn't
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.640]  stupid they had hundreds of millions of people under their control and they did
[18:56.640 --> 19:00.880]  horrible things and now it was also they could sit around and rub their hands
[19:00.880 --> 19:04.200]  together that they had just gone and divided Poland and killed hundreds of
[19:04.200 --> 19:10.360]  thousands of people on the takeover and that's what it really comes down to is
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.040]  we have to not even hate these people but really realize how pathetic they are
[19:14.040 --> 19:17.040]  and that's the good news before I come back and give you my analysis and
[19:17.040 --> 19:22.240]  stare the Union is that they really are pathetic but that's also the bad news
[19:22.240 --> 19:24.880]  because that makes them even more dangerous they don't realize how
[19:24.880 --> 19:28.040]  pathetic they are and they can end up having a nuclear war or a bio weapons
[19:28.040 --> 19:32.000]  release or anything I mean they could do they could pull anything and the rest of
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.480]  the ruling class it's not completely evil you should be really concerned about
[19:35.480 --> 19:39.080]  not resisting this and speaking out against it and that's the good news a

[25:35.800 --> 25:40.360]  we were witness to last night and more analysis on the nightly news tonight
[25:40.360 --> 25:45.280]  Daniel Isdalon will be joining us for 30 minutes with the latest intel on

[26:01.320 --> 26:07.280]  take on the bank runs that are starting all over the world from Russia to England
[26:07.280 --> 26:11.760]  to the United States banks are trying to restrict the money that is coming in
[26:11.760 --> 26:15.880]  you got a drug report calm at least when I checked it a few minutes ago even has
[26:15.880 --> 26:20.520]  an image up there showing the Russian Bank and not letting people get their
[26:20.520 --> 26:27.160]  money out and that's our article from info wars calm and again if people
[26:27.160 --> 26:34.160]  aren't denial about that it's also Bloomberg reporting on that so zero
[26:34.160 --> 26:40.720]  hedge is also reporting on that we're gonna be breaking that down with Salente
[26:40.720 --> 26:47.520]  coming up by the way my voice sounds deeper than normal the cedar fever we
[26:47.520 --> 26:51.200]  call them cedar down here it's really juniper from Europe in the Middle East
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.120]  that's invasive and has taken over to kill most the oak trees in the last 150
[26:56.120 --> 27:01.480]  years and it's an accursed plant that has horrible horrible pollen when it
[27:01.480 --> 27:04.960]  grows the way it does here it's supposed to be like a hundred feet tall well here
[27:04.960 --> 27:08.560]  they grow like 20 feet tall and they're just everywhere and they use like five
[27:08.560 --> 27:14.920]  times the water of an oak or a elm or any other noble tree they're the most
[27:14.920 --> 27:20.480]  ignoble demons and it's like that movie the happening where the trees release a
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.040]  toxin to kill all the humans I mean that's literally what's going on here I
[27:24.040 --> 27:29.640]  mean if it was a government program and a government tax in Travis County or
[27:29.640 --> 27:33.200]  surrounding areas to eradicate them I would support that that would be
[27:33.200 --> 27:40.400]  government doing a good thing that is a public health issue it's like nerve gas
[27:40.400 --> 27:47.320]  or something I mean it is you can see yellow in the in the blowing outside it
[27:47.320 --> 27:52.920]  an example of an invasive species and you walk outside I need a respirator to
[27:52.920 --> 27:59.520]  go out there now because I drink more water and I take my supplements in five
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.240]  years ago I didn't take off for a week when the stuff was really I mean the
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.120]  trees are now orange ladies and gentlemen they're supposed to be green
[28:07.120 --> 28:10.480]  they're orange they're evergreens with with this with the pollen and they
[28:10.480 --> 28:15.440]  actually go and then you shoot it out like nerve gas and it's just clouds of
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.040]  this stuff and you know I don't even so much hate the trees as I love them I
[28:20.040 --> 28:28.000]  want them out of my universe they are horrible parasitic creatures and across
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.480]  the board oh they won't let us cut them down though because they claim a golden
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.400]  cheek warbler lives in them well if the golden cheek warbler nest in the morons
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.880]  then then explain to me what it did before the German and Polish and Czech
[28:41.880 --> 28:47.560]  settlers some of my ancestors but still which I could punch them in the nose they
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.680]  didn't know what they were doing brought these stinking things over here and by
[28:51.680 --> 28:54.640]  the way I'm now seeing them in California Californians you better kill
[28:54.640 --> 29:00.200]  these immediately and we actually have video of them when they release look at
[29:00.200 --> 29:04.920]  that you're watching us on prisonplanet.tv I mean this is what I'm
[29:04.920 --> 29:08.760]  bombarded with children are now getting rashes oh this is a whole other
[29:08.760 --> 29:16.000]  issue one of my best friends daughter two years old collapses they take her
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.080]  into Dell children's it's full of kids and they said well they said what did she

[29:24.760 --> 29:27.720]  what all these kids now have type 1 diabetes they go but that's genetic well
[29:27.720 --> 29:33.080]  they go well it triggers the genetic predistrib- predistribution and
[29:33.080 --> 29:39.080]  predisposition and then they would look at the numbers of type 1 exploding how's
[29:39.080 --> 29:44.880]  it exploding with genetic well it's viral pancreatitis folks but they won't
[29:44.880 --> 29:48.520]  even tell them that even though it's in the literature I'm gonna explain that

[33:28.760 --> 33:45.480]  There's some of the bombshell info Obama plagiarized Bush's 2007 State of the Union
[33:45.480 --> 33:51.360]  speech and the takeaway from that is I'm gonna be breaking this down there's
[33:51.360 --> 33:55.800]  video of it we're gonna play in a few minutes is that it just shows how the
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.960]  establishment rights the same old lies ropa dope everything's gonna be okay
[34:00.960 --> 34:06.640]  just work together trust the government we're all in this together so we all
[34:06.640 --> 34:10.320]  feel good and don't actually try to change the country and realize that
[34:10.320 --> 34:14.760]  globalism is the problem not the answer that the fruits of this political
[34:14.760 --> 34:22.000]  class are ultra bad not super good and then Kurt Nemo has an article on info
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.360]  wars.com State of the Union takeaway dictatorship and then another one CNN
[34:28.360 --> 34:35.240]  poll 67% oppose Obama's executive agenda and that's their their viewers
[34:35.240 --> 34:42.320]  their propagandized establishment viewers 67% I mean it's got to be 90%
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.120]  people I'm talking to are freaked out every black person I know that I talked
[34:46.120 --> 34:51.600]  to you the media says all support Obama still they don't support Obama I mean
[34:51.600 --> 34:55.520]  it's a hoax ladies and gentlemen there's another one crowd hammer when
[34:55.520 --> 35:02.720]  Obama repeated Guantanamo you knew he'd sort of run out of ideas absolutely he's
[35:02.720 --> 35:08.240]  like let me fly people secretly to black sites and ghost sites as they're
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.280]  properly called media calls and black sites really called ghost sites but it's
[35:12.280 --> 35:15.360]  take people at the real torture camps give me unlimited power to despair
[35:15.360 --> 35:20.200]  people why there's a law that directs the Pentagon to not let me do that I need
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.840]  I've got the NDAA saying I can do that but there's another law and he looks at
[35:24.840 --> 35:30.240]  the Joint Chiefs you need to get behind me it was all a push for
[35:30.240 --> 35:37.120]  dictatorship exactly as we knew and it's now being discussed on even MSNBC and
[35:37.120 --> 35:41.080]  they're even having trouble promoting well the Republicans are blocking
[35:41.080 --> 35:44.840]  everything so he's got to act alone but they're trying to sell it and CNN is
[35:44.840 --> 35:52.040]  trying to sell it but guess what tyranny is not being bought people really
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.320]  fundamentally yet we're in a depression for most people and you guys try to act
[35:56.320 --> 36:02.040]  like you know we're he said five years into a recovery Obama said he turned it
[36:02.040 --> 36:07.280]  around in a year no what they did was is game every statistic to a level ever
[36:07.280 --> 36:11.920]  before seen I mean this is the guy that had his people put out statistics that
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.360]  raising the debt doesn't raise the debt do I even need to explain to new
[36:16.360 --> 36:24.520]  listeners why that's a fallacy that's like saying 2 plus 2 equals 0 do I need
[36:24.520 --> 36:30.520]  to explain that 2 plus 2 does not equal 0 what is 2 plus 2 equal come on folks
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.160]  what's it equal if you're a new listener a big Obama supporter out there it
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.000]  equals 4 it does not equal 0 if you increase the debt it increases the debt
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.680]  by the way if you're a new listener you don't believe me he said that in a whole
[36:42.680 --> 36:46.080]  bunch of speeches and he said you can keep your doctor and it'll cut your
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.520]  thing in half and it'll be 2,500 a year and it'll be the cost of a cable bill or
[36:51.520 --> 36:55.520]  phone bill and I'm not gonna come after any of your guns and I'm not gonna hire
[36:55.520 --> 36:59.440]  a single lobbyist and I'm gonna be the most transparent and I'm not gonna have
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.440]  signing orders and I'm gonna give you five days to read the bills I mean
[37:03.440 --> 37:09.200]  everything is a lie even said in the campaign and the first state of the second
[37:09.200 --> 37:12.200]  state of the union I will not try to make churches be involved in abortions
[37:12.200 --> 37:14.440]  or birth control I'm in that fruit
[37:14.440 --> 37:22.720]  Obamacare does not have a member when he said Obamacare does not give
[37:22.720 --> 37:28.800]  illegal aliens free health care and then the congressman said you lie if you
[37:28.800 --> 37:32.160]  guys pull up the congressman the famous clip but congressman tells Obama you
[37:32.160 --> 37:37.840]  lie it'll be on YouTube and the whole and the whole point is but we'll play that
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.400]  old clip later I want to get to these new ones first well we played on the
[37:42.400 --> 37:46.240]  nightly news last night it's it's like when you're met with a solid wall of
[37:46.240 --> 37:54.240]  lies it's never been a solid wall I mean even even the controlled medium the
[37:54.240 --> 37:58.880]  state-run media had enough sense to tell some truth years ago or they knew
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.320]  they'd lose all their viewers but now in the face of having competition by new
[38:03.320 --> 38:08.680]  media by real media by alternative media by the media they've ceased to be media
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.160]  we now fill the vacuum we're not the alternative we are the media we're not
[38:12.160 --> 38:17.540]  as important as CNN I'm not bragging it's a fact we are more important we
[38:17.540 --> 38:21.000]  really will tell it like it is we really do have an agenda and we're open
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.080]  about it of freedom and telling the truth and stomping tyrants into the
[38:24.080 --> 38:28.360]  ground politically you know real advanced warfare is psychological real
[38:28.360 --> 38:31.520]  advanced warfare is never having a physical confrontation and that's what
[38:31.520 --> 38:34.920]  they're trying to do with us well I'm just hitting them with pure truth as
[38:34.920 --> 38:40.600]  pure as I can tell it we all see through rose-colored glasses we all distort
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.720]  things one way or the other light itself bends and is distorted in this
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.320]  time-space continuum but I'm trying to tell the truth I have a spirit of the
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.160]  truth I want justice and and that's who we are that's who you are if you have a
[38:55.160 --> 39:00.440]  local blog you're just as important as the local newspaper and that local
[39:00.440 --> 39:05.440]  newspaper has been proven to be a shell operation you're more important in fact
[39:05.440 --> 39:15.320]  you're the answer to their 1984 what Trump's a 1984 card 1776 I wonder what
[39:15.320 --> 39:24.000]  it is if you minus 1776 out of 1984 what number do you come up with now and
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.880]  now according to Common Core I could just say whatever number I want about 5
[39:26.880 --> 39:37.160]  million I mean what is the calculator 1770 208 whatever that means but under
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.040]  Common Core I could just say 250 why not you don't agree with me you're racist
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.600]  you don't like being lied to me know Obama said two weeks ago that it really
[39:46.600 --> 39:53.640]  hit me last night that that Obama said two weeks ago quote my approval rating
[39:53.640 --> 39:59.880]  is down because of race because of racism and I and I started ranting last
[39:59.880 --> 40:03.360]  night during the State of the Union you know over the commander in
[40:03.360 --> 40:10.880]  traitorship the the El Comedante El Hefe Kim Jong-un the great the dear
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.720]  leader and there it is Obama says racial animus blunts approval New Yorker
[40:15.720 --> 40:20.720]  reports Bloomberg reports on New Yorker I like how the guys actually pull up
[40:20.720 --> 40:23.560]  whatever I'm talking about so maybe the actual quote great job guys Johnny
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.840]  on the spot that's kind of sexist to say Johnny how about Jenny on the spot even
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.200]  though a guy did find it see they want us to be all obsessed with how we're
[40:31.200 --> 40:34.800]  being racist or we're being sexist or we won't even communicate because we feel
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.480]  guilty for doing nothing while they're engaged in total race baiting and
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.280]  division but it really hit me and I got angry last night I was thinking about
[40:42.280 --> 40:45.680]  all the stuff George Soros is doing trying to overthrow Ukraine and put
[40:45.680 --> 40:52.840]  him under EU tyranny and I thought about how when he was 11 to 15 how he was
[40:52.840 --> 40:58.240]  a top agent in major cities going in and getting Jews to trust him and then
[40:58.240 --> 41:01.120]  setting him up and stealing everything they had and he knew how to find where
[41:01.120 --> 41:06.080]  Jews were hiding and somehow that makes him a hero on 60 minutes where he
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.240]  admitted all that and said he it wasn't bad what he did because that's quote how
[41:10.240 --> 41:13.960]  he survived and that is the opposite of being a good person that is the opposite
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.360]  of being honorable and I just thought about how he has all these media
[41:17.360 --> 41:20.400]  organizations that attack me and hate me and say they're gonna infiltrate us and
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.280]  bring us down and it's like an act of war against me and my family you really
[41:24.280 --> 41:31.160]  are scum some freak Nazi collaborator is is is running the ADL and having them
[41:31.160 --> 41:36.760]  say I'm anti-semitic and having MSNBC say I'm deeply racist with no proof when
[41:36.760 --> 41:42.360]  my grandfathers both almost died in the Army Air Corps
[41:42.360 --> 41:51.320]  fighting at all Hitler I reject your racist crap you Nazi collaborating filth
[41:51.320 --> 41:54.560]  I've talked to my that knows George Soros they were in his house it's all
[41:54.560 --> 42:02.720]  black with black furniture what a freak man what a demon no wonder and I just
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.480]  really I'm just these people hate us these people are coming after us they're
[42:06.480 --> 42:14.640]  pure evil this guy worked with the people that tried to kill my grandfathers
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.560]  and then they have the nerve one month one grandfather crashed on landing
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.720]  almost died the other one was in a whole bunch of missions and then had each
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.080]  eye stroke from the Sun not wearing sunglasses and and and was blind for a
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.080]  couple days and that was by the grace of God because his plane took off with the
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.320]  crew when he wasn't piloting it and got blown up over Germany because they were
[42:36.320 --> 42:39.960]  in North Africa then they were in Italy and then my dad was explaining to me
[42:39.960 --> 42:43.840]  last night he's read all the stuff they were over Germany imagine my grandfather
[42:43.840 --> 42:48.520]  in flying coffins that's what he was flew in the B-17s being shot up being
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.680]  attacked the whole nine yards but by the grace of God had a had a what's it
[42:53.680 --> 42:57.040]  calling you burn your eyes in the Sun it's not a heat stroke it's a the point
[42:57.040 --> 43:03.360]  is by the grace of God he I wouldn't even exist I barely exist by a millimeter
[43:03.360 --> 43:11.240]  because flashburn flashburn and then here's George Soros and CNN and MSNBC
[43:11.240 --> 43:15.840]  saying I'm implying I'm a Nazi or something man that's those are fighting
[43:15.840 --> 43:21.160]  words you punk slime piece of crap I am so sick of you people with your fake
[43:21.160 --> 43:25.200]  moral high ground and then I start seeing Obama this race pimp and the
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.840]  Democratic Party it just started hitting me they were the Ku Klux Klan you can
[43:29.840 --> 43:35.080]  pull up the LBJ quotes from his letters and stuff and you know about how I'm
[43:35.080 --> 43:39.320]  not about to have these you know in words voting Republican and all this
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.040]  stuff and getting their rights and they were gonna get them all welfare and get
[43:43.040 --> 43:49.040]  these people back on the planet chasing these dirty stinking I mean this is the
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.840]  moral high ground of these George Soros a top Nazi collaborator moral high
[43:53.840 --> 43:59.280]  ground ADL gives him awards Arnold Schwarzenegger wears Nazi uniforms
[43:59.280 --> 44:04.200]  death's head Nazi belts told Rolling Stone he admires Hitler wants to be a
[44:04.200 --> 44:08.960]  dictator was in gay porn you know but my point is when a real conservative was
[44:08.960 --> 44:13.040]  in that they never get office but but he's because he's a sellout to the New
[44:13.040 --> 44:20.760]  World Order the ADL gives him awards I mean it's it's a the ADL are literally
[44:20.760 --> 44:28.840]  Nazi collaborators that just hit me I mean it is so wild yeah they just pulled
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.760]  up the quotes these inwards they're getting pretty uppity these days and
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.360]  that's the problem for us since they've got something now they never had before
[44:38.360 --> 44:46.000]  the political pull back up their uppetiness this is a LBJ now we've
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.200]  got to do something about this we've got to give them a little something this
[44:51.200 --> 44:57.360]  writer Eisenhower got the Civil Rights Act passed just enough to quiet them
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.680]  down not enough to make a difference well if we don't move at all then their
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.640]  allies will line up against us and there will be no way of stopping them we'll
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.880]  lose a filibuster and there'll be no way of putting the break all sorts of wild
[45:11.880 --> 45:20.320]  legislation it'll be reconstruction all over again by the Republicans I mean I'm
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.780]  not romanticizing the Republicans either but compare I mean the Democratic
[45:23.780 --> 45:28.920]  Party is Grand Dragon Ku Klux Klan but when the Republicans and the war vets
[45:28.920 --> 45:32.160]  and the Christians all came together said we're not gonna do this racist stuff
[45:32.160 --> 45:36.280]  anymore they go oh you know what let me take the Grand Dragon hat off senator
[45:36.280 --> 45:43.840]  oh I love you oh and you turn on MSNBC it's race this it's race that it's the
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.920]  exact stuff the Klan would use to try to recruit poor whites to politically
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.440]  control was just a mafia that's all it was Dixie mafia that's all they've done
[45:52.440 --> 45:56.680]  is now convert over and they're playing this giant race game now with
[45:56.680 --> 45:59.640]  everybody and they're gonna bring in the illegal aliens to be their 30 million
[45:59.640 --> 46:02.760]  strong new clan brigade and then another 30 million to vote take everybody's
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.280]  guns and then we're like hey that's a racist group and but we're not shut up
[46:07.280 --> 46:16.000]  raise we work better now I mean it's just I mean you got a Nazi collaborator
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.920]  you got Obama up here who knows full well he's manipulating blacks I mean it's
[46:21.920 --> 46:29.960]  just there they're so evil and and it's like Fox News CNN MSNBC Fox Sports the
[46:29.960 --> 46:36.520]  NRA is the new Klan when the NRA was founded to fight the Klan I mean it is
[46:36.520 --> 46:45.200]  literally literally false reality with these people literal false reality with
[46:45.200 --> 46:49.000]  the moron population out there Margaret Sanger said it you can pull up her quote
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.920]  she said we need to kill these black people we need to get control of them
[46:52.920 --> 46:57.560]  we won't buy off all the black preachers I'm gonna make sure nobody gets up any
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.780]  and we're gonna abort every one of these people and they've done it and then
[47:01.780 --> 47:04.420]  what if they couldn't abort you they create the gangster culture and sell
[47:04.420 --> 47:08.400]  out on MTV to destroy the black community and then like a disease that
[47:08.400 --> 47:12.720]  culture then spreads everywhere else to the entire world weaponized CIA culture
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.480]  you know it's been declassified they put out degenerate art degenerate porn to
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.360]  to again destabilize and sabotage the psyche and I always told you that was
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.480]  declassified last year they do that what do you think gay marriages and
[47:27.480 --> 47:32.520]  satanic ceremonies at every live TV event are what do you think them teaching
[47:32.520 --> 47:37.040]  five-year-olds to masturbate in public schools are it is meant to screw
[47:37.040 --> 47:43.880]  everyone up this is psychological warfare to where you don't care if you
[47:43.880 --> 47:48.400]  have the right to not have big banks get taxes passed to bankrupt you while
[47:48.400 --> 47:51.160]  they're exempt that's the real discrimination that's the true
[47:51.160 --> 47:57.520]  violation of equality equality means just weights and measures all men are
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.560]  created equal means all men have the same rights it does not mean everyone's
[48:01.560 --> 48:06.360]  actually equal if that was the case we I would be playing in the Super Bowl this
[48:06.360 --> 48:11.280]  week am I equal to those guys genetically no and all the drugs that are
[48:11.280 --> 48:20.560]  on no me should we put you know I don't go next door find some woman 110 pound

[48:34.960 --> 48:44.080]  it and that's just one example of the fraud of the complete and total fraud
[48:44.560 --> 48:50.040]  that is George Soros and Obama and all of them and I just reject you I see you
[48:50.040 --> 48:53.760]  and your filth and your con artist and your scum and your time's coming okay

[49:01.040 --> 49:05.600]  lobelist and try to blame it on us not gonna work as you know why quite
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.840]  frankly I don't want to die and I enjoy life but quite frankly I'm so dedicated
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.200]  in this quest to fight tyranny it's exhausting I'm not worried about you

[49:44.080 --> 49:48.080]  go ahead and play him saying citizenship is going after guns here it is
[49:48.080 --> 49:53.160]  citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us
[49:53.160 --> 50:02.080]  each day I've seen the courage of parents students pastors police officers all
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.880]  over this country who say we are not afraid to see courage and I intend to
[50:06.880 --> 50:11.920]  keep hiding guns without Congress we're not afraid more tragedies from visiting
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.640]  innocent America's invoking fear of guns shopping gun violence is down like
[50:16.640 --> 50:23.080]  51% total crime with guns 61% look it up just part of some numbers which they try
[50:23.080 --> 50:26.560]  to hide under their big fat bucks and you say well what if Obama's got bad
[50:26.560 --> 50:29.440]  statistics why are you saying those are good the British crime statistics have
[50:29.440 --> 50:33.800]  been proven fake by some of their top police chiefs the FBI numbers will come
[50:33.800 --> 50:40.920]  back and put the rest of it the FBI numbers the FBI numbers are collated
[50:40.920 --> 50:43.400]  off local crime statistics and they're not perfect but they're some of the best
[50:43.400 --> 50:47.840]  statistics in the world because they've been gathering them since the 20s and
[50:47.840 --> 50:51.400]  it's like how many murders where they're in Austin and give or take it's a pretty
[50:51.400 --> 50:57.480]  darn accurate number it's the model of statistics worldwide and the facts are

[54:55.840 --> 55:00.600]  Daniel is the one joining us is he in Spain or where's he at right now Spain
[55:00.600 --> 55:06.480]  he's gonna be joining us and then we're going to have Gerald Salante come on as
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.040]  well but I'll open the phones up at the bottom of the next hour there is so much
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.320]  news but again we have the clips but you saw him where Obama said he'll use
[55:14.320 --> 55:19.640]  dictatorial power to get done what he has to on guns you name it he said he'd
[55:19.640 --> 55:22.800]  try to legalize the illegals with executive orders if they wouldn't do it
[55:22.800 --> 55:28.560]  quote with or without Congress critics respond he doesn't have the authority to
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.480]  act unilaterally well it's not even critics it's the Constitution and
[55:33.480 --> 55:37.080]  Boehner said before the speech well he can do some stuff
[55:37.080 --> 55:40.280]  executively if we don't do it but it better not violate the Constitution the
[55:40.280 --> 55:45.360]  president acting alone on borders citizenship guns I mean that's all in
[55:45.360 --> 55:51.240]  the Bill of Rights folks and the Constitution on on military stuff the
[55:51.240 --> 55:54.440]  president does not have the authority to do that the Congress is like the
[55:54.440 --> 55:58.320]  football coaches they give the quarterback to place quarterback doesn't
[55:58.320 --> 56:03.760]  start calling the plays on his own and that's a fact in the referees of the
[56:03.760 --> 56:08.160]  courts but now we have the quarterback running everything and guess what he's
[56:08.160 --> 56:12.680]  playing for the other team and that's the issue if you study subversion how
[56:12.680 --> 56:16.040]  empires take over how the communists take over it's the same thing you come
[56:16.040 --> 56:20.640]  in you subvert you turn people against each other you dumb them down you take
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.360]  over the institutions and then have them do bad things who just credit the
[56:24.360 --> 56:27.680]  institutions so you can then fully destroy them and bring in tyranny
[56:27.680 --> 56:31.160]  that's why I don't just sit here and attack police even though they're trying
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.040]  to turn them into evil forces and in some cases they are is because that plays
[56:35.040 --> 56:38.840]  into it and then we attack the police and then they get told by the
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.920]  establishment see they're your enemy and then they're able to co-opt them while
[56:42.920 --> 56:47.560]  discrediting the institutions so they can later totally reform it into
[56:47.560 --> 56:52.280]  something 10 times worse oh Obamacare it's not working too well I'll just be a
[56:52.280 --> 56:57.160]  dictator and then make it worse don't worry I'm gonna make the insurance
[56:57.160 --> 57:01.040]  companies not kick you off and then he's not doing that it's all just here I'm
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.760]  gonna give you a hand oh I'm sorry I'm gonna give you a hand again maybe like
[57:04.760 --> 57:08.880]  if somebody said hey shake my hand you went whoo-hoo I'm too cool put your put
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.880]  your hand through your hair and you go shake my hand again suck to a two-year-old
[57:12.880 --> 57:19.400]  playing with them oh I tell you what shake my hand again oh shake my hand
[57:19.400 --> 57:24.320]  again and in this stunted society people want to be treated bad I mean on
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.560]  average women want to be treated bad they think that's dominance that's
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.720]  that's not dominance that's a twisted form of fake dominance on the surface
[57:32.720 --> 57:37.640]  men think it's cool to be treated bad and then whoever treats them bad must be
[57:37.640 --> 57:44.080]  in charge I mean it is just incredible it's incredible I mean they've written
[57:44.080 --> 57:46.440]  books about it but it's true you can walk up to beautiful women and tell them
[57:46.440 --> 57:52.120]  they're ugly and they'll go home with you I mean it is sick folks it is
[57:52.120 --> 58:00.280]  totally sick and it's not normal magicians will tell you that people are

[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.400]  Estalin from Spain is coming up with a key intel was inside sources inside the
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.240]  global power structure I've checked his sources this info is very good we'll be
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.040]  joining us for your video skyper is gonna be great usually on a crackly phone
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.640]  line did you say you had that clip I'm sorry I heard you say something in my
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.560]  ear okay well we're getting the club of Obama saying he'll act alone operate on
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.240]  his own but he's been saying that a lot in the state of the Union yesterday but
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.880]  later after Estalin leaves us I want to talk about Vladimir Putin because I
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.160]  really thought about Vladimir Putin a lot last night and the geopolitical
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.440]  things that are happening and when you've gone through the depths of evil
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.720]  like the Russians have for 80 years I don't romanticize the strongman Putin
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.920]  but there is a psychological thing that happens sometimes when someone's
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.240]  actually in control and Putin is in command to a great extent where people
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.640]  actually want to build up society and get what you call a philosopher king and
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.480]  the globalist actually endorsed that idea but they'd never really manifest and
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:33.160]  I don't I wouldn't say he is a philosopher king but he compared to
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.760]  Obama he is Vladimir Putin is a philosopher king compared to Obama
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.160]  because he's saying men need to be strong women need to be women and strong
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.880]  family don't try to recruit kids you want to destabilize us with psychological
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.480]  warfare I mean that's what it is they don't want to make kids gay because they
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.400]  love gay people they want to absolutely rewrite be like trying to teach you'll
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.520]  fish to be gay well they wouldn't reproduce there'd be no more fish it's
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.480]  extinct yourself there's nothing to do with hating someone's you know a sexual
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:12.360]  situation it's the force feeding of it and Putin I remember reading this and
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.920]  seeing this was a big fan of Alexander Silsen Eason who was wrote the gulag
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.880]  acapella and talked about a strong Russian nationalism going back to
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:28.320]  freedom being honorable being stoic and really kind of welding a 1776 type idea
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.160]  into the old Russian stoic Viking because that's what Russia is means the
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.440]  roost the red really founded by the Vikings Western Russia and merge with
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.840]  some Asian groups but that's what they are it's kind of an Asiatic Viking
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:49.040]  group Asian Vikings splice and that's why Russians are so smart but they also have
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.160]  their problems they were under Zara systems for so long that they never had
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.560]  a chance at freedom and then our criminal government with the big banks on
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.440]  record put the Bolsheviks in in 1917 I mean we owe Russia such an apology they
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.560]  been our ally all along against the British they did so much for this
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:11.200]  country in the Civil War you name it and then we just absolutely let the
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.400]  globalists put in the worst of the worst and just butcher those people up one
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.920]  side and down the other and they used Russia as a giant engine of evil against
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:24.760]  Ukraine Poland Romania the what's the Czech Republic now and then it created
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.880]  incredible enmity between Slavs and Slavs just total evil and now the West is
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.800]  attacking them with al-Qaeda and you look at Putin he clearly has people
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.160]  resonate with it he is confident because he he met a lot with Sholzenitsyn and
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.280]  Sholzenitsyn literally grabbed Putin and said you will not sell people out you'll
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.640]  stop being a gangster this is reportedly a decade ago this only leaked out
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.800]  through some of my connections and sources I went and checked it and it's
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.200]  been hinted at here and there and confirmed that Sholzenitsyn basically
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.480]  and he met with him right before he died too said stop stop being a sellout be
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.640]  and be a knight for Russia stand up be real they will follow you and that's why
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.760]  he came here in the 80s and Sholzenitsyn left very honorable stoic man because he
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.260]  came and saw the decadence and the evil and he was like it's growing here and
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:19.360]  it's like the Soviets did this to us they would just like a judo move take
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.160]  all of our own evil it was already there and then the punch comes they would
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.720]  take it and pull it along with them and that's why it's so easy to be evil
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.040]  because if you just want to wreck people and use their ignorance against them of
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.400]  course you can dominate them but who wants to dominate a destroyed person you
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.680]  only dominate someone who is coming down on you and has attacked you first and
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.000]  then all bets are off you gotta do whatever it takes to defeat them and
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.200]  that's what we need is real warriors of liberty and I'm not saying Putin is
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:57.520]  perfect but he has he has gone through a process that compared to Obama is very
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.240]  good Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty

[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.920]  going to do and he went on to say he used dictatorial powers to go after the
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.720]  Second Amendment and more so what a speech Daniel Estolin joins us he is a
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.720]  best-selling author and a Bilderberg sleuth I consider my friend of mine and
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.080]  he's written an excellent new book we're not selling it but we should be selling
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.800]  it at the info war store trans evolution the coming age of human
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.360]  destruction Daniel Estolin from the author of the true story of the
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.440]  Bilderberg group and it's available from trine day and is he able to save us
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.920]  before the after I forgot to ask you guys that or is he got to go at the
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.680]  bottom of the hour because I wanted to get that question into him earlier
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:42.280]  my star just ask him now before we go to him okay great now you know the whole
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.000]  point here is that everything he's talked about in a late Jim Tucker talked
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.640]  about and then I've talked about and Ron Paul's talked about and that Vladimir
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.440]  Putin was talking about it's bizarre folks that they put top people over
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.080]  Russian state-run TV that basically talk about cancer viruses and vaccines the
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:04.240]  plan to destroy the family the New World Order and the Russians are going with a
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.920]  truthful way to try to unify their country from outside attack and overthrow
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.640]  and I don't like the fact that Putin's been cracking down on the press and
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:19.360]  people but those are far-improven Soros run groups so it's a serious situation
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.680]  what do you do when you are being infiltrated by foreign powers that's
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.000]  what the New World Order is it's a corporate above-the-law breakaway
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.720]  civilization that wants to build its own global technocracy and Daniel Estolin
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:36.120]  I happen to know via some other connections and Tucker before he died
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.840]  and then some other folks and I brought it up to Estolin one time over the phone
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.120]  he said well yeah that is one of my sources that I mean he really does have
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.720]  these big sources high-level Hollywood high-level banking high-level
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:52.200]  Bilderberg and so that's why he's basically saying the same thing I say
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.520]  because it's not like we're reading from the same sheet of music it's not
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.000]  music we're looking at it's a death warrant on humanity we're looking from
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  different perspectives at the same program being rolled out and his book I
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.520]  just began to read it this weekend I'm almost done I even learned something
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:16.160]  reading and which which I mean I know a lot and and you know just the way he
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.680]  puts things really gets people to think and it's got a good cover to get the
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.360]  average folks thinking out there the reason I'm pitching and even though I'm
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:32.120]  not selling it is it is really really important for people to to understand the
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.720]  real mindset of who runs the planet and so I want to get into his book first but
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.480]  then the bottom of the hour I want him to give us his take on what's happening
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:48.880]  geopolitically the race from Spain to where he's at from Greece to Japan to
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.760]  everywhere towards dictatorship and towards Goldman Sachs people being
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:57.880]  appointed as presidents I mean this is this is corporate world government what
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.800]  he thinks about Soros trying to overthrow Ukraine because they wouldn't
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:07.840]  join the EU just simply amazing the time in history we're entering and the fact
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.720]  that we've been so right I wish we weren't right Daniel do you wake up a
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.240]  lot of times the middle of the night like I do and just wish that we'd been
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.960]  wrong I mean it's not very satisfying to be so dead on is it no it's not first
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.720]  of all it's great to be back on your show I certainly do consider you to be a
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.320]  very very good friend of mine very proud of all the things that you have done
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.680]  together over the years standing shoulder-to-shoulder way back in the 2006
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.600]  build-up a conference if you remember and a few other events as well so I'm very
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.840]  very very honored to be back on your show you know it's as you said you know
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:46.600]  from from Greece to Spain to the United States Ukraine Russia we've seen this
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.760]  before it's deja vu you know over and over and over again and beat Soros in
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.400]  in the Ukraine or beat Soros in the Soviet Union or post-Soviet Union Russia
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:05.640]  as they try to destroy Russia you know in the 1990s trying to turn into a lost
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.800]  at statehood it became a protectorate and you have the human rights watch in
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.880]  there you have the George Soros's and the Harvard endowment and then the
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.080]  Carnegie's and and Goldman Sachs and the same players over and over again at all
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.080]  these same locations always doing the same thing and as some of my sources have
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.600]  said when I asked them I said why do you guys always do the same thing over and
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.800]  over again they said to me because it works why would we change that's right
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.280]  that's why they run the same attack profile but I think that is their
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.720]  weakness is that if we get the public to realize that it's game over and I think
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.320]  their old tricks are starting to fail you know you have a very good point there
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.240]  Alex I listen to a show not every night but certainly a lot of the times because
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.400]  you know your morning is our afternoon yes it's 7 o'clock 7 15 in the
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:57.840]  afternoon here p.m. but you know back in 2005 when Jim Tucker God bless us all
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.720]  and I were the only two journalists who covered the Rotterhegeran built-up
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.000]  conference and at that conference I learned something which basically is the
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.280]  backbone to this new book the transhumanism of the coming age of human
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:17.200]  deconstruction it was based on the discussion at that meeting which later
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.640]  turned into the strategic trends report 2007-2036 which at the time was a
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.840]  secret source document on the future of humanity I got a hold of that in 2005
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.080]  I was looking through it and I said to myself this isn't the future this is the
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.760]  present and the present that they were talking about back in 2005 which turned
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.360]  in 2007 into a report which is now available you can download it on for
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.120]  free on the internet is the backbone of what we're seeing right now you know
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.840]  the age of transition transition to a global civilization and this is exactly
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.720]  what we're seeing right now it's out of the terms from back then that I remember
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.640]  reading in the report they were talking about flash mobs what was a flash mob I
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.560]  said to myself in 2005 I understand what it means well we do now you look at
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.240]  Turkey look at Kiev one day everything is fine the next day the city is being
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.880]  burned down by people we don't know where they came from that's a flash mob it
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.720]  wasn't the report which is the backbone to my book transhumanism amazing and
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.200]  just put it all in scope and then we'll drill down into details what is the
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.200]  master plan if you say had four minutes till break four minutes to talk to three
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:35.000]  million people and encapsulate if they succeed what will be left and what the
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.800]  time scales are you know it's interesting because you know the basis is the
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.760]  basic theory is this if you think of a pyramidal structure Alex six thousand
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.680]  years ago who controlled knowledge high priests and they fed it to us one little
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.640]  droplet at a time we the great and worse then or now basically we're fed this
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.800]  information just enough with so we can do our daily you know chores and and and
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.400]  live day-to-day well today this pyramid is upside down pyramid because of the
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:09.040]  internet revolution anybody anywhere in the world the UI somebody in Japan or a
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.880]  Koya Indian sitting in a tree in the middle of an Amazon forest with a
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.960]  computer and access to internet has access at his fingertips to the entire
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.320]  history of knowledge of mankind so if you're the elite that's bad news for
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.000]  them because suddenly the playing field because of these technological
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.080]  advancements has been evened on the one hand but on the other hand the elite
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.120]  said to themselves we got to do something and they're using the
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.720]  technology and the advancement to create a bigger and bigger and bigger gap
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.160]  which we thought were you know was actually being bridged so you know if
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.440]  you spent trillions of quadrillions of gazillions of dollars in trying to you
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.760]  know use the technology to get so far ahead of what we are right now you can
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.360]  actually do this because they have the money and the you know one of the things
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.240]  I'm talking about in this book and it is I think absolutely revolutionary is that
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.120]  our children your children my children my oldest daughter is 16 they're the last
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.760]  truly human generation of human beings on the planet her children and you know
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.760]  her children's children are gonna be transhumans posthumans men machine
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.600]  cyborgs beings who are not totally human humans who are not 100% beings will
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.040]  literally living at the cost of the greatest change in the history of
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:33.120]  mankind and it has nothing to do with a microchip in your hand it is technology
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.880]  that is so advanced that people literally will be able to in less than a
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.800]  generation download their consciousness onto a computer and live forever and
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.160]  that's what a transhumanist movement is all about that's why book is called
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:54.840]  trans evolution the coming age of human deconstruction and they're saying
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.360]  they're not going to give us free will they're just going to do it and it's so
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.000]  much more advanced than a chip we carry a little computer that watches
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.440]  everything we do and tracks everything we do better than a supercomputer of 20
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.080]  years ago now they have the quantum computers and the key here Daniel is
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.560]  the prediction of the future where Amazon can now ship you your order before
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:20.320]  you order it with 100% accuracy this was always the key the literal crystal ball
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.080]  where they get enough data on the world and how things work they can predict the
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.400]  future and then with that data they can manipulate the future we're literally
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.880]  seeing godlike power being given to this degenerate elite it's very interesting
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.040]  Alex in the last 50 years we've learned more than the entire history of mankind
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.920]  and the next 20 will have learned more than the last 15 than all the history of
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.520]  mankind and it's going to get to a point in about a generation and a half from
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.720]  now where we'll be doubling our knowledge every year and that's something
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.760]  unfathomable for people because we don't even know what the future is going to
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.000]  look like and that's one of the things about this book you know build a book I
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.760]  answered a lot of the questions but with this book when you finish it you have
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.720]  more questions than answers because it's the future and we really don't know even
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.280]  if we try to extrapolate it there's just so many unknowns but we certainly see
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.440]  where all of it is going that's right and the elite may be good at watching us
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.600]  manipulating us but look at them themselves trying to dumb us down and
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.400]  control us that shows they're not enlightened right there and with this
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.160]  power I don't know if we're gonna make it out of this Daniel. Well you know they
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.520]  need to dumb us down you know the basement of education is part of it
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.800]  because people who are aware of what's going on people who understand history
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.880]  you understand geography who can add who can subtract who are interested and keen
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.320]  and who realize that what separates us from animals is this divine spark of
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.280]  reason that we have which allows us you know to invent to investigate to
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.640]  discover to empower individuals with a spark of creativity to where we might
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.440]  have our own destiny instead of being their robot slaves. Do you know about the
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.640]  NSA loophole or maybe you think your law-abiding ways are too boring for them
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.520]  to care about you tell that to the Virginia farmer who was audited by the
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:14.360]  IRS because of her Tea Party activities or the Texas man who woke up to a SWAT

[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.120]  Hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.280]  you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotsSupply.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.200]  Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.400]  with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.080]  us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:23.720]  Patriots was born. MyPatriotsSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.440]  funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.320]  hard-working American men and women. It is rare to find companies who practice

[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:18.720]  Don't want no shackles. That's my good buddy Jimmy Vaughan bringing us in. Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:30.960]  Land that acoustic. Don't want no shackles. Don't want no shackles on me. See that's the issue is they are
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.120]  seducing us with these technologies. They're rolling them out. They let it
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.560]  have some good aspects but down the road we're already now to that point it's
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.280]  about total human control. The NSA all of it and like children the public are
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.120]  taught to deny that this stuff's even going on but Daniel Ustalin is an expert
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.120]  on this he has the sources so much of this is now out in the open. A big hope
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.480]  is within the establishment itself they may need to basically get
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.480]  religion to understand this program will destroy them but they say they're
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.720]  willing to do that if it allows them to have immortality. They believe they'll
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:12.800]  have immortality merging with her to use that example with a popular film out
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.680]  there very powerful dystopic film I'm gonna do a review of soon and that's
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.000]  what we're facing here. This is the end of humanity. You can see this
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.840]  technology is dumbing us down it's not empowering us overall because it's being
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.120]  deployed in a dehumanizing way. Daniel Ustalin this is the most powerful
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.440]  interview ever with you. You're really getting fiery here talking about to be
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:40.440]  or not to be. That is the question that spark of humanity. Well I choose to be
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.600]  a human I've seen all the disasters these people engage in and what I'm saying
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.960]  is they've got a big plan they are visionaries they're in control they
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.640]  steal our wealth but I'm saying I don't like their dream and I don't think their
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.000]  dream will succeed but regardless we need to educate the public about their
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.640]  nightmare they're trying to create Daniel Ustalin. Absolutely Alex you know
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.720]  God bless you you know what what is absolutely you know is true is that the
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.920]  rise of the machine is here and we're facing the time of the unconscious
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.120]  evolution period is almost finished and we come to this new period when a
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.520]  controlled human evolution can and will happen and the elite believe that it
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.320]  will happen technological progress will be concentrated on making a new body
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:28.560]  for the human being. The plan is to incrementally move the human mind into
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.080]  more disembodied and futuristic vehicles not bodies but vehicles first a
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.920]  humanoid robot controlled entirely by the human brain via brain machine
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.120]  interface then a conscious human brain transplant into a humanoid robot then
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.160]  consciousness uploaded to a computer and finally a hologram that contains a full
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:55.080]  conscious human mind DARPA is finding dozens of human augmentation projects
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.160]  around the world to radically improve the performance mental capacity and
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.280]  resilience first and soldiers obviously and then later on in humans
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.440]  everything from tapping the potential of our unconscious mind to augmented
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:12.760]  cognition and the creation of of an uninhibited combat vehicles or by the
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.320]  military expects in the very near future for individual pilots to fly entire
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.960]  squadrons of robot planes they're working on you know this mind-boggling
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.120]  experience such as cybernetic insects and we see this in films like G.I. Joe it's
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:33.280]  already there it is a total genetic rewrite of the planet overthrowing the
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.200]  creation and then you look at the byproduct the fruits of all their
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.760]  programs it's dehumanizing it's not even empowering and they're not being honest
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.360]  with the public all the white papers you're mentioning that your books based
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:51.040]  on it's out there it's on record but people need to understand this is the
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.720]  end of humanity and they are aggressively right now trying to destroy
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.840]  the family by the mere Putin speaks out against that and he's a bad person you
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.240]  know because of the synergy Alex the interplay of three great revolutions the
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.560]  quantum the computer and biotech revolutions again we have learned so
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.760]  much in such a short period of time the marvels of science like the internet
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.600]  telecommunication satellites laser beams radio television microwave structures
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.880]  of DNA molecules biotechnology all of it ultimately comes from quantum theory and
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.320]  they dominate this you know we have the means through genetics robotics
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.800]  information technology and nanotech to control matter energy and life itself we
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  have never seen anything like this before and it is raising profound questions
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.440]  about what it means to be human and some of these questions you know we're seeing
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.600]  by public officials Putin is talking about this which is one of the reasons
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.760]  I'm mentioning this it is being completely ignored in the United States but
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.280]  these intense cross-pollination between the computer biotech and quantum
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.480]  revolutions will give us unprecedented power in the 21st century and this is
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.520]  something that as you said people simply are unaware of that's right and if I'm
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.040]  gonna talk to you in the next long segment this is intriguing Daniel about
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.400]  your ideas to try to turn this around because I believe that we can have a
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.880]  revolution to your book and other systems of understanding about this and
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.160]  have humans know that they've got to actively be part of this decision-making
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.080]  process it could actually empower humanity with the nanotech the rest of
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.040]  it and we could literally be launching space fleets in just a few decades to
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:34.480]  colonize space in a way to empower humanity while maintaining our humanity
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:41.160]  but also if we choose then having a separate almost avatar that we test
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.880]  these systems with and I believe that is the program that should be followed but
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.120]  I want to talk about this on the other side with you
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:59.920]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.160]  banks because they know they're rewriting the entire genetic code of the
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.720]  planet in case things go wrong they have a backup what about a backup for
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.200]  humanity
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:44.240]  undoubtedly the the eugenicists that develop biometrics in 1860s and
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.960]  envisioned the genetic code and the double helix that has been the ancient
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.880]  sign of medicine for 6,000 years the ancients do a lot more folks than the
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.560]  modern historians will tell you and that's all part of the secret societies
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:02.360]  that's all part of the Illuminati the priest class that Daniel Estelman was so
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.640]  eloquently investigative journalist best-selling author sold tens of
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.960]  millions of copies of his nonfiction books in Europe he's also written novels
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:14.840]  that are basically like Pachinic real but the names are changed to protect the
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:22.520]  innocent and a lot of important information at his website as well and I
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.480]  will give you that address it's dandleslan.com I know his site but he's
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.760]  got several several others up there but that's that's the main one it's an
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.920]  excellent site but I want to talk to him about free will because that's what
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.360]  he's getting in here this is freedom versus slavery I'm not against humans
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:45.000]  developing and advancing the problem is the spirit that animates the ghosts that
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.880]  animates the globalist machine is very anti-human very predatory hey let the
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.560]  troops use D you let them die hey let the navy drive through the radiation and
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:58.880]  let the troops be in wheelchairs and catheterize and dying so what but then
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:04.160]  have football games how much we love the troops the globalist hate pure good
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:10.760]  loving people they hate altruistic knights more and more I realize that they
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.760]  are threatened by good people because they've cheated to get into control and
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.760]  they can't help their psychopathic and sociopathic and other you know criminology
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.080]  designations and it is a predatory group that's infested civilization since its
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.880]  beginnings so I want to ask Daniel Estolin we need to put out because
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.120]  obviously no one's gonna stop this march forward and the church is so
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.720]  controlled they just say oh the world's gonna end next week don't worry about it
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.200]  but obviously that's not what's going on here there's a great challenge coming we
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.040]  need to be the salt of the earth and I'm asking you what you think we should do
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.600]  to say hey there is advanced breakaway civilization it's 30 40 years ahead the
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.320]  globalists say a how advanced are they in the breakaway civilization in the
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.160]  corporate government reservations and be what is an alternate vision where we
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.480]  can try to capture the imagination of the public about what's really happening
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.320]  so they're not obsessed with Justin Bieber and they're obsessed more with
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.840]  giant space colony missions to the nearest star systems and habitable
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:17.040]  planets and the real trailblazer master builder spirit of humanity it's a very
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:21.480]  good questions Alex very very good questions you can summarize it I think
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:26.760]  the following way you know you have to understand that the people who are our
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:33.080]  enemy are not the rocker fellows of Rothschild so just the names but it's
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.520]  it's it's a different movement one of the things I talk about in the book is
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:43.360]  transhumanist movement we're taking as this vector for the future mega projects
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.640]  such as Russia 2045 movement which they intend to create this new civilization
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:53.000]  aimed at future human development and evolution by integrating these new
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.720]  discoveries and developments from science from physics you know energetics
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.640]  aeronautics bioengineering nanotechnology a neurology cybernetics cognitive
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.640]  science and on and so forth and the rocker fellows of this world really have
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.120]  nothing to do with to say in this matter because they will have been dead by
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:13.080]  that but the point is that the transhumanists and I think the face of
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:18.120]  transhumanism is Ray Kurzweil one of the greatest inventors of the 20th
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.320]  century unfortunately a lot of the things that being done by him right now
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.760]  I'm very little to do with helping humanity he was what he's the the end of
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.120]  Google development he thinks he's gonna become God that's right exactly Ray
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.440]  Kurzweil now the whole idea behind this transhumanist movement if you want to
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.280]  know what it is it's the simplest H plus human plus transhuman is this ultra
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.520]  high-tech dream of computer scientists philosophers neuroscientists and many
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.360]  others to use radical advances in technology to augment the human body
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.800]  human mind and ultimately the entire human experience and these people wish
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:59.360]  to become post-human which is someone who has been modified and with
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:04.400]  performance enhancing body not drugs body and brain augmentations to the point
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:09.140]  that they could no longer call themselves human which is why again the
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:13.840]  Rockefellers have nothing to do and they describe us like bugs that okay you
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.760]  don't have to get augmented but you'll be like a bug we might step on you and
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:24.000]  and my issue is that Google and the rest of them at the head of this the
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.240]  systems are all being designed to control they they claim on the surface
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.440]  it's a system to empower but I don't see that at the heart of absolutely right
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.840]  you got it you're absolutely right you're one of the few people who said it
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.400]  exactly how it is look newer chip interfaces computer chips that connect
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.920]  directly to the brain are being developed right now and the ultimate goal of
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.680]  the brain chip will be to increase intelligence thousands of times over
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:52.480]  basically turning the human brain into the supercomputer lifelong emotional
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:56.800]  well-being is also a key concept you know for the transhumanist movement and
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.760]  they can achieve this through a recalibration of the pleasure concenters
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:07.720]  in the brain pharmaceutical mood renders have been suggested wire lips exactly
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.800]  which will be cleaner and safer than the mind-altering drugs this is Huxley's
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:18.280]  21st century vision of scientific dictatorship without tears but behind
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:24.880]  all of this no matter how you look at it you know this technology is something
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.840]  that you know we've talked about a lot before it's a transhumanist movement and
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.800]  the post humanity you know will be a new human which has been genetically
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.320]  engineered and brain chip for total control part men and part machine this
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.280]  new man will no longer have a need of the sexual reproductive functions right
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.520]  at least plan is to reduce the world's population you know I can't think of a
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.280]  better way to do that and not only that but was through synthetic biology the
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:56.840]  changing our DNA through genetically modified crop they can literally create
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:02.360]  beings who are not human that have never existed on the planet Earth so why do
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.040]  they need men and women you know as a couple they don't need that anymore
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.640]  which is why as you said on your website yesterday I think it was you know
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.800]  talking about the Illuminati agenda at the last Grammy Awards although this was
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.080]  exactly why they're pushing it and this is one of the reasons why they hate
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.640]  people like Putin who is absolutely against this kind of an agenda that's
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.080]  right and and and here's the key I want to ask you this point they're
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.160]  toxifying the environment on purpose then the crisis comes they use that to
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:33.800]  bring an agenda 21 and neo feudalism to shut people down for social control so
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.840]  we can then follow their scientific dictatorial edicts always posing as the
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.600]  savior and clearly destroying reproductive fertility clearly wrecking
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  humanity where it's going to be impossible to live in the civilization
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:55.000]  unless you accept the transhumanism it is simply simply amazing this this
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:02.800]  is beyond a HP Lovecraft book it's beyond a brand stroke you know Dracula this
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.080]  is this is literally something out of the mind of the devil well these
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.520]  technologies and again you talked about this are not being developed to stop the
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.600]  terrorists but rather to stop us the people and the laws to justify these
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:22.000]  technologies they're not written on a whim they're specifically designed to
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.680]  give the government carte blanche authority over the people during the
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:30.520]  chaos and confusion of the period we're in right now which the elite called the
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:36.240]  age of transition transition to a planetary civilization and I think
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:40.400]  people have to realize that the big lines in the Gaddafi's are not the enemy
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.320]  they never wore the enemy we the people of the enemy that's right we are
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.000]  allowing ourselves to be seduced by this as we cover in my film in-game
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.880]  blueprint for global enslavement that you're in and when that came out a
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.720]  year ago it was a big hit because people thought it was science fiction now
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.000]  they're watching at the films more popular than it's ever been because now
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.120]  it almost all came true eight years later you know I used to buy boxes of your
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.360]  film Alex you know and you know going trips because I travel a lot last year
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.600]  I did 240,000 kilometers about 200,000 miles of traveling around the world and
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:19.000]  I used to give you a CD's of your films away to people and they're saying who is
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.440]  this Alex Jones character I said watch the film and you'll realize and again
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.440]  please understand those who are watching and listening to us right now these are
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.560]  not publicly funded projects for the betterment of humanity but they're
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:36.480]  mostly secret experiments sanctioned in the name of defense which when you put
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:41.640]  her in its head is crime prevention and extrapolated into the future is tailor
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:48.160]  made to put down any rebellion by the 99% of the world's population destined
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.800]  to live in abject poverty and crime-infested mega cities of the future
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.000]  just as the strategic trends report talks about which I read way way way back
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.440]  in 2005 almost 10 years ago and so much if not all of it is you know coming
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:07.760]  true that's what's incredible that's what's incredible and people need to
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.280]  understand they go I don't care the NSA watches me or whatever because I've been
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.680]  nothing wrong well why don't you live in a glass house then why don't you I mean
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.240]  I'm tempted to dress up like an agent you know in black I'm a man in black and
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.240]  then go look in people's windows in broad daylight and see them call the police
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.480]  on me and I'm gonna say well what's wrong the government does it just to
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.520]  illustrate with a camera crew or to go up people on the street and say do you
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:34.080]  mind if you were clean a clear raincoats just to make sure you're not
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.760]  carrying a weapon and they'll go well of course I'm not gonna do that go away
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:41.080]  New York's already trying to make people only have clear bags you know the point
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:45.640]  is we're being trained to be slaves not even to be enslaved but to stand down
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:52.080]  so we can be erased Daniel let me ask you this question do you think they're
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.160]  gonna succeed what is your gut tell you and what is the time frame because I
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.040]  don't know the time frame is because again one of the things about this book
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.880]  and it's a bit unnerving in the sense that it asks more questions than it
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.760]  answers because again we're talking about the future but I think you know
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.680]  what it's absolutely undeniable is this divine spark of reason which makes us so
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.080]  different from anything else on this planet can never be replicated no matter
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:21.480]  whether your name is Ray Kurzweil you know Jason Silva or any one of these
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:25.080]  other characters billionaires and zillionaires who want to literally turn
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:29.920]  us into something we're not men machine you know future post humans they are
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.800]  beings who are not fully human sure they will never be able to ever be able to
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:40.360]  replicate exactly he says from a storage thing full of his dad's papers he's
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.080]  gonna resurrect his father there is no way Ray Kurzweil is gonna
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:49.280]  resurrect his real father he may have a computer that can fool him and he thinks
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.760]  it's his father and he says he doesn't believe in God yet he's gonna be the
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:59.240]  first God I call it the God race the race to be God and it's as old as the
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:04.560]  Garden of Eden it's as old as the Tower of Babel and if we tried to
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:08.480]  build a new future out of love and compassion and transparency we might
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:13.320]  destroy ourselves but from this delusional perspective my concern is
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.880]  is these people are they want to control us but who controls them if closing
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.960]  comments and thank you so much for the time I'm gonna read the whole book I
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.680]  want to get with your publisher and carry it as well in the info or store
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.200]  just another amazing job Daniel last one what do you want to leave us with in
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:32.760]  two minutes you know I just want to go over some of the things that this
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:38.000]  report the strategic trends 2007-2036 talked about they're talking about
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.920]  by 2015 over 50% of the world's population will be living in urban
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.560]  rather than rural environments in one generation between 2007 and 36 the
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:52.760]  population will go from 7 to 10 billion people they're talking in this report
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.800]  about lack of food water medicine proper hygiene education and basic human
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:03.360]  necessities will spell collapse and without missing words the report states
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:08.280]  explicitly a growing gap between majority and a small number of highly
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:14.520]  visible super rich is likely to pause an increasing threat to social order and
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.400]  stability the result of the growing desperation on the part of humanity will
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.840]  result in civil war intercommunal violence insurgency pervasive
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:30.000]  criminality and widespread disorder this is from 2005 then they talk about that
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  the countries the nation states because of the collapse of the job with a global
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.240]  economy and a breakdown of the international political system these
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:43.960]  are all terms from the report will disappear and will be replaced by
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.840]  mega cities and a mega city is defined in the report as a city of a base
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:54.840]  population minimum 20 million people and then they say because of the massive
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:00.360]  population displacement cities will swell to unimaginable proportions and as a
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:06.720]  result of that mega cities themselves will collapse by the year 2045 and the
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.720]  effect of this collapse will be equivalent to state failure and to
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:14.280]  endemic failure of the entire and of course that's the British Ministry of
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:18.520]  Defense report that you had already gotten a copy of in 2005 that came out
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.000]  what in the Guardian in 2007 or was it a that's right that's right exactly what
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.600]  we had in 2005 when we attended the building conference with Jim our sources
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.040]  gave us the report not a complete report because it wasn't written at the time
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.440]  but parts of the report and we're seeing their agenda on right now and again
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:40.480]  transhumanism is changing the face of society and people have to become aware
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.760]  that what's around us and what we are about to become in the very near future
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.760]  will be completely different from anything we have ever seen in the history
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.520]  of mankind that's right let me quantify this their scientists their doctors
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:58.760]  their technocrats the whole world's a laboratory in their own words they
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.840]  believe out of this epic struggle in a war against general humanity in
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:08.080]  survival of the fittest they will become gods in the great cyber wars the
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:12.160]  great technocrat wars the biotech wars that are to come they have the
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.920]  underground bases the redoubts the supercomputers and and and that they
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:20.560]  will then rid the earth of the scourge of the proto-human as they see us and
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.400]  they will become I forget the exact term they use you know this sentient
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:30.320]  omnipresent super sapien and it is just totally delusional and in the end of the
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.000]  day we'll be lucky if they don't destroy the entire planet give me 10 seconds I'll
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.320]  just have to say this Alex you know they feel that I have enough technology
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:42.040]  right now to face the gods and beat them at their own game and they feel that
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:46.960]  they today are the gods that's right they they don't let people at Builderburg
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.280]  look at any of them and it just shows their total disconnect I talked to so

[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.960]  Daniel us when that is by far best interview ever unbelievable how do I
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:21.360]  become up with a headline good enough to describe how epic these these issues
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:25.560]  are I mean that's why I don't go out to Hollywood anymore when famous people
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.320]  invite me out there why do I care that's why I don't care about being on red
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:33.160]  carpets and stuff and what does it do only if I could get those people to go
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.920]  public to try to cause an awakening and an understanding that's the only
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:44.600]  reason famous people are important you know I just wish there was a new planet
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.520]  to go to but we would carry with us the same seeds of our own destruction we've
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:56.160]  got a battle here you've got to go on to the end there's no way to run in the
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.160]  long run but it may come down to some people having to go to places that are
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:07.480]  safer they can operate better or they can have asylum but some people say well
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.520]  it's time for violence defensively you have a right to defend yourself and
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.200]  when you're on the right that's what you got to do I'm not trying to stop you
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:21.920]  believe me I'm all about violence it's a good friend of mine feels good to stand
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.800]  up it feels good to be a man it feels good to be strong feels good to not be
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:29.120]  afraid you got to be smarter than that you got to go to the higher levels of
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.400]  warfare you got to just tell the truth and put the truth out there as a
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:41.680]  comparison to the other option that is the lie this is not a pretty place we're

[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.160]  of God the supreme being perhaps they'll see how ugly they are
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.320]  spiritually and gain knowledge because they say with great knowledge comes
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:34.600]  great sorrow for those that are pure of heart with this great knowledge isn't
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:39.080]  nothing but a magnifying glass so they can enjoy their crimes against humanity
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:45.160]  that much more you know my biggest issue is as I come to full grips with what we
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:50.840]  face as a civilization and as a species in our long history I realize that my
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:56.200]  life is a flash in the pan twinkle in the eye at the lilies of the field out
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:02.680]  out brief candle but that it is the great struggle of the race to uplift
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:07.000]  ourselves and become nobler that I am part of and that you are part of and
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.600]  that what matters to me is that we make it to the next level and don't destroy
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:16.280]  ourselves and the greatest crime of the establishment is telling us how bad we
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:21.000]  are all day and except when the leader comes out Obama and then he tells us
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.880]  we're good and so we go oh he must be good because he's telling us we're good
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:29.040]  I mean it's disgusting they know exactly what they're doing and it's like
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:39.760]  watching a Navy SEAL beat up a newborn baby it's like watching an NFL linebacker
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:46.240]  you know beat up a one-year-old I mean it's it's really pathetic that they sit
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:53.200]  there and abuse these people and then laugh at them it's disgusting and I
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:59.080]  personally get to the point up here where trying to run this operation
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:03.080]  everything we do that you know and the way the establishment tries to guilt
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:06.800]  anyone in new media that tries to fund themselves I mean it's all just mind
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.520]  games manipulating good people and it's time to vote with your dollars it's time
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.800]  to spread the word about news sites like info wars.com prisonbunna.com
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:21.040]  rogerport.com it's such a beacon of liberty it's time to really get behind
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.640]  the sources that will talk about the real issues that matter and actually put
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:31.040]  those on the front of the table our ascension is a great responsibility but
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.800]  it's only happening because great tyranny is rising it's a battle it's a
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.640]  war it's not a bunch of narcissistic baloney it is a struggle and you will
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.240]  find that in that animating struggle of liberty an animating contest you will
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:49.160]  find your humanity and I know you know that but don't don't just take our
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:52.600]  incredible reports for granted that are on prisonplanet.tv and the YouTube
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:56.560]  channel don't just take the news sites and the articles for granted I mean it
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.040]  is hard work to ever get to this point a lot of prayers a lot of providence and
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:06.200]  I'm telling myself that I better appreciate the position I'm in I better
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:13.720]  understand that I can't get I can't get target fatigue being so close to this
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:19.080]  get acclimated to just how big a situation we're in and I do in closing

[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:32.520]  humanity has to make we'll be looking at trends and move towards dictatorial
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:37.920]  government worldwide and the fact that we are going into a global meltdown these
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:42.000]  bank runs that are happening with Gerald Solente one of our favorite guests and
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:48.240]  a good friend coming up in the next segment but here are some of the articles
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:54.800]  that are up on info wars.com right now award Edward Snowden the Nobel Peace
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:01:00.440]  Prize that came out in the news earlier today CBS Norway lawmakers nominate
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:05.600]  Edward Snowden for Nobel Peace Prize that would be a major coup against the
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.560]  tyrants but I don't think they'll actually vote for them they vote for Al Gore
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:13.200]  and Henry Kissinger why not vote for Joseph Stalin while they're at it or
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:18.560]  Genghis Khan but how about the people award him the Nobel Peace Prize how
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:24.000]  about we get millions of likes on a new Facebook page that we just created that
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.280]  when you like it and get other people to look at it it will point out that he's a
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:34.880]  hero not a traitor like the establishment has said and he exposed
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.000]  what we already knew on many many fronts and Paul Watson's gonna do a video on

[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:21.640]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:27.080]  to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:32.400]  on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:36.560]  previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:19.840]  raising the debt ceiling which has done been done over a hundred times does not
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:26.000]  increase our debt it does not somehow promote profligacy all it does is it
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.720]  says you got to pay the bills that you've already racked up

[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:19.080]  Fauber who's been a really accurate guy and a great fund manager he says
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:25.080]  insiders are selling like crazy shorting us stocks he says by treasuries and gold
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:28.240]  and it's coming out in mainstream ish what you're also lente and others have
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:31.040]  been saying for years and Bob Chapman rest is sold they've been suppressing
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:35.880]  gold prices with naked shorting you name it hey you like how Dinesh D'Souza has
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.880]  been arrested for supposedly giving a little bit too much money to a campaign
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:47.160]  of his friend but John Corsign or the IRS persecuting people and there's also a
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:52.080]  question up on info wars comm and article why are so many top British
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:58.240]  bankers jumping off of bridges and we're gonna get into that article I mean
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.440]  it's like every day somebody's jumping off a bridge or their own banking
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:07.200]  buildings killing themselves now look the collapse came years ago we've been
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:13.120]  in a recession since 2008 depression in many areas last four years they've gone
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:17.560]  into this QE unlimited while depressing the real economy so that it wouldn't
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:20.920]  create too much inflation but inflation has increased so they've been trying to
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.080]  cover that up and now currencies all over the place are in this mad race I
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:29.760]  mean we are sitting on top of it's like somebody's had 10 heart attacks they're
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:33.200]  85 years old and you're gonna make him walk up a hundred flights of stairs what
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:38.240]  do you think's gonna happen and this is a serious situation but but there's so
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.240]  much mind control though Obama can say raising the debt limit doesn't raise the
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:46.880]  debt he can say you're gonna keep your doctor it's gonna cut your rate in half
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:50.880]  and then get rid of your doctor double your healthcare on average I mean it
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:55.080]  it's the overthrow of reality appears to be what they're doing because they
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:59.160]  think the public is so insecure and so uninformed that as long as there's a big
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:02.760]  stage and people are clapping for him Obama could say two plus two equal to
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:07.080]  billion I mean this is an overthrow of reality that's what George Arwell wrote
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:12.760]  about 1984 and they've pretty much done it to a certain extent but they can't
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:15.760]  overthrow the communist Chinese and the Russians they can't overthrow super
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.840]  bugs they can't overthrow the reality of what's going on so they're on classic
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:26.480]  megalomaniac power trips most 95% of people they've got studies and a big
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:28.680]  documentary out about it I'm gonna get that director on if you get the name I
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:34.520]  saw it last year where 95% of people are more it's over 95% that win 10 million
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.480]  20 million dollars in a lottery in a year they're totally depressed half broke
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.600]  in two three years they're totally broke or in jail it destroys them power
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:46.400]  corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely money destroys marriages money
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.080]  power destroys marriages power is a curse folks unless you do it for
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:56.760]  absolute good then it's very empowering that's the archetypal night's quest or
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:00.960]  the hero's quest and the globalist are the enemy of the night's quest even of
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:07.240]  these wars have been frauds they hate real virtuous military because they're
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:12.480]  the only people out there that could ever organize in a totalitarian physical
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.320]  takeover a resistance now the general public being virtuous and voting with
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:19.880]  their dollars and creating local communities and buying local we can
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:22.080]  defeat them the other way but they're going to start a fight before that
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:30.680]  happens but they are I mean cowards and scum have always hated real men and real
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:34.440]  women and they always want to tell us how we're wrong and we're not virtuous I
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.040]  am virtuous I care about people I want to live in a good world with good people
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.040]  I treat people like I want to be treated I'm not perfect the complexity of life
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:46.480]  means you stubble people's toes and don't even mean to do it the difference is
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:50.560]  I want to be good I like being good does it mean I'm perfect does it mean I
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.040]  don't have an evil side that I could slide into just like that you got a big
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.600]  good side you're gonna have a evil side folks the point is I choose good now I've
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:04.320]  put in my rant there Gerald Salente joins us and I always enjoy him coming on
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.540]  for the balance of the hour trends research comm friends journal comm will
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.120]  actually get you there as well great site a lot of videos and trend updates
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:16.520]  there Gerald I've kind of set the table the last three four minutes with a
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:21.720]  potpourri of points I've laid out there about the state of civilization going
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:26.520]  into this decadent cycle what do you want to tackle first well let's look at
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:31.040]  the state of the Union address last night as you were mentioning you know I
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:37.080]  watched it you know entirety and you know and it was a it was really flat you
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.840]  know I look at things objectively you know me I don't have any skin in the
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.320]  game I'm a political atheist and he got very very few applause lines he
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:51.280]  threw out the ones you know the woman card of course equal pay for women and
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.160]  men of course that got a big round of applause and and with Obamacare women
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:01.200]  won't have to pay more so he used he played that card and then the last card
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:06.800]  he played him this was a flat it was flat throughout it was nothing new he
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:12.080]  didn't he didn't have the he didn't have the train seals jumping up and down as
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:17.680]  much as he had in the earlier years you know pom pom Pelosi when she was the
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:23.520]  head over there of the majority leader so they didn't have that energy but he
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:28.760]  played the card at the end of pulling out this soldier to tend towards of duty
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:36.320]  in you know in Afghanistan and and became seriously injured and that got the
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:42.200]  greatest round of applause more what was was more war talk so they use that and
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:47.720]  also talking about gun control that he brought up again he also said another
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:54.680]  great Obama lie about how they've pulled back on the drone attacks when in fact in
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:59.480]  the last five years he's done eight times more than George Bush as a matter of
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:04.320]  fact this speech made little Georgie Bush look good from his terrible I was
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:09.640]  about to say I've never seen such a solid wall of lies it's actually hard to
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:15.840]  tell lies at that level and to be that pure of a liar with even double on
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:22.160]  Trondrest he could tell multiple lies at once and expanding on that that's like
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.000]  a Rosetta stone of the whole fraud was that poor guy who meant well with his
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.840]  arm blown off clapping on his chest next to that monster that obviously hates
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:36.000]  him in the military Michelle but the Abomination through that man you can
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.160]  see all the fraud ten years when they knew in World War two don't serve more
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:45.880]  than two tours Vietnam don't serve more than two tours one is enough I mean
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:51.200]  they I mean that is like literally literally putting troops in front of a
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.800]  firing squad ten tours and even the strongest person
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:58.800]  psychologically can't handle that and it just shows how they're just spending
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:02.680]  everything and how it's totally dishonorable I mean I don't mean to
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.640]  start ranting it's just and then to use him for more warmongering and reflected
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:13.400]  glory like Obama's a hero when he says I'm really good at killing people yeah
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:17.640]  it's a suit what do you say they didn't know that suit would fit me so well
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.900]  you should be in a white jacket that's the suit he should be in and again you
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:26.920]  looked at all these these these little trained seals these political seals
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:32.240]  jumping down and applauding this you know this war brought nothing but more
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:36.920]  hatred around the world and remember the big lie that we they George Bush
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:42.440]  launched it on we're gonna get Osama bin Laden because the tally band won't give
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:47.040]  him to us that was the reason for attacking Afghanistan and now we've
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:51.240]  been there as you mentioned the longest war in American history and they play

[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.960]  controlling that you're building too many weapons man and you're using them
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.480]  to kill too many people you want to talk gun control hey how about the
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:29.640]  militarization of the police in America you want to talk about gun control let's
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:34.800]  start with them oh did you see that congressman from Staten Island that's
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:41.320]  making the news representative Michael Grimm perfect name for the cat how he
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:47.520]  threatened that little reporter from New York one to throw him over the balcony
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:55.600]  and cut him in half you know Michael Grimm is it's perfect a former FBI agent
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:18:01.960]  go to Wikipedia look it up this guy New York a New Yorker magazine did a story
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:08.600]  on him about how he went into a nightclub and threatened this this this guy
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:13.000]  and said that they'll never find him again a words to that effect and then
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  came back twice and one time pulled a gun and played the on the FBI another guy
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:27.680]  another guy these tough guys you know that threatened little boys and by the
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:35.800]  way if you or I were to send a letter to Grimm or Pelosi or Diane not to
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:41.880]  Feinstein and threaten to throw them off a balcony and cut them in half those
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:48.280]  FBI guys they'd be there man having us face down beating the crap out of us
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:51.400]  what I was about to say is Paul most says if you don't agree with him
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:55.200]  politically get out of the state they're threatening to kill people but this is a
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:00.440]  direct threat no no I agree they're gangsters they're gangsters and what's
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:06.000]  happening to him now after he did this nothing he did they apologize then
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:14.360]  everything will be okay again the word justice is JUST US just us no Wall
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:20.320]  Street heads go again if you or I sent a threatening letter to a congressman we
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:25.320]  would they would lock us up this is a direct threat well he hasn't he hasn't
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:29.040]  denied it and we have the clip it's a little bit low audio but you can hear it
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:33.320]  and imagine for having a reporter there he threatens to kill him and let's play
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:37.640]  that clip for radio listeners TV viewers can actually see him come over and do it
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:42.480]  here it is and then we'll look before we let you go since we have you here we
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:45.800]  haven't had a chance to kind of talk about something that's off topic this is
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:51.000]  only about the president all right so Congressman Michael Grimm does not want
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.520]  to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances we
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.600]  wanted to get him on camera on that but he as you saw refuse to talk about that
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.080]  back to you
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.440]  he was threatened to throw him off the balcony again it doesn't go over radio
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:21.000]  too well but you can hear it it's up on info wars.com if you want to actually
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.240]  turn it up here at over a.m. people won't be able to understand it I mean he
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:28.560]  clearly is saying I'll throw you off I'll kill you I'll cut you in half and he
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:33.720]  looks like a total thug and the fact is he thinks they're above the law and I
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:36.600]  see on these police websites and I'm not against the general police because that
[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:40.120]  feeds into the Balkanization but where they talk on their forums about killing
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:45.480]  protesters and anybody films me I'm gonna I'm gonna kill them and you know
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:51.560]  stuff like that it's this military attitude like anybody else's rights are
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:55.760]  you know a threat to be dealt with and I'm sorry I mean if some guy got in my
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:59.560]  face and said I'm gonna throw you off a balcony I would shove them back and then
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:03.240]  if they tried to punch me I mean I would shove them and say how dare you
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:09.280]  threaten me and then if they came at me I'd punch them in the face and then I
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:12.440]  would be arrested for terrorism Gerald Salante what would you do he did that to
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:18.080]  you well again you know look at this guy you'll go to go to Wikipedia and you
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:22.720]  could see the story how he pulled a gun on these guys in this nightclub he's a
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:33.480]  thug and again hey junior give me a word public servant try that one on none of
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:39.200]  these these these clowns these political clowns every election time I'm a public
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:45.840]  servant yeah clean the toilets over here their royalty you saw it last night
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:50.560]  yeah I've seen it every one of these state-of-the-union addresses and now the
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:56.920]  cabinet and what is this pop in circumstances cut the crap well I thought
[02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:00.480]  in old state-of-the-unions they would heckle the president if he was lying
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:03.520]  and they would throw stuff at each other and things and I'm not saying that's
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:08.240]  good but it's better than I've never seen it look like all these theater folks
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:12.400]  who don't really have talent but want to be in the theater and are obsessed with
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:15.000]  some narcissistic thing I'm not attacking folks that want to be in the
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.120]  theater they really like it but you know I'm talking about theater rats who then
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:22.280]  fawn around someone who's gets more attention than them and worship them
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:27.120]  when they really hate them and and I've never seen such narcissistic hopping
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:32.200]  around and gleeful worship as when he came in because it was about them being
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:38.200]  on TV I mean give me a break they look like a bunch of mummies well that's why
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:44.680]  politics is show business for ugly people you nailed it that's exactly all
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:51.440]  it is and again they are destroying our nation in front of us what you see is
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:57.320]  what you get is there an Illuminati boy if there is the Illuminati are doing the
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:23:03.520]  dirty work for them I mean it's so transparent it's such a failure you look
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:09.440]  at these people you look at their actions and look at their deeds so as we go
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:18.280]  through and see what's going on nothing about really the economy and also when
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:22.640]  we're looking at this and you talk about the big lies he bragged about the
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:28.280]  jobs well everybody knows the jobs that are being created stink oh and go to
[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:32.640]  college that's right go to college get deep in debt and don't forget you could
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:40.280]  take a course in stocking shelves how about packaging and shipping one-on-one
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:45.320]  because that's what you're going to do when you get out of college so is it was
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:51.480]  one lie after another and again totally flat so now here we are and as we're
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:57.800]  talking the Federal Reserve announced just as we had forecast another round
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:03.000]  of tapering and you're seeing what's going on in all the emerging markets
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.720]  everyone should pay attention to this it's very important the only reason as
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:13.280]  you well know and everyone else does that listens to your show the only reason
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:17.440]  we have any kind of a recovery at all is because all of these tens of trillions
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:21.440]  of dollars the central banks have been shoving it to the marketplace all this
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:26.720]  cheap money went over to these emerging markets and was a carry trade so what
[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:30.560]  they did is they got higher interest rates took money cheaply put it in another
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:35.560]  country got more money for it and kept playing the deal now all this money is
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:41.000]  flowing out so what's going on you mentioned about the bank runs that HSBC
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.920]  then we heard the one about that you reported on one of the first ones to do
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.840]  it with JP Morgan Chase putting limits on how much you could withdraw and then
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:54.640]  you see what's going on in Russia as is on your website now what's happening
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:25:03.800]  check it out India Turkey one country after another they're all raising
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:09.880]  interest rates they're doing this because the money is flowing out and their
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:16.600]  currencies are being deflated oh South Africa another one so now as I've
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:22.200]  mentioned the only the only thing that kept this going as everyone knows is
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:26.440]  the cheap money flow now they're tightening up the currencies are
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:32.800]  crashing great China is announcing as we're seeing from the data coming out
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:36.440]  that their economy is actually going down from the data not that they're
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:40.880]  announcing it from reading the reading the information so the economies are
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:48.280]  going down and now you're raising interest rates brilliant Turkey's just
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:54.520]  raise their interest rates you know it's over 12% about 12% their economy is
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:00.040]  crashing they're in a crisis India raised their interest rate South South
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.680]  Africa they're all raising their interest rates to protect their currencies
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:13.240]  you don't raise interest rates as you're going into a recession unless you want
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:20.720]  to create a depression but they have no choice so you can see where the future
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:28.320]  is heading and it's an ugly one that's right and either course causes major
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:33.560]  economic problems I have your trends journal from the winter of 2010 the
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.480]  trend post and I mentioned this to you do you have that in front of you what
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:45.720]  you wrote back at that time said the bottom fall out of the economy be it
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:50.520]  from a terror strike financial crisis war environmental health related talk
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:56.600]  about this quote catastrophe or other wildcard events draconian measures will
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:02.760]  be taken by governments to forestall panic prevent runs on banks and keep
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:08.520]  equity markets from crashing in such a scenario bank holidays cash
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:16.000]  restrictions and stock market closings should be expected and now they're
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.600]  making the first major moves after Cyprus to do that and are in financial
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:26.240]  publications CNBC Financial Times New York Times Wall Street Journal I
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:30.280]  covered it yesterday going maybe you'll have to pay to have money in the bank
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:35.240]  now maybe we're not gonna let you get cash out maybe we're you know maybe
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:39.680]  we're gonna take some money out of your account like John Corzine did and if you
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:43.000]  don't like it homeland security will come by and and we got to give the
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  illegal immigrants free healthcare but if an old lady can't pay property taxes
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.560]  we're gonna take it I mean it's so predatory and then if we try to go out
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:55.000]  on the street and protest the cops come and beat our heads in when their own
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.480]  futures being destroyed I mean we are in a disaster situation because they ran
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:03.440]  the scam to take over they knew what was gonna happen and they're gonna use the
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:08.840]  next crisis as another power grab another bailout Gerald Solente where are
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:13.600]  we going you really said it do you really put it together and when you
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:19.760]  listen to Obama's empty speech yesterday there's nothing there they're going to use
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:26.120]  it to control us when this thing comes down they're not worried in DC they
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:31.360]  know what the what the deal is they're aware of what's going on so what we're
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:37.800]  seeing is they're preparing for the worst again the HSBC as is making again
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:42.480]  this isn't coming from you know the progressive it's BBC reporting on it
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.000]  about how they're they're they have cash restrictions again what you've been
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.840]  reporting on and by the way I did a story earlier than this about how I
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:58.840]  couldn't get my money out of key bank in the 2010 it happened in 2009 and it
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:07.320]  happened to me again with HSBC two years later they wouldn't give me my money
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:11.280]  and they started putting me through all these these these hoops to run through
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.920]  and I caused a scene over there so what I'm saying is the system is collapsing
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:24.920]  in front of us again this guy is grim he's he's he is he's in mirror image of
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:31.440]  what the police have become today to keep us down and to protect how they'll
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:36.600]  protect John the Slime cause line they'll protect Jamie Legs dying they arrest
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.680]  members of the media like Dinesh to Suza and governors for crooked toenails as
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:44.000]  they might run against Hillary yeah it's pure political persecution I want to ask
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:50.400]  Gerald where he sees this going and how we stop it stay with us we're on the

[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:09.480]  mean it's I'm beating my brains out that's why I got rid of almost all my
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:12.840]  sponsors a lot of them were good but I couldn't handle it I couldn't vet it I
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:15.800]  couldn't mess with it all I just said I'm getting there all the sponsors got
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:20.280]  rid of five salespeople and about half our funding just because I literally
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:24.440]  have to be the most moral person I can and we're gonna rebuild it and they were
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:28.200]  good salespeople too was just I couldn't manage it I need to get managers in

[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:53.520]  separate Gerald Salente you've got the floor on trends I don't want to sit here
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:58.720]  and ask all the questions geopolitical what's going on in the world can we turn
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.360]  it around I think the biggest issue is not that I'm some tough guy but that
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:07.440]  people never been in fights they've never been robbed they've never seen
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.480]  corruption they have no street smarts now we live in such an insulated TV-based
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:16.840]  fantasy land that it's infected the ruling class as well and you know people
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:21.240]  are either super smart and dialed in or they're totally dumb and I see an
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:26.560]  acceleration of that division Gerald Salente. Well you know I'd like to also
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:30.560]  you know just follow up on what you were talking about and how could it change
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:36.920]  you know I've been on virtually every TV show in the country Oprah the today's
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:41.600]  show Good Morning America you name it and I've been to your studios and your
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:49.280]  studios are far above most of them and I know the dedication that you have so
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:53.640]  when you ask people what can you do to help change there's no show like yours
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:59.560]  there's your website the information the people you have your staff that is so
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:04.680]  dedicated and the stories that they write every day it's one of my first go-to
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:10.360]  websites and I you know I travel the world on websites from China Daily to
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:16.920]  Fars to Al Jazeera to hot ads you know but Alex Jones website Prison Planet has
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:22.160]  information that's written in ways and presented that virtually nobody else
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:29.520]  does so people do have to understand the dedication that you and your staff have
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:34.920]  to help change us and put us in as the word that you keep using is in a more
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:40.800]  moral direction you know I'm the last guy to say you know that I played it
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.520]  straight all the time and been the perfect guy you try to you try to
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.680]  advance yourself as you learn more and try to be better at what you're doing in
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.440]  terms of it's about self-respect you know I don't want to pass out of this
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:59.960]  planet with having you know any dark blemishes that I've done intentionally so
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:05.560]  I really urge everyone to do what they can to keep promoting what you're doing
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.200]  because you're one of the few voices out there and you have the the the
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:15.080]  husband the Cajones to say it the way it is well you too my brother I mean I was
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:18.880]  just doing midair refueling to fund our operation I just wanted to you know go
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:23.800]  back to the public and explain to them this is high quality but also they can
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:27.800]  build whatever they want by supporting it and that's what you've always hammered
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:31.720]  on for 30 years as a consultant lobbyists the biggest corporations to the
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:36.840]  public you name it is we literally build the world by our choices that's why
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:39.800]  folks have got to become subscribers of the trends journal that's why they've
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:44.480]  got to support drudgerport.com world net daily anything that's independent
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:48.360]  anything that has a moral compass anything that isn't totally obsessed with
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:55.160]  evil and that's what it comes down to is how do we turn this around again it's
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:58.720]  it's about self-respect and it's happening yes there are all a lot of
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.960]  losers out there and and to me by the way that that show last night in
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:09.160]  Washington it was a pickup from the Grammys you know about the same stupid
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:13.280]  level but there are a lot of people that care and you're a historian you know
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:17.760]  that the revolution began with very few people in America and even at the height
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:21.960]  of it a lot of people didn't support it so it can happen with people that care
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:27.000]  and that's really what it comes down to and now on to the geopolitics it was a
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.520]  line that Obama threw out there that people should it just pushed him right
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:36.720]  through he he he made the distinction that how we were going to have a deal
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:41.760]  with Iran and Iran it's all about business and you saw Rahane over there
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:46.880]  in Davos it's about business 70 million people there the country's been laying
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:51.120]  dormant and the and the multinationals want to get in there as the oil
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:55.400]  companies do so they're gonna it's a business deal let's get it straight but
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.640]  he threw two lines in there and he made and you can see how the deal was made he
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:06.240]  called Israel quote a Jewish state that was the one that they're pushing for now
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:11.800]  and number two right in like that and we're gonna support those Syrian rebels
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:16.400]  so he made a deal with Israel and he made a deal with Saudi Arabia and the
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:22.200]  Arab Little League because the Arab Little League are the ones that also by
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:26.720]  the way there was a great one I was on with the Washington bureau chief of
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:35.320]  Al Jazeera right before the the Libyan war on on China today and you got to see
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:40.120]  this guy freak out at the end when he was telling us why America has to attack
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:44.400]  Libya and I said to him listen you haven't answered any of my questions in an
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:49.520]  hour I'll tell you what you want to go to war with Libya pack up your crap and
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:54.000]  take your wife and your kids and yourself and go fight the war don't you dare
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:59.520]  tell us what we as Americans should do and you mentioned Washington could you
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:09.000]  imagine Obama or Clinton or Clintons or little Georgie Bush or or Gates or the
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.200]  rest of them going up to George Washington a guy that was out there on
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:18.640]  the front lines and saying to him you know George you're full of baloney about
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:23.400]  these foreign entanglement nonsense we're gonna do what we want and get
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:28.720]  involved in any other country's business so I'm going back to Obama again
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:34.520]  throwing the line out to Syria they just cut a deal with the Arab League to
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:40.200]  keep this destabilization going and when you look at Saudi Arabia the reason
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:46.320]  they're against a deal with Iran look at oil prices we haven't one of the coldest
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:51.880]  winters we've had and oil prices are still staying low there's a flood of
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.560]  product on the market at a time when the economies are going down so you can
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:01.920]  see where the war is heading that's right Iraq just said they're gonna flood
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:05.120]  the market that's one reason they set up Saddam is he was trying to pay off his
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:11.400]  debts flood in the market back in 1990 exactly and then again tying it all
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:15.600]  together economically I've made this very clear before you're seeing the
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:20.840]  manufacturing index coming out of China it's down you're seeing slowdowns oh by
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.480]  the way durable good orders came out yesterday in the US and they were way
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:31.720]  off figure it out of quote by unexpectedly down in December will you
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.400]  look at the the new one of the new employment numbers in December there
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:40.080]  were only 74,000 so what's the bottom line they're gonna start turning down the
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:43.120]  QE how much you think they're gonna do it what's gonna happen in the next year
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:48.280]  Gerald Solente here's my forecast you're looking at the markets already as we're
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:54.960]  talking they're fluctuating between almost 200 down to 120 down then your
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:00.480]  markets in Europe took a hit they're all taking a hit they have to flood the
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:05.880]  markets with money they're not gonna do it for a while and you're gonna see the
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:11.280]  equity markets continue to decline interest rates go up the economy goes
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:18.160]  down they're going to come out with a new scam by I believe by the end of the
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.800]  second quarter this year it's they're not gonna call it quantitative easing
[02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:27.840]  they're not gonna call it stimulus now with Ben Bernanke out of there maybe
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:32.960]  they'll call it Yellenomics or something for the new person the front for the
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:37.520]  for the for the bankers they're going to come out with another round of
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:42.040]  stimulus they have to do it they're gonna do it in Europe they're gonna do it in
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:49.880]  China and when they do it you're gonna see gold prices skyrocket we believe
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:55.320]  that when they announced the next round of stimulus which are going to have to
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:01.520]  do when you're looking at the numbers only that's when you're gonna see gold
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:08.080]  prices skyrocket our forecast is the downside of gold is only between 100
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:13.520]  and 150 that's not a lot because it's gonna cost you 1200 bucks just to pull
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:17.920]  this stuff out of the market and by the way when you look at the Goldman Sachs
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:21.920]  gang and they're the ones that keep driving down the price of gold coming
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:25.560]  out with their announcements of how low it's going to be and you look at their
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:30.720]  track record over the last three years they have been off on virtually every
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:35.800]  one of them but they're manipulating the market as dr. Paul Craig Roberts keeps
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:40.200]  pulling showing everyone how they're doing it and if you don't think they're
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:45.840]  manipulating the markets guess what they manipulated the LIBOR markets they
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:50.780]  said sets interest rates at the tone the tune of some 700 trillion
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:55.080]  record they're manipulating all the markets all right it's a fact they're
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:48:00.680]  manipulating the Forex markets those are the currency markets it's a fact so the
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:06.040]  fact is that when gold prices go up they're gonna try to drive them down but
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:10.000]  here's what's different I bought my first buy of gold at a hundred and seven
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:15.440]  hundred eighty seven fifty an ounce back in the late 70s I also bought it at the
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:22.600]  highest point of the trading day the day it collapsed at 875 it closed at 850 the
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:28.280]  next day it went down 50 bucks here's what's different back then you didn't
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:33.160]  have physical demand that skyrocketing throughout Asia and the rest of the
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:38.720]  world even in the United States the mints are running 24 hours a day in
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:44.280]  Austria they can't keep up with demand for physical metal that didn't happen in
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:51.480]  1980 I was there back in 1980 China wasn't buying like they are now now the
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:58.120]  largest buyer of physical metals China was just getting off the mound trip they
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:05.440]  had no GDP India no they weren't buying much either Russia how much is Russia
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:10.960]  buying now back then everything east of Berlin was locked no absolutely they
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.640]  can only suppress it so long that's why I've never sold an ounce of gold or
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:18.800]  silver I've bought and I'm totally confident but expanding on that Gerald
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:23.920]  speaking of the mall trip people are over the globalist big government fake
[02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:28.760]  neoliberal neocon garbage people all the polls show six percent approval ready
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:34.680]  for Congress Obama plunging what will the establishment do to get itself out
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:39.920]  of this again it goes back to that liney-throat about Syria when all else

[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:16.640]  I've got to go on Jesse Ventura's new TV radio show he's on next week former
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:23.080]  governor Minnesota again final segment here with Gerald Salente Joel I've got
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:27.400]  so many questions and things to raise but you know what I'm not gonna do it
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:32.480]  I'm just gonna ask you what else you think is front and center and really
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:36.880]  really important again as I was just saying take a look what's going on in
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:41.200]  Thailand people haven't left the streets now in two months and then you go over
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:45.280]  to look what's going on in Cambodia the people the tide are working for 61 bucks
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:48.920]  a month and the police are beating their hell out of them but they're not
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:53.560]  leaving the streets the same thing in Bangladesh how can you forget what's
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:59.880]  going on over there in Japan Arbenomics brilliant some tons of money into the
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:04.680]  system the exports are weighed down and it's not doing anything but what is
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:11.320]  happening is that he keeps increasing the tension between Japan and China so
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:15.560]  and then you look what's going on down there in Argentina oh yeah that they're
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:21.000]  pesos collapsed the people are out in the streets go over to Brazil same thing
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.400]  the people are tired of being poor and they're tired of the corruption what I'm
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:29.880]  saying Alex and I've said this now everybody's starting to kind of pick it
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:36.160]  up now in the media it looks a lot like it did before World War one a very
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:41.360]  unnecessary war and the reason you got in there was because you had a lot of
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:48.800]  stupid people that were in charge both in the military and in government and you
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:55.040]  had the same thing going on now you got losers you have just hit the key is that
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:59.640]  I look at the political elite now and they're real good at Robinus and real
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:03.440]  good at saying they know everything but really they've got horrible families
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:08.360]  they're horrible people they're stupid and and the public is either dumb or
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:11.680]  awake I mean this is a disaster and I agree with a lot of historians you were
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:14.920]  saying this years ago but now they're saying yeah get ready for World War one
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:20.000]  World War two the climate that we see lining up says World War three exactly
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:28.080]  it was the top trend that we had last year top trends of 2014 2013 was war and
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:32.840]  showing the lead up to it that's my greatest concern because you saw what
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.520]  happened last night with Obama everybody you know I wrote about in the last
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:45.120]  trends journal how I almost went broke back in in the early 2000s 2003 the top
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:51.200]  trends I wrote now remember this is you know it comes out in December of 2002
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:57.240]  the the war just started in in it wasn't even a year old absolutely we're out of
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:00.520]  time I want to have you back on no you predicted it all I want to have you back
[02:57:00.520 --> 02:57:03.880]  on but the minute and a half we got left what do you make of Obama and the
[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:08.200]  media trying to sell the idea of him as a dictator that then he can fix
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:14.080]  everything I mean this is getting crazy well again it this is what the setup
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:19.040]  is this is what I'm trying to say you saw how that they championed this guy
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:23.880]  last night it was one of the longest rounds of applause of any state of the
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:28.600]  Union when they mentioned the troops they mentioned war all we need is one
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:33.880]  flip one little one little terror thing you saw what happened in Boston when
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:37.880]  they called martial law when the police went into people's houses without
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:44.240]  warrants they can have a false flag or a real terror strike and the flags of the
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:49.160]  made in China American flags will come out and people be tying yellow ribbons
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:53.400]  around everything that's my greatest fear and that's what the people have to
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:58.200]  stand up to as they did when they wanted to take us to war with Syria and say
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:04.640]  no very well said I mean bottom line we're on the edge of catastrophe the
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:10.080]  stars have aligned historically my gut tells me I've never my guts always
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:15.360]  right it Gerald my guts ten times the dread I've ever had and and what do you
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:18.840]  think it is the economic collapse the war it all comes together all comes
[02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:23.320]  together when when the economy what's going on now with this tapering again
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:27.640]  you're seeing what's going on with the emerging markets they need the money they
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:32.200]  need that monetary heroin they can't survive well thanks for moving too
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:36.520]  quickly you come back next week talk about war I love to thank you next week
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:58.800]  we'll set you up right now thank you so much sir
