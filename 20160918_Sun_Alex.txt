[00:00.000 --> 00:08.480]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[00:08.480 --> 00:15.840]  tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:15.840 --> 00:18.840]  radio network.
[00:18.840 --> 00:31.600]  Stop bringing in a planetary world government. And they're at war with
[00:31.600 --> 00:37.680]  logic because logic would state that an unelected world government is anathema
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.600]  to a free society, would be the enemy of free people. Should I be able to
[00:42.600 --> 00:48.440]  complete this takeover? They're at war with language. They're at war with
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.880]  mathematics. They're at war with the simple maxim that 2 plus 2 equals 4,
[00:53.880 --> 00:59.760]  literally with Common Core. And that's why when we saw a bomb go off in New York
[00:59.760 --> 01:05.720]  City in Chelsea and a bomb go off in New Jersey yesterday along a military parade
[01:05.720 --> 01:13.000]  route, we saw Hillary Clinton come out and say this is not a bombing. Bombs
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.600]  going off are not bombings. Even as ISIS celebrates New York City dumpster bomb
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.560]  and all up mall stabbings in Minnesota, there will be more. Nine people at the
[01:25.560 --> 01:29.600]  hospital, three still in critical condition. The stories are all up on
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.120]  infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and of course drudgereport.com. I have stacks
[01:34.120 --> 01:38.200]  of the news right here where I'm supposed to sit here and just debate Hillary
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.840]  Clinton who came out and says in a press conference, well a very short press
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.600]  statement I should say because there's stamina just a few minutes that, well
[01:46.600 --> 01:50.760]  we've had a bombing and it's improper for Donald Trump to call it a bombing.
[01:50.760 --> 01:55.080]  So that story is up on infowars.com. Hillary Clinton says bombings in New
[01:55.080 --> 02:01.560]  York, 40 seconds later criticizes use of word bombing and says that Donald
[02:01.560 --> 02:12.160]  Trump is basically compulsive. No, he's not compulsive. He's decisive and let me
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.160]  tell you something, it's decisive. If you're standing on a street corner and a
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.680]  city bus runs over somebody and kills them, say a bus just ran over somebody
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.080]  or there's a house fire and a house burns down to say that the house burned
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.080]  down. You can be decisive, you know, when the sun comes up in the morning at 7 a.m.
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.640]  and say that's the sun, it just came up. We don't need Hillary to tell us it did.
[02:35.640 --> 02:45.920]  It's not compulsive, that was her term, it is decisive. But this is the mind
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.480]  control we deal with. I have stacks of news articles with corporate controlled
[02:51.480 --> 02:57.720]  media criticizing Trump for calling two different bombings yesterday in New
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.560]  Jersey and New York, clearly targeting the military in New York on a Marine
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.800]  Corps jogging route, a race that was about to happen. And the fact that they
[03:08.800 --> 03:13.200]  will sit there and turn the story into a debate on whether or not it's
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.800]  terrorism when ISIS has taken responsibility yesterday and they
[03:18.800 --> 03:25.560]  officially took responsibility today. Trump and Clinton battle over what
[03:25.560 --> 03:33.240]  terms should be used. This is how they paralyze us. This is how they manipulate
[03:33.240 --> 03:39.080]  us. Remember how they kept calling the attack in Nice that killed was a 90
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.200]  something people a few months ago? They called it a truck attack, a truck
[03:44.200 --> 03:50.240]  attack. It'd be like if I stabbed someone with a butcher knife, they'd say the
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.560]  knife attacked. Media blames truck not terrorist or Islam for an east attack.
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.240]  This is an example of mind control. Then I see comments on info wars and other
[04:01.240 --> 04:05.560]  sites like YouTube saying Jones is you know saying this is an Islamic attack.
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.280]  Why? It's probably a false flag. When there's a false flag, when clearly
[04:11.280 --> 04:15.320]  governments have been involved and then have been caught before, provocaturing
[04:15.320 --> 04:20.840]  events, we cover that. Islamic state is the mega false flag with Obama and
[04:20.840 --> 04:25.480]  Hillary and NATO and the globalist Saudi Arabia turning loose a Jihad army
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.240]  worldwide flooding Europe and the US with refugees and admitting in sorrows
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.400]  his own memos that have been out for weeks and emails. Here's after I told
[04:33.400 --> 04:36.960]  you. We can look at it and tell you what it is. It's very clear. It's not rocket
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.400]  science that they're bringing in the Islamists to create a civil emergency,
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.280]  martial law so the state can come in and take all of our rights, countering
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.600]  the threat they've brought in. So it's an intensification of the false flags we
[04:50.600 --> 04:54.400]  saw in 2001 and on and they're run by the globalist. Stay with us. It's an
[04:54.400 --> 04:57.280]  important broadcast.
[04:57.280 --> 05:01.160]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.600]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[05:05.600 --> 05:10.440]  pretty much scares me the most. I mean I try to make sure that I don't put
[05:10.440 --> 05:14.600]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're
[05:14.600 --> 05:19.400]  dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.160]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.320]  disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[05:28.320 --> 05:31.320]  parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.680]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[05:35.680 --> 05:39.320]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[05:39.320 --> 05:42.280]  Alright well I'm glad we got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[05:42.280 --> 05:45.840]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense. InfoWarsLife.com and folks you
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.480]  can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body period and you support the
[05:50.480 --> 05:54.280]  broadcast. InfoWarsLife.com. Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[05:54.280 --> 06:23.280]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.960]  Before I plow into all this news I want to air a three-minute piece by one of our
[06:27.960 --> 06:33.600]  great reporters Paul Joseph Watson that he filed today dealing with the
[06:33.600 --> 06:39.160]  bombings the dual bombings in New Jersey and New York yesterday because we've
[06:39.160 --> 06:44.640]  got Hillary Clinton in the mainstream media out saying don't call it a bombing
[06:44.640 --> 06:48.680]  and criticizing Donald Trump for saying that and I'm going to put a clip of
[06:48.680 --> 06:54.280]  Hillary actually saying that after she says in a 40-second clip we've had a
[06:54.280 --> 06:58.880]  bombing and it's not good for Donald Trump to refer to these events as
[06:58.880 --> 07:04.160]  bombings. So it's all about how they control the language. Don't use the
[07:04.160 --> 07:10.840]  word mother and father on high school or elementary school entrance paperwork
[07:10.840 --> 07:14.520]  because someone might not have children or might not have parents and if you
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.840]  don't have parents it's hurtful to hear someone else doesn't. It's all about
[07:18.840 --> 07:24.000]  controlling the language telling you what words to use. This is cult level.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.400]  They've brought in the Islamists, they brought in the refugees in mass, these
[07:28.400 --> 07:33.640]  are people from the most war-torn areas that are so whacked out on Sunni,
[07:33.640 --> 07:40.080]  Wahhabist, Saudi Arabian-funded Orthodox Islam, the most hardcore type that
[07:40.080 --> 07:44.640]  they're constantly killing each other no matter what country they're in. I mean
[07:44.640 --> 07:49.760]  you bombings every day in every city, stabbings every day, shootings every day
[07:49.760 --> 07:54.760]  because a woman was caught wearing purple socks or somebody you know didn't
[07:54.760 --> 07:59.400]  bow perfectly right you know five times a day and somebody saw him. I mean this
[07:59.400 --> 08:05.240]  is like living in a giant brainwashing cult. The left brings it in to be
[08:05.240 --> 08:09.480]  totally incompatible. We have now in the last two weeks the latest George Soros
[08:09.480 --> 08:14.680]  emails via DC leaks, WikiLeaks and others, thousands of emails where he's
[08:14.680 --> 08:17.920]  talking about we're gonna bring in the Islamists, we're gonna make women
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.920]  accept Sharia law. It'll cause such a crisis that we'll have a new voting block
[08:21.920 --> 08:27.280]  that we can activate to basically engage in destabilization anytime we want. Now
[08:27.280 --> 08:30.600]  obviously I've been telling you this for years because you could watch what
[08:30.600 --> 08:36.200]  Soros has done in the Middle East, Ukraine, Asia, you name it. He destabilizes
[08:36.200 --> 08:41.200]  countries but now we have the very emails where he admits that he's funding
[08:41.200 --> 08:45.400]  Black Lives Matter and other groups that are calling for violence to create a
[08:45.400 --> 08:52.840]  civil war in America. Al Gore three years ago called for a quote Arab Spring in
[08:52.840 --> 08:59.480]  America and when I saw that quote I thought oh he means liberals run around
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.720]  burning stuff down. No he means even bringing in the Muslims to do it. It's
[09:05.720 --> 09:11.800]  unprecedented. So we have the frightening similarities between the
[09:11.800 --> 09:16.760]  Manhattan dumpster explosion that hurt 29 in the New Jersey military run blast.
[09:16.760 --> 09:22.000]  Oh somebody tries to blow up a Marine Corps event and you don't even call it
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.400]  a bomb. And then ISIS takes responsibility. Meanwhile ISIS is taking
[09:27.400 --> 09:31.720]  responsibility for nine stabs, three in critical condition in Minnesota mall as
[09:31.720 --> 09:37.040]  the man screamed Allah Akbar God is great and then would ask people are you a
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.520]  Muslim? If they said no, God butch your knife. Butch your knife. But it's not
[09:42.520 --> 09:48.720]  Islamic related. These happen every week. There's more events in the UK, more events
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.960]  in Germany, more rapes, more murders because we're not seen as human by
[09:53.960 --> 10:00.600]  Muslims. Now I've explained this. Most Muslims are what you call heretics to
[10:00.600 --> 10:04.800]  Islam and don't want to live like this that previously came to the West. But
[10:04.800 --> 10:11.640]  we're getting the Sunni Wahhabist people now. Okay we're getting the hard core
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.240]  ones that by the way are the majority of Islam. 80% of Islam is Sunni and the
[10:16.240 --> 10:19.960]  group that bullies and controls the Sunnis and tries to keep them in line is the
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.280]  Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia. That's who's funding all of this right now. And
[10:24.280 --> 10:29.240]  our criminal government as well as NATO has publicly allied with these people to
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.880]  bring them in to be our new bosses. Total red carpets for three years, at least
[10:33.880 --> 10:38.320]  three years. The Homeland Security is not even allowed to list a bombing or an
[10:38.320 --> 10:43.840]  attack as Islamic or as a bombing or as Muslim. Even when they confess and say
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.160]  it is for God, it is for God, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, it is
[10:49.160 --> 10:57.600]  for God. Police, man stabs not at Minnesota mall before cop kills him. But
[10:57.600 --> 11:00.720]  of course if you read deeply in the article that it says, reportedly
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.760]  mentioning Allah and asking victims as he stabbed them. But it's not terror
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.520]  related. Reuters, Islamic State says Minnesota mall stabbing carried out by
[11:09.520 --> 11:13.600]  a soldier. We're going to continue. But don't worry, Hillary said it's not. Okay,
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.800]  because she loves you and cares so much about you. Let's continue. With these
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.240]  reports here, the authorities are looking into whether the New York
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.040]  explosion was connected to a blast that happened 11 hours earlier when
[11:26.040 --> 11:31.320]  improvised device exploded, a pressure cooker in a garbage can near the course
[11:31.320 --> 11:37.960]  of a charity race for injured Marines. Continuing, ISIS supporters rush to
[11:37.960 --> 11:45.280]  celebrate NYC explosion. We cause you this pain inside your house. Manhattan
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.960]  explosion timeline, second device, again, pressure cooker. There will be more
[11:49.960 --> 11:55.640]  chilling 911 call after the Chelsea explosion, but it's not connected to
[11:55.640 --> 12:02.440]  Islam. ISIS says the left. That's the group that has literally nothing to do
[12:02.440 --> 12:09.040]  with Islam. 29 injured in improvised explosive device. New York City, Bill
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.560]  de Blasso mayor calls the incident intentional act. Really, it's an
[12:13.560 --> 12:19.920]  intentional, unintentional act. Again, ISIS supporters rush to celebrate the
[12:19.920 --> 12:25.080]  explosion. Now before and of course they found some other bombs as well that
[12:25.080 --> 12:27.920]  didn't go off. But before I get into more of this, I want to play a short
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.080]  clip by Paul Joseph Watson, where he talks about the truth about the New
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.200]  York and New Jersey bombings. Here it is.
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.560]  And then one in a dumpster exploded in New York's Chelsea neighborhood,
[12:40.560 --> 12:45.440]  injuring 29 people, a pressure cooker bomb with wires sticking out a cell
[12:45.440 --> 12:50.320]  phone and a written note was also found nearby. A pipe bomb in a garbage can
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.480]  also exploded in New Jersey during a marathon in aid of military soldiers
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.840]  and veterans. And a man screaming about Allah when on a stabbing rampage in
[12:58.840 --> 13:03.120]  Minnesota, asking people if they were Muslim during the attack, which of
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.200]  course is nothing to do with Islam. The terrorist was shot dead by a
[13:07.200 --> 13:12.000]  responsible person with a gun. Not a narrative. The establishment is keen
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.040]  to see gain traction. Despite all of the attacks clearly having the hallmarks
[13:17.040 --> 13:22.760]  of terrorism, the media and authorities rushed to move the narrative away from
[13:22.760 --> 13:28.000]  terrorism that there is no evidence at this point of a terror connection to
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.680]  this incident. So it's intentional. There's a handwritten note. There's a
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.680]  pressure cooker bomb nearby. But this isn't terrorism. Give me a break. I mean,
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.680]  are they going to blame the attack on a trash can? Like they blamed the
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.400]  niece attack on a truck. They're playing politics and lying to the people of
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.080]  New York so that this doesn't hurt Hillary in the polls. After Hillary
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.960]  Clinton called the incident a bombing, the Clinton mouthpiece media then
[13:55.960 --> 14:01.680]  slammed Donald Trump for calling the incident a bombing. I've been briefed
[14:01.680 --> 14:07.560]  about the bombings in New York and New Jersey. Do you have any reaction to the fact that Donald
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.680]  Trump immediately appointed the state tonight called the explosion in New York a bomb?
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.080]  Bombings in New York. Bombings, bombings, bombings. News outlets like Channel 4 also
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.520]  edited out Hillary calling it a bombing in order to make her look more
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.680]  reasonable than Trump. Other prostitutes said Trump was reckless and
[14:27.680 --> 14:32.840]  irresponsible for telling a crowd that a bomb had gone off in New York even though
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.120]  that was completely accurate since a bomb had gone off in New York. Someone
[14:38.120 --> 14:41.960]  claiming to be the New York bomber wrote a Tumblr blog saying he was a Trump
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.520]  hating social justice warrior and that the attack was a response to racist
[14:46.520 --> 14:51.200]  misogynistic Islamophobic cisgendered privileged white people. Could this be
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.360]  another example of a crazed leftist going jihad in the same vein as the Black
[14:56.360 --> 15:01.040]  Lives Matter inspired shooter who murdered cops in Dallas? We await more
[15:01.040 --> 15:05.000]  details but whoever the culprit the media and the establishment will do
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.880]  everything in their power to hijack the narrative. Terror attacks by the same
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.760]  fringe groups whether they be Islamists, leftists or black lives matter radicals
[15:14.760 --> 15:20.920]  that Hillary has embraced will only drive more support to Trump. That's why
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.200]  the media and the establishment will continue to obfuscate the truth behind
[15:25.200 --> 15:31.120]  these incidents with bizarre rhetoric and contrived narratives in a desperate
[15:31.120 --> 15:55.200]  effort to deceive the American people.
[16:02.120 --> 16:09.560]  I've been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.040]  get in here at 8 30 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.400]  was gonna make it and I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my
[16:17.400 --> 16:20.840]  bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later
[16:20.840 --> 16:24.960]  it's like bing everything just kind of clears up it's got four and a half stars
[16:24.960 --> 16:28.680]  people really love it read about it find out why third-party

[20:25.920 --> 20:29.120]  listening to alex jones
[20:48.120 --> 20:51.760]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this
[20:51.760 --> 20:58.760]  Sunday edition part of the 18th day of September 2016 I am your host alex jones
[20:58.760 --> 21:05.320]  I want to give you some of the good news here but I'll be honest with
[21:05.320 --> 21:13.680]  everybody it really freaks me out to see ABC NBC CBS every major channel there
[21:13.680 --> 21:19.560]  is that is an establishment media get up there and do things like not use the
[21:19.560 --> 21:24.040]  word terrorists now and there's terror attacks or not call a bombing a bombing
[21:24.040 --> 21:33.400]  and to not call major terror attacks in Europe or the Middle East Islamic attacks
[21:33.400 --> 21:37.880]  because if they can set the precedent to basically cover up for that group they
[21:37.880 --> 21:43.640]  can do it for anybody and it shows the lock step control decades ago people
[21:43.640 --> 21:50.360]  noticed that ABC CBS NBC had the same ads in the same order during the breaks
[21:50.360 --> 21:55.400]  and the same stories in the same order during the shows almost every night you
[21:55.400 --> 21:58.880]  could flip to the channels when I was a teenager when I was a kid I was a young
[21:58.880 --> 22:04.080]  adult it was like same story same story same story same talking points because
[22:04.080 --> 22:09.040]  talking points were coming out of Washington and it's now admitted those
[22:09.040 --> 22:14.200]  talking points come now directly out of the Democratic Party was bad enough to
[22:14.200 --> 22:19.720]  have the CIA and the White House directing media that's totally criminal
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.040]  now it's the Democratic Party even when Republicans are out of power that are
[22:24.040 --> 22:29.400]  directing everything because they took over the shadow government they set up
[22:29.400 --> 22:36.080]  a COG a continuity of government system they established the NSA spy grid they
[22:36.080 --> 22:41.120]  put the control systems in and once they had control they just took the data and
[22:41.120 --> 22:45.280]  placed it on all their own private computers and servers and they run it
[22:45.280 --> 22:50.760]  all the spy grids the blackmail grids everything and that's why they're so
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.440]  arrogant it's why the media follows their orders it's why things are so scary
[22:54.440 --> 23:00.200]  because they have surveillance technology 10,000 times what Hitler ever dreamed
[23:00.200 --> 23:06.000]  of when I say 10,000 times I almost said 10 billion times because when you think
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.240]  about the level of surveillance that 16 intelligence agencies have over the
[23:11.240 --> 23:16.080]  American people they spy on the US as much as they spy on all other countries
[23:16.080 --> 23:21.680]  combined that's been declassified they can go right into your computer and watch
[23:21.680 --> 23:29.120]  you over your phone right over your video cam I told people that 20 years ago
[23:29.120 --> 23:35.240]  because I talked to NSA whistleblowers then now you go see the movie Snowden
[23:35.240 --> 23:39.440]  which I saw last night it is undoubtedly the greatest work by Oliver
[23:39.440 --> 23:43.520]  Stone it is incredibly accurate and I cannot believe that that film came out
[23:43.520 --> 23:49.400]  knowing how controlled Hollywood the media is it's it's amazing in fact I'm
[23:49.400 --> 23:55.240]  gonna review it off the cuff later today but I'm gonna do a really focused
[23:55.240 --> 24:01.000]  review that's produced with clips and documentation later this week I have no
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.760]  connection to the film but I'm telling you I'm telling you this is incredible
[24:06.760 --> 24:09.560]  you know I think the establishment let this come out because they think the
[24:09.560 --> 24:15.040]  people are too stupid even though what they're watching they admit in the film
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.560]  that for decades chips have been sold and computer programs have been loaded
[24:20.560 --> 24:28.960]  on to General Electric and IBM and Microsoft and Dell and all US
[24:28.960 --> 24:37.680]  manufacturers Cisco you name it kill switches in the Swiss the Japanese the
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.360]  South Africans every country kill switches in their dams kill switches in
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.360]  their light poles kill switches in their power plants kill switches in your
[24:46.360 --> 24:50.760]  toasters now kill switches in your smart meter and of course people that are
[24:50.760 --> 24:54.680]  our listeners have heard this for 18 years I'm not about this for 18 years
[24:54.680 --> 25:01.720]  but I cannot believe it was on the show it was in the two-hour movie my mouth
[25:01.720 --> 25:10.520]  was hanging open and then to show how I don't I don't follow pop culture I should
[25:10.520 --> 25:14.120]  follow more that's where the real war is going on I'm like did they clone Clint
[25:14.120 --> 25:19.520]  Eastwood there's a young Clint Eastwood that's like rowdy Yates from rawhide my
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.440]  mom was watching when she was five years old that guy looks just like Clint
[25:24.440 --> 25:27.040]  Eastwood and I don't follow Clint Eastwood I mean I follow his movies I
[25:27.040 --> 25:31.280]  like the guy I bet I'm not in love with Hollywood stars but he's like a member
[25:31.280 --> 25:33.880]  of the family I mean it feels like that when you've been you know liking somebody
[25:33.880 --> 25:38.400]  since you're a little kid and I'm like that looks like Clint Eastwood so when
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.360]  I leave I Google it and it's his it's his youngest son that looks just like him
[25:43.360 --> 25:50.480]  is in the movie I was just like that looks like Clint Eastwood crazy people
[25:50.480 --> 25:53.040]  so I don't like Clint Eastwood that's a young guy look at a young Clint Eastwood
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.120]  and then look at Scott Eastwood it's incredible but getting off all of that
[25:58.120 --> 26:02.160]  I've got to write some notes up because I don't want to drop the ball on a
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.720]  review of this I mean it was amazing they were just admitting everything but
[26:07.720 --> 26:13.480]  one omission one big omission and it's probably because the public couldn't
[26:13.480 --> 26:18.240]  handle it when I was told this by NSA whistleblowers 20 years ago 18 years
[26:18.240 --> 26:25.920]  ago 15 years ago when people would tell me I was doing radio remotes at a car
[26:25.920 --> 26:30.320]  show or the rodeo or I'd be at a book signing or video signing at a movie
[26:30.320 --> 26:34.520]  theater and they'd meet me in the parking garage and then you know give me data
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.000]  dossiers of stuff that of course I burned or shredded and I was showing my
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.560]  dad my dad's like you got to destroy this and it was just how the whole thing
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.720]  works top engineers came to me and explained that it was to see over the
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.960]  horizon with enough human activity with billions of people's actions a minute
[26:51.960 --> 26:58.960]  they can predict the future with mass movements and I never even really talked
[26:58.960 --> 27:02.280]  about that because it was so crazy I talked about there's keywords just like
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.000]  Google it searches the the real internet which is digital communications the
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.360]  internet is just a you know kind of one public version and limited system where
[27:11.360 --> 27:16.440]  you make things public if you choose but the NSA searches the real internet that
[27:16.440 --> 27:20.720]  is digital telecommunications and I explained it all first show ever I mean
[27:20.720 --> 27:27.440]  we had James Bamford on we had so many other big whistleblowers on like Wayne
[27:27.440 --> 27:31.920]  Madsen and of course we've had the former head of the NSA technical William
[27:31.920 --> 27:36.280]  Benny in studio by the way Nick Cage plays him in the movie see I'm kind of
[27:36.280 --> 27:40.720]  already reviewing it that's why it was so mind-blowing the only time I
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.480]  experienced something like this was watching kill the messenger that came
[27:44.480 --> 27:47.640]  out a few years ago about about the murder of investigative journals Gary
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.560]  Webb who exposed CIA drug dealing since then it's been declassified he's been
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.640]  totally vindicated I knew Gary Webb pretty good I knew Freerick Ross I knew
[27:55.640 --> 27:58.480]  a lot of the folks involved because back then I was the only top of show that
[27:58.480 --> 28:02.200]  would have them on once this crediting started it you see all the
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.440]  establishment media that everybody wants to be on why everybody begs to be
[28:05.440 --> 28:08.480]  friends with it all stabs you in the back you know don't go on cutting edge
[28:08.480 --> 28:14.120]  Alex Jones no no no no but I was watching the movie and quite friendly
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.840]  getting nauseous though feeling sorry for Gary Webb and how he was murdered but
[28:18.840 --> 28:24.680]  with this film it's different because it's triumphant and it's incredible but
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.440]  the only thing they don't cover is that the real final use is not just blackmail
[28:29.440 --> 28:33.840]  not just control not as being able to shut down the grids in any nation you
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.280]  want anytime that's all important that's penultimate that the top of the
[28:39.280 --> 28:45.280]  pyramid the summit is being able to get enough data to predict the future with
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.120]  total accuracy and mass movement but then with that control you can add
[28:49.120 --> 28:54.200]  stimuli and start controlling the future we'll be back I'm Alex Jones this is
[28:54.200 --> 28:56.760]  info war
[28:56.760 --> 29:01.480]  Hillary Clinton's new book stronger together a blueprint for America's future
[29:01.480 --> 29:05.880]  featuring Tim Kaine is being branded the most excellent toilet paper ever the
[29:05.880 --> 29:09.960]  book sold less than 3,000 copies in its first week in print and has a whopping
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.480]  1.5 star review on Amazon what a joke Clint supporters are blaming Trump for
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.440]  the pathetic sales numbers you could put half of Trump supporters into what I
[29:20.440 --> 29:26.840]  call the basket of deplorables so shame on you deplorables don't you know all
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.320]  the profits from this book will go to charity just like Haiti so Clinton can't
[29:31.320 --> 29:35.880]  sell books her rallies can't fill high school gymnasiums we can barely find
[29:35.880 --> 29:40.080]  any of her supporters on the streets she can't do a press conference she can't
[29:40.080 --> 29:44.280]  tell the truth she can't even stand up and I'm supposed to believe that this is
[29:44.280 --> 29:51.400]  a tight race give me a break Trump is kicking her ass this is Owen shroyer
[29:51.400 --> 29:55.160]  from info wars.com

[30:06.240 --> 30:10.240]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[30:10.240 --> 30:14.200]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[30:14.200 --> 30:18.440]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family in the water they took the good
[30:18.440 --> 30:23.120]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened

[30:37.280 --> 30:41.720]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[30:41.720 --> 30:45.680]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[30:45.680 --> 30:50.640]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival

[33:21.440 --> 33:29.280]  jones so 20 years ago I had James Bamford who was the former nightline
[33:29.280 --> 33:34.520]  executive producer on who talked to NSA whistleblowers and he wrote several
[33:34.520 --> 33:41.360]  books about the NSA and then because I had him on I started getting sent more
[33:41.360 --> 33:46.040]  packages of information I started getting contacted but I exposed the
[33:46.040 --> 33:49.200]  scientific Atlantic cable boxes 18 years ago had cameras and microphones
[33:49.200 --> 33:56.080]  and I'm in Austin that's when I really started getting the data dumps and it
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.520]  just got crazier and crazier from them and then of course one of the biggest
[33:59.520 --> 34:04.040]  whistleblowers ever is a fellow that actually works for him for wars and
[34:04.040 --> 34:10.800]  that's Wayne Madsen is coming on here in just a few days and he was in security
[34:10.800 --> 34:14.720]  I don't mean just a security guard I mean spy on members of the NSA was his job
[34:14.720 --> 34:20.040]  and tracking what was coming in and out of the NSA and they knew that taps were
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.560]  being put on by outside agencies and contractors even before 9-11 that this
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.760]  was the ultimate national security risk was to actually let the contractors in
[34:29.760 --> 34:33.440]  which you actually saw that happen with Snowden and I'm not saying it's a bad
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.760]  thing what Snowden did but you build this giant surveillance grid and now it's
[34:37.760 --> 34:41.600]  the surveillance grid that's actually burning Hillary and Obama and the
[34:41.600 --> 34:48.040]  Bushes because it's the NSA technology that people are jacking into that is
[34:48.040 --> 34:52.600]  creating the leaks which is what William Benny who headed the NSA told them
[34:52.600 --> 34:59.960]  20 years ago do not do this and the guy's got a 200 IQ like an idiot
[34:59.960 --> 35:06.560]  savant that thinks in three-dimension four-dimension fractal systems
[35:06.560 --> 35:12.080]  holograms I had dinner with them for like two hours give me business for a few
[35:12.080 --> 35:15.600]  days here in Austin but you know at that dinner I was sitting there talking to
[35:15.600 --> 35:18.600]  him about all this stuff and of course he wasn't telling me any classified
[35:18.600 --> 35:22.680]  things but just stuff that I'd seen in quantum mechanics and theoretical
[35:22.680 --> 35:26.320]  physics and how even mainline journals have been predicting that the NSA was
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.000]  using holograms but I still had people sitting right next to us leaning over
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  watching us and listening us and you know following us around because they've
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.360]  swat teamed that guy you name it the point is is that it's weird to live in
[35:39.360 --> 35:44.480]  the real world all the general public's watching the NFL and I'm not knocking if
[35:44.480 --> 35:47.360]  you do but come on and while the general public's you know watching
[35:47.360 --> 35:51.760]  dances with the stars the real world is going on around you but I'm gonna do a
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.560]  big review this week of Snowden I have no financial connection to it I liked
[35:57.560 --> 36:01.560]  Oliver Stone for JFK and a few of his other films his history series was
[36:01.560 --> 36:08.040]  pretty powerful but I got to tell you I really admire him now because of how
[36:08.040 --> 36:12.720]  accurate this film is now I'm done talking about that film until I put out a
[36:12.720 --> 36:16.240]  produced piece later this week because I want to really I'm gonna go back and
[36:16.240 --> 36:19.520]  watch it again and actually write notes because I expected to see some white
[36:19.520 --> 36:27.000]  wash and it did not happen it was it was extremely powerful so I'm gonna do a
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.960]  big review later this week but you do need to go see the film that said though
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.120]  you need to support independent media and obviously most of you know that I
[36:35.120 --> 36:37.600]  just want to thank those that have supported us that have spread the word
[36:37.600 --> 36:40.560]  that have prayed for us that have bought our products because we've built
[36:40.560 --> 36:44.160]  info wars that reaches over 30 million people a week now one way or another it
[36:44.160 --> 36:47.680]  was 28 million a few months ago it was 26 million a few months before that and
[36:47.680 --> 36:52.600]  it was 20 million a year ago a week and you know it's 30 plus million and quite
[36:52.600 --> 36:57.120]  frankly we have NSA technology to know that that's what Google and Google
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.880]  analytics and all the software that the internet is is NSA the NSA created the
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.280]  internet the NSA just lets us have a small part of it to be able to track
[37:06.280 --> 37:09.480]  everything we do but with the NSA technology just just with one Google
[37:09.480 --> 37:16.080]  tool we know it's 28 million people as of a few months ago 30 plus as of just a
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.880]  few weeks ago and that's taking the 20 million so we know they're just coming
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.960]  to our IP addresses and our platforms and adding those numbers up and then
[37:25.960 --> 37:29.480]  adding what we know we have on terrestrial radio it brings us over 30
[37:29.480 --> 37:34.920]  million and I'm not saying that's a brag I'm tying it all together for you that
[37:34.920 --> 37:42.600]  with one one hundredth of the type of knowledge and data the NSA has I know
[37:42.600 --> 37:47.040]  where our listeners are what countries what their IP addresses are everything
[37:47.040 --> 37:50.840]  people say well you're being a hypocrite I'm not doing any such thing I'm
[37:50.840 --> 37:55.400]  telling you this is how the internet works you can't be on the internet and
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.920]  not do this and here's what I'm getting at what have we built what have we
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.360]  constructed what has the establishment allowed to be done with the architecture
[38:05.360 --> 38:11.160]  of this to put kill switches in every major chip in the world and then let the
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.360]  Chinese manufacture about 60% of those chips and the South Koreans and the
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.520]  Japanese and others and then put those in all our fighter jets tanks submarines
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.160]  ICBMs cruise missiles tow missiles and everything else you can imagine but
[38:25.160 --> 38:29.240]  let's go further what is the establishment done where they start a new
[38:29.240 --> 38:34.040]  type of war where the Japanese and the Swiss and all of our allies but the
[38:34.040 --> 38:40.560]  British and the Israelis have had infrastructure systems put in to shut
[38:40.560 --> 38:46.200]  off their power plants their dams their hospitals everything their power grids
[38:46.200 --> 38:51.720]  in one second and the movie admits which what we covered at the time and then
[38:51.720 --> 38:58.600]  we're going to our reporters on the ground in New York it admits that five
[38:58.600 --> 39:02.600]  and a half years ago the US started and I say US the global sort of hijacked the
[39:02.600 --> 39:09.440]  US the criminals launched a war on Syria that was becoming our ally working with
[39:09.440 --> 39:14.160]  us that let the West get in and get the chips in their grid and to shut their
[39:14.160 --> 39:20.080]  power their water and their internet off for over a month so that the jihad
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.120]  armies out of Saudi Arabia had launched their 200,000 man attack our criminal
[39:25.120 --> 39:28.800]  government launched an attack on the biggest Christian nation in the Middle
[39:28.800 --> 39:35.240]  East 22% Christian at the time 200 plus thousand Christians dead and I'm sitting
[39:35.240 --> 39:39.680]  there in the movie knowing every bit of the movie every bit of it and you know
[39:39.680 --> 39:42.720]  reading the books about Snowden and having the guest on and having folks on
[39:42.720 --> 39:47.320]  the train Stoden do they have in the movie William Benny and I'm sitting
[39:47.320 --> 39:50.640]  there and I couldn't believe they went past up that wasn't in the books and
[39:50.640 --> 39:54.160]  wasn't the news that I'd been told by people that are high up I was just like
[39:54.160 --> 39:57.560]  I don't know how this came out I'm sorry to keep gushing it's just that
[39:57.560 --> 40:04.200]  the donkulous now after we talked to Owen shroyer who's on the ground in New
[40:04.200 --> 40:10.080]  York where there was not a bombing cuz Hillary and the media said you do not
[40:10.080 --> 40:13.760]  call the bombing bombing she says you're not called bombing bombing this is
[40:13.760 --> 40:17.840]  not Allison Wonderland Tea Party this is not an insane asylum this is how dumb
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.040]  they think you are there's no illegal spying either remember that there's no
[40:22.040 --> 40:27.960]  new world order there's no TPP there's no carbon taxes none of it's true just
[40:27.960 --> 40:33.960]  everything we told you is coming true in triplicate because I was wild enough to
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.520]  let whistleblowers come on and to get threatened and to get sued and to get
[40:37.520 --> 40:40.840]  physically attacked and they just kind of underestimated me because I guess I
[40:40.840 --> 40:44.880]  goofy they thought oh well that's just Alex Jones so what if whistleblowers go
[40:44.880 --> 40:48.920]  on him we'll just discredit him doesn't matter you smash me you discredit me in
[40:48.920 --> 40:52.960]  my name the info gets out makes it safer for others to talk about it and then
[40:52.960 --> 40:57.280]  it's a chain reaction see I don't think like you I'm not doing this to be the
[40:57.280 --> 41:02.040]  ego maniac in charge of everything I'm doing it to stop you so I'm happy up
[41:02.040 --> 41:05.560]  front to be the one that hits the barbed wire I'm happy to get chewed up by
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.040]  your political machine gun fire because I'm gonna draw out your location for
[41:10.040 --> 41:14.040]  everybody coming behind me I'm a trailblazer and I'm not a trailblazer
[41:14.040 --> 41:17.320]  because I want to be a trailblazer I'm a trailblazer because it's got to be done
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.320]  you people are dangerous you've got to be dealt with you've got to have somebody
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.880]  stand up to you and say no and that's what we've done and I'm proud of it and
[41:24.880 --> 41:27.560]  I'm proud of all the other patriots out there that have made this broadcast
[41:27.560 --> 41:33.200]  possible so there was a bombing in New Jersey yesterday there was a bombing in
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.920]  New York yesterday it is terrorism Islamic State has taken responsibility and
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.160]  we're going to cover it with our reporters on the ground we come back now
[41:42.160 --> 41:45.760]  some people say who I taught them the term false flag I talked on the term
[41:45.760 --> 41:49.880]  self-inflicted wound I taught them the term inside job concerning terrorism and
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.560]  then I see the comments Alex it's all a stage deal none of it's real blah blah
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.040]  blah there been staged events a lot of it's been declassified we cover those
[41:59.040 --> 42:02.520]  real events the media says that I say everything's a false flag I never did
[42:02.520 --> 42:07.840]  that but this is a false flag in that the globalist are behind radical Islam
[42:07.840 --> 42:11.280]  and opening the door for it and protecting and bringing them in that's a
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.640]  prima facie on its face fact you cannot debate it but the difference is the
[42:16.640 --> 42:20.320]  globalist are actually now allied with Islam to take over the West in the next
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.880]  20 years and they mean business because they think we're soft and stupid and
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.600]  they think jihadis are basically culturally mind-controlled they'll do
[42:27.600 --> 42:32.520]  whatever they're told so that's why I'm opposing and I know it's real because
[42:32.520 --> 42:36.280]  it's the action of the giant jihad army the globalists have turned lose with
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.480]  Saudi Arabia known as al-Qaeda and ISIS so I'm here saying stop letting them into
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.000]  the country because they're forming up and getting ready for even bigger attacks
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.680]  that will then be used to bring in a permanent state of emergency and I told
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.240]  you what happened in Europe it's now been done next it's coming here and I'm
[42:51.240 --> 42:54.320]  not gonna lose our free society because our trade or government brought in a
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.600]  bunch of damn jihadis please listen carefully because I'm about to point

[46:58.240 --> 47:19.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:19.080 --> 47:22.800]  gentlemen we have called you together to inform you that we are going to
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.400]  overthrow the United States government leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[47:27.400 --> 47:32.800]  the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. You still think that Jeffrey will
[47:32.800 --> 47:40.480]  brought down a World Trade Center? Does anybody else see a problem here? If the
[47:40.480 --> 47:45.520]  government has nothing to hide are they so afraid to answer a few questions? This is
[47:45.520 --> 47:50.760]  not our government. The story does not add up. We're on a mission to expose the
[47:50.760 --> 47:53.400]  globalists that have hijacked our country they're working with radical Islam
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.480]  we're going to Saudi Arabians the communists Chinese and others to overthrow
[47:57.480 --> 48:00.920]  this country they want to have a terror attack they stage working with the
[48:00.920 --> 48:04.560]  jihadis then have a police state that's set up that we accept that's then
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.280]  really used on us to have the globalists and the central government clamped down
[48:08.280 --> 48:11.400]  the people now have you never heard the New World Order described to you
[48:11.400 --> 48:15.960]  perfectly and succinctly that's it they advertise to bring the jihadis into
[48:15.960 --> 48:20.840]  Europe they tell them there's free women whiskey and gold come on in baby they
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.360]  come in they red carpet them the UN runs TV ads in Germany saying blonde women
[48:25.360 --> 48:31.360]  wear hijabs the socialist leaders on national TV in the Bundestag say being
[48:31.360 --> 48:36.080]  German is evil breed with the Muslims I mean this is treason we have the articles
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.680]  up on info wars.com if you're a new listener I know that sounds insane
[48:39.680 --> 48:45.120]  truth is stranger than fiction the fact that the NSA dials in and turns on your
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.480]  webcams and watches you for fun and almost every NSA member has been caught
[48:49.480 --> 48:54.720]  in other agencies you know tracking their wife or husband I think I probably
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.760]  would too that technology the point is is that you're not supposed to have one
[48:58.760 --> 49:03.600]  group with this and nobody else this is dangerous now I know I've gone off on a
[49:03.600 --> 49:09.640]  jag about that the next few segments I'm gonna cover the attacks in New Jersey and
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.640]  in New York yesterday with pressure cooker bombs two bombs went off other
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.160]  bombs were found 29 people were injured some of them critically you know faces
[49:18.160 --> 49:24.360]  blown off you name it they bombed a Marine Corps fundraiser March jog and
[49:24.360 --> 49:27.480]  it's supposedly according to Hillary we're not supposed to say it's a terror
[49:27.480 --> 49:32.840]  attack this is like living in North Korea if we buy this Hillary should be
[49:32.840 --> 49:38.200]  instantly discredited now the good news is coming up later the next hour Trump
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.480]  polling surge is turning into a tidal wave we have the poll numbers across the
[49:42.480 --> 49:46.920]  nation black voters are turning from Trump from Clinton to Trump in new polls
[49:46.920 --> 49:53.360]  raised Titans and projected us electoral college vote Reuters CBS says
[49:53.360 --> 49:56.080]  they're in a dead heat battleground states nice 10 points ahead remember what
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.240]  he remember when they say he leaves in a dead heat 10 points ahead and where I
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.280]  told you a month ago and they said he was losing that was all big lie we have
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.160]  internal polls ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna leave it that but Trump was so
[50:07.160 --> 50:11.480]  confident Trump's got scientific polls nationwide at great expense going on
[50:11.480 --> 50:18.640]  daily they know the real numbers 10 points ahead folks he's so far ahead in
[50:18.640 --> 50:21.760]  New York he may even win it I know there's hardly any Republicans even
[50:21.760 --> 50:26.440]  registered there it's almost a pure Democrat state but in internal polls and
[50:26.440 --> 50:33.120]  even in mainline polls he is ahead he is only a few points ahead you know in a
[50:33.120 --> 50:37.280]  few states but if you look at places like DC Hillary is only a few points ahead
[50:37.280 --> 50:43.880]  she was 20 points ahead a month ago and that's Google polls that are being
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.200]  scientifically done of respondents where they know which political party they're
[50:48.200 --> 50:53.800]  in Democrats using when DC by 30 points Hillary's only a few points what four
[50:53.800 --> 50:59.960]  points out of Trump now what's that tell you she is in deep horse manure because
[50:59.960 --> 51:03.560]  she's a total fraud she said she wasn't sick we know she's been in the hospital
[51:03.560 --> 51:06.520]  off and on for over a year we know she's been falling down from the Secret
[51:06.520 --> 51:09.720]  Service what I tell you with big four and a half weeks ago on the Sunday show
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.480]  from our Secret Service sources that we personally met in Cleveland at the RNC
[51:14.480 --> 51:19.960]  and then got us the Intel as promised three weeks later we don't know what's
[51:19.960 --> 51:24.000]  wrong whether we think it's Parkinson's or brain tumor she's falling down how
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.880]  soon every 20 30 minutes she's got special stuff to get in the vehicles go
[51:28.880 --> 51:32.480]  look at it for yourself all turn out to be true then she fell down in front of
[51:32.480 --> 51:36.960]  everyone and the news wouldn't even show the video over falling down it showed
[51:36.960 --> 51:41.800]  her like wobbling and said oh she just stumbled and cut the tape and now that
[51:41.800 --> 51:46.360]  same media thinks you're so dumb they say there wasn't bombs yesterday in
[51:46.360 --> 51:50.720]  New York and New Jersey let's play Hillary last night talking about the
[51:50.720 --> 51:56.120]  bombing on her plane doing a press conference and then they start talking
[51:56.120 --> 52:01.640]  about how bad Trump is 40 seconds later because he called it a bombing maybe
[52:01.640 --> 52:05.280]  like if I said if anyone wears an AV blue sports jacket they are the filth of
[52:05.280 --> 52:08.160]  the earth and she'd be arrested anyone wearing that should be discredited I'm
[52:08.160 --> 52:13.680]  wearing an AV blue jacket that's what she did she's like she say there's a
[52:13.680 --> 52:18.280]  bombing and he's horrible he said it's a bombing this is upside down Looneyville
[52:18.280 --> 52:24.360]  folks let's go to the club briefed about the bombings in New York and New
[52:24.360 --> 52:31.160]  Jersey and the attack in Minnesota obviously we need to do everything we
[52:31.160 --> 52:39.480]  can to support our first responders also to pray for the victims we have to
[52:39.480 --> 52:45.200]  let this investigation unfold we've been in touch with various officials
[52:45.200 --> 52:52.520]  including the mayor's office in New York to learn what they are discovering as
[52:52.520 --> 52:56.680]  they conduct this investigation and I'll have more to say about it when we
[52:56.680 --> 53:12.120]  actually know some facts well I think it's important to know the facts about
[53:12.120 --> 53:18.720]  any incident like this that's why it's critical to support the first responders
[53:18.720 --> 53:24.040]  the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen I
[53:24.040 --> 53:34.680]  think it's always wiser to wait until you have information before making
[53:34.680 --> 53:41.080]  conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine
[53:41.080 --> 53:46.440]  now Owen shroyer and our crew are in New York City site of the bombing last night
[53:46.440 --> 53:51.240]  the bombing that injured 29 a pressure cooker another one went off in New
[53:51.240 --> 53:55.840]  Jersey the same day and other bombs were found and deactivated by the police so
[53:55.840 --> 54:02.840]  there were bombs the police say they were bombs it's terrorism but Hillary
[54:02.840 --> 54:07.560]  Owen says that there was a bombing and and Trump shouldn't call it a bombing I
[54:07.560 --> 54:12.960]  mean we've reached a new level here what's your latest info my friend well
[54:12.960 --> 54:16.600]  Alex we're out here on the scene and there is a bomb squad here there is
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.120]  counter-terrorism also present here so it's amazing how they'll say it's not a
[54:21.120 --> 54:25.280]  bombing or it's not terror but then the government sends out bomb squads and
[54:25.280 --> 54:28.320]  counter-terrorism squad so they're kind of it's a bit of a double thing there but
[54:28.320 --> 54:30.880]  we know what the media is trying to do they want to massage this for Hillary
[54:30.880 --> 54:33.640]  and you know you were just talking about the polls not to get off track here but
[54:33.640 --> 54:37.440]  Hillary wouldn't even be polling Hillary wouldn't even be on the stage if she
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.760]  didn't have the media in her back pocket but as you were saying earlier it is
[54:40.760 --> 54:45.240]  scary that we can have a bombing happen and then have the media and our own
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.840]  government officials here in New York pretend like it's no big deal pretend
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.360]  like it wasn't a bombing and just try to shuffle it under the rug oh and it's so
[54:53.360 --> 54:57.800]  crazy it makes my head spin I mean it's the next level of brainwashing and
[54:57.800 --> 55:00.960]  absolutely I mean Hillary knows they flood the country with jihadis same thing
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.560]  in Europe that it's the same policy they will not call 90 plus people dead in
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.640]  the satir attack they say it's a truck attack well I think about this Alex you
[55:10.640 --> 55:14.880]  know we still have questions from past bombings that weren't so long ago the
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.120]  Boston Marathon bombing what did they use for that a pressure cooker bomb but
[55:18.120 --> 55:21.200]  they say there's no relation between the two events we had an explosion in
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.440]  Central Park I believe it was July 2nd or somewhere around there's blew a kid's
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.960]  leg off nothing no answers on that could this be the same person we don't know
[55:29.960 --> 55:34.320]  that's my landmine it was a landmine well and then Cuomo comes out and what
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.040]  does he say he says nobody's claim responsibility that's an outright lie
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.000]  and then he says that he he knows that this was not an international act of
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.840]  terror so they're sitting here they're saying well we don't know we still need
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.240]  more intel but we know for sure it's not ISIS related we know for sure
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.200]  responsibility for this and the nine people stab three critically in Minnesota
[55:54.200 --> 55:57.800]  with a guy screaming Allah Akbar and asking are you Muslim they say no they
[55:57.800 --> 56:04.880]  go I mean oh but it's not the Muslims well and we can sit here and maybe we'll
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.040]  figure out what happened with this bombing maybe we won't but we know what
[56:08.040 --> 56:13.560]  the real story here is they want to bring in the Islamic people from the
[56:13.560 --> 56:16.640]  Middle East they tear the parties are cut they tear those countries apart with
[56:16.640 --> 56:21.160]  war they bring in the refugees that's all a destabilization attempt in America
[56:21.160 --> 56:24.720]  just like what happened in Europe they want to do that same thing here so of
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.360]  course the media wants to separate any relation to ISIS of course the media
[56:28.360 --> 56:31.640]  wants to say that or Hillary wants to say that Islam is the religion of peace
[56:31.640 --> 56:35.400]  because they have to have the American public buying that so that when they
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.200]  bring a million refugees here from those war-torn countries people won't be
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.000]  scared that there's gonna be bombs planted all over their cities but then
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.600]  when the bombs go off we all have to lose our rights keep it safe from the
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.840]  events that are quote intentional events but not terrorism and certainly not
[56:51.840 --> 56:55.920]  Islamic yeah you know and again it's like how can they sit here and say that
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.320]  well we're still doing our investigation we don't really have any answers but we
[56:59.320 --> 57:03.160]  know it's not ISIS we know it's not an international act of terror how do you
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.000]  know that you are the one saying you don't know well buddy you know that put
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.960]  info wars comma put drudge up we have ISIS officially planning responsibility
[57:11.960 --> 57:15.440]  for this and saying that the Minnesota stabbing just like the ones in London
[57:15.440 --> 57:18.400]  everywhere else and the cops get a shot and everything when they scream Allah
[57:18.400 --> 57:24.200]  Akbar ISIS ISIS celebrates NYC dumpster bombing Allah mall stabbings in Minnesota
[57:24.200 --> 57:28.160]  there will be more that's their words but it's okay because there will be more
[57:28.160 --> 57:32.680]  people in our media that tell us pure lies the NSA isn't listening to you
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.640]  there's no police state yeah there is and the police states there to keep the
[57:36.640 --> 57:40.480]  jihadi safe and to make sure they can get in an attack us and to spy on the
[57:40.480 --> 57:44.160]  American people and have George Soros running around trying to fund black lives

[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.760]  ladies and gentlemen it's actually good news that the globalists are so arrogant
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.120]  that they would try to run a corpse like Hillary have her with epilepsy brain
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.080]  tumors lung cancer reportedly from our sources falling down has no idea what
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.480]  planets she's on was totally ill always doing you know one person interviews on
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.760]  her airplane for five minutes she can't even give a ten minute speech without
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.320]  coughing and she's up and just trying to sell us all these lies it's emblematic
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.600]  as I've said many times that they're delusional and I told you Trump was 15
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.480]  10 to 15 points depending on the poll in scientific polls even in mainstream
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.000]  polls after the RNC so they got freaked out changed the methodology and put him
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  10 points behind but now he served so much in some internal polls nationally
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.600]  15 20 points ahead that even with 15 points added he said he's had by five
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.400]  points this is a tsunami this is a tidal wave and even mainstream analysts I'm
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.880]  gonna cover it later are now admitting it so we told you folks and we told you
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.960]  there's election fraud they were gonna federalize the election and a month
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.680]  later they announced they're doing it we know what we're talking about we know
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.760]  the enemy we know that when two bombs go off and ISIS claims responsibility it's
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:57.000]  terrorism you're like yeah that's not very smart to know I know I know when the
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.400]  sun comes up I can say I get it that's what I mean this is not hard explosive
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.000]  language call the New York bombing terrorism already that's what the
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.600]  observers saying absolutely right but that's Donald Trump's not in law that
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.680]  owns that so you're gonna get some reality oh no Trump is is is is what was
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:27.200]  the word they were using trunk Trump is impulsive no he's decisive mr. shroyer
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:33.600]  what do you say reporting from fours calm on the ground there in New York what
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.640]  do you say about them claiming that that he's compulsive when they announced
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.000]  bombs have gone off to say bombs have gone off I mean are they trying to train
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.920]  us just that they're God and that words themselves are evil well and think about
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.640]  this that's exactly what an ISIS terror-related group would want they
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.360]  would want to attack and bomb and do all this stuff and then have the American
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.320]  people or whoever it is they're attacking just sitting on their heels and
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.280]  waiting and thinking oh well we don't know you know no you you have to have
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.560]  some level of impulse you have to have some level of compulsive here otherwise
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.000]  you're gonna get stepped all over if you gotta be decisive it's like of a wall
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.680]  farce coming we had wall fires all over Austin six years ago that burned down
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.760]  tens of thousands of acres imagine if there's a wall fire coming a mile from
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.760]  your house and you wait for the government to tell you to evacuate or you
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.400]  I mean it's crazy it's like it's a damn wildfire it's a bombing it's an attack
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.520]  well and think about this Alex we're in New York City 15 years ago the Twin
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.160]  Towers and Building 7 were brought down by what we were told our radical
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.360]  Islamic terrorist now here we are not terrorism Hillary says we're not allowed
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.680]  to say so sorry exactly 15 years later just saying radical Islamic terror is a
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.800]  crime so how I mean how do the American people not see right through this how
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.880]  can you go in 15 years from radical Islamic terror bringing down three
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:56.360]  buildings in this city to now saying you can't say radical Islamic terror that's
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:00.520]  the religion of peace that's all happened in just this city alone regardless of
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.520]  all the other attacks we've seen people chaining Allah Akbar and then going
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.080]  around stabbing people and you know they say like Hillary says Islam is a
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.640]  religion of peace okay let's say there's one million Muslims on the planet and
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.400]  let's say 5% of them are radical okay well well guess what nobody yells praise
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.440]  Jesus Christ goes into a mall and stabs 20 people nobody yells pray Jesus Christ
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:26.720]  or or praise Buddha and then blows themselves up in an act of terror okay
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.360]  so there is no Islamic trait to kill each other and to run around murdering
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.000]  for the religion it's like we go have communion well under Islam you go blow
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.600]  people up well and what are what like what are you gonna do if this continues
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.560]  are they gonna continue to try to brush it under the rug are they gonna continue
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.200]  to say it's not radical Islamic terror are they gonna just make it pass a are
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.880]  we just gonna have to accept it we're gonna come right back and talk more
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.040]  about what you expect to happen Hillary's way behind now in polls what's
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.960]  she gonna pull United States women's national team soccer player Megan
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.560]  Rapinoe has decided she would take a knee during the national anthem during
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:10.000]  yesterday's game against Thailand now Rapinoe had been taking a knee during
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.680]  her games for the national women's soccer league but taking a knee during a
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:19.840]  national game is an entirely different story she was told by US soccer that she
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.200]  was expected to stand for the national anthem when she represented the national
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.320]  team but instead she decided to take a knee anyway US soccer released the
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.280]  following statement representing your country is a privilege and an honor for
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.560]  any player or coach that is associated with the US national teams the playing
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.400]  of our national anthem is an opportunity for our men's and women's
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.000]  national team players and coaches to reflect upon the liberties and freedom
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.560]  we will appreciate in this country we have an expectation that our players and
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.840]  coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.040]  well I think that there's only one solution to this kick Megan Rapinoe
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:06:10.240]  off the US women's national team this is Owen Troyer from info wars.com
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:16.360]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:30.040]  GCN radio network
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:36.720]  Owen Troyer one of our new great reporters at info wars been a citizen
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.040]  reporter and activist for years out there has been here a few months doing a
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.840]  great job he and the team are up in New York City site of the terrorist bombing
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:49.400]  that ISIS has taken responsibility for another bomb went off into Jersey other
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.440]  bombs were found the communist mayor will not call it terrorism the police have
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.280]  been ordered to say it isn't terrorism despite the fact it is but it's like if
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.480]  the moon rises at night and the media says you're not allowed to call that the
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.440]  moon I'm still gonna call it the moon this is a real exercise in mass mind
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.320]  control now I want to be clear our own Pentagon has a lot of patriots headed who
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:16.040]  five years ago refused to back Hillary and Obama in the overthrow of Syria and
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.520]  they've since gone public general Flynn who advises Trump is exposed the fact
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.800]  that Obama and Hillary are basically funding and arming al-Qaeda its new
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.920]  name is ISIS it's it's new country is called Islamic State but that's an
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:36.440]  al-Qaeda Wahhabi a Saudi Arabian state part of Iraq part of Syria and thanks
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.320]  to the military exposing it and info wars and our listeners exposing it and
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.680]  Rand Paul and others coming out exposing in Congress we know about it was
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.000]  about to be a big ceasefire that the Russians had brokered by all sides that
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.400]  was gonna start at midnight last night but magically 60 plus Syrian regular
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:00.320]  army troops and their tanks got blown up and killed in a key battle where al-Qaeda
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.680]  slash ISIS was being defeated and so now al-Qaeda is back on the offensive
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:11.320]  known as ISIS and Russia is saying it was staged by the U.S. to kill the
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.280]  ceasefire now Russia is very clear they said the criminal elements of our
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:21.240]  government backing radical Islam that is exactly what is going on there so we'll
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.080]  talk more about that coming up but everywhere you turn Obama has been
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:31.600]  aiding ISIS and al-Qaeda that's why Trump properly said Hillary and Obama are
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.760]  the founders of ISIS she ran Libya she ran it all we've got a big story tomorrow
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:43.880]  on Libya breaking at info wars.com and this deals with leaks this is a big
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.960]  story I'm just gonna leave it there my phones are so tapped and everything we
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.920]  do is so tap it's already known but this is coming out tomorrow and it deals
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.320]  with Hillary and the fact that Hillary this even came out at the time but now
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:03.760]  we have the proof total proof Hillary had Qaddafi trying to give up completely
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.200]  follow every Western demand turn the country over but they wanted to wreck
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.480]  it and turn Islamic State lose to kill everybody and wreck the country and
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:16.280]  create a failed state so the negotiator with Hillary that was on the phone with
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.320]  Qaddafi is coming on the show this week we have all the documents it's gonna be a
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.640]  big deal just like we told you a month ago Hillary's falling down all the time
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.600]  and have an epileptic seizures a secret service told us they got special
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.280]  wheelchair access to her vehicles we have all the video now it's all a bit
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.560]  admitted we don't make this up we're the people that will have the whistleblowers
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.720]  on and the establishment hasn't gotten up to the point yet I'm being willing to
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.520]  kill me or set me up or arrest me for whistleblowing because I've got so many
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.160]  good people in the government the back us and so many citizens of back us I'm a
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.440]  radio host I'm not like Snowden running off to you in the middle of the night to
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.240]  Hong Kong and I don't blame but being where could he go he had to go to the
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.640]  media we're here we're exposing the globalist we're defending this Republic
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.600]  from enemies foreign and domestic all right going back to our reporter on the
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:19.440]  street in New York where do you think all of this is going what do you think
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.800]  Hillary's gonna do when she's way behind the polls even the cook pole she's
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.520]  behind what is she gonna pull my big concern is they can't cover up all their
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.480]  jihad attacks they can't cover up the imploding economy the open borders they
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.200]  can't cover what's happening with the dollar what is Hillary gonna do what is
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.040]  the establishment gonna do because we got the new Colin Powell emails from
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.240]  Bohemian Grove with a Republican establishment hating Trump just proving
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:48.800]  how real he is well you know they can manipulate big events like 9-11 or you
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.840]  know ending the ceasefire in Syria they have the power to do that kind of stuff
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:58.080]  but you know if they bring in these radical Islamic terrorists then they're
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.600]  kind of you know people call them lone wolves or whatever you want to call them
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.580]  but then they don't have control over them then they're doing stuff and we
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.840]  can actually get to the bottom of it and we can show what they're doing so
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.040]  we've seen their response deny deny deny and then bring in more of them bring in
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.160]  more of them bring in more of them telling us to their religion of peace but
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.400]  as far as what Hillary's gonna do moving forward we've already we I mean look we
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.240]  knew that she was getting crushed in the polls the what where else do you need
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.400]  proof okay she gets nobody at a rally she gets nobody at a press conferences
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.880]  you can't find her supporters on the street Trump gets tens of thousands
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.080]  people anytime he goes even Bernie Sanders Alex spoke yesterday for Hillary
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.680]  Clinton and had 150 people there Bernie Sanders went from filling arenas now
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:42.080]  he's only got 150 people because he's supporting Hillary Clinton so she is
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.560]  absolutely just falling apart at the seams I don't know what she can do it's
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.160]  like it gets crazier every day a bombing happens she denies it's a bombing I
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.240]  mean who could predict that who could predict such an outrageous thing to come
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.000]  out of a presidential candidates now who could say Islam is a religion of peace
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.600]  when it's almost a monthly event now someone yells Allah Akbar and stab
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.920]  somebody to death oh and Troyer does this show that the establishment's
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.360]  mentally ill and thinks they're magic and control reality because all they're
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.920]  doing is discrediting themselves a and then be what happens if Hillary actually
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.800]  steals the election and gets in and then ends up being an invalid and you know
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:28.760]  not coming out with every six months or something you know I'm not really sure
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.040]  what happens if Hillary wins because I don't think the American public is gonna
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.120]  buy that I really don't see how the American public can buy that and I don't
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.240]  see how she can even serve she's clearly not fit to serve so maybe they just you
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.480]  know you know who knows maybe she dies off or something and Tim Kaine comes in
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.240]  and takes over but like I said first of all they're gonna have to pull the mask
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.520]  over everyone in America and say Hillary Hillary won this because nobody is buying
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.720]  that whatsoever and I would have to say absolutely these people are mentally
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.160]  deranged if you think that you're going to come in and try to take down America
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.720]  and not get backlash from the American citizens you have to be mentally
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.840]  deranged absolutely these people have psychotic psychotic ambitions of
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.840]  world power when you say corrupt elements of the United States government
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.760]  are the ones destabilizing the world they're working with the same corrupt
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:29.000]  elements in Europe okay in China they're all working together to destabilize we
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.640]  know it's a criminal element to suppress the domestic populations
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.320]  absolutely and and we even have declassified documents we have the emails
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.320]  now which shows good people inside our own government are actually leaking info
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.040]  and I love seeing the whole surveillance grid being used against the
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.160]  establishment that's got to be really freaking them out well and and it's like
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.760]  they have to know this now maybe maybe they thought that they had the hearts
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.280]  and the minds of America already won over maybe they thought that they already
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.800]  had us as brainwashed as they needed all of us to be and they got so brazen and
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.600]  so open and with the media and with politicians speaking it's you know
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.440]  starting to turn on them people are starting to wake up but again the
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.000]  question for me is who do you think they will blame first for what happened in
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.320]  New York do you think that they will blame Islamic terror or do you think
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.400]  they'll blame a pressure cooker well it actually said it's a pressure cooker
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.200]  explosion not a bomb and the fraternal order of police the biggest police
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.040]  organization and the countries come out and endorse Trump Hillary didn't even
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.680]  seek their endorsement to show how Joker like she is I mean what does that tell
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.560]  you Owen well and it's like what Dinesh D'Souza said today you know the
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.760]  Democrats are looking here and they're saying that Trump is the problem Trump
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.400]  is the problem but Trump is actually pointing to the real issues in the
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.160]  country they can attack Trump all day Trump is not the one by the way I know
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.520]  I know we've hammered this but let's all just sit back calmly in fact we have
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.200]  that queued up with Hillary saying the bombing and the media criticizes that
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.800]  they said the bombing because we played it earlier think about this she comes out
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.280]  in the press conference it says we had a bombing and Trump is wrong to call it a
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.600]  bombing we actually have her last night talking to a reporter saying this and
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.200]  you're like this is so crazy that Trump is now to blame for the bombing for
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.160]  calling it a bombing when it's a bombing it's next level insanity well
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.440]  they've been trying to tell us that the sky is green and grass is blue for a
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.040]  long time but you know if you even look at Hillary when she makes these
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.440]  statements I mean she looks either like an inch away from death or drugged out
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.960]  of her mind it's one of those two well that's the headline yeah a frail looking
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.160]  Hillary hits Trump for calling NYC attack bombings after doing the same and
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.440]  that's mainstream news saying that I mean this is reaching Cocoa for cuckoo puffs
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.680]  level where I don't even is this even real I mean am I in a dream is this the
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.480]  matrix I mean thank you Owen we'll be back stay with us
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.400]  more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.280]  has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.240]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.200]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.440]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family in the water they took the good
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.120]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.240]  as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.840]  for your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.280]  the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.720]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.680]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.640]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:56.160]  shield x2 today and info wars life calm or by calling 888-253-3139
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.440]  hey everyone pharmacist Ben Fuchs here host of the bright side and as many of
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.880]  you know I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy you've

[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.280]  research and to see the reviews for yourself that's info wars life calm or
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:06.080]  call 888-253-3139 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:21.040]  it's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.800]  ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling which
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.000]  has done been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt it does not
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.320]  somehow promote proflicacy all it does is it says you got to pay the bills that
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.320]  you've already racked up Congress raising the national debt does not raise the
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:47.640]  national debt you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:54.960]  you heard Obama raising the debt does not raise the debt two plus two does not
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:01.000]  equal four you did not build your business you can keep your doctor
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.280]  Obamacare is free then Obamacare was the cost of a cable build the IRS was not
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.760]  there and would not take penalties of up to $5,000 a year out of your bank
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:18.720]  account it's happening all over the country now you know you were lied to
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:28.320]  and now Hillary says the bombing today in New York was not a bombing and Trump
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:38.240]  was wrong to call it a bombing the bombing was not a bombing the bombing
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.200]  was not a bombing this is who you're trying to elect I mean Hillary is an
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:49.280]  international war criminal involved in so many crimes my head spins it isn't
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.800]  about Hillary or Trump or these personalities Hillary is the
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.560]  establishment Hillary is so evil what is wrong with supposed Democrats that
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.280]  would support this woman and then all the weird gay rallies around the country
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.240]  that I see on the news saying Trump's a homophobe when Trump was doing interviews
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.880]  with the advocate the biggest game newspaper in the country and calling for
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.200]  equal rights 30 years ago when no one else was I mean he's known for being I
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.240]  mean conservative should have a problem with him or being too liberal my point
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:27.440]  is is it isn't reality bombings are bombings ladies and gentlemen to Hillary
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.280]  Clinton called the incident a bombing the Clinton mouthpiece media then
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.520]  slammed Donald Trump for calling the incident a bombing
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:53.160]  I've been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey we played the
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.200]  full two-minute clip earlier if she goes on to say yeah he's you know he's where's
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:06.280]  the quote actually wrote it down there it is she said that we had to play the full
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.640]  clip it's upon him for worse calm that he was you know basically somebody that
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.280]  just jumped in made stuff up no it's a bombing I mean I mean that's what happened
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.200]  and you admit it's a bombing but then they say it's wrong with all Trump's
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.800]  calling it a bombing right after you call it a bombing I mean this is so
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.880]  simple so ridiculous it actually makes my head hurt that we've gotten to this
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.520]  point now I want to go to some other video clips here because there's a bunch
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:35.000]  of them we have meet the press cuts to commercial and we've checked their clock
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.840]  we've checked when they were supposed to go to commercial they weren't supposed
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:44.240]  to as Trump spokeswoman attacks Clinton and in the meet the press interview
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:48.760]  featuring Donald Trump's campaign manager Kathleen Conway Sunday in which
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:53.800]  she tore apart Clinton campaign a moment before her feed was cut off it's like
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.720]  when Trump got up and said Hillary's the founder of ices they cut his feed then
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:01.720]  happen two or three other times this is the level of censorship and the show is
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:08.640]  run by former top Democrat White House operatives so this is how stupid they
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:25.280]  think we are let's go ahead and play that clip the full videos on info wars.com
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.680]  I mean don't they feel trapped that the polls are tightening now that we're out
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.680]  there giving our message directly to the voters and they're running 22 just a
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.040]  health plan introduces star kids the plan for children with special needs our
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.080]  service coordinators will offering one-on-one help to develop a care plan
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.080]  as unique as your child the right doctors the right these coalitions
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.440]  well I'll say pause are we gonna let's back up a minute so we cut it a little
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.920]  bit short cuz they actually got a several minutes of ads but right during the
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.800]  middle of it they put some medical ad up about doctors and then they come back
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:15.600]  to her after they basically shut her down now the next clip I want to get to
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:21.000]  is up on info wars.com we posted this Friday a five-year-old could tell this
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.880]  was satire it was Joe Biggs his idea maybe five percent of what we do is satire
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:31.320]  and it's the voice in Hillary's earpiece reveal info wars and covers the man
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:39.540]  behind Hillary Clinton's earpiece and it's Joe Biggs and it's Mr. Shroyer the
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.600]  reporter was just talking to make a joke about all the crazy stuff she's done
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.600]  barking like a dog and do it other weird stuff during species she's given so
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:54.320]  you had a comedy piece Facebook suspended Joe Biggs's account suspended
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.600]  other accounts that ran it and sent us messages saying you're putting out
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:04.960]  misleading news then we had commenters on info wars saying this is satire don't
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.200]  deceive us listen if you're so stupid that you think a drone actually landed
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.960]  to get Hillary's earpiece and you think Joe Biggs is telling her to bark like a
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.680]  dog I'm sorry tune out of the show okay now I know that's trolls doing it I know
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.680]  most the audience got it 90% of people loved it but this is satire about her
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.560]  having her staff in the WikiLeaks and in the FBI files and in the FBI
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:34.080]  interviews admit they have hammers by their sides to destroy their cell phones
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.400]  and computers if they get rated that's the whole point of the piece here it is
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:45.120]  all right madam secretary can you hear me it's not if you can hear me okay good
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.760]  all right secretary Clinton you are in Selma Alabama these people are not gonna
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:53.480]  react to your New York accent I need you to tone it down and use that really thick
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.280]  southern accent you learn from living in Arkansas right come on I don't feel no
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.400]  way he's tired
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:08.320]  from where I started from our secretary Clinton you and I both know that those
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.960]  lives are the people that died Benghazi don't even matter they're hammering you
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.440]  right now just say what difference does it make at this point what difference
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.800]  does it make what difference at this point does it make it is our job to
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.320]  figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.400]  ever happening again all right you're kind of drawing this whole thing out
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.520]  a little too far let's go on ahead and change it up bark like a dog not like a
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:42.520]  ferocious dog but like a chihuahua give me a you know yeah we I think we should
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.520]  just raise taxes on the middle class but you know I'm not the one running for
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.880]  raise no no no no no no no no no no no no
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:59.640]  make what we've got work or I don't well and improve it and get the cost out
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:06.640]  of upward spiral upward spiral now I want to mention two other things last
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.780]  week it was reported on info wars.com that your email server was hacked and
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:14.240]  you knowingly continued to use your email server can you comment on that
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.920]  That was a damn info wars reporter. They're asking about your emails deny deny deny deny. Yeah, it's totally untrue
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.640]  That was close
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.120]  All right, you and I both know this is an extremely boring press conference
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.960]  Let's just act like we're super into it
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.880]  Whoa tone it down tone it down. That's way too much. You just have a seizure
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.960]  Everyone's gonna be thinking that you had a seizure that's enough see the second half satire, which means this is joke
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:49.080]  But it's hilarious great job job bags and the rest of crew with that one the exciting conclusion of it's up on info wars calm
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.120]  But I'm gonna come back into the amazing poll numbers where Trump is not a wave not a surge

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.000]  Now I mentioned these polls, but let's get into some of these numbers and I want to explain something
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:16.360]  When I read these stories, I call politicos libertarians Democrats Republicans
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:22.120]  I know I talked to people that are the national pollsters and I tell them off record tell me the truth and
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.120]  And I get a very clear picture
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  across the board of
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.040]  What's really happening?
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:36.400]  Not the big polls they push that you see on the news every night, but what the corporations the banks the political parties are actually
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:44.160]  Paying to have real polls. There's fake polls. They're paying for as well to create perception. Oh look Hillary 30 points ahead
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.560]  Hillary's 50 points ahead. I
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:52.920]  Made the joke of why not saying she's 5,000 points ahead. I mean you can only say she's a hundred percent ahead
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:57.360]  If she got every voter in America 335 million Americans, you'd say Hillary got a
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.800]  Hundred percent that's impossible hundred percent. Don't vote you get 60% turnouts in national elections
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.600]  40 something percent turnouts in off years
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:12.760]  Every two years you get 40 something percent than every four. I want to say national election. You get
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.960]  60 61 62 65 about as high as it's ever gotten
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.320]  So it's impossible to say she could get a hundred percent, but see the New York Times
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.280]  Just a month ago was saying Hillary had a 95% chance of winning
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.140]  Then it dropped down to 90. I checked the New York Times and it said
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:39.200]  87% chance last week. In fact, let's go to the New York Times right now for TV viewers
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:46.160]  A lot of folks are watching us at m4s.com forward slash show. You can go there and let's see if it's dropping more
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.880]  It creates a perception and that way they can say oh
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.760]  95% oh 87% oh
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.760]  85%
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:02.440]  Hoping you believe it's a foregone conclusion hoping you buy the propaganda hoping you go to sleep hoping you shut up
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:08.280]  But see as he surges way ahead. They've got to start hedging their back. Okay 85 70
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.560]  Oh, he's gonna win. How much do you want to bet?
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.280]  that on the day
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.040]  Hillary loses November 8th. They've got Trump winning
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.160]  Latest election poll they've got Donald J. Trump at 42 Hillary at 44. Well, that's another poll
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.320]  They've got one on their front page every day on their news feed
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:31.320]  They sent out because I subscribed to it that that shows on their front page
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.560]  80 something percent chance Trump's gonna lose everybody's seen it and
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.320]  And sure the real polls they've got there still spins
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Have him losing
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.120]  Do a control f Trump and search search search. Well, you'll find it
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.320]  You know have them on losing my two points
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.240]  But all the other polls show him nationally CNN polls LA Times polls
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.080]  Rasmussen polls Bloomberg polls
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:59.440]  Six to seven to eight points ahead with a margin of error of three points
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:07.080]  Donald Trump is ahead with a margin of error by three points at least even in these cook polls with Reuters and others adding
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.400]  10 to 15 percent more Democrats in the demographic they pull
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.920]  So with that said that we have a former member of the KGB. I have a clip of this
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.880]  Coming out and saying don't buy the propaganda
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.640]  Don't buy the lies and John Bowne actually breaks this down in a very powerful report
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640]  Hillary Clinton
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.640]  As a campaign of globalist demoralization
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:39.360]  Don't believe it. I really want to air this report, but I've got another report. That's even more important
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.480]  I want to air after the break. We'll see how much time we have
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  But but let's go ahead and go through these polls
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.720]  This is a daily caller
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:53.320]  Two weeks ago some pundits began talking about Trump surge suddenly the surge is looking like a full-fledged wave
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:41:01.000]  Trump's polling surge is now a wave. I call it a tsunami in one battleground after another the billionaire real estate model is opening up a
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.440]  Lead over Hillary Clinton or making that states race competitive again
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.520]  Here's how beating Clinton and several of the latest polls and then they go over in Ohio in
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:13.480]  Florida in Iowa
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  Let's talk about those actual poll numbers
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.920]  Black voters are turning from Clinton to Trump in new poll. That's the New York Post same thing
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:30.280]  Hillary had a 20 plus percent lead in DC. It's now a 5% lead. I mean in places that are Democrat owned
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.180]  She's only got five point leads when they were 20 plus point leads just a month ago
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.240]  Trump saw 16.5 percent point increase and backing from African-American votes in Los Angeles times
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:49.760]  The University of Southern California tracking poll up from 3.1 percent in September to 19.6 percent Friday
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.880]  that's only because
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:58.640]  The LA Times and others were discrediting themselves putting out fake polls where they were only sampling Democrats that came out
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:05.480]  So now they know his landslide is so huge that claiming he's losing isn't gonna work. So now they're just putting out real polls
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:11.760]  There hasn't been a Republican since Ronald Reagan got more than 15 percent in the most liberal area
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.760]  The country he's getting 19 plus
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.040]  See
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:23.760]  This is only them now saving face because they know it's a landslide for Trump. They know she's collapsing that physically and figuratively
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.080]  Let's continue race Titans in
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:34.960]  US electoral college vote Reuters basically admits what what Roger Stone told us four days ago
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.320]  He's a top analyst. He's winning the electoral college now. That's Reuters
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:45.720]  But CBS tries to spin it. They just say they're tied in battleground states
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:54.200]  Tied in battleground states. No, he's six to ten fifteen points ahead. You name it battleground states

[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:47.960]  Special reports coming out want to take your phone calls as well a lot of other news. I didn't get to
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:55.760]  Obama enlist Republican KC to push TPP trade deal which again is a transfer of our power to multinationals
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.320]  Outside of Congress outside of the power of the people that's out of the hill and Reuters is also reporting that
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.880]  black lives matter leader
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.120]  Calls for greater
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.480]  Police presence after being robbed. This is a guy that bitches about the police all day and wants a mind of his neighborhood
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:15.960]  At the University of Houston, but since he got robbed he wants the police there
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:24.480]  There's just no end to it speaking of black lives matter black police officers senior police officers suing black lives matter and sorrows for inciting race war
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:27.280]  Which sorrows his own e-mail show they are doing
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.040]  So that is all happening
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:33.480]  People think America is in a trance. They think we're
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.400]  We're done
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:42.160]  They want to play us all off against each other the truth is no matter what color you are where you're from if you care about free market you care about
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.040]  leading your own life and and having low taxes and
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.120]  Promoting American values you should become an American
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:55.080]  But the globalists want to bring people here and turn them against the country and create a divide and conquer and have the nation
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:00.320]  Implode and that's why we have to expose globalism because it's about foreign multinationals
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.440]  Conquering this country and turning it into a greater engine of tyranny and to a great extent
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:11.480]  We've been conquered and I'm here trying to kick the globalist occupiers out. That's the group I'm anti
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.240]  I'm not anti-government. I'm not anti anybody, but I'm anti
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:22.080]  Social engineers coming in here and playing games because the country is so obsessed with entertainment. We're in a trance
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.080]  So that's part of the news. I wanted to cover today. I got to most of it
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.920]  I want to air this special report because Hillary talked about look at how somebody
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.080]  Actually behaves look at their fruits
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:38.680]  Look at what they've said in the past and so I wanted to look back on just some of the crimes of Hillary Clinton the full videos on
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.680]  in full wars.com
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:45.600]  Well, the crime boss Hillary Rodham Clinton came out today and said that we should judge basically everybody
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:54.440]  Not just Donald Trump off of what they originally actually said and basically did that that we should go off somebody's
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.600]  Original record. Here's the clip
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.360]  In recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:03.320]  And clean up his image
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.560]  But as Maya Angelou once said
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.560]  When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:17.160]  So she's demonizing Donald Trump because he questioned
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:23.560]  Barack Obama's birth certificate and the fact that Barack Obama when he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:30.080]  Said in his bio that he was born in Kenya, but Trump said okay. Hey, you were born America. Let's just move on
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:32.800]  But since Hillary brought up the past
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:40.120]  Let's look at the past. Let's look at what she originally said what she originally did in her college thesis
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:46.200]  She was a pen pal with Saul Alinsky who wrote rules for radicals who was an admitted communist and basically
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:51.440]  One of the ideological leaders of the weathermen who of course were also
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:58.320]  advisors to Obama and he pledged his book to Lucifer and he talked about deceiving the public
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:05.180]  Overthrowing America going after Christians creating basically a hell on earth and there was sweet little Hillary
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:11.520]  Being groomed all along and pin pals with him and writing her thesis on how wonderful Saul Alinsky was
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:18.400]  After college Hillary went on to represent child molesters in court and you know made jokes about how she couldn't believe
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:28.400]  Guilty people could pass a lot of sector tests
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.680]  Of course he climbed
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.360]  Then she got thrown off of the Watergate
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:53.400]  Investigative committee because she was caught fabricating evidence against Richard Nixon
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:58.360]  I mean this girl was involved in the dirtiest of the dirt from the moment
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:04.960]  She got out of the gate then she hitched her wagon to William Jefferson Clinton and her star began to rise
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:12.400]  Oh, there were cattle future scams and swindling old folks out of their property in Arkansas with whitewater deals
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.600]  There were CIA airfields at Mina and cocaine
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:19.480]  Admittedly being flown in and the Clintons overseeing the whole operation
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:24.960]  There were over a hundred murders now known as Arkansas where enemies of the Clintons were killed
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:32.560]  But don't worry the Arkansas medical examiner family Malik said it's totally normal to shop your arms your legs and your head off in a suicide
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.520]  But once Hillary Clinton became co-president in 1993
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:45.160]  The horror only intensified she launched wars against the Serbs to bring in jihad armies out of Albania
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:51.240]  She bombed TV stations with depleted uranium and bragged that she's the one that got Clinton to go ahead and pull the trigger
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.880]  She supported the most incredible sanctions
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:01.680]  Basically doubling what George Herbert Walker Bush had done even stopping shipments of food into Iraq and
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:07.920]  Over a half million children died, but her own secretary of state Madeline Albright her
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:15.040]  Confidant her mentor told 60 minutes that it was a good price to pay a half million
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:20.440]  Dead kids. We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.160]  children than died one and in Hiroshima and
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.000]  and
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  You know is the price worth it? I?
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.640]  Think this is a very hard choice, but the price we think the price is worth it
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.920]  Now if I try to chronicle all the crimes committed by the Clintons when they were in the White House for eight years
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:41.200]  We'll be here for ten hours. Let me just skip past
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:49.160]  All the stuff that happened and Mama color winsky and the Chinese generals in the White House and our missile secrets being transferred to the
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:50.760]  Communist Chinese and
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.720]  National sovereignty being sold out and our jobs being sold out with NAFTA and Gatt and how the Clintons
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:01.600]  Engineered getting rid of the Glass-Steagall Act to allow big mega banks to create all this counterfeit money and derivatives
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:07.600]  Let's just forget about all that. Let's fast forward to what they've been doing in the last decade
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:12.120]  Launching their big giant foundation and we have the emails where she sold
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:19.680]  Access to the Chinese president where she sold access through the State Department to change US policy
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.160]  If donors would give her money phone calls to whom I have it into other people in the State Department
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:30.440]  From donors to the Clinton Foundation asking for meetings asking for access to a false
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:35.200]  First of all, there's no question. There were phone calls made to get appointments for people
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.840]  But Mohammed Eunice a Nobel laureate
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.440]  Melinda Gates, I mean these are people that any Secretary of State would have
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:48.600]  Would have seen courtesy appointments and others business people
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.780]  There's no question about that but and then we learn thanks to all the different hacked emails
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:55:00.080]  Which she admits are real that she sent people dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters to attack Trump rallies
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.720]  So she could blame both Trump and Sanders
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:10.400]  Then she stole the nomination and even CNN and the Associated Press admitted that it was the super
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:12.920]  Pax it was the big donors
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:20.720]  It was the super delegates who actually decided who would be the nominee and now that she's stolen the nomination
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.880]  She's eyeing stealing the general election because she's way behind
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.000]  Even in these polls even in places like DC where she was 20 something points ahead of Trump
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.400]  She's only a few points ahead of him now. She's in free fall
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:41.600]  So the big question is this woman that tells us look at what somebody said first. Look at what they did first look at their record
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:49.280]  But as Maya Angelou once said when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:57.920]  Before we start celebrating the fact that Hillary Clinton is in free fall and that the mainstream media has been totally discredited trying to cover up her collapse
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:04.440]  In New York on 9-11 before we celebrate that you have to understand the crime syndicate behind Hillary
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.400]  Isn't going to give up power easily. They know nationalism is rising in Russia and with the
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.160]  Briggs it and with what's happening now here in the United States with Donald Trump
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:19.080]  So they're throwing everything they can against Trump and the nationalist movement false flags
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:26.560]  Race riots you name it George Soros is turning up the heat the Ford Foundation just gave a hundred million
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.960]  Dollars to black lives matter. This is the time for vigilance. This is the time to be focused
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:35.400]  This is the time to be praying that this Republic be restored
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:43.600]  But with Hillary we see this sickening bloodlust this bloodthirst where she brags about creating a failed state in Libya and
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:50.680]  Coming and seeing and Gaddafi dying and then organizing al-Qaeda to then become ISIS and invade Syria and
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:56.720]  Target Christians and then not let them get out of the country, but bring the actual Sunni invaders into the United States
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:01.280]  The truth is Hillary Clinton wants to mount America's head on the wall
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:09.240]  Hillary Clinton wants to dominate this Republic Hillary Clinton is an enemy a domestic enemy and an agent of globalism
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:13.480]  And if this Republic is to survive Hillary Clinton must fall
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:20.760]  The good news is Providence has always shown that when the people take action do the right thing and take those first steps
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.320]  God will carry us historically the rest of the way and the hand of doom as
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:32.120]  We see her deteriorate on a daily basis has already reached Hillary Rodham Clinton
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:45.760]  This is the heart of 1776
