[00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:16.604]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:17.805]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:18.125]  Today.
[00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.082]  It's Wednesday, October 26, 2022.
[00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.403]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:38.009]  And I'm about to play in the next segment a clip of Yuval Noah Harari, the high priest of the World Economic Forum, that's what they call him, laying out their ultimate in-game secret.
[00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.774]  They are engineering the artificial collapse of human civilization.
[00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:54.003]  And the, quote, elites, as he calls himself, and the other globalists, are going to extract the technological know-how and resources of the human earth while they cut it off from us.
[00:00:54.924 --> 00:01:05.289]  To build undersea, underground, and space-based redoubts that will protect them from the organized collapse of civilization.
[00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:11.871]  And that's what the COVID release was, was a beta test of far more deadly bioweapons they're planning to release.
[00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:16.794]  Remember, Ian Fleming was number two in the OSS and very high level.
[00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.455]  In MI6 after World War II.
[00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.035]  And he wrote the James Bond books.
[00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:26.316]  And one of them was Moon Raker.
[00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.317]  Before we even gone to space.
[00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:33.278]  And in it he described a group of mad scientists that want depopulation.
[00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:36.539]  Building a space station they can go to.
[00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.080]  While on Earth a deadly bioweapon is released that will kill all life on Earth.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.741]  They can then return with all the best genetic specimens.
[00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.442]  And the Earth will be basically like a national park for them.
[00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:51.246]  We've now seen statements like this out of Jeff Bezos.
[00:01:51.246 --> 00:02:02.177]  We've now seen statements like this out of basically all of the globalists except Elon Musk, who says he wants a pro-human future, and he's actually more and more moving towards our direction of standing against it.
[00:02:02.177 --> 00:02:06.442]  I don't know if he's hedging his bets, but regardless, he's saying and doing the right things.
[00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:09.685]  But all of them, from Bill Gates to Klaus Schwab,
[00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:13.267]  to Tim Cook are espousing this.
[00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.369]  This is their transhumanist religion.
[00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:26.273]  So when we come back from break, we are going to play the latest clip of Yuval Noah Harari spilling his guts to the world and admitting the plan.
[00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.133]  And it's not just what Harari's saying.
[00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:45.073]  All the major globalist publications and television programs, both fiction and non-fiction, promote a world without humans, and how great it's going to be, and how we're bad for the planet, and how this cataclysm is coming sometime after 2030, and our population's got to be reduced.
[00:02:45.914 --> 00:03:02.467]  So what they're doing is corralling us, locking us down, taking away our resources, turning us against each other, while they build what they believe an accelerated path of evolution to merge with cybernetic systems and genetic engineering systems to become, quote, gods.
[00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:07.611]  You've all heard Harari make similar statements to that, where he actually says, we are going to be gods.
[00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:12.996]  Ray Kurzweil, the head futurist at Google, says, I don't believe in God yet, but I'm going to become a god.
[00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:35.970]  But for them to become a god, they must play god and artificially create a cascade of cataclysms, or Armageddons, that lead to this planetary crisis, out of which they build their breakaway civilization, or their Noah's Arks, not Ark, Arks, to separate themselves from humanity.
[00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.592]  They believe it is their evolutionary job to call us
[00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:39.472]  I think?
[00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.618]  This could not be a more important issue.
[00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.960]  This is the central issue of the elite capture.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.882]  Yes, the megacorporations of the world are allied with Communist China.
[00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.363]  Yes, they control the media.
[00:04:11.363 --> 00:04:13.825]  Yes, they control most academia and the banks.
[00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.767]  And yes, they are selling us that we deserve to die.
[00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:25.511]  And that this is just part of a foregone conclusion, a self-fulfilling prophecy, that for them to transcend, we must die.
[00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:32.235]  They are self-appointed, doing what Hitler did, but on a much wider, more complex scale.
[00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:43.821]  And that's why they're dividing us, that's why they're poisoning us, that's why they're dumbing us down, that's why they're trying to destroy all the educational systems, turn us into a bunch of mindless idiots, so that we don't contend for them for the future.
[00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:46.222]  This is a war for the future, a war for the world.
[00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:47.684]  A war for the species.
[00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.246]  We are at the crossroads.
[00:04:49.246 --> 00:04:52.149]  Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday broadcast.
[00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.910]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.415]  I'm gonna come back and lay all of this critical information out.
[00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:58.217]  Nothing is more important than this information.
[00:04:58.217 --> 00:05:01.482]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:02.203]  It's our bestseller.
[00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.066]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:16.129]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.190]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.396]  Vitamin-mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:32.522]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:35.124]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[00:05:35.124 --> 00:05:42.951]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:50.117]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWar.
[00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:57.905]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting Vitamin Mineral Fusion, finally back in stock, at InfoWarStore.com for 50% off.
[00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:00.567]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:12.993]  It's Wednesday, October 26, 2022.
[00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:14.593]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:19.655]  And I'm about to lay out the most important information on this planet.
[00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:50.428]  Without a doubt, this is the most central, critical information facing not just our species, but all life on this planet.
[00:06:51.704 --> 00:07:13.489]  The globalists are transhumanist technocrats who believe they are forcing an accelerated evolution of humanity into a new ubermenschen or super species that is a hybridized homo sapien sapien merged with new biotech and cybernetic forms of life.
[00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.872]  And they believe they're the guardians of this planet.
[00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:28.000]  And to step into that position, they need to play God and need to carry out the forced depopulation of at least 90% of Earth.
[00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:38.330]  Now I've been talking about this for 28 years on air because I've been reading their own reports, their own books, their own white papers, and watching their speeches on C-SPAN.
[00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.877]  And now we've gone from this being a very esoteric thing decades ago to being out in the open because they're going from
[00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:51.180]  Testing phase, or beta phase, into operational phase.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:08:02.142]  And we played a lot of clips here on air of the high priest of the World Economic Forum, a medieval studies professor, you all know of Harari, who did not come up with any of these ideas himself.
[00:08:02.142 --> 00:08:15.304]  They're actually the ideas of Julian Huxley and others that first founded the transhumanist movement after World War II, changing the name from the World Eugenics Society to the World Transhumanist Society, to forcibly take control of what they believe is human evolution
[00:08:16.284 --> 00:08:20.326]  And again, merge humans with advanced biotech and machines.
[00:08:20.326 --> 00:08:33.351]  But before that process can be carried out, they have to step into the evolutionary position of God, in their words, and direct the direction of human development.
[00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:40.975]  There's a new clip of Noah Eval Harari that we're about to play in a moment, where he explains the big secret of secrets.
[00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:43.636]  The general public's not going to make it.
[00:08:43.636 --> 00:09:00.067]  The general public's going to be destroyed in a cataclysm, in a flood-like event that they're going to orchestrate and implement, and that the elites will then steal all the technological development and ideas of humanity to build their escape ship off of the Earth.
[00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:07.892]  Now, national media in the last 20 years has made a lot of fun of me when I explained that interdimensional off-world influence, the Bible tells us it's Satan,
[00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:36.201]  is manipulating humans here on the planet to build a escape system to get off the planet in which this interdimensional entity is trapped in a vortex and that we are actually more advanced than this fallen species that's more robotic the way it's described in the Bible and that it is again seeking to manipulate us into building this new system
[00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:38.162]  That's right.
[00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:55.988]  In a new Noah's Ark from humanity.
[00:09:55.988 --> 00:10:01.350]  The reason I've been laying this out for years is studying their documents, their reports.
[00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.970]  This is actually what they believe.
[00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.532]  That's why we've seen Elon Musk begin to break with these globalists.
[00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:20.594]  And openly say, beware those that worship AI gods and those that believe they're going to become AI gods, because they've made the decision that you don't deserve to go into the future.
[00:10:20.594 --> 00:10:28.376]  And they've made the decision that they're going to direct every facet of not just human life, but all life on this planet.
[00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:33.397]  Here is the short 56 second clip of Harari laying out their plan.
[00:10:34.122 --> 00:10:44.729]  You have a small elite that pushes things in its own interests, even if it doesn't benefit the vast majority of the population.
[00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:49.812]  This has happened so many times previously in history, and it's probably going to happen again.
[00:10:54.314 --> 00:11:04.528]  One of the biggest dangers to the planet today is this technological utopia, because probably for the elite it will work.
[00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:07.211]  If bad comes to worst, and when the flood comes,
[00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:14.855]  The scientists will build a Noah's Ark for the elite, leaving the rest to drown.
[00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:18.276]  The rest of the people and then the rest of the ecosystem.
[00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:26.099]  But they are likely to be able to construct this technological Noah's Ark, which is probably what much of the elite is counting on.
[00:11:26.892 --> 00:11:30.795]  There are countless other clips we've played of Harari that I would remind you of.
[00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:39.842]  Just a few months ago, he said he doesn't believe in God, but that we're going to become gods, similar to what Ray Kurzweil and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and others have said.
[00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:42.043]  This is their transhumanist cult.
[00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:46.006]  This is their get-out-of-jail-free-card-live-forever system.
[00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:46.887]  This is their ethos.
[00:11:46.887 --> 00:11:47.788]  This is their religion.
[00:11:51.210 --> 00:12:02.901]  And when you study the Bible and you study other ancient texts from Mesopotamia and other areas of the world, it's the same story repeated over and over and over again.
[00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:10.508]  That's why in the movie Prometheus, in the prequel to the Alien series, you see the same Anunnaki line
[00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:16.114]  Coming to Earth, creating humans, and then deciding to come back and destroy us.
[00:12:16.114 --> 00:12:26.844]  When in the Bible it says that God, who also created the Anunnaki and us, decided to destroy the Anunnaki and most of the humans on Earth because they were manipulating the genetics of humans.
[00:12:26.844 --> 00:12:30.527]  Now, you could say, well, that's just a book or, you know, that was written in ancient times.
[00:12:30.527 --> 00:12:34.731]  Who knows if the Sumerians or the Israelites or before them the Jews were correct.
[00:12:34.731 --> 00:12:35.371]  But regardless,
[00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:45.342]  The globalists are manifesting everything that's in the Bible and everything that's in the Sumerian text and everything that's in the Vedic text that are over 3,000 years old from India.
[00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:47.124]  It's all the same story.
[00:12:47.124 --> 00:12:48.325]  They believe it.
[00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:48.886]  They know it.
[00:12:48.886 --> 00:12:49.306]  That's why
[00:12:50.788 --> 00:13:05.278]  Revelation, written by John the Revelator of the Isle of Patmos 2,000 years ago, is being followed exactly with a world government, three global regions, ten sub-regions, a mark in the forehead and hand to buy and sell.
[00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:19.367]  Everything in there describes how everyone on earth will be able to watch the beast when it communicates to them and gives the public orders and engages in signs and wonders and cures the sick and ends war and brings in global peace, but only for
[00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:21.589]  A very, very short time.
[00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:42.200]  And if you put them together and read his books and watch his speeches, it's everything the Bible says.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.681]  He even quotes the Bible.
[00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:54.971]  But he's put himself and the other globalists in the place of God, who are building this technological Noah's Ark, or breakaway civilization, to separate themselves from us.
[00:13:54.971 --> 00:14:02.317]  While they teach us we're failed, while they teach us that we've got to die to save the Earth, while they go after our life force, our self-preservation instinct.
[00:14:03.178 --> 00:14:14.121]  So that we will stand down, not create our own dreams, our own ideas, and hand total control of these monsters to the future development of our species.
[00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:38.265]  They know there have been previous cataclysms on this planet and now they're trying to artificially create a cascade of cataclysms where they position themselves as God and basically manipulate humanity into the idea that we deserve to be destroyed and starved to death and hit with radiologicals and 5G and bioweapons because we are bad for the earth.
[00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:43.247]  That the viruses don't come out of labs, they come out of the jungles because of global warming.
[00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:44.487]  These people are self
[00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:45.807]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:15:16.104 --> 00:15:20.446]  InfoWars has been banned.
[00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:24.387]  Arrested.
[00:15:24.387 --> 00:15:27.148]  Attacked and threatened.

[00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:15.082]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[00:16:15.082 --> 00:16:18.605]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:19.465]  It's game over.
[00:16:19.465 --> 00:16:25.169]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:29.753]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[00:18:24.525 --> 00:18:26.526]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:28.046]  I don't plan to be Mr. Health.
[00:18:28.046 --> 00:18:35.669]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarshaw.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.970]  By the will of God,
[00:19:02.048 --> 00:19:11.498]  And by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent media.
[00:19:11.498 --> 00:19:13.120]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:20.348]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:25.272]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[00:19:25.272 --> 00:19:26.533]  And I need your support.
[00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:34.160]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:43.007]  And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL that gives him go for direct Alex Jones Legal Defense Fund.
[00:19:43.007 --> 00:19:47.530]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.773]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:59.178]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[00:20:00.396 --> 00:20:06.317]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:21.402 --> 00:20:26.284]  Thank you again for joining us on this live Wednesday broadcast.
[00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:32.967]  Owen Schroer and a ton of news and analysis is coming up here in the next segment, but I wanted to continue
[00:20:33.687 --> 00:20:35.909]  With the most important issue in the world.
[00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:37.890]  This is a spiritual battle.
[00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.211]  There is good and evil in the universe.
[00:20:40.211 --> 00:20:42.273]  Humans are made in the image of God.
[00:20:42.273 --> 00:20:47.136]  Whatever we envision, give it enough time and energy we're able to build.
[00:20:47.136 --> 00:20:49.898]  Think how far humans have come the last six, seven thousand years.
[00:20:49.898 --> 00:20:51.358]  Think about how far we can go.
[00:20:52.279 --> 00:21:14.291]  And the globalists know this and they're in a race to control the future and create a new dark age for the general public or a Hunger Games type scenario where a massively depopulated group of serfs live basically in subsistence level dark age farming systems for the controllers and the controllers live in high tech compact
[00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:16.372]  We're good.
[00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:48.572]  If you just joined us last segment, I played the clip.
[00:21:48.572 --> 00:22:07.238]  It's just one of hundreds where he openly declares that the elite is going to break away using the science and technology we have and the resources of humanity and build an Elysium field type or Moonraker type scenario where they are exempt from the hell they rain down on us.
[00:22:07.238 --> 00:22:14.580]  That we are simply here extracting resources from the earth to provide them with the science, the technology, and the know-how so they
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.300]  Can't
[00:22:34.605 --> 00:22:42.330]  You don't see anywhere but in the globalist-owned admissions is what the Antichrist system is actually trying to build.
[00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.672]  They want to be God.
[00:22:44.672 --> 00:22:46.793]  They want to go interplanetary.
[00:22:46.793 --> 00:22:48.574]  They want to go interstellar.
[00:22:48.574 --> 00:22:50.276]  They want to go intergalactic.
[00:22:50.276 --> 00:22:58.981]  They want to go interdimensional with the CERN superconducting supercollider cyclotron with their fission fusion artificial suns and black holes they're creating.
[00:22:58.981 --> 00:23:04.185]  They're endangering the whole planet rolling the dice in the attempt to become
[00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:04.846]  God's.
[00:23:12.512 --> 00:23:13.472]  And who dies?
[00:23:13.472 --> 00:23:15.973]  Think of what they've just done in the last three years.
[00:23:15.973 --> 00:23:23.795]  Cooking up a deadly virus, releasing the virus, then giving people deadly shots that create artificial nanotech clots in the body.
[00:23:23.795 --> 00:23:25.916]  Massive increase in death.
[00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:32.297]  Conservatively, more than 10 million worldwide have died from the injections and they're just getting started.
[00:23:32.297 --> 00:23:34.178]  But because they see us as animals.
[00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:46.882]  And because we act like animals, many of us that don't organize and fight back against them, they believe it is their right and their duty to carry this out because it is social Darwinism, survival of the fittest.
[00:23:46.882 --> 00:23:51.924]  They believe they're filling the predator role in culling the useless eaters.
[00:23:51.924 --> 00:23:53.205]  But the good news is this.
[00:23:54.525 --> 00:23:56.706]  They thought they'd still have us in lockdown.
[00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:59.267]  They thought they'd still be rolling out force injections.
[00:23:59.267 --> 00:24:00.927]  They thought the public would buckle.
[00:24:00.927 --> 00:24:08.790]  They thought their censorship would suppress those of us that were aware of what they were doing, and that they would be far, far further ahead than they are now.
[00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:16.253]  In fact, they've been fought to a standstill, a stalemate, and all over the world, from Sweden to Canada,
[00:24:16.793 --> 00:24:16.973]  Yes.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:53.246]  The new Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in Sweden, came out, oof, Christiansen, and says they're getting rid of their environment ministry that works for the UN and the WEF, and they're ending all the restrictions on farming, on methane, on carbon, and everything else.
[00:24:53.246 --> 00:24:59.409]  And he came out and said it's all a fraud to control society and create serfs and slaves.
[00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:05.015]  Let me give you the name of the headline so you can find it from Armstrong Economics.
[00:25:05.015 --> 00:25:08.679]  Sweden will not meet agenda 2030.
[00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:16.708]  And there are just so many countless examples of that just today, but I wanted to give you just one.
[00:25:16.708 --> 00:25:18.730]  My friends, our situation
[00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:20.992]  It's far from hopeless.
[00:25:20.992 --> 00:25:35.177]  They would need, as I say every day, to be censoring and attacking and suing and threatening and indicting patriot, pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-Earth individuals if we were defeated.
[00:25:35.177 --> 00:25:37.218]  In fact, we are far from defeated.
[00:25:37.218 --> 00:25:41.220]  We are promoting truth and justice and prosperity and chivalry and
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:52.426]  If you look at the evil, corrupt, degenerate Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah Harari and the rest of them, like Ray Kurzweil, they are degenerate, gross, ugly, sickening, parasitic individuals
[00:26:09.963 --> 00:26:14.212]  That have quite literally made a deal with the devil for what they believe will be artificial.
[00:26:16.238 --> 00:26:19.820]  Immortality in a matrix-like system they're building.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.403]  That's their promise of artificial life.
[00:26:23.403 --> 00:26:28.106]  But everything, just like their shots, and just like all their other systems, is a fraud.
[00:26:28.106 --> 00:26:30.087]  It doesn't work.
[00:26:30.087 --> 00:26:31.248]  It's a scam.
[00:26:31.248 --> 00:26:36.571]  They're never going to give us access to the technology that our brain trust actually created.
[00:26:36.571 --> 00:26:41.975]  They will only give us access to poisoned, twisted systems that lower us
[00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.111]  We're good to go.
[00:27:00.194 --> 00:27:07.639]  To be able to have discernment and transcend the enemy's plan and actually build God's plan here on Earth.
[00:27:07.639 --> 00:27:09.861]  Heaven on Earth.
[00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:11.001]  Revelation will be fulfilled.
[00:27:11.001 --> 00:27:12.162]  Daniel will be fulfilled.
[00:27:12.162 --> 00:27:13.883]  Ezekiel will be fulfilled.
[00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:15.064]  All of it will be fulfilled.
[00:27:15.064 --> 00:27:17.046]  The Antichrist will arise.
[00:27:17.046 --> 00:27:18.126]  We will have a technocracy.
[00:27:19.227 --> 00:27:21.650]  A large portion of the planet will be killed.
[00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:29.561]  Satan will then be bound and defeated for a thousand years and let loose yet again for a short time to test the faithful yet again.
[00:27:29.561 --> 00:27:30.822]  Then at that point,
[00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:48.911]  This entire dimension, we think of as the third dimension, that is not a simulation, but is an artificial creation of God for us to be able to be tested, will be rolled up from its four corners like a scroll and will be disappeared into eternity.
[00:27:48.911 --> 00:27:52.513]  And we will go forward with God into infinity.
[00:27:52.513 --> 00:27:55.153]  Now, if that isn't heavy, I don't know what is.
[00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:56.494]  And the globalists know it's true.
[00:27:57.134 --> 00:28:04.216]  They're attempting to fill the void they see, and be God, and carry out and execute God's plan.
[00:28:04.216 --> 00:28:09.578]  Just as the Bible says, Satan is actually fulfilling God's plan, and Satan even knows it.
[00:28:09.578 --> 00:28:21.802]  Satan simply wants to take as many souls as he can with him, again, in a hope that someday, in some eon, into infinity, they will somehow be able to break away.
[00:28:22.922 --> 00:28:27.523]  And escape to another artificial dimension from a system God's created.
[00:28:27.523 --> 00:28:29.164]  They are trying to run from God.
[00:28:29.164 --> 00:28:30.904]  We must run towards God.
[00:28:30.904 --> 00:28:32.245]  This is the truth.
[00:28:32.245 --> 00:28:35.486]  Noah, Yuval Harari and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are not God.
[00:28:35.486 --> 00:28:37.246]  In fact, they're the opposite of God.
[00:28:37.246 --> 00:28:38.506]  They are disconnected from God.
[00:28:38.506 --> 00:28:42.348]  And by reaching out to God, we can and will transcend them.
[00:28:42.348 --> 00:28:44.248]  We must choose God or Satan.
[00:28:44.248 --> 00:28:45.588]  The choice is yours.
[00:28:45.588 --> 00:28:47.609]  Even not making a choice is a choice.
[00:28:47.609 --> 00:28:48.569]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:48.569 --> 00:28:49.710]  InfoWars.com.
[00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.530]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:59.502 --> 00:29:06.266]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:19.374]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the globalists and their censorship and tyranny.
[00:29:20.034 --> 00:29:34.110]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.
[00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:37.728]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[00:30:04.034 --> 00:30:11.480]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.361]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:14.822]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:30:14.822 --> 00:30:16.323]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:30:16.323 --> 00:30:18.085]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:30:18.085 --> 00:30:19.326]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:30:19.326 --> 00:30:20.727]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:30:21.147 --> 00:30:25.994]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:30:25.994 --> 00:30:28.377]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[00:30:28.377 --> 00:30:30.400]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:37.349]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:43.376]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:30:43.376 --> 00:30:52.326]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[00:30:59.972 --> 00:31:03.456]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:06.599]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:07.360]  Now, I knew that.
[00:31:08.211 --> 00:31:12.434]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[00:31:12.434 --> 00:31:14.936]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[00:31:14.936 --> 00:31:19.739]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.

[00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:52.062]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[00:32:52.062 --> 00:32:53.843]  You need to experience it.
[00:32:53.843 --> 00:32:54.323]  Don't wait.

[00:33:01.057 --> 00:33:05.666]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:06.968]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.512 --> 00:33:33.015]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:33.015 --> 00:33:37.698]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:52.963]  If you just joined us here on this live Wednesday broadcast, I want to invite you to go to the archives at Bandot Video later today.
[00:33:52.963 --> 00:34:00.466]  Once the analysis I just laid out is posted, it's only about 25 minutes long, and it's so important.
[00:34:00.466 --> 00:34:07.028]  Whether you believe the globalists are going to be successful or not in creating the system they say they're building, and they are building it,
[00:34:08.231 --> 00:34:20.872]  It's so central to understand that it's a nightmare authoritarian world where full control is taken over human development and human evolution, in their words, to not empower humanity.
[00:34:21.647 --> 00:34:31.231]  But to depopulate the vast majority of us and on its ashes build their world government, technocracy, where they believe they're going to be gods.
[00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:35.392]  They have decided to bring down civilization as we know it.
[00:34:35.392 --> 00:34:45.256]  And the adherents, the cult members that join this system and go along with it, believe they're about to be given everlasting artificial life and be gods.
[00:34:45.256 --> 00:34:47.817]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a psychotic cult
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:58.922]  Transhumanist is setting up a planetary world government and their holy grail is life extension technology.
[00:34:58.922 --> 00:35:08.964]  I covered my film Endgame made in 2007 and it's more pertinent today because their agenda is now out of the open.
[00:35:08.964 --> 00:35:10.445]  That's why I asked listeners
[00:35:11.687 --> 00:35:25.414]  To realize that this broadcast is so important in the fight against these people because we have their battle plan, we have their number, we have their M.O., their modus operandi, and we know how to stop them.
[00:35:25.414 --> 00:35:39.580]  That's why the corporate media, the globalist left wing, the technocracy absolutely hate us because they want the public blissfully distracted by Netflix and sports and all the entertainment, not realizing that a
[00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:48.347]  Forced planetary collapse and a new dark age is being implemented as we speak.
[00:35:48.347 --> 00:35:53.471]  That's why I want to thank the long-term listeners and viewers and also all the new viewers that are tuning in.
[00:35:53.471 --> 00:35:57.034]  Because without you, humanity literally would not have a fighting chance.
[00:35:58.203 --> 00:36:14.996]  That's why it's important to take time out to thank the crew, all of our AM and FM affiliates, our TV affiliates, our sponsors, our listeners and viewers particularly, and all the prominent people that now realize that our analysis has been dead on and understand that the Globals are coming after us because we're on to something.
[00:36:15.396 --> 00:36:18.918]  We're on the New World Order agenda, and we know how to stop it.
[00:36:18.918 --> 00:36:33.327]  Not just resisting their agenda, not just exposing their agenda, not just warning the public about their operations, but also promoting a better system that's pro-human, that's based on truth and justice and God and family and competition.
[00:36:33.327 --> 00:36:39.971]  I'm about to hand the baton to Owen Schroyer and the big broadcast he's got lined up today, but I just want to encourage listeners again.
[00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:48.393]  To let it sink in that you're the reason InfoWars is still here, despite the desperate globalist attacks, and that they're far from all-powerful.
[00:36:48.393 --> 00:36:50.474]  And that when you take action, nothing can stop you.
[00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:55.895]  So please, take advantage in the last few days we've got, it ends on Friday, of the biggest sell of the year.

[00:37:28.206 --> 00:37:30.648]  So many of the problems out there caused by deficiencies.

[00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:35.673]  It's 50% off as well.
[00:37:35.673 --> 00:37:36.854]  So is X3.

[00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.815]  That's how we override the censors.
[00:38:10.815 --> 00:38:21.303]  I know you know that, but I wanted that to consciously burn into your brain to realize how incredibly important you are in this fight, because the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:38:21.303 --> 00:38:27.588]  That's why they're so desperate to suppress us, and we're beginning to turn the tide, not just here in America, but around the world.
[00:38:27.588 --> 00:38:30.130]  So please take action now at infowarestore.com.

[00:38:48.513 --> 00:38:52.274]  Now I hand the baton to Owen Schroeder.
[00:38:52.274 --> 00:39:00.656]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are now live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas with you today.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:08.383]  And let me just kind of reset the transmission here and tell you what's coming up.
[00:39:08.383 --> 00:39:31.253]  We are going to be joined in the next hour and for the hour by Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec to talk about all kinds of midterm election issues, specifically the debates that have just happened where Fetterman was just an unmitigated disaster and the only defense that the Democrat media
[00:39:33.223 --> 00:39:37.084]  Collusion has is, oh, he's a victim of a stroke.
[00:39:37.084 --> 00:39:38.284]  Oh, he's recovering from a stroke.
[00:39:38.284 --> 00:39:41.665]  So before it was, he's fine, it's no problem, his health is fine.
[00:39:41.665 --> 00:39:48.667]  Then you see the debate last night and the disaster that Federman is, and it's, well, he's recovering from a stroke.
[00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:51.147]  And that's basically all they can do to promote him.
[00:39:51.147 --> 00:39:57.269]  But every poll had Oz winning last night's debate in a landslide.
[00:39:57.269 --> 00:39:58.129]  Folks, if you watched it,
[00:39:59.218 --> 00:40:00.699]  I mean, you know how bad it was.
[00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:02.160]  There's really no words to describe it.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.841]  It's actually sad.
[00:40:03.841 --> 00:40:04.922]  It's actually quite sad.
[00:40:04.922 --> 00:40:11.127]  From the beginning to the end of the hour-long debate, Fetterman was just not well.
[00:40:11.127 --> 00:40:12.048]  Just not well at all.
[00:40:12.048 --> 00:40:13.309]  So we'll be talking about that.
[00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:19.253]  I'm going to come back and talk about some of the latest vaccine news.
[00:40:19.253 --> 00:40:21.675]  We also have some internet censorship news.
[00:40:21.675 --> 00:40:27.719]  There were some big legal developments, I guess you could say.
[00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:28.160]  Or rather,
[00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:32.170]  You had Daryl Brooks found guilty on all accounts.
[00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.051]  That just happened moments ago.
[00:40:34.051 --> 00:40:35.591]  Daryl Brooks guilty on all accounts.
[00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:37.212]  The Waukesha Massacre.
[00:40:37.212 --> 00:40:41.174]  Now you notice you didn't have mainstream media foaming at the mouth over that story.
[00:40:41.174 --> 00:40:45.156]  You didn't have the cameras rolling in the courtroom 24-7.
[00:40:45.156 --> 00:40:47.537]  Why is that?
[00:40:47.537 --> 00:40:50.958]  Why wasn't more attention paid to the Waukesha Massacre killer?
[00:40:50.958 --> 00:40:55.760]  Oh, because he was a radicalized leftist.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.761]  A radicalized
[00:40:57.927 --> 00:41:12.286]  Leftist, and so he can't be covered, he can't be talked about when he killed six white people and ran over 70 plus people in an intentional race-based, political-based attack.
[00:41:12.286 --> 00:41:14.769]  Oh no, I'm sure it was just a coincidence, how dare I say that?
[00:41:16.052 --> 00:41:21.576]  Well, he was found guilty, but there was another school shooting that happened in St.
[00:41:21.576 --> 00:41:23.758]  Louis this week that you didn't really hear about either.
[00:41:23.758 --> 00:41:26.259]  Now, why would that be?
[00:41:26.259 --> 00:41:41.611]  Also, some of the big crime wave news that's so important ahead of the midterms as well, where you have stores in Philadelphia and Los Angeles and San Francisco and Chicago and New York City saying, we're closing our doors permanently, it's too dangerous here.
[00:41:43.482 --> 00:41:48.284]  So, that's going to be coming up as well.
[00:41:48.284 --> 00:41:50.965]  We've got some border news we'll be covering.
[00:41:50.965 --> 00:42:02.671]  Oh, and also, Greg Manarino is going to be joining me in the third hour to discuss some of the latest economic news with the bond market instability, U.S.
[00:42:02.671 --> 00:42:06.733]  dollar, the lie that low rates are the cause for inflation.
[00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:18.134]  The rising possibility of false flags, specifically with the developments in Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine and the United States that are embedded in that war.
[00:42:18.134 --> 00:42:19.315]  They're just now admitting it.
[00:42:19.315 --> 00:42:22.516]  It's been going on for months, but now they're telling you that that's what's going on.
[00:42:22.516 --> 00:42:24.977]  So imagine what they have planned next.
[00:42:24.977 --> 00:42:28.598]  So you can imagine six months ago the US was already boots on the ground.
[00:42:28.598 --> 00:42:30.078]  Now they're telling you that.
[00:42:30.078 --> 00:42:34.580]  So what are they doing now that you're going to learn about six months from now or perhaps less?
[00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:41.175]  So, all of that coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:41.175 --> 00:42:47.219]  But when we come back, I'll get into some of the vaccine news, as Joe Biden just got his fifth vaccine, they claim.
[00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:47.940]  You believe that?
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:52.883]  Fifth booster for Joe, telling you it's time to get yours.
[00:42:52.883 --> 00:42:57.607]  But some new vaccine data has even the Washington Post alarmed.
[00:43:00.458 --> 00:43:07.226]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[00:43:07.226 --> 00:43:20.341]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance, alerting the people, not just of America, but the world, to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[00:43:21.002 --> 00:43:35.071]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time in our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.
[00:43:36.664 --> 00:43:38.525]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[00:43:38.525 --> 00:43:39.706]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[00:43:39.706 --> 00:43:43.149]  They admit, once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[00:43:43.149 --> 00:43:45.950]  I'm in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.253]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[00:43:50.253 --> 00:44:00.661]  Thank you for all your past support, and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts at Infowarstore.com with promo code 1776 for an additional 10% off on the already big sales and huge discounts.
[00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:02.782]  Look around you.
[00:44:02.782 --> 00:44:07.785]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[00:44:07.785 --> 00:44:11.707]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[00:44:11.707 --> 00:44:21.032]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[00:44:21.032 --> 00:44:26.696]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:30.298]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[00:44:31.138 --> 00:44:34.242]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[00:44:34.242 --> 00:44:40.529]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[00:44:40.529 --> 00:44:41.830]  It's unsustainable.
[00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.051]  So please, visit.
[00:44:44.125 --> 00:44:46.108]  SaveInfoWars.com.

[00:44:54.239 --> 00:44:57.224]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[00:44:57.224 --> 00:44:58.545]  Thank you for your support.
[00:44:58.545 --> 00:44:59.647]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[00:44:59.647 --> 00:45:00.729]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:45:02.464 --> 00:45:07.346]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:45:07.346 --> 00:45:13.769]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:45:13.769 --> 00:45:18.891]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:20.592]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:27.015]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we've had the success.
[00:45:27.735 --> 00:45:33.158]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:45:33.158 --> 00:45:37.481]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.

[00:45:49.128 --> 00:45:50.209]  I thank you.
[00:45:50.209 --> 00:45:55.552]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:45:56.212 --> 00:45:57.553]  The fight is my fight.
[00:45:57.553 --> 00:45:58.174]  It's your fight.
[00:45:58.174 --> 00:45:58.914]  It's our fight.
[00:45:58.914 --> 00:46:03.377]  God bless you all.

[00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:07.274]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:12.401 --> 00:47:13.282]  There's Joe Biden.
[00:47:34.093 --> 00:47:36.096]  Getting his fifth booster!
[00:47:36.096 --> 00:47:37.718]  At least that's what they're claiming here.
[00:47:37.718 --> 00:47:39.019]  Now you see the propaganda.
[00:47:39.019 --> 00:47:41.523]  Oh, there's the doctor with the mask on.
[00:47:41.523 --> 00:47:43.485]  He's gotta wear the mask.
[00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:45.848]  Just to remind you to be in fear.
[00:47:45.848 --> 00:47:48.512]  And you need your face muzzled.
[00:47:48.512 --> 00:47:50.354]  Joe Biden allegedly getting his fifth
[00:47:51.246 --> 00:48:16.230]  COVID vaccine if you believe that I have a hard time actually believing that they know a fifth vaccine I mean you got to be up to probably a 25% chance after a vaccine number five to have a life-altering side effect although who knows Joe Biden did say he could drop dead any day now maybe he was referencing the vaccine they were about to hit him with but actually if you go back to the clip you can hear the audio is really low but you can hear in the clip
[00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:27.368]  Joe Biden is asked, because the media doesn't get any access to the President, he's hidden, he's protected.
[00:48:27.368 --> 00:48:34.234]  And so this was some of the only time the media had access to him to ask about the Saudi Arabia situation, to which he responded, get the shot.
[00:48:34.234 --> 00:48:40.298]  And so guys, let's pull up the audio, it's going to need some serious boost, but you might as well just hear it.
[00:48:40.298 --> 00:48:42.961]  So here's Joe Biden getting his fifth booster shot.
[00:48:43.973 --> 00:48:53.038]  And then, since the media can't get any access, except when he's in the fake White House... By the way, that's him in the fake White House basement, the little TV studio they have set up.
[00:48:53.038 --> 00:48:58.542]  They don't actually want media in the White House.
[00:48:58.542 --> 00:49:01.283]  Sir, do you think it was a mistake for your tour?
[00:49:01.283 --> 00:49:04.826]  So it's... yeah, here we go.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.780]  Sir, do you think it was a mistake for New York to order?
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.401]  So she asks, what is your thought on the Saudis and the oil problem that you have?
[00:49:16.401 --> 00:49:18.082]  Oh, get your COVID shot, as he laughs.
[00:49:18.082 --> 00:49:18.822]  Get your COVID shot.
[00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.562]  That's the answer to everything.
[00:49:20.562 --> 00:49:24.843]  It's the answer to every problem in the history of mankind.
[00:49:24.843 --> 00:49:28.924]  Just get your COVID shot, dammit!
[00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:33.965]  But if you can't see how this is obvious propaganda, here's the President's Twitter account.
[00:49:35.376 --> 00:49:55.604]  I guess after Joe got the injection there, and it's a picture of him smiling, pointing at his arm on the injection site, and then it's a picture he's apparently FaceTiming here with Anthony Fauci, and I forget the other gentleman's name, big vaccine promoter there in the Biden administration.
[00:49:57.924 --> 00:50:00.325]  Yeah, that's such clear propaganda.
[00:50:00.325 --> 00:50:01.285]  Oh yeah, thumbs up!
[00:50:01.285 --> 00:50:02.566]  Yeah, way to go Joe!
[00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:03.886]  You did it!
[00:50:03.886 --> 00:50:05.907]  Your fifth vaccine!
[00:50:05.907 --> 00:50:06.987]  Yeah!
[00:50:06.987 --> 00:50:13.170]  And how sick is it they promote this to Americans as if it's safe and effective when it's neither.
[00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:17.931]  And I would be surprised if he actually took the real COVID vaccine.
[00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:19.132]  I would be surprised if that's the case.
[00:50:19.132 --> 00:50:21.473]  Oh, Fauci giving you the thumbs up.
[00:50:22.563 --> 00:50:24.743]  And Biden's other health director giving you the thumbs up.
[00:50:24.743 --> 00:50:25.404]  Oh yeah!
[00:50:25.404 --> 00:50:25.984]  Oh yeah!
[00:50:25.984 --> 00:50:27.164]  It's great, man!
[00:50:27.164 --> 00:50:28.984]  Yeah, get that vaccine!
[00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:31.185]  Yeah!
[00:50:31.185 --> 00:50:36.306]  Just 50,000 dead from it that we know of.
[00:50:36.306 --> 00:50:38.106]  Vivek Murphy.
[00:50:38.106 --> 00:50:39.046]  That's the guy's name.
[00:50:39.046 --> 00:50:41.067]  Thank you, crew.
[00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:45.787]  Yeah, just 7.7% of the people that get it have a life-altering side effect.
[00:50:45.787 --> 00:50:47.508]  Yeah!
[00:50:47.508 --> 00:50:48.408]  Get that vax!
[00:50:49.693 --> 00:50:52.954]  Virtually every COVID death in America is preventable.
[00:51:20.057 --> 00:51:21.618]  Virtually everyone.
[00:51:21.618 --> 00:51:27.521]  Almost everyone who will die from COVID this year will not be up to date on their shots.
[00:51:27.521 --> 00:51:30.983]  Or they will not have taken Paxlovid when they got sick.
[00:51:30.983 --> 00:51:32.864]  So he's just lying.
[00:51:32.864 --> 00:51:35.566]  In fact, the data is the exact opposite.
[00:51:35.566 --> 00:51:39.768]  Most of the COVID deaths are vaccinated people.
[00:51:39.768 --> 00:51:42.249]  In fact, it's like 90% now.
[00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:44.991]  90% of COVID deaths are from individuals that are vaccinated.
[00:51:44.991 --> 00:51:46.532]  So, just an outright lie.
[00:51:47.947 --> 00:51:51.288]  But hey, maybe you're not falling for the propaganda.
[00:51:51.288 --> 00:51:53.249]  Maybe a bribe, hmm?
[00:51:53.249 --> 00:51:58.110]  How about a little bribe to get you to join the VAX side?
[00:51:58.110 --> 00:51:59.051]  How about a little bribe?
[00:51:59.051 --> 00:52:04.852]  Here's Biden bribing the American people to get the vaccine in clip C. Get the shot.
[00:52:04.852 --> 00:52:14.356]  Five, ten, twenty dollars off your drugstore grocery purchase or grocery purchase next time at the same time you get the shot.
[00:52:14.356 --> 00:52:15.316]  They're all laughing!
[00:52:16.496 --> 00:52:18.238]  They're all laughing at you.
[00:52:18.238 --> 00:52:19.559]  It's such a joke at this point.
[00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:21.822]  Joe Biden can't say it with a straight face.
[00:52:21.822 --> 00:52:24.004]  When he's talking, the people behind him are laughing.
[00:52:24.004 --> 00:52:26.287]  This is all a joke.
[00:52:26.287 --> 00:52:27.988]  It is all a big fat joke.
[00:52:27.988 --> 00:52:38.560]  They know the vaccine is not safe, not effective, and here they are pushing it to you, laughing in your face, thinking the American people are so stupid that they won't know any better.
[00:52:39.807 --> 00:52:47.769]  But the American people do know better, and sadly many of them have learned to know better.
[00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:53.711]  And COVID, or the vaccine, has been the red pill to swallow to learn better.
[00:52:53.711 --> 00:52:59.832]  But the Washington Post, who you know, the liberal Washington Post, loves to make everything about race.
[00:52:59.832 --> 00:53:01.633]  Normally you'd call that a racist.
[00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:17.998]  And they're confused because remember they were saying how COVID disproportionately affects black Americans and so therefore it's a more serious problem but now the data doesn't actually bear that out and they're concerned.
[00:53:17.998 --> 00:53:26.362]  The post analysis found that black deaths declined while white deaths never eased until the mortality gap flipped.
[00:53:27.159 --> 00:53:28.760]  Because it's all about race.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.623]  Because that's what racists care about.
[00:53:31.623 --> 00:53:39.810]  From the end of October through the end of December 2021, white people died at a higher rate than black people did, the Post found.
[00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:40.791]  What?
[00:53:40.791 --> 00:53:43.534]  White death rates have risen compared with others?
[00:53:43.534 --> 00:53:44.355]  What could this be?
[00:53:45.865 --> 00:53:49.768]  We can't have white people as the biggest victim of anything!
[00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:51.929]  Blacks must be the biggest victim!
[00:53:51.929 --> 00:53:53.991]  Or Jews must be the biggest victim!
[00:53:53.991 --> 00:53:55.752]  Or the Palestinians!
[00:53:55.752 --> 00:53:58.033]  Not the whites!
[00:53:58.033 --> 00:54:01.756]  It's the minoritas!
[00:54:01.756 --> 00:54:03.197]  Oh no!
[00:54:03.197 --> 00:54:04.558]  What could it be?
[00:54:04.558 --> 00:54:08.020]  Whites now more likely to die from COVID than blacks.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:11.162]  Why, the pandemic shifted.
[00:54:11.162 --> 00:54:13.044]  Well, there's a thing about that, actually.
[00:54:15.072 --> 00:54:25.195]  In a study, latest data on COVID-19 vaccinations by race and ethnicity.
[00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:30.916]  And so let's go into the study here.
[00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:32.877]  And let's see what they found.
[00:54:32.877 --> 00:54:38.638]  Black and Hispanic people have been less likely than their white counterparts to receive a vaccine.
[00:54:38.638 --> 00:54:38.678]  Ah!
[00:54:42.996 --> 00:54:44.177]  Ah, okay.
[00:54:44.177 --> 00:54:47.560]  So we now know what it is then.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.804]  Why are white people dying more than black people?
[00:54:51.804 --> 00:54:52.844]  That can't be the case.
[00:54:52.844 --> 00:54:58.709]  The Washington Post always says it's black people that are the biggest victim, and then I guess brown people, anybody but the whites.
[00:54:58.709 --> 00:55:03.313]  But now they see that the white people are the ones dying from COVID.
[00:55:03.313 --> 00:55:08.317]  And then you realize it's because the white people are the ones getting the vaccine.
[00:55:08.317 --> 00:55:08.658]  Yeah.
[00:55:10.157 --> 00:55:14.179]  So Joe Biden says if you don't get the vaccine, you're going to die from COVID.
[00:55:14.179 --> 00:55:17.980]  All of the data shows 90% of the COVID deaths are people that have been vaccinated.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.122]  The Washington Post says, why aren't black people dying from COVID anymore?
[00:55:21.122 --> 00:55:24.903]  And the research data says because black people aren't taking the vaccine.
[00:55:24.903 --> 00:55:29.905]  Isn't it fun having to correct all the Democrat Party propaganda here every day?
[00:55:29.905 --> 00:55:30.606]  Isn't it fun?
[00:55:31.997 --> 00:55:41.631]  Having to sort out all the mainstream fake news media propaganda, all the big pharmaceutical propaganda, CDC propaganda, Fauci propaganda, every day.
[00:55:41.631 --> 00:55:42.372]  Isn't it fun?
[00:55:44.721 --> 00:55:48.123]  But of course, we were on the tip of the spear on this.
[00:55:48.123 --> 00:56:02.450]  We were on the leading edge on this, just like everything else here at InfoWars, while others were promoting the vaccine, like Ben Shapiro, who was not just promoting the vaccine, he was then shaming individuals like Elijah Schaefer, who were warning against taking the vaccine.
[00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:03.990]  This is Ben Shapiro.
[00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.552]  This is Ben Shapiro today, though.
[00:56:06.552 --> 00:56:09.173]  In fact, guys, let's just play a brief moment of the clip.
[00:56:09.173 --> 00:56:11.174]  So here's Ben Shapiro.
[00:56:11.174 --> 00:56:12.614]  I believe we have it here, guys.
[00:56:12.614 --> 00:56:13.235]  Do we have the clip?
[00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:22.660]  Here's Ben Shapiro after telling you to take the vaccine, saying the vaccine is safe and effective, saying it should be mandated, and criticizing people that disagreed.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.640]  Here's Ben Shapiro today.
[00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:32.227]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:56:32.227 --> 00:56:32.768]  That's enough.
[00:56:32.768 --> 00:56:33.208]  Oh!
[00:56:33.208 --> 00:56:35.791]  It's now perfectly clear, guys!
[00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:40.075]  It's now perfectly clear because Ben Shapiro says so.
[00:56:40.075 --> 00:56:41.697]  It's now perfectly clear.
[00:56:41.697 --> 00:56:47.182]  He says, Pfizer has now admitted they did not test whether the COVID vaccines prevented transmission before releasing them.
[00:56:47.182 --> 00:56:49.124]  No, that was always known.
[00:56:49.124 --> 00:56:50.246]  All of this was always known.
[00:56:51.752 --> 00:56:58.636]  But hey, Ben Shapiro being two years late is perfectly fine, but he's not going to apologize because he lied about it too.
[00:56:58.636 --> 00:57:02.277]  He's not going to apologize because he repeated the propaganda too.
[00:57:02.277 --> 00:57:02.638]  No, no, no.
[00:57:02.638 --> 00:57:04.919]  He's going to act like he's the one telling you the truth now.
[00:57:06.021 --> 00:57:07.182]  Yeah.
[00:57:07.182 --> 00:57:13.730]  Rand Paul demands answers over Vax Company PR firm's embedded staff within CDC to promote vaccines.
[00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.692]  Well, yeah, I mean, of course.
[00:57:14.692 --> 00:57:16.394]  And they got their lobbyists, too.
[00:57:16.394 --> 00:57:19.157]  And then Joe Biden says, we beat Big Pharma.
[00:57:19.157 --> 00:57:19.578]  Remember that?
[00:57:19.578 --> 00:57:20.819]  He says, we beat Big Pharma.
[00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:21.880]  Now go take your vaccine.
[00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:24.463]  Potential violation of HIPAA.
[00:57:24.463 --> 00:57:31.308]  Mother outraged after CDC called her for survey asking number of kids in the household eligible for vaccination.
[00:57:31.308 --> 00:57:35.892]  Yeah, because then they want to send their little minions out there to force inoculate your children.
[00:57:35.892 --> 00:57:37.454]  Don't you know that's how it works?
[00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:39.395]  Safe and effective, safe and effective.
[00:57:39.395 --> 00:57:42.157]  And then a year later, oops, not safe, not effective.
[00:57:42.157 --> 00:57:45.080]  But hey, it's mandated for kids and Joe Biden just got his fifth shot.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:50.244]  So come on, join the club.
[00:57:50.244 --> 00:57:50.965]  It's our bestseller.
[00:57:52.059 --> 00:57:55.824]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[00:57:55.824 --> 00:58:04.917]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[00:58:04.917 --> 00:58:06.980]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.

[00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.872]  Essential means without these things you die.
[00:58:23.872 --> 00:58:31.977]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:58:31.977 --> 00:58:34.199]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[00:58:49.940 --> 00:59:02.691]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[00:59:02.691 --> 00:59:05.133]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[00:59:05.894 --> 00:59:14.798]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[00:59:14.798 --> 00:59:16.799]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:25.923]  I don't plan to be Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarshore.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.

[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.078]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:11.768]  Well, really excited for this next hour of the Alex Jones Show, because we're going to be joined by Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec.
[01:00:11.768 --> 01:00:25.092]  In fact, we are joined by them right now, and we're going to be covering the debates that have been going on, specifically the big Senate debate between Fetterman and Oz, which was beyond a disaster for Fetterman.
[01:00:25.092 --> 01:00:27.293]  Just beyond a disaster.
[01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:30.794]  We'll play some of those clips coming up, but I bring in Steve
[01:00:31.474 --> 01:00:33.955]  Bannon and Jack Posobiec now.
[01:00:33.955 --> 01:00:45.540]  And guys, let's just kind of give a brief reaction to the debates, whether it's the Zeldin-Hockel debate and the Federman-Oz debate, or just all the debates, or in some cases lack thereof.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:50.002]  Just what's been your kind of initial response to this now, 13 days from the midterm, Steve Bannon?
[01:00:51.474 --> 01:00:57.636]  Well, first off, last night, Tudor Dixon took it to Whitmer, and Lee Zeldin took it to Hochul, and I think this is the issue.
[01:00:57.636 --> 01:01:02.178]  Every time you're on a debate stage with a MAGA Republican, they're bringing heat.
[01:01:02.178 --> 01:01:03.758]  And this is why people don't want to debate.
[01:01:03.758 --> 01:01:07.079]  This is why Josh Shapiro's not debating Mastriano.
[01:01:07.079 --> 01:01:11.441]  You know, Posobiec's a son of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[01:01:11.982 --> 01:01:21.519]  For a place that has that much history, that means that much to the American people, all the way from the revolution, from the founding of the nation to the revolution, the Civil War down to the current day.
[01:01:22.322 --> 01:01:25.124]  It was, Owen, I think it's nothing more than a humiliation.
[01:01:25.124 --> 01:01:30.629]  It shows you how crass and cynical the Democrats are.
[01:01:30.629 --> 01:01:32.110]  He's a guy who's very ill.
[01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:35.873]  I mean, we cover him as the cyborg because he's half man and half machine.
[01:01:35.873 --> 01:01:39.376]  And now you're seeing they're complaining about that, Owen, that it wasn't done right.
[01:01:39.376 --> 01:01:40.597]  And we knew that was going to happen.
[01:01:40.597 --> 01:01:42.058]  That's the problem with having a cyborg.
[01:01:42.757 --> 01:01:44.919]  But, I actually fell for the guy.
[01:01:44.919 --> 01:01:46.440]  He's seriously ill.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.544]  He has a very tough, you know, rehab to go for him.
[01:01:50.544 --> 01:01:53.827]  And the Democrats are so callous to put it out there.
[01:01:53.827 --> 01:02:03.935]  And Pasovic, I think, nailed it this morning on his Twitter, that they want Shapiro to sneak in here without debating to win and then to appoint the wife to be the senator.
[01:02:03.935 --> 01:02:08.159]  So, Jack, I know this had to hurt you last night, being a son of Pennsylvania.
[01:02:10.009 --> 01:02:11.270]  No, Steve, that's exactly right.
[01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:28.156]  So, what they're trying to do, and Richard Barris actually just covered this on his show, but he said, look, if they can get both Democrats in by fortifying the election as hard as possible, the same way we've seen fortified elections before, what they'll do is, John Fetterman, if he's elected, the plan is for him to not serve a single
[01:02:28.656 --> 01:02:29.577]  That's right.
[01:02:47.506 --> 01:02:49.768]  As the second lady of Pennsylvania.
[01:02:49.768 --> 01:02:53.731]  Doug Mastriano, the actual Republican candidate, isn't even verified.
[01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:57.194]  We're the only statewides in Pennsylvania where Twitter won't allow this.
[01:02:57.194 --> 01:03:00.156]  And so, we can see the fix has been in from the start.
[01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:01.197]  At the end of the day, Steve,
[01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:07.050]  I came on this program last week with Alex and I said they're putting Fetterman up as a prototype.
[01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.592]  This isn't even about the election.
[01:03:08.592 --> 01:03:17.402]  They want to see if they can take someone whose mind has already been damaged and then combine them with this machine assistance.
[01:03:17.782 --> 01:03:24.304]  In order to show a prototype of the technology, roll it out, and for the transhumanist agenda.
[01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:26.064]  Now, I don't think the technology is there yet.
[01:03:26.064 --> 01:03:28.225]  As we saw last night, the technology ain't there.
[01:03:28.225 --> 01:03:38.468]  Or, you have to show that you need the subject to be at a certain mental acuity, which of course Fetterman was not yet, for the technology to be successful.
[01:03:38.468 --> 01:03:39.988]  So we didn't get that last night.
[01:03:39.988 --> 01:03:44.970]  We saw, and of course we see him complaining, he's blaming it on the technology, he's blaming it on the system, but what are they doing?
[01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.912]  What are they doing in the midst of all of this?
[01:03:47.912 --> 01:04:03.945]  While we see Federman, while he's complaining about these campaigns, complaining about the system, the computer, they're normalizing the idea of candidates using computer assistance and computer technology impacted directly into their minds.
[01:04:03.945 --> 01:04:06.387]  A mind-man merger.
[01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:10.203]  On stage, right before our eyes, they're normalizing this.
[01:04:10.203 --> 01:04:18.205]  They're normalizing it to the point where they're saying, oh, the computer was just malfunctioning, but it's totally normal for a candidate to be hooked up like this.
[01:04:18.205 --> 01:04:26.028]  Oh, and this is, I know we've got just a short segment here, but this is what they've been condemning Alex Jones as a conspiracy theory guy for a decade, right?
[01:04:26.748 --> 01:04:28.990]  Are we not seeing what Alex Jones has warned about?
[01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.371]  Last night you saw a man-machine merger.
[01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:32.812]  It's just not closed caption.
[01:04:32.812 --> 01:04:35.354]  We had our transhumanist editor there, Joe Allen.
[01:04:35.354 --> 01:04:38.616]  It's a whole system to kind of make it right for his brain.
[01:04:38.616 --> 01:04:42.518]  And they complained this morning that the system wasn't set up correctly.
[01:04:42.518 --> 01:04:47.522]  They had the gall to complain that the system they had, the man-machine merger, was...
[01:04:48.362 --> 01:04:53.165]  Oops, the president just got us in a nuclear war because the system wasn't working.
[01:04:53.165 --> 01:04:55.027]  His brain implant wasn't working.
[01:04:55.027 --> 01:04:56.868]  Oh, oops, our bad, sorry.
[01:04:56.868 --> 01:05:06.015]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:05:06.015 --> 01:05:09.117]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[01:05:10.196 --> 01:05:15.117]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:05:15.117 --> 01:05:18.638]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[01:05:18.638 --> 01:05:19.498]  It's game over.
[01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:25.200]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.781]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:05:29.781 --> 01:05:35.943]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[01:05:36.423 --> 01:05:48.392]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsTore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:05:48.392 --> 01:05:54.516]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:56.338]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:17.387]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:17.387 --> 01:06:19.490]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:22.174]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:24.342 --> 01:06:25.763]  Hi, good night everybody.
[01:06:48.214 --> 01:06:50.595]  I'm running to serve Pennsylvania.
[01:06:50.595 --> 01:06:52.816]  He's running to use Pennsylvania.
[01:06:52.816 --> 01:06:59.678]  Here's a man that spent more than twenty million dollars of his own money to try to buy that seat.
[01:06:59.678 --> 01:07:05.000]  I'm also having to talk about something called the Oz Rule.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.901]  That if he's on TV, he's lying.
[01:07:07.901 --> 01:07:11.142]  He did that during his career on his TV show.
[01:07:11.142 --> 01:07:14.343]  He's done that during his campaign about lying about
[01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:21.112]  Our record here, and he's also lying probably during this debate.
[01:07:21.112 --> 01:07:23.773]  And let's also talk about the elephant in the room.
[01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:24.993]  I had a stroke.
[01:07:24.993 --> 01:07:27.294]  He's never let me forget that.
[01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:34.876]  And I might miss some words during this debate, mush two words together, but it knocked me down, but I'm going to keep coming back up.
[01:07:35.376 --> 01:07:51.000]  And this campaign is all about, to me, is about fighting for everyone in Pennsylvania that ever got knocked down, that needs to get back up, and fighting for all forgotten communities all across Pennsylvania that also got knocked down, that needs to keep, get back up.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.320]  Okay.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.361]  I mean, the fumbles, the stutters, admitting he's having problems.
[01:07:56.361 --> 01:07:58.962]  Steve Bannon, what did we just see there?
[01:07:58.962 --> 01:08:04.023]  That was, I mean, at the beginning, it was, it's so,
[01:08:04.895 --> 01:08:08.022]  Awful that you sit there and go what what are they doing here?
[01:08:08.022 --> 01:08:12.192]  I mean this guy can't can't have them and look if you look at the New York and Michigan debate
[01:08:12.948 --> 01:08:20.170]  And I think Tudor Dixon and Lee Zeldin crushed their Democratic opposition, right?
[01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:21.170]  Two sitting governors.
[01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.350]  But it was give and take.
[01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:23.931]  It was thrust and parry.
[01:08:23.931 --> 01:08:25.971]  They were at each other for the entire time.
[01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:31.272]  And Owen, quite frankly, something I want to get to, your last segment about the vaccines was a big part of both of those.
[01:08:31.272 --> 01:08:34.373]  But there you had people defending policy and other people all over them.
[01:08:34.373 --> 01:08:36.254]  That's where the debate's supposed to be.
[01:08:36.254 --> 01:08:37.354]  What you saw last night,
[01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:38.795]  Was pathetic.
[01:08:38.795 --> 01:08:42.157]  It was beneath the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to have to watch that.
[01:08:42.157 --> 01:08:44.318]  And here's where I really got a problem with.
[01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:46.580]  Josh Shapiro has not come out.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.521]  He's still hiding from Astriano.
[01:08:48.521 --> 01:08:52.504]  And he will not come out and condemn what happened last night by the Democratic Party.
[01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:54.305]  Jack, you're a Pennsylvania voter.
[01:08:54.305 --> 01:08:57.447]  What did you see last night?
[01:08:57.447 --> 01:09:00.409]  Look, I saw it was disrespectful.
[01:09:00.409 --> 01:09:02.991]  It was disrespectful to John Fetterman.
[01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:08.891]  To his family, in a sense, though I know obviously his wife plays a huge role in this.
[01:09:08.891 --> 01:09:12.133]  And it was disrespectful to my family.
[01:09:12.133 --> 01:09:15.254]  It was disrespectful to the people of Pennsylvania, the people of our Commonwealth.
[01:09:15.254 --> 01:09:17.075]  Look, Pennsylvania's hurting right now.
[01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:42.365]  Whether you're looking at the fentanyl that's pouring into our state from all over the world, obviously across the southern border, coming directly from the Chinese Communist Party, whether it's the crime that's pouring out of Philadelphia, murdering children in our streets, coming out into the suburbs there from Philadelphia, people getting killed at football games, people getting killed in the street there, and then nobody getting locked up over this,
[01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:50.503]  You see a massive amount of disrespect for the people of our state who are hurting because of these economic policies.
[01:09:50.503 --> 01:09:56.107]  And one of the big policies that did come up in terms of this was this idea of fracking.
[01:09:56.107 --> 01:10:12.897]  And should the people of Pennsylvania be able to utilize the resources that God bequeathed to them underneath the very ground of the state itself, the Marcellus Shale Find, the same as the Permian Basin, the Bracken Formation out west.
[01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:19.537]  Fetterman, when they asked him about this, you could tell that he forgot what he was supposed to say.
[01:10:19.537 --> 01:10:21.019]  He couldn't tell where he was.
[01:10:21.019 --> 01:10:23.461]  Well, Jack, let's play the clip.
[01:10:23.461 --> 01:10:25.923]  Let's give the evidence to what you're talking about and then respond.
[01:10:25.923 --> 01:10:27.725]  Here is the clip that Jack is talking about.
[01:10:27.725 --> 01:10:30.508]  Fetterman stumbling over the question on fracking.
[01:10:34.872 --> 01:10:37.333]  Mr. Oz, I do want to clarify something.
[01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:47.357]  You're saying tonight that you support fracking, that you've always supported fracking, but there is that 2018 interview that you said, quote, I don't support fracking at all.
[01:10:47.357 --> 01:10:54.299]  So how do you square the two?
[01:10:54.299 --> 01:10:58.701]  I do support fracking and I don't
[01:11:00.586 --> 01:11:03.588]  I support fracking, and I stand, and I do support fracking.
[01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:30.815]  Yeah, my guess is that, and I'll put my analyst hat on here, is that he probably had a prepared statement that his campaign had given him.
[01:11:30.815 --> 01:11:40.859]  If I were staffing him, if I were a guy on the left, one of these operatives, I would have given him a prepared statement that kind of threaded the needle to say that, you know, we have to have resources, but it has to be safe and environmental.
[01:11:40.859 --> 01:11:42.980]  He completely went into vapor lock.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:46.502]  That was like a flashing 404 error up on his head.
[01:11:47.606 --> 01:12:06.310]  Look, Owen, when I just went up to Pennsylvania and I was in Erie, Pennsylvania, we talked about the Mastriano plan to build a Pennsylvania pipeline for that Freedom Gas straight up to Erie, another one out to Philadelphia to put this Pennsylvania Freedom Gas out on the world market, actually be able to undercut OPEC and then ensure American energy dominance.
[01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:10.651]  It was probably the biggest applause line that I got because we're talking six
[01:12:11.471 --> 01:12:19.721]  Your jobs that people would be coming back to the people of Pennsylvania, whether you're a trucker, whether you're a worker, whether someone who can go and actually work on these sites.
[01:12:19.721 --> 01:12:21.082]  These are massive, massive.
[01:12:21.082 --> 01:12:26.589]  And then the secondary tertiary economic effects thereof in terms of utilizing this Josh Shapiro.
[01:12:26.589 --> 01:12:28.731]  He wants to ban this Federman.
[01:12:28.731 --> 01:12:30.013]  He's never been on the side of this.
[01:12:30.633 --> 01:12:35.356]  The coal mining, of course, obviously, this would be a huge boon for Pennsylvania to actually start bringing this back.
[01:12:35.356 --> 01:12:38.118]  This is an agenda that is not like the Dobbs decision.
[01:12:38.118 --> 01:12:42.321]  It's not like some of these other decisions that just kind of, you know, democracy is democracy at stake.
[01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:43.002]  What does that even mean?
[01:12:43.002 --> 01:12:44.923]  You can't put that in your fuel tank.
[01:12:44.923 --> 01:12:48.125]  You can't put that on your kitchen table and eat it at dinnertime.
[01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:51.307]  You can't serve the Dobbs decision and democracy to your children.
[01:12:51.307 --> 01:12:52.728]  These are things that actually matter.
[01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:53.749]  People are starting to go.
[01:12:53.749 --> 01:12:55.370]  You go to that northern tier of Pennsylvania.
[01:12:55.370 --> 01:13:00.033]  People wouldn't go to the dentist for the first time because dentists are opening up in some of these small towns.
[01:13:00.353 --> 01:13:05.856]  Because that's how bad it's been since they shipped all of our manufacturing jobs, our steel jobs, over to the Far East.
[01:13:05.856 --> 01:13:06.836]  That's how bad it's been.
[01:13:06.836 --> 01:13:13.420]  We can now bring it back with Mastriano, and you have to stop Oz, you have to stop Shapiro, in order to make this happen.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:23.685]  Yeah, Steve, this has actually been one of your big issues when you were specifically working with Trump, was the jobs being sent out of America, specifically to China.
[01:13:23.685 --> 01:13:27.567]  And this is one of the agendas, to ship the energy off it, offshore the energy, too.
[01:13:27.567 --> 01:13:28.688]  We can bring the energy back.
[01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:34.241]  Look, that's a policy discussion, and we should have that, and the people of Pennsylvania should have that.
[01:13:34.241 --> 01:13:36.264]  That's not what we just saw.
[01:13:36.264 --> 01:13:38.967]  What we just saw is the cyborg had a malfunction.
[01:13:39.767 --> 01:13:45.191]  This is monumental, and that's why I think it's humiliating, but everybody in America should watch it.
[01:13:45.191 --> 01:13:57.901]  Pasova just laid out a rational, and if you were in New York or if you were in Michigan, you had that thrust and parry of two conflicting ideas of what American industrial life should be and the economics around that.
[01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.582]  That's not what we just saw.
[01:13:59.582 --> 01:14:03.445]  What we just saw is the cyborg had a malfunction, okay?
[01:14:03.445 --> 01:14:04.746]  For whatever reason.
[01:14:04.746 --> 01:14:06.828]  And this is why it's a disgrace.
[01:14:07.308 --> 01:14:09.969]  This thing is at such a level we can't even honor it.
[01:14:09.969 --> 01:14:15.330]  To even put it up to having a policy discussion means that we're buying into the cyborg.
[01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:22.132]  And I don't say that to try to hurt this guy's feelings or try to hurt people's feelings or hurt his family.
[01:14:22.132 --> 01:14:24.333]  This is something that's very dangerous.
[01:14:24.933 --> 01:14:34.155]  It showed last night, and to have the political class, oh and this morning we woke up to the political class sitting there, oh gosh, we didn't really know it was that bad, he's hidden it so much.
[01:14:34.155 --> 01:14:35.936]  That's a bald-faced lie.
[01:14:35.936 --> 01:14:43.078]  But Sobic has talked about this, he's been up there, he's talked about this on War Room for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.
[01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:44.838]  Everybody knew the shape this guy was in.
[01:14:44.838 --> 01:14:45.678]  We're good to go.
[01:15:09.352 --> 01:15:15.856]  Well, and we can't, because it's this difficult line that we walk now, too, where, hey, we're sympathetic, right?
[01:15:15.856 --> 01:15:16.896]  I mean, we're sympathetic.
[01:15:16.896 --> 01:15:19.218]  We don't like seeing somebody up there struggling like that.
[01:15:19.218 --> 01:15:20.699]  We don't want to see people in that position.
[01:15:20.699 --> 01:15:22.920]  But this is the country's future.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.201]  This is our prosperity we're talking about here.
[01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:27.162]  So we have to tell the truth.
[01:15:27.162 --> 01:15:32.806]  John Fetterman is not even capable of having a debate, let alone being in the Senate.
[01:15:32.806 --> 01:15:35.527]  But it's, oh, see, but, Steve, you say that.
[01:15:35.527 --> 01:15:36.748]  It's like they had no idea.
[01:15:37.288 --> 01:15:40.229]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:07.368]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[01:16:08.456 --> 01:16:13.377]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:16:13.377 --> 01:16:17.758]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[01:16:17.758 --> 01:16:23.459]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:16:23.459 --> 01:16:28.061]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:34.202]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.

[01:16:58.061 --> 01:17:01.544]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[01:17:01.544 --> 01:17:04.686]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:05.447]  Now, I knew that.
[01:17:06.294 --> 01:17:10.536]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[01:17:10.536 --> 01:17:17.840]  But listen, they're coming after us right now, they're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.

[01:17:33.809 --> 01:17:34.229]  I think so.
[01:17:57.933 --> 01:18:09.246]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:18:09.246 --> 01:18:11.148]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:18:11.148 --> 01:18:12.610]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:14.112]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:18:14.112 --> 01:18:15.834]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:17.115]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:18:17.115 --> 01:18:18.517]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:18:18.917 --> 01:18:23.762]  I studied The Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:18:23.762 --> 01:18:26.144]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:18:26.144 --> 01:18:28.166]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:35.113]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to The Globalist agenda.
[01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:41.135]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:18:41.135 --> 01:18:50.097]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[01:19:59.646 --> 01:20:05.550]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.593 --> 01:20:31.734]  Good night.
[01:20:31.734 --> 01:20:33.036]  Hello.
[01:20:33.036 --> 01:20:34.258]  Betterment.
[01:20:34.258 --> 01:20:35.740]  I am.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.662]  John.
[01:20:37.662 --> 01:20:39.765]  I. Brackig.
[01:20:39.765 --> 01:20:41.127]  And.
[01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:41.567]  Oz.
[01:20:41.567 --> 01:20:43.470]  Doctor.
[01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:47.815]  Anyway, uh, what was the next question you had for me in clip J?
[01:20:50.725 --> 01:20:53.186]  One person on this stage has broken the law, we believe.
[01:20:53.186 --> 01:21:01.209]  John Fetterman took a shotgun, chased an unarmed African-American man, and put the gun, apparently, according to that man, to his chest.
[01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:03.409]  John, you weren't pulled over by the police.
[01:21:03.409 --> 01:21:04.030]  They let you go.
[01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:05.190]  You were the mayor at the time.
[01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:10.832]  Why haven't you apologized to that unarmed, innocent black man who you put a shotgun to his chest?
[01:21:11.112 --> 01:21:13.834]  All right, we will allow a 30-second response to that.
[01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:17.958]  Mr. Fetterman, specifically what he was saying referring to the incident in Braddock.
[01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:23.323]  I made the opportunity to defend my community as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer there.
[01:21:23.323 --> 01:21:28.187]  Everybody in Braddock, an overwhelmingly majority community of black,
[01:21:29.068 --> 01:21:32.291]  The community all understood what happened.
[01:21:32.291 --> 01:21:43.522]  They understood what happened and everybody agreed that and nobody believes that it was anything about me making a split-second decision to defend our community as well.
[01:21:43.522 --> 01:21:44.623]  Why not apologize?
[01:21:44.623 --> 01:21:46.525]  Well, Jack, obviously...
[01:21:47.566 --> 01:21:56.932]  The hypocrisy here is pretty obvious, and as inconsequential as that event may have been, you know the inconsistencies here.
[01:21:56.932 --> 01:22:06.678]  We know the incongruencies with applying that if, let's say, any Republican, let alone Dr. Oz, would have done something similar, that would have been the end of their political career!
[01:22:06.678 --> 01:22:12.881]  But John Fetterman can just say, I did the right thing, black, and he gets away with it.
[01:22:12.881 --> 01:22:15.303]  Well, I mean, look, you know, it's not...
[01:22:15.996 --> 01:22:18.077]  Hypocrisy, though, really.
[01:22:18.077 --> 01:22:19.217]  It's hierarchy.
[01:22:19.217 --> 01:22:28.881]  The idea that a Republican or a Conservative can say anything, have their words twisted, have the way you pronounce words twisted, as I've had done to me, they smear who they fear, right?
[01:22:28.881 --> 01:22:35.324]  This has nothing to do with whether or not someone is actually racist or not racist.
[01:22:35.324 --> 01:22:37.445]  What it has to do is power and control.
[01:22:37.905 --> 01:22:48.350]  Because in order to institute their agenda of total power and total control, they need people that are human sponges, mush minds, like Fetterman, in there in office.
[01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:53.253]  Look what they got in the Oval Office if you need any further indication of that or any further verification.
[01:22:53.253 --> 01:22:57.375]  Because it's not about, this guy isn't the one who's going to be pushing the button.
[01:22:57.375 --> 01:23:07.060]  This guy's not the one that's actually going to be weighing and measuring the limits on abortion, or whether we go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine, or what we're going to do in terms of
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:07.840]  You know,
[01:23:29.654 --> 01:23:35.478]  Physically cannot think for himself unless he's hooked up to a computer that they control.
[01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:37.059]  That's who John Fetterman is.
[01:23:37.059 --> 01:23:38.140]  That's who Joe Biden is.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.721]  That's why they're trying to stop him.
[01:23:39.721 --> 01:23:53.150]  That's why they want people that are either, number one, simply going to be there because they're ambitious and will say whatever the regime wants, like Josh Shapiro, or someone that they can actually control at a cerebral level, like John Fetterman.
[01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:55.551]  Steve, let's think about how this applies to the midterms.
[01:23:55.551 --> 01:23:56.112]  You had a comment.
[01:23:56.112 --> 01:23:57.012]  You can respond to Jack.
[01:23:57.012 --> 01:23:58.393]  Go ahead.
[01:23:58.393 --> 01:23:58.794]  Hang on.
[01:23:58.794 --> 01:23:59.354]  This is key.
[01:24:00.194 --> 01:24:09.300]  Because remember, and I know we'll talk about some geopolitics later in the show, geostrategic initiatives that are going around right now, this is about control of the Senate.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:16.105]  They understand that these four or five seats we're defending, this is the one they thought was the lowest hanging fruit, okay?
[01:24:16.105 --> 01:24:23.150]  They see the Senate slipping away from them and the control of the Senate right now with all the important issues the Senate deals with separate from the House.
[01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:24.931]  This is why it's so central.
[01:24:24.931 --> 01:24:28.954]  And they would go to have a man-machine merger
[01:24:29.634 --> 01:24:34.876]  To try to have that up on stage and fool the folks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[01:24:34.876 --> 01:24:37.296]  That's what's so shocking, and they got out of it last night.
[01:24:37.296 --> 01:24:43.498]  This is why this thing is so much deeper and more troubling than just a normal Senate race.
[01:24:43.498 --> 01:24:47.379]  One, shifting the entire power of the Senate to MAGA, right?
[01:24:47.379 --> 01:24:51.220]  They're trying to defend it at all costs, and they would do it with a man-machine merger.
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.901]  They did it with essentially a cyborg.
[01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:55.862]  And what did they complain about today?
[01:24:55.862 --> 01:25:02.346]  Their first thing they came out with is that, oh, the moderators didn't have the cyborg programmed right.
[01:25:02.346 --> 01:25:07.829]  Because it wasn't, pointing out their lie, Owen, that it wasn't just closed caption.
[01:25:07.829 --> 01:25:09.750]  This was something much deeper.
[01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:13.653]  If you had said a year ago, or if Alex Jones had said it on this very show,
[01:25:14.173 --> 01:25:25.862]  That you're going to see a cyber, a man-machine merger and the entire Senate is going to hang in the balance on one debate where he's up on stage about whether the man-machine merger actually works.
[01:25:25.862 --> 01:25:28.965]  The thing to laugh this off is this is more crazy talk from Alex Jones.
[01:25:28.965 --> 01:25:30.166]  This is ridiculous.
[01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:32.788]  That's what you saw in Philadelphia last night.
[01:25:32.788 --> 01:25:40.554]  It's quite ironic that it's back to the very beginning of American liberty that there you see what transhumanism has in store for the future of us.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:52.848]  Well, and the incredible thing now we now we have more of an idea of why there was that kerfuffle over the NBC interview where he needed multiple machines just to conduct the interview.
[01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:55.710]  And the NBC interviewer was like, this is really strange.
[01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:56.330]  This is odd.
[01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:58.371]  I'm going to report this as a news story.
[01:25:58.371 --> 01:25:59.672]  And they said, oh, how dare you?
[01:25:59.672 --> 01:26:00.413]  You're ableist.
[01:26:00.413 --> 01:26:01.233]  That's not the case.
[01:26:01.233 --> 01:26:02.454]  He's perfectly fine.
[01:26:02.454 --> 01:26:05.116]  But he only had one or two machines to work with him last night.
[01:26:05.116 --> 01:26:06.497]  He needed four or five.
[01:26:06.497 --> 01:26:07.918]  And we saw the results.
[01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:10.780]  So but let's talk about the midterms now, 13 days away.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:11.120]  I want to get
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:11.840]  Thank you.
[01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:31.514]  Look, no, no, no, Owen.
[01:26:31.514 --> 01:26:38.880]  I mean, this is just like 2020 all over again because they know when they don't have the candidate, what do they do?
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.983]  They flip the switch and they begin to fortify the elections.
[01:26:42.983 --> 01:26:52.510]  There was a headline from the Associated Press just today, a few hours ago, talking about this that said, well, you know, there's times where a machine might switch your vote.
[01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:55.473]  There's times where there's some issues, but we're going to work on that.
[01:26:55.473 --> 01:26:58.435]  You got the Department of Justice under Biden putting out these statements.
[01:26:58.715 --> 01:27:04.197]  Saying, by the way, you know, these systems, these critical election infrastructure systems, they're susceptible to cyber attack.
[01:27:04.197 --> 01:27:05.058]  There's many issues.
[01:27:05.058 --> 01:27:06.098]  We've got to look forward to this.
[01:27:06.098 --> 01:27:12.501]  And at the end of the day, the biggest one for specifically Pennsylvania, but a lot of these states have this issue as well.
[01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:19.323]  The United States Supreme Court came out and put out a decision that said, hey, you can't count these ballots if they come in without dates.
[01:27:19.323 --> 01:27:23.785]  If they don't come out without the paperwork filled out properly, you cannot count them.
[01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:27.747]  The state of Pennsylvania, which is currently controlled by Democrats, including Josh Shapiro,
[01:27:28.067 --> 01:27:28.447]  We're good to go.
[01:27:48.875 --> 01:27:50.155]  That's how they're going to try to do that.
[01:27:50.155 --> 01:27:58.757]  And that was my question is, of course, any common sense state would not elect John Fetterman, but whether that exists or not, the voter fraud exists.
[01:27:58.757 --> 01:28:02.937]  I mean, how we did go, it's reported that the Republicans... You need the patriots there on game day.
[01:28:02.937 --> 01:28:05.738]  The patriots need to show up on game day.
[01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:09.879]  You need to stand in line as long as it takes, as many hours as it takes.
[01:28:09.879 --> 01:28:13.439]  Bring the water, bring your wah-wah or sheets, provisions, whatever you need.
[01:28:13.439 --> 01:28:15.020]  Stand in line.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.600]  Patriots do not step back.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.221]  Take no step back, no surrender.
[01:28:33.832 --> 01:28:35.393]  Heading into the midterm elections.
[01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:36.913]  So, I mean, they're well aware.
[01:28:36.913 --> 01:28:39.194]  We saw them blocking the windows at Philadelphia.
[01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:41.996]  We saw the ballot boxes coming in in the middle of the night.
[01:28:41.996 --> 01:28:43.816]  We saw the vote Viagra for Biden.
[01:28:43.816 --> 01:28:47.238]  He's losing all day and then it goes straight up and then they stop the counting.
[01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:50.159]  How concerned are we about that in the 2022 midterms?
[01:28:50.159 --> 01:28:53.000]  We ask Steve Bannon on the other side of this break.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:53.721]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:54.541]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:58.789 --> 01:29:04.387]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[01:29:05.546 --> 01:29:19.174]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[01:29:19.174 --> 01:29:33.422]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.

[01:30:30.846 --> 01:30:33.447]  Essential means without these things you die.

[01:30:41.531 --> 01:30:43.752]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[01:31:02.621 --> 01:31:07.146]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[01:31:07.146 --> 01:31:08.848]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:31:08.848 --> 01:31:12.752]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table?
[01:31:12.752 --> 01:31:16.356]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[01:31:16.636 --> 01:31:28.181]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[01:31:28.181 --> 01:31:32.582]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[01:31:32.582 --> 01:31:36.624]  Take a few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.124]  Plus it funds the InfoWar.

[01:31:46.268 --> 01:31:52.313]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[01:31:52.313 --> 01:31:53.173]  This family that is InfoWars.
[01:32:14.096 --> 01:32:30.310]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:39.418]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:42.391]  I don't take the credit.
[01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:44.112]  I give you the credit.
[01:32:44.112 --> 01:32:46.734]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[01:32:46.734 --> 01:32:48.336]  It isn't going to give up.
[01:32:48.336 --> 01:32:50.177]  Without your support, we could be shut down.

[01:32:53.460 --> 01:33:00.006]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[01:33:00.006 --> 01:33:05.911]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.552 --> 01:33:11.214]  Oh, okay.
[01:33:19.321 --> 01:33:20.981]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:22.662]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:22.662 --> 01:33:24.663]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.663 --> 01:33:27.883]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:27.883 --> 01:33:29.944]  You know, there were other highlights from last night.
[01:33:29.944 --> 01:33:33.585]  The Fetterman Senate debate obviously getting most of the attention.
[01:33:33.585 --> 01:33:39.827]  It's the balance of the Senate and just the example of the cyborg Fetterman that was such an embarrassment.
[01:33:39.827 --> 01:33:43.828]  But Zeldin got Hochul to admit she doesn't care about crime.
[01:33:44.728 --> 01:33:53.156]  Tudor Dixon got Gretchen Whitmer to lie about school closures and lockdowns that received a major backlash today.
[01:33:53.156 --> 01:33:56.639]  But Steve, let's just look at the midterms overall.
[01:33:56.639 --> 01:33:59.562]  How concerned are you where we stand?
[01:33:59.562 --> 01:34:05.368]  Because I see all of the political momentum obviously moving in the direction of Republicans.
[01:34:05.368 --> 01:34:06.249]  It really has since 2016.
[01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:13.717]  But, as in 2020, I'm afraid it's not going to be fairly represented with the votes.
[01:34:13.717 --> 01:34:21.446]  Steve Bannon, what are you thinking when it comes to midterms and the odds of a Republican victory against all the election fraud we know is going to exist?
[01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:24.455]  Look, right now we have two things.
[01:34:24.455 --> 01:34:25.356]  Get out the vote.
[01:34:25.356 --> 01:34:26.638]  Everybody's got to man the ramparts.
[01:34:26.638 --> 01:34:32.024]  And also, you've got to sign up and volunteer to be an election official, a poll worker, not just a poll watcher.
[01:34:32.024 --> 01:34:34.807]  It's got to be the Yunkin model in Virginia.
[01:34:34.807 --> 01:34:36.229]  Remember, Yunkin's not our guy.
[01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:38.011]  I know he's not an Alex Jones guy.
[01:34:38.011 --> 01:34:40.875]  But it showed you 100% participation by MAGA.
[01:34:41.435 --> 01:34:43.617]  Plus, these suburban moms.
[01:34:43.617 --> 01:34:50.582]  And that's why that segment you did right before I came on, Owen, while I was watching the show about the vaccines is critically important.
[01:34:50.582 --> 01:34:52.524]  That's the thing nobody's talking about.
[01:34:52.524 --> 01:34:54.165]  It's the three I's.
[01:34:54.165 --> 01:34:57.507]  It's immigration, it's inflation, it's injections.
[01:34:57.507 --> 01:34:59.729]  That is what's bringing this coalition together.
[01:34:59.729 --> 01:35:03.632]  And we know that we're expanding the battlefield, right, on the votes.
[01:35:03.632 --> 01:35:06.834]  Now, we've got to figure out how we're going to close on this and not have it stolen.
[01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:07.655]  But look in New England.
[01:35:08.155 --> 01:35:11.617]  In Connecticut, there are two House seats that are totally in play right now.
[01:35:11.617 --> 01:35:12.298]  We could win.
[01:35:12.298 --> 01:35:13.058]  Why?
[01:35:13.058 --> 01:35:15.380]  Suburban Connecticut, the moms up there are furious.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:21.184]  You add a MAGA vote to these suburban moms and dads, the parental rights thing, but particularly about the injection.
[01:35:21.184 --> 01:35:26.347]  They're very silent about it, but they're vocal at the school boards of what they don't want to have happen.
[01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:30.912]  Rhode Island 2, Maine 2, 2 seats in New Hampshire.
[01:35:30.912 --> 01:35:38.320]  The Vermont Senate is 2 or 3 points away on the Senate seat in Vermont, Bernie Sanders' home state, in New Hampshire.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.423]  General Bolduc's almost dead heat.
[01:35:40.423 --> 01:35:42.986]  The Republicans are actually coming back in with money.
[01:35:42.986 --> 01:35:45.609]  New York State, they're 12 to 15 House seats in play, 12 to 15 House seats.
[01:35:48.496 --> 01:35:48.616]  It's
[01:36:07.017 --> 01:36:07.818]  Into his House seat.
[01:36:07.818 --> 01:36:09.620]  That's never happened before in history.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.201]  You look at Washington State.
[01:36:11.201 --> 01:36:12.903]  You got a dead heat there in the Senate race.
[01:36:12.903 --> 01:36:14.425]  You got Joe Kent winning.
[01:36:14.425 --> 01:36:19.570]  You got three House seats in Oregon that MAGA candidates right now are on the cusp of winning.
[01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:21.552]  You've got the Oregon governorship.
[01:36:21.552 --> 01:36:23.654]  We've expanded this battlefield all over.
[01:36:23.654 --> 01:36:30.201]  So what we have to do now, Owen, and that's why I think this vaccine thing, CDC gave us a gift, a political gift,
[01:36:30.621 --> 01:36:31.642]  We're right on the cusp.
[01:36:51.116 --> 01:36:59.360]  Of having the opportunity to destroy the Democratic Party as a national political institution from school boards all the way up to the House and the Senate.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.180]  And Owen, here's the big tell.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:08.123]  Today in the Hill, the lead story this morning was about how the knives are already out internally at the White House, on the Hill.
[01:37:08.123 --> 01:37:10.965]  They're blaming Pelosi, Hoyer, Clyburn.
[01:37:10.965 --> 01:37:14.086]  The younger progressives saying these people are in their 80s, they didn't get the right
[01:37:14.366 --> 01:37:15.487]  You know, issues.
[01:37:15.487 --> 01:37:17.247]  J6 never really mattered.
[01:37:17.247 --> 01:37:18.548]  Abortion played out.
[01:37:18.548 --> 01:37:20.809]  Climate change is not somebody somebody's going to vote on.
[01:37:20.809 --> 01:37:21.569]  It's crime.
[01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:22.850]  It's inflation.
[01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:25.351]  It's the injection.
[01:37:25.351 --> 01:37:27.572]  That's what's playing on people's minds right now.
[01:37:27.572 --> 01:37:40.818]  They said, and here's the number they gave, they said anything 30 seats and above in the House and any flip of the Senate, and that's why Pennsylvania is so big, that immediately all the House and Senate leadership is going to be broomed immediately.
[01:37:40.818 --> 01:37:43.679]  And that Joe Biden, they're going to force Biden to announce
[01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:51.406]  In like 24, 48 hours, he's not running again for president because this is a repudiation of his presidency.
[01:37:51.406 --> 01:37:55.550]  Look, this shows so much, number one, Owen, you know this, you can do the math.
[01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:59.734]  No regime could have collapsed this quickly when we had no money.
[01:38:00.194 --> 01:38:03.616]  If they actually had 81 million votes the first time around.
[01:38:03.616 --> 01:38:05.778]  This proves the case more than ever.
[01:38:05.778 --> 01:38:07.479]  They didn't win in 2020.
[01:38:07.479 --> 01:38:08.219]  Okay?
[01:38:08.219 --> 01:38:12.862]  What we have to do now is an overwhelming show of force everywhere to converge.
[01:38:12.862 --> 01:38:13.863]  Own your vote.
[01:38:13.863 --> 01:38:14.924]  Get out the vote.
[01:38:14.924 --> 01:38:15.904]  Help get out the vote.
[01:38:15.904 --> 01:38:16.645]  Go volunteer.
[01:38:16.645 --> 01:38:17.646]  Phone bank.
[01:38:17.646 --> 01:38:18.826]  Walker Precinct.
[01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:19.507]  And in addition,
[01:38:20.047 --> 01:38:21.248]  We have to close the deal.
[01:38:21.248 --> 01:38:23.869]  Remember, in 2020, we won, but we didn't close.
[01:38:23.869 --> 01:38:25.810]  And it's like in mergers and acquisitions.
[01:38:25.810 --> 01:38:27.772]  If you don't close the deal, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:27.772 --> 01:38:30.413]  The way we got to close, and we still got the problems with the machines.
[01:38:30.413 --> 01:38:31.154]  I understand that.
[01:38:31.154 --> 01:38:39.078]  And you see the Wall Street Journal today, the op-eds or the editorial page talks about, we still got problems with the mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania.
[01:38:39.078 --> 01:38:40.239]  And these are going to be fights.
[01:38:40.239 --> 01:38:43.821]  But the way you do that, you get into the room and become a poll worker.
[01:38:43.821 --> 01:38:46.002]  This is 100%, Owen, within our hands to grasp.
[01:38:47.663 --> 01:38:48.764]  This will never come again.
[01:38:48.764 --> 01:38:57.128]  We have a unique opportunity to have something like 1932 or right after the Civil War when you have these massive realignments in American politics.
[01:38:57.128 --> 01:39:00.429]  We could blow these people out of the House and the Senate for a decade.
[01:39:00.429 --> 01:39:00.910]  Okay?
[01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:03.611]  If we pick up 40 or 50 seats, that gets us up to what?
[01:39:04.851 --> 01:39:10.534]  260, 270, and those guys below 150, you kill them for a generation because they're going to sit there with no power.
[01:39:10.534 --> 01:39:11.975]  All your great talent is going to leave.
[01:39:11.975 --> 01:39:13.496]  They're not going to sit in D.C.
[01:39:13.496 --> 01:39:15.496]  and just be on a minority in a committee.
[01:39:15.496 --> 01:39:17.537]  It doesn't work like that because you have no power.
[01:39:17.537 --> 01:39:26.662]  This is our opportunity to destroy the groomer party, to destroy the globalist party, to back off their Wall Street and their corporate interest, and to go for it.
[01:39:26.662 --> 01:39:29.003]  So that's why I say everything is the next 13 days, sir.
[01:39:29.443 --> 01:39:37.565]  Well, and I actually want to focus on that cause in the next segment, ending what I believe is the biggest hate group and terror group in American history, the Democrat Party.
[01:39:37.565 --> 01:39:43.767]  But I want to get into that with you on the other side, because I know you've dedicated a lot of your effort and work to that.
[01:39:43.767 --> 01:39:52.469]  But getting back to the vote issue, we spoke in the last segment, Republicans went for about 250 poll watchers in the 2020 presidential election.
[01:39:52.469 --> 01:39:53.170]  They've got over 6,000 now.
[01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:59.753]  We have been seeing the stories about, and of course the liberal media is panicked.
[01:39:59.753 --> 01:40:00.993]  They hate poll watchers.
[01:40:00.993 --> 01:40:03.955]  They don't like people watching the mail-in drop box ballots.
[01:40:03.955 --> 01:40:05.656]  Oh, I wonder why they don't like that.
[01:40:05.656 --> 01:40:07.376]  I think the answer is obvious.
[01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:09.538]  But do you think it's enough?
[01:40:10.538 --> 01:40:12.699]  Do you think it'll back the Democrats off?
[01:40:12.699 --> 01:40:16.180]  Do you think there'll be enough evidence to prove if they do go forward with voter fraud?
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.160]  I mean, there were two stories today.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.321]  Ballots found in Rogue River in Oregon.
[01:40:22.321 --> 01:40:27.163]  Another one here, Georgia mail truck potentially carrying absentee ballots destroyed by fire.
[01:40:27.163 --> 01:40:29.604]  Is this them covering up their crimes?
[01:40:29.604 --> 01:40:30.844]  Is it a coincidence?
[01:40:30.844 --> 01:40:34.085]  I mean, so how do you see that issue solving itself coming up here?
[01:40:34.905 --> 01:40:37.447]  Here's what happened in 2016.
[01:40:37.447 --> 01:40:38.167]  We were prepped.
[01:40:38.167 --> 01:40:40.329]  We were ready to go into court and to fight.
[01:40:40.329 --> 01:40:42.130]  We had people on the ground.
[01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:49.395]  Remember, we won just by 10,000 votes in Michigan, or 10,000 in Wisconsin, 20,000 in Michigan, 40,000 in Pennsylvania.
[01:40:49.395 --> 01:40:52.857]  We were able to fight any kind of protest they had, right?
[01:40:52.857 --> 01:40:54.839]  We were able to close the deal with very thin
[01:40:55.359 --> 01:40:55.780]  I'm good to go.
[01:41:12.196 --> 01:41:16.539]  We can do this because you're quoting stories right there, Owens, of people finding it now.
[01:41:16.539 --> 01:41:23.783]  That's why they're in meltdown with guys in CAMI, by the law, with the open carry in Arizona, total silent citizens.
[01:41:23.783 --> 01:41:26.444]  They're in meltdown, they're in federal court, even as we speak.
[01:41:26.444 --> 01:41:27.925]  They're trying to get that shut down.
[01:41:27.925 --> 01:41:28.245]  Why?
[01:41:28.245 --> 01:41:30.767]  We don't want any more 2,000 mule situation.
[01:41:31.287 --> 01:41:33.949]  That's why the audience, if you see it, report it.
[01:41:33.949 --> 01:41:36.090]  We can't wait till after the fact.
[01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:39.952]  We have to be now to report it all, and you have to be in the counting room.
[01:41:39.952 --> 01:41:43.714]  You have to sit around that green table and argue about every ballot.
[01:41:43.714 --> 01:41:44.895]  That's the way we stop it.
[01:41:44.895 --> 01:41:46.095]  It's not a perfect system.
[01:41:46.095 --> 01:41:48.597]  It worked in the Commonwealth of Virginia with Yunkin.
[01:41:48.597 --> 01:41:49.757]  I think it's going to work now.
[01:41:49.757 --> 01:41:51.818]  We got to outvote the algorithm.
[01:41:51.818 --> 01:41:53.399]  We got to outvote the money.
[01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:55.320]  We got to outvote the corruption and stealing it.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.263]  But with this close away, and I think with every patriot in a counting room, we can pull this off.
[01:42:00.834 --> 01:42:07.660]  You know, and another issue, too, with the early voting, you know, Pennsylvania, I think, has already had early voting for a week or so now.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:11.142]  So people went and voted for Fetterman before seeing that disastrous debate.
[01:42:11.142 --> 01:42:12.223]  They probably regret it.
[01:42:12.223 --> 01:42:15.606]  That's why early voting is a problem, especially before any debates.
[01:42:15.606 --> 01:42:17.928]  But, you know, another thing, I understand why people do early voting.
[01:42:17.928 --> 01:42:19.569]  In fact, I've done early voting myself.
[01:42:19.569 --> 01:42:20.510]  I get it.
[01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:21.951]  Sometimes it's more convenient for you.
[01:42:21.951 --> 01:42:22.752]  Sometimes it's quicker.
[01:42:23.192 --> 01:42:25.834]  But recall this fact, folks.
[01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:33.639]  If they know how many votes are there before Election Day, if somebody wanted to steal it, they'd know how many votes they'd need to steal it.
[01:42:33.639 --> 01:42:35.099]  Do you really want to give them that ammunition?
[01:42:35.099 --> 01:42:46.026]  It might be worth waiting an extra 30 minutes to an hour on Election Day to cast your ballot instead of doing it early and perhaps giving somebody some intel that they might use that day.
[01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:51.850]  Alright, when we come back, I want to talk to Steve Bannon about dedicating his work, which I am in complete agreement with.
[01:42:55.011 --> 01:43:02.134]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[01:43:02.134 --> 01:43:05.255]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[01:43:05.255 --> 01:43:06.036]  Now, I knew that.
[01:43:06.874 --> 01:43:11.137]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[01:43:11.137 --> 01:43:13.598]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[01:43:13.598 --> 01:43:18.421]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.
[01:43:18.421 --> 01:43:25.406]  So please visit InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible, game-changing products, while at the same time keeping us on air.

[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:24.125]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[01:44:24.125 --> 01:44:25.387]  And I need your support.
[01:44:25.387 --> 01:44:32.796]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.

[01:45:18.302 --> 01:45:23.964]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:45:23.964 --> 01:45:27.585]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:45:28.425 --> 01:45:31.530]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:45:31.530 --> 01:45:37.820]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:39.122]  It's unsustainable.
[01:45:39.122 --> 01:45:40.344]  So please, visit.
[01:45:41.411 --> 01:45:43.412]  SaveInfoWars.com.

[01:45:51.516 --> 01:45:54.517]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[01:45:54.517 --> 01:45:55.818]  Thank you for your support.
[01:45:55.818 --> 01:45:56.918]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[01:46:59.409 --> 01:47:04.031]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.031 --> 01:47:18.116]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.116 --> 01:47:22.578]  Steve Bannon is with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.578 --> 01:47:25.479]  And Steve, you have talked about
[01:47:26.576 --> 01:47:35.461]  Dedicating a lot of your work, energy, and time into eradicating this country of the cancer known as the Democrat Party.
[01:47:35.461 --> 01:47:36.801]  We're kindred spirits in that.
[01:47:36.801 --> 01:47:40.623]  I have also basically made a formal announcement of the same thing.
[01:47:40.623 --> 01:47:45.626]  My reasoning being, the Democrat Party formed out of the ashes of the KKK.
[01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:54.471]  It was then resurrected into cultural political power with the violent terrorists of the Weather Underground to now be introduced as the violent
[01:47:55.071 --> 01:48:01.114]  Communistic Democrat Party with the violence of Antifa and BLM that it is today.
[01:48:01.114 --> 01:48:10.740]  And with all of that history behind us, how could we not be looking to eliminate the Democrat Party as a political party from this country?
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:14.162]  You laid out how there's a path to that, specifically in these midterms.
[01:48:14.162 --> 01:48:22.006]  But I ask you, Steve, why would you want to dedicate so much of your work, your time, your effort into destroying the Democrat Party despite what we've seen?
[01:48:22.006 --> 01:48:23.267]  It's already cost you so much.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:28.502]  Well, number one, Owen, you bring up a great point about the Weather Underground.
[01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:32.303]  I come from a working class Irish Democrat family.
[01:48:32.303 --> 01:48:39.045]  I mean, my, from, you know, my dad and my grandfather, everybody were, because the Irish came over here, we were just Democrats by birth.
[01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:42.087]  You didn't even consider voting for a Republican.
[01:48:42.087 --> 01:48:49.329]  Jack Kennedy, I remember my brother says, you know what being a Democrat is when he walked precincts for Adlai Stevenson the second time.
[01:48:49.329 --> 01:48:50.770]  It was just something by culture.
[01:48:50.770 --> 01:48:53.511]  And then the Vietnam War came up and you saw these radicals
[01:48:54.071 --> 01:49:15.552]  At the universities and particularly the weather underground and they were killing police officers and they were, you know, throwing stuff on servicemen coming back and denigrating the service in Vietnam that these young men had never really had had either been drafted or volunteered to went to go to the, you know, for the defense of their country, what they believe was the defense of their country.
[01:49:15.552 --> 01:49:17.033]  And you saw what the Democratic Party did.
[01:49:17.033 --> 01:49:18.074]  And now it's so radical.
[01:49:18.074 --> 01:49:18.835]  This is why Owen.
[01:49:19.415 --> 01:49:24.838]  The win in 2016, I keep telling people because I had a ringside seat for that, it was totally providential.
[01:49:24.838 --> 01:49:36.483]  I mean, we had a plane, we had a candidate, the greatest candidate since Reagan, we had a set of issues, we had a little bit of money but not much, not much organization, it was self-organizing, and we had Hillary Clinton, the globalist.
[01:49:37.043 --> 01:49:38.244]  As the opposition.
[01:49:38.244 --> 01:49:39.844]  It was providential we won.
[01:49:39.844 --> 01:49:44.666]  We saw what going against the administrative and deep state, what President Trump had to fight every day.
[01:49:44.666 --> 01:49:47.888]  Then at 20, the steal was also providential.
[01:49:47.888 --> 01:49:51.669]  Because you saw this is not your father's or grandfather's Democratic Party.
[01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:57.132]  We're not arguing about difference in education policy or difference in marginal tax rates.
[01:49:57.992 --> 01:50:02.135]  You know, you're talking about a radical cultural Marxist.
[01:50:02.135 --> 01:50:10.880]  These people are as radical on the family side and the cultural side as Mao Zedong and the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution or during the French Revolution.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.702]  Their whole purpose is to destroy the nuclear family.
[01:50:13.702 --> 01:50:17.024]  And they're trying to weaponize the kids to do that.
[01:50:17.024 --> 01:50:25.869]  Whether it's gender ideology, CRT, the mass mandates, and particularly that's what they're trying to do with the vaccines, which was your segment before, which quite brilliantly
[01:50:26.349 --> 01:50:29.531]  Talks about the undertones of what this election's about.
[01:50:29.531 --> 01:50:31.712]  In addition, it's a totally globalist party now.
[01:50:31.712 --> 01:50:33.293]  It doesn't represent working class people.
[01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:39.076]  Look, we've shifted the Republican Party in less than 10 years to be a working class, working folks party.
[01:50:39.076 --> 01:50:42.058]  That's why African Americans are not voting for the Democrats.
[01:50:42.058 --> 01:50:43.719]  The Hill newspaper's been all over that.
[01:50:43.719 --> 01:50:47.661]  They've had low turnout in the last couple of days to support Democrats.
[01:50:47.661 --> 01:50:53.204]  Hispanics in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas are now flocking to Republicans like never before.
[01:50:53.564 --> 01:50:58.808]  We have built a working class coalition that is not just populist, it's nationalist.
[01:50:58.808 --> 01:51:00.249]  It believes in the sovereignty of the sky.
[01:51:00.249 --> 01:51:01.670]  It doesn't believe in America as an idea.
[01:51:01.670 --> 01:51:03.832]  It believes in America as a nation.
[01:51:03.832 --> 01:51:10.156]  A nation with borders, a nation with sovereignty, and most important, a nation with American citizens.
[01:51:10.156 --> 01:51:17.462]  And we're prepared to step up whether the enemy is in Davos, whether the enemy is in Brussels, the City of London, Wall Street, or our nation's capital.
[01:51:17.862 --> 01:51:19.383]  Prepare to stand up against it.
[01:51:19.383 --> 01:51:23.744]  And that's why the Democratic Party should go the way of the Whigs before the Civil War.
[01:51:23.744 --> 01:51:36.370]  We need to break the back of the Democratic Party, expose their funding, expose their relationship with corporations, and ultimately explain their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and other influence peddlers from off our shores.
[01:51:36.370 --> 01:51:36.450]  Sir.
[01:51:40.037 --> 01:51:49.706]  Well, and you know, if God is still divinely guiding this nation, and we pray that that's the case, then maybe this was all part of the plan.
[01:51:49.706 --> 01:51:54.971]  Allow the Democrats to steal the 2020 elections to show the people just how bad it really is.
[01:51:54.971 --> 01:52:00.897]  Allow them to show their lust, their desire for power, and then what they'll do with it from the most sordid,
[01:52:01.537 --> 01:52:22.939]  Political, cultural aspects of the Democrat Party ideology of grooming children, calling it trans kids, calling it drag queen stripper time, to the basic economic policies and energy policies that have crippled this nation to the degree of which most people can't even believe it, with record inflation, record gas prices, the consumer price index, the producer price index.
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:25.343]  No, maybe this was all part of the plan.
[01:52:25.343 --> 01:52:28.247]  Yeah, let Biden and the corrupt Biden crime family get up there.
[01:52:28.247 --> 01:52:31.071]  Let them sniff and grope little kids when they come to the White House.
[01:52:31.071 --> 01:52:33.915]  Maybe America really had to see this moment, Steve.
[01:52:33.915 --> 01:52:39.463]  Really had to live in this moment, experience this moment with their own eyes to understand what we need to do to save this country.
[01:52:40.347 --> 01:52:42.588]  Oh, and I think that brings us back to the beginning of the show.
[01:52:42.588 --> 01:52:46.028]  That's why what happened last night in Philadelphia is so important.
[01:52:46.028 --> 01:52:47.089]  It's ironic.
[01:52:47.089 --> 01:52:52.270]  It happened in the birthplace in the Cradle of Liberty, right there near Independence Hall, right?
[01:52:52.270 --> 01:53:03.853]  In the same city where the great documents of the Declaration and the Constitution were negotiated and signed and brought forth that really set up ourselves as the new Jerusalem.
[01:53:04.253 --> 01:53:05.313]  That's what America is.
[01:53:05.313 --> 01:53:09.195]  America is a divinely inspired country and we've got to get back to that.
[01:53:09.195 --> 01:53:10.475]  But we had to fight this battle.
[01:53:10.475 --> 01:53:19.978]  Last night, for the control of the Senate, what could be the whole shooting match, which they're so in, they actually had a cyborg, a man-machine merger up there.
[01:53:19.978 --> 01:53:22.819]  You could see it, and they didn't pull it off.
[01:53:22.819 --> 01:53:26.461]  And that's what I think shocked the Democrat, the operatives in the Democratic Party.
[01:53:26.461 --> 01:53:27.621]  It should shock the nation.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:33.383]  There is nothing too low that these people won't do to maintain power.
[01:53:33.383 --> 01:53:35.004]  That's what we're going to see in the next 13 days.
[01:53:35.004 --> 01:53:38.727]  I mean, Alex has warned us about false flags, cyber attacks, everything.
[01:53:38.727 --> 01:53:40.668]  People have to be on watch.
[01:53:40.668 --> 01:53:42.829]  You have to be focused.
[01:53:42.829 --> 01:53:48.273]  The next 13 days should all be about how we take this country back, and we're taking back at the ballot box.
[01:53:48.273 --> 01:53:54.317]  We have to both show up to get the vote out, and we have to both show up to get it on, and we have to secure it.
[01:53:54.777 --> 01:53:56.497]  Well yeah, you gotta have your head on a swivel.
[01:53:56.497 --> 01:54:00.398]  Democrats are not just going to relinquish this power so easily.
[01:54:00.398 --> 01:54:07.420]  And my biggest fear is they now see the power that they truly desire at an arm's length away.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:13.161]  I'm talking about adding a 51st, 52nd state so they can add their votes in Electoral College, rig it that way.
[01:54:13.161 --> 01:54:16.762]  We're talking about amnesties so they can overwhelm the popular vote as well.
[01:54:17.162 --> 01:54:22.827]  I'm talking about ending the filibuster so there'll be no means of stopping them when they try to write their legislation.
[01:54:22.827 --> 01:54:32.975]  They see all of this right there at an arm's length and that's why I'm afraid the moves that they're going to make here with 13 days left till the midterms are going to be paramount.
[01:54:32.975 --> 01:54:34.316]  But I think people see it.
[01:54:34.316 --> 01:54:35.618]  I mean, I don't know about you, Steve, but...
[01:54:36.418 --> 01:54:43.788]  In my walk of life, when I go around, when I talk to people, random people, strangers, friends, family, I don't know anybody that supports the Democrats right now.
[01:54:43.788 --> 01:54:51.438]  We're talking about lifelong liberals, even Democrat voters, and even they're kind of like, yeah, I don't know if I can support these guys.
[01:54:52.805 --> 01:54:53.445]  I think you're right.
[01:54:53.445 --> 01:55:08.352]  I think, look, they're so over the top with what they've done in destroying the economy, what they've done geopolitically, putting unlimited arms and money into Ukraine and not really paying attention to Taiwan or the South China Sea or the rise of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:55:08.672 --> 01:55:13.437]  You see what they've done to capital markets in this country, whether it's 401Ks or the bond market.
[01:55:13.437 --> 01:55:15.259]  You see what you've done to your income.
[01:55:15.259 --> 01:55:16.400]  You see it across the board.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:29.094]  But the most radical thing they've done, if everything they've done to destroy American life and shut our full spectrum energy dominance, it's what they've done around the family that exposes their true cultural Marxism.
[01:55:29.094 --> 01:55:31.256]  Because this is what the French Revolution wanted to do.
[01:55:31.676 --> 01:55:41.202]  This is what Mao Zedong attempted to do to the Chinese people, to break the back of Lao Baijing, break the back of the family, and weaponize the children against the parents.
[01:55:41.202 --> 01:55:46.085]  You're seeing it all right now in real time, but everybody has an opportunity to stop it.
[01:55:46.085 --> 01:55:49.287]  If we don't stop it now, Owen, it's over.
[01:55:49.287 --> 01:55:53.170]  We have one opportunity, and God has given us this opportunity to find providence.
[01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:57.391]  But Divine Providence works through human agency.
[01:55:57.391 --> 01:56:01.692]  And trust me, Divine Providence works through many imperfect instruments.
[01:56:01.692 --> 01:56:06.794]  Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, your cell phone.
[01:56:06.794 --> 01:56:08.515]  Very imperfect instruments.
[01:56:08.515 --> 01:56:12.916]  But he is definitely working through us, and this is why we have to deliver on November 8th.
[01:56:13.756 --> 01:56:16.677]  I'm starting to get that big game anticipation.
[01:56:16.677 --> 01:56:18.897]  I'm starting to get that big fight feel, folks.
[01:56:18.897 --> 01:56:28.759]  Thirteen days out from the midterms, and look, we're talking about the greatest country in the history of this planet offering the most freedom and prosperity than any other country in known history.
[01:56:28.759 --> 01:56:31.740]  And its future of survival, it all is thirteen days away.
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:32.840]  That's why it's so paramount.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.720]  Steve Bannon, great stuff as always.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.321]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:56:37.321 --> 01:56:38.581]  Owen, thank you so much for having me.
[01:56:38.581 --> 01:56:42.502]  Always an honor to work with you guys at InfraWars, and we always have Alex Jones' back.
[01:56:43.396 --> 01:56:44.537]  We appreciate that, brother.
[01:56:44.537 --> 01:56:45.378]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:45.378 --> 01:56:46.940]  There goes Steve Bannon.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:53.908]  Wow, what a great hour with two great guests here as we conclude our number two of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:53.908 --> 01:56:57.212]  We got another great guest coming up in the next hour, Greg Menino.
[01:56:58.514 --> 01:57:01.719]  Manorino, excuse me, going to be talking about a lot of economic issues.
[01:57:01.719 --> 01:57:04.504]  But ladies and gentlemen, remember, InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:57:29.384 --> 01:57:30.164]  How do I get caught up?

[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:54.703]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[01:57:54.703 --> 01:57:57.626]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced
[01:57:58.337 --> 01:57:58.737]  We're good.
[01:58:14.563 --> 01:58:20.127]  All the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[01:58:20.127 --> 01:58:22.749]  Essential means without these things you die.
[01:58:22.749 --> 01:58:30.834]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[01:58:30.834 --> 01:58:33.076]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[01:59:46.722 --> 01:59:50.163]  Visit InfoWarStore.com right now.
[01:59:50.163 --> 01:59:59.646]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.646 --> 02:00:04.787]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay Sandy Hook victims' families nearly one billion dollars!
[02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:10.750]  A billion dollar verdict.
[02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:14.433]  Almost a billion dollars in damages.
[02:00:14.433 --> 02:00:17.935]  965 million dollars in damages.
[02:00:17.935 --> 02:00:19.056]  965 million dollars.
[02:00:19.056 --> 02:00:21.777]  A billion dollars.
[02:00:21.777 --> 02:00:24.099]  100 billion dollars.
[02:00:24.099 --> 02:00:29.963]  This is actually a larger warning for other liars and conspiracy theorists in our society and our politics.
[02:00:29.963 --> 02:00:35.346]  It's a rebuke and a punishment that we believe, according to a lot of experts, will set this new precedent.
[02:00:35.526 --> 02:00:43.551]  The mother of George Floyd's daughter now filing a $250 million lawsuit against Kanye West.
[02:00:43.551 --> 02:00:48.534]  Kanye West made, quote, false statements about the manner of Floyd's death.
[02:00:48.534 --> 02:00:57.359]  He says the family could sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress, citing the recent Alex Jones trial as an example.
[02:00:57.359 --> 02:01:01.402]  Alex Jones is patient zero.
[02:01:01.402 --> 02:01:02.823]  Take him out.
[02:01:02.823 --> 02:01:03.483]  Now what does this mean?
[02:01:08.368 --> 02:01:11.811]  Lying and conspiracy theories part of their business model or politics.
[02:01:11.811 --> 02:01:14.454]  Fox News is clearly watching this closely.
[02:01:14.454 --> 02:01:20.481]  They are facing this suit by Dominion Voting Systems for over a billion dollars.
[02:01:20.481 --> 02:01:22.002]  You heard that right!
[02:01:22.002 --> 02:01:23.604]  Billion with a capital BYE!
[02:01:26.536 --> 02:01:27.758]  This is not a trial.
[02:01:27.758 --> 02:01:30.361]  There was no jury trial in this case.
[02:01:30.361 --> 02:01:31.483]  No judge in U.S.
[02:01:31.483 --> 02:01:34.547]  history has ever told somebody what they can and can't say.
[02:01:34.547 --> 02:01:37.350]  Everybody knows you're supposed to get your day in court.
[02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:41.356]  Yet the one person who is being denied any day in court is Alex Jones.
[02:01:41.596 --> 02:01:42.998]  Alex Jones didn't kill anybody.
[02:01:42.998 --> 02:01:59.820]  You were clear that you had a change of heart, or you believed that you were wrong, or you believed you made a mistake, which I think is admirable, and I think the fact that they want to browbeat you after that is what is so scary, and I think that people out here would do well, if you're watching, to understand that apologies do nothing with these monsters.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:05.623]  The whole purpose of the First Amendment is to keep the government the hell out of the business of speech.
[02:02:05.623 --> 02:02:12.427]  Totally disregarded by the Connecticut courts when they decided to write their Alex Jones rule.
[02:02:12.427 --> 02:02:19.731]  This judge, Barbara Nellis, is a disgrace to the rule of law, a disgrace to the judiciary, a disgrace to the justice system.
[02:02:19.731 --> 02:02:22.013]  So the regime has come for Alex Jones.
[02:02:22.013 --> 02:02:24.154]  They always start with Alex Jones when it comes to these things.
[02:02:24.454 --> 02:02:30.615]  You don't have to be an Alex Jones fan to understand that he is most definitely being made an example of.
[02:02:30.615 --> 02:02:39.778]  The law industrial complex in collusion with the media can work in harmony to completely obliterate somebody financially.
[02:02:39.778 --> 02:02:48.540]  That's a billion dollars for expressing an opinion which under the prevailing Supreme Court case law is absolutely protected.
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:54.241]  The question is do they really care about what Alex Jones said or do they want to destroy
[02:02:54.241 --> 02:02:55.342]  I believe that the First Amendment
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.761]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:03:08.761 --> 02:03:10.801]  Most countries don't have that.
[02:03:10.801 --> 02:03:13.983]  I think the United States is the only country that has this, right?
[02:03:13.983 --> 02:03:16.784]  This enshrined freedom of speech in our highest law.
[02:03:30.769 --> 02:03:31.990]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:13.944]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:04:13.944 --> 02:04:18.546]  If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like Jason Adderley's boy.
[02:04:18.546 --> 02:04:21.106]  Deal me out this hand, Jason.
[02:04:21.106 --> 02:04:22.987]  I'm about to bust.
[02:04:22.987 --> 02:04:25.248]  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the bathroom.
[02:04:25.248 --> 02:04:26.148]  Oh, good lord!
[02:04:28.331 --> 02:04:28.832]  Scanning.
[02:04:28.832 --> 02:04:31.114]  Control.
[02:04:31.114 --> 02:04:33.256]  Manipulate scientific data.
[02:04:33.256 --> 02:04:33.816]  Take over.
[02:04:33.816 --> 02:04:34.176]  Blast.
[02:04:34.176 --> 02:04:34.697]  Control.
[02:04:34.697 --> 02:04:35.898]  World government.
[02:04:35.898 --> 02:04:37.139]  Shut down infrastructure.
[02:04:37.139 --> 02:04:40.082]  Give everything to China.
[02:04:40.082 --> 02:04:44.666]  Look at this person.
[02:04:44.666 --> 02:04:49.751]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:04:58.151 --> 02:05:04.202]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:05:04.202 --> 02:05:07.327]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[02:05:08.404 --> 02:05:13.306]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:05:13.306 --> 02:05:16.847]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[02:05:16.847 --> 02:05:17.688]  It's game over.
[02:05:17.688 --> 02:05:23.390]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:27.992]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:05:27.992 --> 02:05:34.134]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[02:05:34.614 --> 02:05:46.597]  And that's why when you go to Infowarsstore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[02:05:46.597 --> 02:05:52.719]  The fight starts at Infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:52.719 --> 02:05:54.519]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[02:06:03.402 --> 02:06:07.750]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:12.439]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:12.439 --> 02:06:15.384]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:26.144 --> 02:06:39.391]  We are now joined by Greg Manarino, traderschoice.net, and we will be getting into the economic news with him and Greg.
[02:06:39.391 --> 02:06:46.315]  You know, even let's say we try to put politics aside when we have these discussions about where the U.S.
[02:06:46.315 --> 02:06:48.456]  economy is or where it's going.
[02:06:49.704 --> 02:06:52.044]  You try to put politics aside.
[02:06:52.044 --> 02:06:56.885]  Is it not just a universal fact that the U.S.
[02:06:56.885 --> 02:07:06.427]  economy has gotten drastically worse in the last two years with all the things we've seen like inflation, producer price, consumer price?
[02:07:06.427 --> 02:07:08.028]  Again, remove the politics.
[02:07:08.028 --> 02:07:10.948]  You can sit here and point at one side or the other.
[02:07:10.948 --> 02:07:12.869]  That can flesh itself out.
[02:07:12.869 --> 02:07:15.809]  But, you know, some people act like that's not even happening.
[02:07:15.809 --> 02:07:17.630]  What is the true state of the U.S.
[02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:18.850]  economy right now?
[02:07:19.771 --> 02:07:23.894]  It's a complete disaster area.
[02:07:23.894 --> 02:07:28.558]  It couldn't possibly be worse, but I can promise you this, it's going to get much, much worse.
[02:07:28.558 --> 02:07:33.421]  This is going to get very, very real for people.
[02:07:33.421 --> 02:07:40.047]  People honestly have no clue as to what is going on, why it's happening to them, the lies, the distractions, the propaganda.
[02:07:40.687 --> 02:07:46.231]  From the mainstream, what do we want to call these things here?
[02:07:46.231 --> 02:07:51.954]  They're nothing to me, but some kind of a mind twisting program.
[02:07:51.954 --> 02:07:58.778]  That's all they do here is try to convince people that what they're seeing is not real.
[02:07:58.778 --> 02:07:59.739]  Now this issue
[02:08:00.499 --> 02:08:03.781]  Clearly, you understand it just by listening to your statement here.
[02:08:03.781 --> 02:08:05.221]  Yeah, it's over here.
[02:08:05.221 --> 02:08:10.544]  The United States economy is in collapse, along with the rest of the world here.
[02:08:10.544 --> 02:08:13.805]  And I don't think it's getting the attention that it deserves here.
[02:08:13.805 --> 02:08:15.206]  We have a major issue.
[02:08:15.726 --> 02:08:36.705]  And I've been trying for a very long time, years, many years as a matter of fact, to try to raise awareness here that central banks are pushing the world into a global, forget about a depression, we're talking about a meltdown in the debt market that very few people on the planet are prepared for.
[02:08:36.705 --> 02:08:39.307]  Let me show you this real quick for everyone that's watching.
[02:08:39.307 --> 02:08:41.890]  This is a headline from Bank of America.
[02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:47.432]  This just came out a couple of days ago that explains what I've been covering for years.
[02:08:47.432 --> 02:08:58.196]  That is that the debt market is a clear and present danger and a meltdown here in the global debt market is going to bring the financial system to its knees by design.
[02:08:58.196 --> 02:08:59.657]  This is what central banks are doing here.
[02:09:00.117 --> 02:09:03.659]  They're deliberately inflating, they're going out of their way to create inflation.
[02:09:03.659 --> 02:09:08.461]  Meanwhile, they are lying to everyone, trying to say, hey, this is a rate problem.
[02:09:08.461 --> 02:09:09.802]  It has nothing to do with rates.
[02:09:09.802 --> 02:09:15.624]  Anyone that follows my work knew from day one, Federal Reserve, Central Bank are going to raise rates.
[02:09:15.624 --> 02:09:17.045]  Oh yeah, they're going to fight inflation.
[02:09:17.045 --> 02:09:20.647]  I said it would not work because this is not a rate problem.
[02:09:20.647 --> 02:09:23.568]  I said they could raise rates until kingdom come.
[02:09:23.568 --> 02:09:24.348]  It's not the issue.
[02:09:24.348 --> 02:09:25.109]  The issue here is a
[02:09:28.763 --> 02:09:34.429]  Central banks around the world are on a mission to destroy their own currencies and to destroy the people along with it.
[02:09:34.429 --> 02:09:43.038]  The root cause of surging inflation globally, not just here in the United States, is the fact that currencies are dying.
[02:09:43.038 --> 02:09:45.000]  It has nothing to do with rates.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.186]  If central banks, for example, really wanted to slow down inflation, what would they have been doing?
[02:09:51.147 --> 02:09:56.257]  For months now, we've been hearing about, okay, we're going to, you know, raise the federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate.
[02:09:56.257 --> 02:09:59.723]  This is what central banks have been doing month after month.
[02:09:59.723 --> 02:10:00.705]  No result.
[02:10:00.705 --> 02:10:02.368]  Okay, imagine my shock here.
[02:10:03.192 --> 02:10:04.573]  Okay.
[02:10:04.573 --> 02:10:09.558]  The issue is a ballooning, hyper-ballooning money supply issue.
[02:10:09.558 --> 02:10:14.782]  Now, central banks can actually do something about this if they really want to, but they're not concerned at all.
[02:10:14.782 --> 02:10:21.288]  What they could do is have the commercial banks here raise their capital requirements from zero.
[02:10:21.288 --> 02:10:29.575]  In other words, the capital they're supposed to hold in reserve, and that would contract the money supply, and we would see inflation abate very rapidly, but no.
[02:10:30.115 --> 02:10:32.156]  Central banks are in collusion with each other.
[02:10:32.156 --> 02:10:34.137]  This is the real issue here.
[02:10:34.137 --> 02:10:37.818]  Central banks around the world are crushing the global economy.
[02:10:37.818 --> 02:10:47.603]  I mean, honestly, anyone who has taken Economics 101 realizes that a central bank raises rates to do one thing, to crush demand.
[02:10:47.603 --> 02:10:55.346]  It has nothing to do with inflation, but people are being duped, as they always are, by the mainstream propaganda ministry, and they're out of control right now.
[02:10:55.746 --> 02:10:56.767]  So, absolutely.
[02:10:56.767 --> 02:11:02.272]  We have an economy in free fall and we haven't seen exactly a damn thing yet.
[02:11:02.272 --> 02:11:05.174]  This is going to get very real, very fast.
[02:11:05.174 --> 02:11:16.804]  What is going to, what we're on the cusp of here, I mean, just, you know, looking at headlines like this one from Bank of America is a meltdown in the global debt market.
[02:11:16.804 --> 02:11:20.607]  And what people don't realize, you know, everyone's looking over here at the stock market, okay?
[02:11:20.607 --> 02:11:23.770]  The stock market is not an independent entity of itself.
[02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:31.692]  The stock market as itself and globally derives value from what's happening in the debt market.
[02:11:31.692 --> 02:11:36.953]  So the global equity markets are derivatives as to what is happening in the debt market.
[02:11:36.953 --> 02:11:42.654]  Now, we are existing underneath a Frankenstein monster that is this global debt bubble.
[02:11:42.654 --> 02:11:43.615]  It's going to burst.
[02:11:43.615 --> 02:11:45.095]  And when it bursts here,
[02:11:45.995 --> 02:11:48.737]  Like I said, it's going to change everything.
[02:11:48.737 --> 02:11:51.578]  The economies of the world are going to lock up.
[02:11:51.578 --> 02:11:53.179]  In other words, there'll be no transactions.
[02:11:53.179 --> 02:11:56.461]  Once the debt bubble pops, what do we have at its core here?
[02:11:56.461 --> 02:12:02.004]  What we have is, on top of all that, yeah, is a debt-based economic model.
[02:12:02.004 --> 02:12:02.645]  What does that mean?
[02:12:02.645 --> 02:12:03.665]  That means that every
[02:12:05.326 --> 02:12:12.052]  Conceivable idea, reason to pull cash into the now from the future is going to be created.
[02:12:12.052 --> 02:12:21.561]  Wars, expanding wars, this app, that policy, whatever they got to do to continue to pull cash into the now and allow central banks to continue to inflate.
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:25.522]  Central Bank resides in one thing.
[02:12:25.522 --> 02:12:27.463]  That is their ability to inflate.
[02:12:27.463 --> 02:12:32.767]  If we can take that power away, and we can do it in a nanosecond, I'll outline that in a second, we win.
[02:12:32.767 --> 02:12:34.008]  Otherwise, we all lose.
[02:12:34.008 --> 02:12:40.874]  We live under the rule and guide of central banks who run the economy and they run the financial system.
[02:12:40.874 --> 02:12:42.455]  You want to take down a central bank?
[02:12:42.455 --> 02:12:44.137]  I'll tell everyone how to do it right now, real simple.
[02:12:44.557 --> 02:12:47.880]  Prevent them from issuing one single dollar of new debt.
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:53.524]  If we could prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing one dollar, just one, of debt, they implode.
[02:12:53.524 --> 02:12:55.105]  We take back the system.
[02:12:55.105 --> 02:12:57.507]  But you see, people are being distracted.
[02:12:57.507 --> 02:13:03.592]  They're not being told the truth that central banks, especially the Federal Reserve here, get from George Gammon.
[02:13:04.292 --> 02:13:06.613]  Public enemy number one.
[02:13:06.613 --> 02:13:17.635]  Okay, we need to end this organization and central banks who are a curse on the world and they are driving the world and its people off of a cliff here very very rapidly.
[02:13:17.635 --> 02:13:23.636]  So that's where we stand, that's where we're going and I hope people are ready for what's coming because I don't think they are.
[02:13:23.636 --> 02:13:29.518]  Well and here's where I kind of see it going and maybe it's both aspects of this or maybe it's one.
[02:13:29.518 --> 02:13:30.458]  You know when they talk about
[02:13:31.593 --> 02:13:37.099]  House prices are going down and some people are celebrating this like, oh well, maybe I can afford a house again now.
[02:13:37.099 --> 02:13:42.124]  And they don't even realize, well you just went from a 2% interest rate to a 6.5% interest rate.
[02:13:42.124 --> 02:13:44.847]  You're actually paying the same price for the house.
[02:13:44.847 --> 02:13:47.350]  It's just a different number, but it's the same price.
[02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:48.591]  They just haven't realized it yet.
[02:13:49.706 --> 02:14:11.264]  But when you talk about the debt bubble and raising rates, so okay, when they raise the rates, how much of that is for say, let's say personal gain, or they're trying to make up their own margins, versus how much of that is to actually collapse the whole thing to centralize the currencies on the planet, or is it both?
[02:14:11.264 --> 02:14:11.765]  What do you think?
[02:14:12.825 --> 02:14:13.626]  Absolutely.
[02:14:13.626 --> 02:14:23.797]  What their goal is here is very simple, and I've been outlining this for probably almost an entire decade, is a move to a completely new system.
[02:14:23.797 --> 02:14:28.602]  Absolutely digital, full control, and that's really what's behind this entire thing here.
[02:14:29.422 --> 02:14:35.685]  And I'm glad you brought up the issue with housing, and most people have no idea of what you just covered just real quick.
[02:14:35.685 --> 02:14:37.185]  And let me just follow that up with this.
[02:14:37.185 --> 02:14:45.008]  Despite the fact that we're seeing this issue here with home prices falling, home affordability is at a record low.
[02:14:45.008 --> 02:14:46.689]  People are being destroyed.
[02:14:46.689 --> 02:14:47.809]  They're being wiped out.
[02:14:47.809 --> 02:14:52.011]  This is an experimentation of an entire class of people on a global level.
[02:14:52.011 --> 02:14:57.013]  We're talking about the middle class, a warning I have been screaming from rooftops about for probably a decade.
[02:14:57.746 --> 02:15:00.547]  And it's getting very real, very fast.
[02:15:00.547 --> 02:15:02.308]  But you know what bothers me?
[02:15:02.308 --> 02:15:03.588]  I don't see the protests.
[02:15:03.588 --> 02:15:05.129]  I don't see anyone in the streets.
[02:15:05.129 --> 02:15:08.931]  They're being distracted, they're being propagandized, they're being lied to and deceived.
[02:15:08.931 --> 02:15:10.651]  And that's really the game.
[02:15:10.651 --> 02:15:13.572]  Keep people in some kind of state of learned helplessness.
[02:15:13.572 --> 02:15:17.394]  They feel like they can't do anything, so they throw up their arms and they surrender.
[02:15:17.394 --> 02:15:21.296]  And then, of course, they're told where to look, what to do, who to love, who to hate.
[02:15:21.296 --> 02:15:24.757]  People's lives are dictated, literally, by the mainstream propaganda.
[02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:28.752]  Well that's the big issue as we go to break here that I was going to bring up.
[02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:35.594]  I mean, we can inject the politics or remove the politics, but the story is still going to be the same.
[02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:45.202]  The mainstream media is protecting the Biden administration right now by not telling you how bad the economy really is.
[02:15:45.202 --> 02:15:53.169]  And it's a direct protection of the Biden administration because they're trying to point the finger at Donald Trump and Republicans and say they're to blame for the economy.
[02:15:53.169 --> 02:15:55.932]  Vote Democrat in November when that's not the truth.
[02:15:57.526 --> 02:16:08.775]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:16:08.775 --> 02:16:10.676]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:16:10.676 --> 02:16:12.137]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:16:12.137 --> 02:16:13.638]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:16:13.638 --> 02:16:15.340]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:16.621]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:16:16.621 --> 02:16:18.022]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:16:18.442 --> 02:16:23.286]  I studied The Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:16:23.286 --> 02:16:25.668]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:16:25.668 --> 02:16:27.690]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:34.636]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to The Globalist agenda.
[02:16:35.276 --> 02:16:40.658]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.

[02:17:11.849 --> 02:17:28.076]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[02:17:28.076 --> 02:17:30.978]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[02:17:31.889 --> 02:17:38.475]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[02:17:38.475 --> 02:17:40.177]  I don't take the credit.
[02:17:40.177 --> 02:17:41.878]  I give you the credit.
[02:17:41.878 --> 02:17:44.500]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:46.102]  It isn't going to give up.
[02:17:46.102 --> 02:17:47.943]  Without your support we can be shut down.

[02:17:59.863 --> 02:18:01.445]  It's the bad halogen.
[02:18:01.445 --> 02:18:05.289]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[02:18:05.289 --> 02:18:06.970]  What's the good halogen?
[02:18:06.970 --> 02:18:09.793]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[02:18:57.210 --> 02:19:09.959]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[02:19:09.959 --> 02:19:13.181]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.

[02:19:58.193 --> 02:20:04.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.333 --> 02:20:26.995]  Greg Mandarino, our guest.
[02:20:26.995 --> 02:20:31.460]  TradersChoice.net is his website.
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:35.866]  So, the news we're discussing here, the economic news, is really not debatable.
[02:20:36.923 --> 02:20:39.825]  But why don't you see it in mainstream news?
[02:20:39.825 --> 02:20:41.146]  Why isn't it on the nightly news?
[02:20:41.146 --> 02:20:42.547]  Why isn't it in the weekend reports?
[02:20:42.547 --> 02:20:51.354]  Well, because there is an agenda right now to protect the Biden administration ahead of the midterms, and they don't want any bad economic news out there.
[02:20:51.354 --> 02:21:01.521]  But Greg, no matter how much mainstream media protection of the Biden administration in regards to this news there is, it doesn't change the reality of the situation.
[02:21:01.521 --> 02:21:05.584]  Why is there this blind spot from the American media
[02:21:06.570 --> 02:21:12.012]  That, oh, if we just ignore this to protect our political allies, then we'll just be fine.
[02:21:12.012 --> 02:21:19.076]  No, you can ignore the tidal wave, you can ignore the shark about to bite your leg off, it's still going to bite your leg off.
[02:21:19.076 --> 02:21:25.058]  Where is this mentality of, oh, let's just kick this can down the road or ignore it, it won't affect us?
[02:21:25.058 --> 02:21:30.821]  Well, you know, look, I think it's very simple for the mainstream media to keep people in the dark.
[02:21:31.483 --> 02:21:34.285]  To not allow people to understand what's really happening.
[02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:42.709]  And then what they do, it's an incredible thing, seriously, is they tell people that what they're seeing with their own eyes isn't real.
[02:21:42.709 --> 02:21:44.370]  It's an incredible phenomenon.
[02:21:44.370 --> 02:21:49.113]  They're trying to push this already with downplaying inflation.
[02:21:49.113 --> 02:21:49.413]  Okay.
[02:21:49.413 --> 02:21:50.794]  Oh, central banks are fighting it.
[02:21:50.794 --> 02:21:51.894]  Oh, it's getting better.
[02:21:51.894 --> 02:21:52.235]  Really?
[02:21:52.235 --> 02:21:53.896]  I don't see that at all.
[02:21:53.896 --> 02:21:54.316]  But this is
[02:21:55.131 --> 02:21:56.232]  They're their M.O.
[02:21:56.232 --> 02:22:01.456]  constantly to deflect, to tell you, oh, no, that's not really what's happening.
[02:22:01.456 --> 02:22:03.678]  I don't care what you think you're seeing.
[02:22:03.678 --> 02:22:04.538]  It's not true.
[02:22:04.538 --> 02:22:06.820]  This is what's going on.
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:08.421]  And that's what they always do.
[02:22:08.421 --> 02:22:11.464]  You see, it's it's just part of the game that they play.
[02:22:11.464 --> 02:22:17.108]  And unfortunately, they have huge, huge audiences of people who are being literally programmed.
[02:22:17.108 --> 02:22:19.090]  OK, henceforth, why these are called programs.
[02:22:19.090 --> 02:22:21.271]  And I call it to tell live vision here.
[02:22:21.271 --> 02:22:24.154]  People sit there and they allow themselves
[02:22:24.694 --> 02:22:30.501]  To be kind of brainwashed into whatever the mainstream media wants to sell them.
[02:22:30.501 --> 02:22:32.143]  This is just a game.
[02:22:32.143 --> 02:22:41.875]  The mainstream media's goal is to twist people's minds, get them to focus on some nonsensical things so they can pull off whatever they want on the other side.
[02:22:41.875 --> 02:22:42.857]  Look, we all know
[02:22:43.277 --> 02:22:46.759]  That the mainstream media outlets, all of them, are controlled.
[02:22:46.759 --> 02:22:49.221]  They all talk about the same things.
[02:22:49.221 --> 02:22:49.561]  Really?
[02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:50.922]  Isn't that kind of shocking?
[02:22:50.922 --> 02:23:00.207]  That every single mainstream media outlet will have you look over here while something else is going on, talking about the same stories, the same kind of guests repeating the same stories.
[02:23:00.207 --> 02:23:01.808]  They'll never have a guy like me on.
[02:23:02.228 --> 02:23:11.537]  If I were to go on any one of these financial channels, I mean, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves here because I'm telling people how it's really working and people can see this for themselves.
[02:23:11.537 --> 02:23:13.239]  People know the truth when they hear it.
[02:23:13.239 --> 02:23:14.800]  It's not that hard to understand.
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.761]  But that's what they do.
[02:23:15.761 --> 02:23:17.142]  It's always a deception.
[02:23:17.142 --> 02:23:18.203]  It's a distraction.
[02:23:18.203 --> 02:23:23.508]  These people are there reading a script, unlike you and I. You and I, we're just going for it right here.
[02:23:23.508 --> 02:23:27.012]  We're telling people what's on our minds and people know that it's real.
[02:23:27.512 --> 02:23:34.579]  But when you've got these mainstream media commentators reading some kind of nonsense script fed to them, well, you know what?
[02:23:34.579 --> 02:23:41.225]  Look, they're out there to do one thing, to dupe people, to convince them that things are better than they are.
[02:23:41.225 --> 02:23:48.051]  And of course, that, you know, the administration here has and everybody has their best interest in mind here.
[02:23:48.051 --> 02:23:49.492]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:23:49.492 --> 02:23:51.234]  There is an agenda going on here.
[02:23:51.234 --> 02:23:53.916]  And I personally believe it all stems from central banks who control
[02:23:53.916 --> 02:23:54.216]  I don't know.
[02:24:20.691 --> 02:24:21.351]  It's pretty bad.
[02:24:49.645 --> 02:24:53.526]  And of course, you know, we've been hearing about the debt bubble for a while.
[02:24:53.526 --> 02:24:55.667]  You know, Donald Trump didn't really help it very much.
[02:24:55.667 --> 02:25:02.949]  If anything, he was, quite frankly, one of the worst for it as far as printing money and adding money and inflating the debt bubble is concerned.
[02:25:02.949 --> 02:25:14.653]  Now, the Biden administration is claiming, they're claiming that they're actually now in a, they have it at a deficit now and they're not spending money.
[02:25:14.653 --> 02:25:16.293]  Okay, well yeah, you react to that.
[02:25:16.293 --> 02:25:19.234]  Joe Biden and the Democrats claim that spending is at a deficit now.
[02:25:20.242 --> 02:25:22.604]  No, it's an absolute joke.
[02:25:22.604 --> 02:25:29.209]  Joe Biden-Stein, I call him Biden-Stein like Frankenstein or mummy man because he looks like the freaking mummy to me.
[02:25:29.209 --> 02:25:30.610]  He really does.
[02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:34.212]  You know, look, the man, he can't walk and chew gum at the same time.
[02:25:34.212 --> 02:25:36.594]  I think that's pretty obvious to most people right now.
[02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:37.215]  Okay.
[02:25:37.215 --> 02:25:45.441]  But the fact of the matter is, you see, look, what the people can't be told is the fact that we have a debt-based economic model.
[02:25:45.441 --> 02:25:46.041]  Okay, that's it.
[02:25:46.041 --> 02:25:46.702]  At its core,
[02:25:47.282 --> 02:25:52.586]  This whole thing, every developed nation has a debt-based economic model, meaning the debt must inflate.
[02:25:52.586 --> 02:25:53.486]  It can't stop.
[02:25:53.486 --> 02:25:56.948]  The moment it stops inflating, we implode here.
[02:25:56.948 --> 02:26:03.052]  And, you know, yes, the fact is that what you said about Donald Trump is correct, but at the same time, look at every other president.
[02:26:03.052 --> 02:26:04.353]  They do the same thing.
[02:26:04.353 --> 02:26:12.138]  They must, what presidents cannot tell people... Well, Sharon, that's what I'm saying is Biden is claiming, let me correct myself, Biden is claiming they're not running at a deficit.
[02:26:12.138 --> 02:26:14.740]  Biden is claiming that in his years they have cut the deficit.
[02:26:15.546 --> 02:26:17.928]  Yeah, how about his other lie that we're not having inflation?
[02:26:17.928 --> 02:26:18.929]  Did you hear that one?
[02:26:18.929 --> 02:26:20.250]  Inflation is zero!
[02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:22.852]  It doesn't even exist!
[02:26:22.852 --> 02:26:24.794]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:26:24.794 --> 02:26:26.495]  It's impossible to do.
[02:26:26.495 --> 02:26:29.018]  But every president must outspend the last president.
[02:26:29.018 --> 02:26:31.300]  The debt must rise exponentially.
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:32.661]  It can't stop.
[02:26:32.661 --> 02:26:43.150]  If we had one fearless leader that would tell people the truth, that this debt-based economic model is a curse upon the world, and because of that, this is why we have wars, expanding wars,
[02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:46.312]  Things like the Inflation Reduction Act?
[02:26:46.312 --> 02:26:46.912]  Really?
[02:26:46.912 --> 02:26:51.735]  So let's see, we're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars and that's going to reduce inflation?
[02:26:51.735 --> 02:26:54.537]  Oh, why don't we just spend five trillion dollars and then we'll go to zero?
[02:26:54.537 --> 02:26:55.978]  But there is no inflation though.
[02:26:55.978 --> 02:27:01.862]  They tell you there is no inflation, but we need to sign the Inflation Reduction Act to stop the inflation that doesn't exist.
[02:27:03.892 --> 02:27:04.572]  I love that.
[02:27:04.572 --> 02:27:08.134]  You see that this is exactly what I'm talking about, what you just said.
[02:27:08.134 --> 02:27:09.394]  It's just so in our face.
[02:27:09.394 --> 02:27:15.436]  But look, we can expect, unfortunately, that the lies, the propaganda and the distractions to get worse.
[02:27:15.436 --> 02:27:21.898]  Right now, unfortunately, we do have an economy that is, it couldn't be worse off, in my opinion here.
[02:27:21.898 --> 02:27:25.359]  People are getting crushed under surging inflation with no end in sight.
[02:27:25.359 --> 02:27:27.499]  And there's no help coming here.
[02:27:27.499 --> 02:27:29.340]  It's only going to get worse.
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:29.800]  Although,
[02:27:30.895 --> 02:27:31.876]  What's the media going to do?
[02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:33.338]  They're going to tell you it's not happening.
[02:27:33.338 --> 02:27:34.259]  This is not happening.
[02:27:34.259 --> 02:27:38.623]  They're going to convince you, or try at least, to convince some people that what they're seeing is not real.
[02:27:38.623 --> 02:27:39.644]  It's always the same story.
[02:27:39.644 --> 02:27:40.825]  It's pretty insane.
[02:27:40.825 --> 02:27:44.829]  Alright, we've got Greg Manarino with us here.
[02:27:44.829 --> 02:27:50.915]  When we come back, I want to ask him what winners are doing right now, if there's any winners in this economic...
[02:27:52.227 --> 02:27:52.447]  I think so.
[02:28:19.454 --> 02:28:31.216]  If you're a parent out there and you've got kids at home and you don't like them drinking the processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup drinks, artificial flavor drinks, take those out of the fridge.
[02:28:32.344 --> 02:28:35.205]  Make a nice pitcher of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:28:35.205 --> 02:28:36.786]  You can mix it with juice or whatever.
[02:28:36.786 --> 02:28:39.767]  Get it nice to where they'll like the flavor and have them drinking that.
[02:28:39.767 --> 02:28:41.088]  It'll be healthy for them.
[02:28:41.088 --> 02:28:49.851]  They won't be getting all that processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and all the other bad ingredients that come in the canned sodas and the fake fruit drinks.

[02:32:58.504 --> 02:33:03.107]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.

[02:33:15.814 --> 02:33:18.055]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.

[02:33:40.989 --> 02:33:45.812]  And Greg, I ask you this now.
[02:33:45.812 --> 02:33:46.972]  What are the winners doing?
[02:33:46.972 --> 02:33:49.413]  There's always winners during economic crisis.
[02:33:49.413 --> 02:33:52.435]  There's always winners during economic downturns.
[02:33:52.435 --> 02:33:54.096]  Usually it's the one causing it.
[02:33:54.096 --> 02:33:58.778]  But there are others out there that know how to win in these markets as well.
[02:33:58.778 --> 02:34:03.600]  What are the winners doing right now with all the economic volatility and instability?
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:04.461]  Greg Manarino.
[02:34:05.729 --> 02:34:07.750]  Well, it's pretty simple in my book.
[02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:09.671]  It's something I've been talking about for many, many years.
[02:34:09.671 --> 02:34:11.952]  What do we realize the problem is?
[02:34:11.952 --> 02:34:19.275]  From a financial standpoint, looking at the global situation and understanding that central banks are not going to stop.
[02:34:19.275 --> 02:34:21.155]  They're on a mission here to inflate.
[02:34:21.155 --> 02:34:22.576]  They're going to continue to inflate.
[02:34:23.634 --> 02:34:24.315]  I think?
[02:34:44.787 --> 02:34:45.467]  Thank you very much.
[02:35:02.172 --> 02:35:04.773]  This is physical silver, all right?
[02:35:04.773 --> 02:35:13.096]  Physical gold and physical silver, in my view, they've only been real money for thousands and thousands of years.
[02:35:13.096 --> 02:35:19.439]  And when you have a central banker like Ben Bernanke tell you that these are not real money, you know, of course, the polar opposite is true.
[02:35:19.439 --> 02:35:24.761]  So, how this is going to play out is very simple, and there's no guesswork involved here.
[02:35:24.761 --> 02:35:29.503]  Okay, we have a situation where the global debt is inflating at a staggering pace here.
[02:35:30.263 --> 02:35:30.783]  I think so.
[02:35:45.596 --> 02:35:47.857]  And that's just the way it's going to play out.
[02:35:47.857 --> 02:35:51.298]  Unfortunately, we're seeing an elimination of a class of people.
[02:35:51.298 --> 02:35:53.939]  Their wealth is being stolen on an unprecedented scale.
[02:35:53.939 --> 02:36:00.882]  It's been going on since the meltdown of 2008 when the Fed jumped in here, started buying all the debt, keeping rates suppressed.
[02:36:00.882 --> 02:36:02.142]  You have an interest-earning account.
[02:36:02.142 --> 02:36:04.943]  Even today, you're being robbed blind.
[02:36:04.943 --> 02:36:07.824]  Okay, so people are not being allowed to make any money in the market.
[02:36:07.824 --> 02:36:09.025]  So what are you going to do?
[02:36:09.025 --> 02:36:12.286]  If we realize that ultimately this whole thing is going to implode,
[02:36:16.018 --> 02:36:16.459]  We're good to go.
[02:36:33.317 --> 02:36:33.997]  Okay.
[02:36:33.997 --> 02:36:39.799]  With regard to that, you will see why I say, and I've been telling people for years, that physical silver is the most undivided asset on the earth.
[02:36:39.799 --> 02:36:41.520]  I don't sell this stuff.
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.841]  I just believe that this is how people can protect their wealth in a meltdown, which is going to occur in the debt market.
[02:36:46.841 --> 02:36:49.022]  Look, everyone's fixated on the stock market.
[02:36:49.022 --> 02:36:50.263]  There's a reason for that.
[02:36:50.263 --> 02:36:56.205]  You've got the mainstream financial channels telling people, look, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 30 companies, that's all.
[02:36:56.205 --> 02:36:58.465]  But the driver here remains the debt market here.
[02:36:58.465 --> 02:37:00.266]  We've been seeing all this instability lately.
[02:37:00.966 --> 02:37:15.873]  But this did turn around on Friday when they floated out the Fed whisperer to say come December the Fed may pivot and start scaling back their aggressive rate-raising stance, which has done nothing to stop inflation.
[02:37:15.873 --> 02:37:22.476]  But the endgame is very simple, an implosion of the financial system on an unprecedented scale globally, and that will cause
[02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:23.713]  I think so.
[02:37:40.566 --> 02:37:44.448]  You know, cash doesn't grow little wings and fly away to money heaven.
[02:37:44.448 --> 02:37:46.949]  It just moves from one reality into another.
[02:37:46.949 --> 02:37:55.354]  So in my view, understanding that the debt market is the biggest bubble in the world and the greatest threat to humankind, bar none, as a clear and present danger here,
[02:37:57.194 --> 02:38:04.296]  When this debt market bubble implodes, we're going to have a resource problem on an unbelievable scale.
[02:38:04.296 --> 02:38:09.118]  Pandemonium industries are locking up of the financial system.
[02:38:09.118 --> 02:38:12.338]  That will force people to take to the streets, of course.
[02:38:12.338 --> 02:38:18.700]  Then you're going to get the same people that you alluded to, who created the problem, are going to institute, oh, we have a solution for you.
[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:21.381]  So to protect your wealth yet again, it's pretty simple.
[02:38:22.071 --> 02:38:28.054]  Debt market implosion, pressure on global stock markets, cash will move into commodities.
[02:38:28.054 --> 02:38:31.836]  My favorites are gold and silver because I think they're massively suppressed.
[02:38:31.836 --> 02:38:35.758]  There's been a suppression game going on for many, many years here.
[02:38:35.758 --> 02:38:37.358]  So look, that's what you do.
[02:38:37.358 --> 02:38:38.719]  Become your own central bank.
[02:38:38.719 --> 02:38:39.680]  Bet against the debt.
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:40.520]  This has been what I've talked
[02:38:43.971 --> 02:38:44.631]  We're good to go.
[02:38:59.991 --> 02:39:03.272]  And I have a little neat little thing right on my website, TradersChoice.net.
[02:39:03.272 --> 02:39:07.814]  It's called the MMRI, Manorino Market Risk Indicator.
[02:39:07.814 --> 02:39:12.535]  Right now, we just crossed 300, which is extreme risk, on Friday.
[02:39:12.535 --> 02:39:13.756]  We've come down a little bit.
[02:39:13.756 --> 02:39:16.877]  When I first put the MMRI out, it was in Haiti.
[02:39:16.877 --> 02:39:17.997]  It's free to anyone.
[02:39:17.997 --> 02:39:20.538]  Just go over to my website and look at it.
[02:39:20.538 --> 02:39:23.599]  And it really gauges market risk based on
[02:39:24.395 --> 02:39:25.636]  What's happening in the debt market?
[02:39:25.636 --> 02:39:27.238]  It's a neat little equation I came up with.
[02:39:27.238 --> 02:39:28.159]  It works.
[02:39:28.159 --> 02:39:29.720]  So look, we don't have to guess.
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:31.242]  People don't have to guess when this is going to happen.
[02:39:31.242 --> 02:39:32.023]  We have clues here.
[02:39:33.353 --> 02:39:34.834]  So that's where I stand.
[02:39:34.834 --> 02:39:40.998]  Protect yourself from that standpoint, meaning bet against the dead, become your own central bank here.
[02:39:40.998 --> 02:39:43.079]  Look, but what is our greatest resource?
[02:39:43.079 --> 02:39:46.382]  Look, people who know my work realize what I'm about to tell everyone here.
[02:39:46.382 --> 02:39:49.364]  We, people, we are each other's greatest resource.
[02:39:49.364 --> 02:39:50.504]  We got to support each other.
[02:39:50.504 --> 02:39:53.246]  We got to get together with like-minded people.
[02:39:53.246 --> 02:40:00.651]  Understand that the divide and conquer mechanism being propagated by the mainstream just doesn't work.
[02:40:00.651 --> 02:40:03.293]  You know, we need to come together, all of us.
[02:40:03.653 --> 02:40:05.595]  If we can do that, we win.
[02:40:05.595 --> 02:40:06.917]  If we can't, we lose.
[02:40:06.917 --> 02:40:08.598]  Period.
[02:40:08.598 --> 02:40:22.152]  I want to come back in the final segment with you and really kind of hone in on the debt bubble and what the burst will look like and maybe even play a little bit of a devil's advocate role there to get a better understanding of it, at least for the audience.
[02:40:22.152 --> 02:40:24.014]  But let me ask you this as we close out this segment.
[02:40:25.517 --> 02:40:27.218]  Well, it hasn't been in the news lately.
[02:40:27.218 --> 02:40:32.241]  I just happen to know this because I'm interested in precious metals myself and I talk to people in the industry.
[02:40:32.241 --> 02:40:36.843]  There have been major runs of gold in the private sector.
[02:40:36.843 --> 02:40:39.145]  The public sector runs kind of already happened.
[02:40:39.145 --> 02:40:40.325]  China bought up a lot of gold.
[02:40:40.325 --> 02:40:41.286]  Russia bought up a lot of gold.
[02:40:41.286 --> 02:40:41.606]  The U.S.
[02:40:41.606 --> 02:40:41.946]  Treasury.
[02:40:41.946 --> 02:40:43.387]  That run kind of already happened.
[02:40:43.387 --> 02:40:45.128]  That kind of tailed off.
[02:40:45.128 --> 02:40:49.151]  Now the private sector is rushing to get gold, rushing to get silver.
[02:40:49.991 --> 02:40:51.912]  It's hard to actually make a purchase now.
[02:40:51.912 --> 02:40:53.132]  You're going to be waiting.
[02:40:53.132 --> 02:40:59.454]  There's a wait period now to get precious metals, if you're looking to make a big purchase at least, definitely.
[02:40:59.454 --> 02:41:01.775]  And so why is that going on right now?
[02:41:01.775 --> 02:41:06.096]  What are you seeing with the delay and individuals being able to make precious metal purchases?
[02:41:07.662 --> 02:41:20.372]  I've been telling people for years that at one point it's going to be very difficult to acquire these things because these are actually scarce, they're real things and I think, at least I'd like to believe that
[02:41:21.351 --> 02:41:28.997]  People are raising their awareness, they understand what's happening, at least I would really hope that's the case here.
[02:41:28.997 --> 02:41:38.404]  Most people unfortunately don't have a clue, but more people are waking up to the grand plan here, the final solution of central banks, what they're doing.
[02:41:38.444 --> 02:41:41.825]  I can promise you that anyone that I know that has a few dollars laying around will
[02:42:06.135 --> 02:42:11.420]  Well, they have a nice stash already, and they've been buying gold and silver for a while.
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:18.205]  I've been buying silver since it was $8, and gold was like $7.50, maybe even less than that.
[02:42:18.205 --> 02:42:22.889]  And I haven't bought any in a while, but I intend to maybe buy some more here.
[02:42:22.889 --> 02:42:28.935]  But I've been prepared for this for a very, very long time, and people need to get ready, and they need to get ready now for an implosion of that dead market.
[02:42:29.395 --> 02:42:36.180]  Yeah, and the one thing that is so obvious, even to a layman just looking at it, you can see the anomaly of the U.S.
[02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:47.048]  dollar, or call it inflation, whatever you want, looking at a chart, it goes straight up, and then you look at a chart for gold or silver, somehow that doesn't actually go up at the same rate.
[02:42:47.048 --> 02:42:48.289]  Why would that be going on?
[02:42:48.289 --> 02:42:51.851]  Why do those prices stay synthetically there while the dollar loses value?
[02:42:51.851 --> 02:42:55.494]  We're asked that and the debt bubble bursts on the other side with Greg Manarino.
[02:42:57.421 --> 02:43:02.988]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[02:43:04.167 --> 02:43:17.954]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[02:43:17.954 --> 02:43:32.021]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.
[02:43:33.746 --> 02:43:34.266]  Look around you.
[02:43:59.745 --> 02:44:04.748]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[02:44:04.748 --> 02:44:08.651]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[02:44:08.651 --> 02:44:17.977]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[02:44:17.977 --> 02:44:23.641]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[02:44:23.641 --> 02:44:27.244]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[02:44:28.084 --> 02:44:31.206]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[02:44:31.206 --> 02:44:37.490]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:38.771]  It's unsustainable.
[02:44:38.771 --> 02:44:39.992]  So please, visit.
[02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:43.071]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:44:43.071 --> 02:44:51.175]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[02:44:51.175 --> 02:44:54.176]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[02:44:54.176 --> 02:44:55.476]  Thank you for your support.
[02:44:55.476 --> 02:44:56.577]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[02:44:56.577 --> 02:44:58.038]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:44:58.038 --> 02:44:58.058]  X3.
[02:45:00.738 --> 02:45:02.559]  X3.
[02:45:02.559 --> 02:45:05.480]  It stands for tri-iodine.
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:11.342]  All three types of iodine that the body needs to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[02:45:11.342 --> 02:45:15.744]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[02:45:15.744 --> 02:45:19.145]  X3 is the ultimate iodine product on the market.
[02:45:19.145 --> 02:45:24.988]  It's back in stock at InfoWarstore.com for 50% off and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:45:26.008 --> 02:45:28.110]  So many of you are on the fence.
[02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:29.491]  You know our information is powerful.
[02:45:29.491 --> 02:45:30.792]  You know it's changed the world.
[02:45:30.792 --> 02:45:39.560]  Try the products at InfoWarsTore.com and start with X3 Tri-Iodine.
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:41.842]  50% off InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:41.842 --> 02:45:43.883]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[02:45:43.883 --> 02:45:47.446]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes, Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes.
[02:45:47.446 --> 02:45:50.148]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[02:45:50.148 --> 02:45:51.950]  You need to experience it.
[02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:52.430]  Don't wait.
[02:45:53.274 --> 02:46:09.118]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:46:09.118 --> 02:46:11.018]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:46:11.018 --> 02:46:12.479]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:46:12.479 --> 02:46:13.979]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:46:13.979 --> 02:46:15.719]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:46:15.719 --> 02:46:16.980]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:46:16.980 --> 02:46:18.380]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:23.644]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:46:23.644 --> 02:46:26.027]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[02:46:26.027 --> 02:46:28.048]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:46:28.048 --> 02:46:34.995]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:46:35.635 --> 02:46:41.017]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:46:41.017 --> 02:46:49.961]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:46:49.961 --> 02:46:58.024]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:46:58.024 --> 02:47:03.926]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.185 --> 02:47:24.233]  My final segment here with Greg Manarino, traderschoice.net is his website.
[02:47:24.233 --> 02:47:32.281]  I want to do one more question on the gold-silver issue before we ask the kind of devil's advocate question about the debt bubble bursting.
[02:47:32.281 --> 02:47:32.662]  Why is it
[02:47:34.201 --> 02:47:35.141]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:47:35.141 --> 02:47:36.622]  Let's talk about that a little bit.
[02:47:36.622 --> 02:47:42.183]  To truly understand why that mechanism plays out the way that it does, you have to understand
[02:48:03.183 --> 02:48:10.612]  Unfortunately, the price of gold and silver is valued or is calculated.
[02:48:10.612 --> 02:48:18.240]  Now, generally, when you're looking at, let's say, for example, you're looking at Apple stock, ticker AAPL here.
[02:48:20.427 --> 02:48:26.411]  The value of that stock is the value of that stock, not the underlying value of, let's say, a derivative.
[02:48:26.411 --> 02:48:28.732]  Now, let's talk about a derivative real quick.
[02:48:28.732 --> 02:48:29.953]  What is a derivative?
[02:48:29.953 --> 02:48:32.394]  When people hear this word, their brain explodes.
[02:48:32.394 --> 02:48:34.656]  It's a very, very simple thing to understand.
[02:48:34.656 --> 02:48:41.580]  A derivative is simply a side bet on an underlying asset.
[02:48:44.375 --> 02:48:50.358]  So the derivative derives value derived derivative from that underlying asset.
[02:48:50.358 --> 02:48:58.023]  Okay, so how they keep the price of gold and silver artificially suppressed is by manipulating the derivative.
[02:48:58.023 --> 02:49:05.707]  Okay, the derivative market, it's funny that we're talking about this here right now is because I just had a long conversation yesterday with a friend of mine on about it.
[02:49:06.607 --> 02:49:17.772]  Is the most poorly understood aspect, I believe, of the entire global financial system and it's going to be the derivative market that really brings the world economy and the financial system to its knees.
[02:49:17.772 --> 02:49:23.835]  When we're talking about a derivative or something that derives value from something else, there's not just one layer of these things.
[02:49:23.835 --> 02:49:31.799]  There's one side bet and there's a side bet on a side bet and a side bet on a side bet and a side bet on a side bet in both directions, both up and down.
[02:49:32.599 --> 02:49:34.180]  Thank you for having me.
[02:49:53.146 --> 02:49:53.586]  Exactly.
[02:49:53.586 --> 02:50:00.392]  And so understanding that mechanism here, this is how they're able to manipulate the price of gold and silver.
[02:50:00.392 --> 02:50:07.517]  It's not going to stop until it does, until we see actual physical shortages of this stuff, because they can do whatever they want to.
[02:50:07.517 --> 02:50:16.404]  We're talking about adding digits to a screen, removing digits from a screen here, kind of like how the financial system itself works here, creating cash from nothing.
[02:50:16.404 --> 02:50:17.846]  This is how central banks work.
[02:50:17.846 --> 02:50:19.327]  It's an incredible situation here.
[02:50:20.387 --> 02:50:22.309]  You know, people don't even understand money.
[02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:23.770]  What is the cash that we have?
[02:50:23.770 --> 02:50:30.674]  I mean, you know, we work to get these things, you know, so we can go out and buy.
[02:50:30.674 --> 02:50:33.796]  But these are, they're not even ours, okay?
[02:50:33.796 --> 02:50:35.958]  You go out and you work for these dollars.
[02:50:35.958 --> 02:50:39.860]  These dollars that are issued by central banks here, they're not ours.
[02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:41.001]  They own them.
[02:50:41.001 --> 02:50:47.065]  Not only do they own the currency, it's owed back to the issuing central bank, plus cash
[02:50:47.125 --> 02:50:48.645]  That they create out of thin air.
[02:50:48.645 --> 02:50:49.745]  Imagine that kind of a situation.
[02:50:49.745 --> 02:50:53.246]  These are IOUs, just like how a treasury is, okay?
[02:50:53.246 --> 02:50:56.507]  These are just IOUs and we owe all of this back to the central bank.
[02:50:56.507 --> 02:50:57.727]  It's never meant to be paid back.
[02:50:57.727 --> 02:50:59.327]  You have to understand that.
[02:50:59.327 --> 02:51:03.588]  It's just meant to be inflated on and inflated larger and larger and larger and larger.
[02:51:03.588 --> 02:51:05.088]  It's created this incredible monster.
[02:51:05.088 --> 02:51:13.130]  Now, if you were to add in the derivatives market on top of, you know, people look at things like, for example, the national debt, whatever it might be.
[02:51:13.948 --> 02:51:14.148]  Thank you.
[02:51:30.167 --> 02:51:33.988]  Like, people have no idea how bad this is going to actually end up getting.
[02:51:33.988 --> 02:51:50.511]  And this is what people need to prepare themselves from every level, you know, mentally, physically, spiritually, absolutely here, making alliances with people in their neighborhoods here, realizing where we're going, how we're being pushed deliberately down a pathway, being literally led to the slaughter.
[02:51:50.511 --> 02:51:51.672]  And this is accelerating.
[02:51:51.672 --> 02:51:52.892]  It's very fast.
[02:51:53.532 --> 02:51:58.293]  And in my opinion, going back to the debt bubble, and I think we're going to talk a little more about that.
[02:51:58.293 --> 02:52:03.135]  Let me just ask you quickly, though, to try to put a bow on this.
[02:52:03.135 --> 02:52:06.436]  I'm making these numbers up just as an example.
[02:52:06.436 --> 02:52:09.977]  Let's say in 1940 an ounce of gold was $1.
[02:52:11.357 --> 02:52:24.560]  And now you're in the year 2020, and $1 compared to $1 in 1940 is now, say, $0.20, but the ounce of gold is not $0.20, it's still $1.
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:25.380]  It's a bad example.
[02:52:25.380 --> 02:52:35.303]  My point is, though, how has the price of precious metals, gold and silver specifically, not properly responded to the rate of inflation or to the rate of the valuation of the dollar?
[02:52:36.662 --> 02:52:47.315]  Well, you know, if you look at what an ounce of gold would buy today and what an ounce of gold would buy back then, you will see that it actually buys the same thing.
[02:52:47.315 --> 02:52:53.162]  But based upon what I was saying earlier, you've got this issue of the hard asset.
[02:52:53.522 --> 02:52:53.782]  Thank you.
[02:53:09.657 --> 02:53:13.261]  The financial system itself is a farce.
[02:53:13.261 --> 02:53:14.802]  Again, it's not on the elemental chart.
[02:53:14.802 --> 02:53:16.283]  It doesn't exist.
[02:53:16.283 --> 02:53:19.066]  How does actually the financial system itself work?
[02:53:19.066 --> 02:53:21.248]  It works on confidence.
[02:53:21.248 --> 02:53:24.431]  Confidence, notice the word here, that it will work here.
[02:53:24.431 --> 02:53:26.273]  Central banks are in full control of this thing.
[02:53:26.273 --> 02:53:27.534]  They control the economy, they control
[02:53:27.614 --> 02:53:29.375]  Let me just end off with this real quick.
[02:53:55.625 --> 02:53:56.165]  I think so.
[02:54:15.153 --> 02:54:22.583]  Yeah, and we've already seen that.
[02:54:22.583 --> 02:54:24.406]  Yeah, we've seen that with the Ukraine situation.
[02:54:24.406 --> 02:54:28.272]  They say $6 billion could solve world hunger, well then they give $100 billion to Ukraine.
[02:54:28.272 --> 02:54:29.173]  It's funny how that works.
[02:54:30.615 --> 02:54:39.403]  So let me just play devil's advocate here quickly, because obviously we talk about the financial systems, you've got kind of the, with the central banks, you've got the mix of corruption and policy causing the problems.
[02:54:39.403 --> 02:54:46.870]  But okay, I've been hearing the debt bubble's going to collapse for years, I've been hearing the debt bubble collapse, I've been hearing imminent danger for years now.
[02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:49.933]  Why, why should I listen to that concern now?
[02:54:49.933 --> 02:54:51.355]  Why should I heed that warning now?
[02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.455]  Because it's happening.
[02:54:53.455 --> 02:54:58.797]  Look at the side effect here of all this money creation is inflation.
[02:54:58.797 --> 02:55:01.337]  And it's going to get much, much worse here.
[02:55:01.337 --> 02:55:04.558]  Especially when this whole thing, you know, look, we can see it.
[02:55:04.558 --> 02:55:06.379]  It's actually unfolding before our eyes.
[02:55:06.379 --> 02:55:15.661]  This artificial suppression of rates now since the last meltdown has inflated the global debt multiple times.
[02:55:15.661 --> 02:55:17.942]  And it's starting to manifest itself in
[02:55:18.762 --> 02:55:24.007]  The way it's hurting people via inflation, which it was meant to do from the get-go.
[02:55:24.007 --> 02:55:25.548]  So this is just the opening act.
[02:55:25.548 --> 02:55:26.689]  We haven't seen anything yet.
[02:55:26.689 --> 02:55:33.595]  Look, if they really wanted to get a handle on this whole financial situation, they could have taken action years ago.
[02:55:33.595 --> 02:55:37.859]  But what people don't get is this debt-based economic model is dying.
[02:55:37.859 --> 02:55:42.883]  And we're seeing the proof of that by actions of central banks who continue to keep rates suppressed.
[02:55:43.243 --> 02:55:45.726]  You can't just central banks have no magical power.
[02:55:45.726 --> 02:55:48.428]  They can't just say, hey, we're going to keep rates at this level or that level.
[02:55:48.428 --> 02:55:50.250]  They have to get into the market and make it happen.
[02:55:50.250 --> 02:55:53.513]  They have to make the cash out of thin air and buy the debt.
[02:55:53.513 --> 02:55:54.854]  That's how it works.
[02:55:54.854 --> 02:55:56.636]  People have no idea how this whole thing is.
[02:55:56.636 --> 02:55:57.577]  It works.
[02:55:57.577 --> 02:56:00.520]  And they're desperate right now to keep it afloat for as long as possible.
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:01.241]  I don't think they're done.
[02:56:01.241 --> 02:56:05.964]  They're going to continue to do this until they suck in every last available person.
[02:56:05.964 --> 02:56:08.506]  What they're trying to do is create more slaves to the system.
[02:56:08.506 --> 02:56:18.795]  The more people that they can get dependent on the system, the easier it is for them to sell it, a new system to people, as they beg for help.
[02:56:18.795 --> 02:56:25.260]  To me, you just put it, and we're out of time here, I'm sorry to cut you off, but to me, you just put it on the most relatable level where
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:30.663]  The way the American financial system is set up, it promotes debt.
[02:56:30.663 --> 02:56:33.524]  It promotes you to go into debt.
[02:56:33.524 --> 02:56:36.686]  And then the financial experts will say, or the bankers will say, well this is a good thing.
[02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:37.507]  You should go into debt.
[02:56:37.507 --> 02:56:38.347]  You should do this.
[02:56:38.347 --> 02:56:41.949]  And then the credit cards on top of it, that's horrible policy.
[02:56:41.949 --> 02:56:43.590]  It will always lead to failure.
[02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:45.611]  It has caused collapse in the past.
[02:56:45.611 --> 02:56:47.892]  And I agree that we're on the verge of another one.
[02:56:47.892 --> 02:56:48.293]  So folks,
[02:56:49.053 --> 02:56:50.673]  Take Greg Manarino's advice.
[02:56:50.673 --> 02:56:53.294]  Go to his website, traderschoice.net.
[02:56:53.294 --> 02:56:56.495]  Get yourself in a smart position in case of a collapse.
[02:56:56.495 --> 02:56:58.996]  And look, I understand why people leverage debt.
[02:56:58.996 --> 02:57:00.516]  I understand why people take debt out.
[02:57:00.516 --> 02:57:01.897]  Believe me, I get it.
[02:57:01.897 --> 02:57:07.558]  But you've got to understand that that's not a smart way to protect your wealth into the future.
[02:57:07.558 --> 02:57:09.999]  So, Greg Manarino, thank you so much for joining us today, brother.
[02:57:10.948 --> 02:57:11.308]  Absolutely.
[02:57:11.308 --> 02:57:12.229]  Thanks for having me.
[02:57:12.229 --> 02:57:12.449]  All right.
[02:57:12.449 --> 02:57:13.209]  Good stuff from him.
[02:57:13.209 --> 02:57:18.112]  That's an hour-long great financial conversation you're not going to see anywhere else except right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:18.112 --> 02:57:23.514]  Now, Maria Z is going to take over and she's going to do the fourth hour today.
[02:57:23.514 --> 02:57:26.096]  I'm going to prepare myself.
[02:57:26.096 --> 02:57:27.836]  I'm already pretty much prepared, though, to host the War Room.
[02:57:27.836 --> 02:57:32.219]  I'll be hosting the War Room today as my usual duties, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:32.219 --> 02:57:32.659]  Central.
[02:57:32.659 --> 02:57:35.540]  I do have a guest coming on and a ton of news.
[02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:38.702]  We're going to really delve into all the breaking news and all the headlines right here.
[02:57:39.022 --> 02:57:41.123]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:57:41.123 --> 02:57:43.844]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[02:57:57.688 --> 02:58:02.592]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:58:02.592 --> 02:58:06.976]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:12.681]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:58:12.681 --> 02:58:17.285]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:58:17.285 --> 02:58:23.451]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes the world.

[02:59:58.590 --> 03:00:00.576]  I don't know.
[03:00:06.923 --> 03:00:13.207]  Thank you for joining me on this Wednesday, October 26, 2022 broadcast.
[03:00:13.207 --> 03:00:23.693]  I'm Maria Z guest hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show and reporting to you from the testing ground of the New World Order here in Australia.
[03:00:23.693 --> 03:00:30.778]  The US midterms are coming up and I want to give everyone some motivation as to why it is so important to vote
[03:00:31.338 --> 03:00:34.362]  And get people with integrity in power.
[03:00:34.362 --> 03:00:37.646]  Steve and Owen were talking about this earlier and it is truly crucial.
[03:00:37.646 --> 03:00:46.097]  We really have to fight in every way that we possibly can with integrity and God does honour those who do things with integrity.
[03:00:46.097 --> 03:00:49.260]  Now I'm saying all of this because what I'm about to share with everyone today
[03:00:50.021 --> 03:00:56.606]  Is some of the most alarming laws in the world that have been introduced into Australia.
[03:00:56.606 --> 03:00:59.568]  And some of these have already been passed.
[03:00:59.568 --> 03:01:08.714]  And if we don't win against these maniacs, this will come to every single country because Australia is the testing ground of the New World Order.
[03:01:08.714 --> 03:01:11.235]  We are treated like lab rats here.
[03:01:11.235 --> 03:01:17.139]  And I know that the people of America certainly do not want to be treated like lab rats.
[03:01:17.139 --> 03:01:17.840]  No one does.
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:23.644]  We are all fed up with these maniac eugenicists doing what they're doing to the whole world.
[03:01:23.644 --> 03:01:28.007]  But we have a bunch of leftists and climate change cultists in power here in Australia.
[03:01:28.007 --> 03:01:34.431]  And since they were selected, not elected, into the Parliament,
[03:01:34.773 --> 03:01:44.096]  We've had some insane laws passed in our country, some of the most extreme laws in the world, to the point where they've even made the mainstream media.
[03:01:44.096 --> 03:01:56.861]  So I want to talk to everyone about that and warn everyone and remind everyone to keep an eye out on Australia because whatever they do to us here, they will do to you in your country if our people don't rise up.
[03:01:56.861 --> 03:01:58.582]  So the first one that I want to talk about
[03:01:59.202 --> 03:02:08.591]  is a law called the Monitoring of Places of Detention by the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, OPCAT Bill 2022.
[03:02:08.591 --> 03:02:19.961]  This bill was introduced under the guise of preventing torture and it allows the United Nations to come into our facilities such as mental health wards or prisons
[03:02:20.701 --> 03:02:24.044]  And make sure that everyone's being treated fairly there.
[03:02:24.044 --> 03:02:28.848]  That's what they say is the reason why they're allowing the United Nations into our facilities.
[03:02:28.848 --> 03:02:33.431]  But when you actually start reading through the legislation, you see that that's not the case.
[03:02:33.431 --> 03:02:38.275]  And funnily enough, we released this report in August.
[03:02:39.015 --> 03:02:45.880]  On zmedia.com and all of the predictions that I made reading through this legislation came true.
[03:02:45.880 --> 03:02:53.425]  Unfortunately, you know, most people don't have the time to read through pages and pages, hundreds of pages of legislation.
[03:02:53.425 --> 03:02:55.406]  And so this is how they slip this stuff in.
[03:02:55.406 --> 03:02:56.226]  It's unbelievable.
[03:02:56.226 --> 03:03:06.173]  But basically it says that it's a bill for an act to facilitate visits to places of detention and access to information by the United Nations Subcommittee.
[03:03:07.494 --> 03:03:10.538]  It talks about people that get taken
[03:03:13.085 --> 03:03:17.446]  For public health reasons to quarantine facilities though.
[03:03:17.446 --> 03:03:23.288]  You know what happened in Australia during the period of the so-called pandemic.
[03:03:23.288 --> 03:03:25.008]  We know that it wasn't a real pandemic.
[03:03:25.008 --> 03:03:34.631]  But people were actually taken to these facilities for not complying with things like contact tracing or home quarantine and things of that nature.
[03:03:34.631 --> 03:03:38.372]  The places of detention of course, like I said, it lists prisons, mental health facilities,
[03:03:38.892 --> 03:03:49.359]  And then it talks about public health orders and pandemic orders and even lists direction given in the exercise of a pandemic management power.
[03:03:49.359 --> 03:03:52.021]  And of course, what they call emergency powers.
[03:03:52.021 --> 03:03:56.704]  And, you know, the agenda with climate change in the future.
[03:03:56.704 --> 03:03:58.205]  Australia's just released this report.
[03:03:58.205 --> 03:04:00.466]  I've been talking about it for weeks now.
[03:04:00.466 --> 03:04:02.988]  It's Australia's pandemic preparedness report.
[03:04:03.638 --> 03:04:09.246]  And we have five separate pandemics that they have identified that are going to hit the whole world.
[03:04:09.246 --> 03:04:14.734]  And they talk about how these are going to be, it's dependent on climate change.
[03:04:15.595 --> 03:04:22.057]  When these pandemics just shift because of human encroachment on animal environments and things like that.
[03:04:22.057 --> 03:04:33.121]  So at any given time they can say that there's a public health need, there's an emergency because we're impacting the climate, all of these things, and they can do it to us yet again.
[03:04:33.121 --> 03:04:36.122]  And you saw how quickly the people fell for it last time.
[03:04:36.122 --> 03:04:37.322]  They will fall for it again.
[03:04:38.078 --> 03:04:47.263]  The UN has unrestricted access to any part of the place of detention and I'm telling you this has even made the mainstream.
[03:04:47.263 --> 03:04:51.865]  In the next segment we're going to keep talking about that and I'll let you know what the mainstream has to say about it.
[03:04:51.865 --> 03:04:53.346]  We'll be back right after this short break.
[03:04:57.938 --> 03:05:00.919]  It's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[03:05:00.919 --> 03:05:05.441]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[03:05:05.441 --> 03:05:07.141]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[03:05:07.141 --> 03:05:11.043]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[03:05:11.043 --> 03:05:14.944]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[03:05:14.944 --> 03:05:26.028]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, it does just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[03:05:26.508 --> 03:05:30.892]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.

[03:05:34.955 --> 03:05:36.436]  Plus it funds the InfoWar.
[03:05:36.436 --> 03:05:40.239]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[03:06:05.373 --> 03:06:07.454]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:07.454 --> 03:06:17.581]  I'm your guest host today, Maria Z. We're talking about what the Australian government has brought in under the guise of preventing torture in quarantine facilities, in prisons.
[03:06:17.581 --> 03:06:24.766]  But what this actually is, is a means for the United Nations to come into quarantine facilities and interrogate citizens
[03:06:25.486 --> 03:06:29.710]  And that's actually evidenced in the bill that was introduced into Australia.
[03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:38.537]  It goes on to talk about how the United Nations have unrestricted access to any part of the detention facilities where people might be held under the guise of public health.
[03:06:39.193 --> 03:06:45.636]  It talks about the UN being able to interview any person and also deny them a support person.
[03:06:45.636 --> 03:06:57.182]  So it says that you're allowed a support person, but the United Nations representative has the ability to deny you the right to have that support person present.
[03:06:57.182 --> 03:07:05.205]  So it's a one-on-one interrogation with the United Nations, who we know are serving the globalist satanic cabal.
[03:07:05.205 --> 03:07:08.307]  And I want to say here, if this is for your health,
[03:07:09.073 --> 03:07:28.119]  If they are there to make sure that you're not being tortured or you're actually there because this is for public health, why would they specifically go to the effort of writing into law that the United Nations have the right to deny you a support person if this is for your health, if it's for your well-being?
[03:07:28.852 --> 03:07:31.494]  Why would they need to deny you that right?
[03:07:31.494 --> 03:07:38.859]  In fact, it should be a human right to be able to have that support person present if we're doing everything above board.
[03:07:38.859 --> 03:07:42.942]  But every single person around the world knows that these people are psychopaths.
[03:07:42.942 --> 03:07:45.384]  We know what they did to us over the past few years.
[03:07:45.384 --> 03:07:48.486]  We know how capable they are of producing lies.
[03:07:49.221 --> 03:08:07.690]  That despite the fact that people see straight through the lies, despite the evidence mounting all over the world of the fact that these people have lied about the safety of these shots, have lied about their efficacy, and have openly gone out killing people with their shots.
[03:08:07.690 --> 03:08:08.430]  And I mean that.
[03:08:08.430 --> 03:08:10.251]  These people are murderers.
[03:08:10.251 --> 03:08:12.132]  Despite all of that, they've still kept going.
[03:08:13.194 --> 03:08:15.157]  Because they don't care!
[03:08:15.157 --> 03:08:20.784]  They will just keep lying to you but people are waking up and for that I am grateful.
[03:08:20.784 --> 03:08:27.232]  We've actually had this reach the mainstream media news and I predicted this back in August when we reported on it and I said
[03:08:28.484 --> 03:08:39.553]  This is going to be brought in under the guise of protecting people and protecting their human rights, but that is just a front for the fact that they want to bring this into legislation.
[03:08:39.553 --> 03:08:53.065]  This was introduced into the state of Victoria and it turns out the Daily Mail has actually reported on this and said that there's been outrage as the United Nations shows up for unannounced Australia's prisons for random inspections.
[03:08:53.752 --> 03:08:58.177]  Go to Saudi Arabia instead, they say, where they still put people to death for being gay.
[03:08:58.177 --> 03:09:00.520]  So they're feigning this outrage now.
[03:09:00.520 --> 03:09:01.741]  They're faking this.
[03:09:01.741 --> 03:09:07.288]  It says that UN prison inspectors were sent packing after being denied access to NSW prisons.
[03:09:07.288 --> 03:09:11.793]  But then it says that the inspectors left the country for New York after a 12-day Australian tour.
[03:09:11.793 --> 03:09:13.195]  So be warned, Americans!
[03:09:13.900 --> 03:09:22.443]  These so-called prevention of torture inspectors are coming to New York right after they were denied access to some prisons here.
[03:09:22.443 --> 03:09:33.327]  It goes on to talk about the fact that they have suspended plans to look at Australian detention facilities after New South Wales and Queensland, these two states, blocked access.
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:49.608]  And it actually mentions here that representatives from the UN subcommittee, and you know they really want to hammer home that they're there to make sure that they're preventing torture, were obstructed from carrying out, listen to these words, their protective mandate.
[03:09:50.308 --> 03:09:52.048]  There's that word mandate again.
[03:09:52.048 --> 03:09:57.610]  Violating the country's agreement or obligations, they say.
[03:09:57.610 --> 03:10:03.651]  So we're now obligated to allow these UN goons into our detention facilities.
[03:10:03.651 --> 03:10:10.153]  And again, I'm telling you, they've specifically written into here quarantine facilities under public health measures.
[03:10:11.813 --> 03:10:22.065]  There's one more alarming thing in this Daily Mail article which actually says that UN inspectors were given access to Commonwealth-run detention facilities but did not specify which ones.
[03:10:22.065 --> 03:10:28.553]  So they have actually been to other Commonwealth-run detention facilities, they're just not telling us which ones.
[03:10:28.553 --> 03:10:31.837]  Now, within the next breath,
[03:10:32.742 --> 03:10:41.788]  Another article was released by the mainstream media which said that Queensland is now going to change laws that prevented UN inspectors entering mental health wards.
[03:10:41.788 --> 03:10:46.751]  So they come out with this article, look how the mainstream coordinates to lie to the people.
[03:10:46.751 --> 03:10:51.575]  They come out with an article saying, oh there's been outrage, what are you doing in our prisons?
[03:10:51.575 --> 03:10:54.737]  But then they talk about the fact that there's a mandate.
[03:10:55.317 --> 03:11:00.223]  Our country has an obligation to the United Nations to let them into our facilities.
[03:11:00.223 --> 03:11:08.012]  And then in the next breath, Queensland goes and changes laws to allow the United Nations into mental health wards.
[03:11:08.012 --> 03:11:09.114]  But that's where it starts.
[03:11:09.114 --> 03:11:11.657]  It's all done under the guise of protecting you.
[03:11:12.097 --> 03:11:16.739]  Under the guise of human rights, just like this insane trans agenda.
[03:11:16.739 --> 03:11:18.299]  Oh, it's about equality!
[03:11:18.299 --> 03:11:19.860]  It's about human rights!
[03:11:19.860 --> 03:11:23.821]  We want to treat everyone fairly and make sure we're all equal.
[03:11:23.821 --> 03:11:32.384]  Meanwhile, they're plotting to lock dissidents up in facilities and this is exactly what this is about and I'm going to prove it to you in the coming segments.
[03:11:33.204 --> 03:11:51.592]  Basically, the delegation's head here has said, Aisha Shijouni Mohammed, has condemned both states for restricting access to UN officials and has said that it is deeply regrettable that the limited understanding of the Subcommittee on Preventing Tortures, again there's that word mandate,
[03:11:52.379 --> 03:12:00.164]  Lack of cooperation stemming from internal disagreements, especially with respect to the states of Queensland, has compelled us to take this drastic measure.
[03:12:00.164 --> 03:12:10.491]  What they're doing at the moment in Australia is they're introducing laws through Queensland because there's some sort of a loophole where this ends up applying to the rest of the country.
[03:12:10.491 --> 03:12:20.158]  And again, I'll prove that to you later on in the show, but it says, they go on to talk about the fact that this looks like either gross incompetence or deliberate obstruction.
[03:12:20.993 --> 03:12:22.553]  This is gross incompetence.
[03:12:22.553 --> 03:12:25.474]  Why aren't we letting the United Nations into our facilities?
[03:12:25.474 --> 03:12:30.336]  My goodness, look at the propaganda and the level of brainwashing here.
[03:12:30.336 --> 03:12:35.717]  And most people will believe it because they think it's for public health and human rights.
[03:12:35.717 --> 03:12:36.478]  It's unbelievable.
[03:12:36.478 --> 03:12:45.100]  Based on what we've heard from advocacy groups, I dread to think what the government might be hiding as they duck and weave these inspections.
[03:12:45.100 --> 03:12:46.540]  And then they go on.
[03:12:46.540 --> 03:12:48.261]  You know, they create this outrage.
[03:12:49.016 --> 03:12:54.900]  They create this outrage in order to justify bringing in tougher laws.
[03:12:54.900 --> 03:12:56.021]  This is what they do.
[03:12:56.021 --> 03:13:07.069]  They create a stir in the mainstream, they create a stir in the people who think that the mainstream serves the good of the people, which is a complete lie because they're working hand in hand with these people to kill you.
[03:13:08.504 --> 03:13:13.886]  And then they buy this stuff and then you get virtue signaling activists saying, oh, we're going to we're going to get involved in this.
[03:13:13.886 --> 03:13:17.128]  We need the United Nations here to make sure that we're safe.
[03:13:17.128 --> 03:13:19.249]  All these poor people with mental health issues.
[03:13:19.249 --> 03:13:22.350]  It's unbelievable how they do it and how they spin it.
[03:13:22.350 --> 03:13:26.552]  But they go on to say that last week's disastrous UN visits
[03:13:27.367 --> 03:13:31.648]  Shows the importance of realizing this protection.
[03:13:31.648 --> 03:13:40.211]  They're calling it protection, allowing the United Nations to come in and interrogate citizens one-on-one and deny them a support person.
[03:13:40.211 --> 03:13:42.192]  It is absolutely horrendous.
[03:13:42.192 --> 03:13:50.454]  And it is past time for human rights to be fully protected, including all closed settings in Queensland.
[03:13:50.454 --> 03:13:52.135]  I mean, literally,
[03:13:53.345 --> 03:13:56.509]  Two months ago, I warned that this was coming.
[03:13:56.509 --> 03:14:00.054]  That report is up on zmedia.com.
[03:14:00.054 --> 03:14:08.124]  We've also got the Emergency Management Amendment Bill, Temporary COVID-19 Provisions Bill of 2022 that I want to talk to you about.
[03:14:08.124 --> 03:14:09.646]  And again, you know,
[03:14:10.592 --> 03:14:26.741]  Most people don't find it interesting breaking down legislation, but while we're distracted, while they're trying to sweep COVID under the rug and call it, you know, we just did the best that we could with the information that we had and we had to move at the speed of science.
[03:14:26.741 --> 03:14:30.963]  The most unscientific statement I've ever heard made by these people.
[03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:37.274]  While they're distracting you with that, this is the kind of stuff that they're slipping right under our noses.
[03:14:37.274 --> 03:14:40.977]  And I would caution the people of the United States to watch for this.
[03:14:40.977 --> 03:14:47.182]  Someone should take the responsibility of watching for new bills like this and reporting on it.
[03:14:47.182 --> 03:14:49.504]  Because while people are distracted, this is what they do to you.
[03:14:49.504 --> 03:14:53.527]  But back to this Emergency Management Amendment Bill in Western Australia.
[03:14:53.527 --> 03:14:56.330]  It allows authorised COVID-19 officers
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:07.049]  Nominated by the Chief Health Officer, which is Dr. Andrew Robertson, who just so happens to have extensive experience working with the United Nations and in a military capacity.
[03:15:07.049 --> 03:15:08.970]  Surprise, surprise.
[03:15:08.970 --> 03:15:11.452]  They don't need a warrant to enter your home.
[03:15:11.452 --> 03:15:14.295]  They don't need proof that you have COVID.
[03:15:15.095 --> 03:15:16.496]  Or any disease.
[03:15:16.496 --> 03:15:18.538]  They just have to have a suspicion that you do.
[03:15:18.538 --> 03:15:35.351]  They can break into your home without any evidence as to why they're there, take your property, seize you, take you to a quarantine facility where you legally, now, according to this legislation, can be forced to submit to a medical procedure.
[03:15:35.351 --> 03:15:37.993]  That, of course, we know includes vaccination.
[03:15:37.993 --> 03:15:43.337]  The Immunization Agenda 2030 document, which you can find online, it's
[03:15:44.668 --> 03:15:46.810]  Being published in coordination with The Who.
[03:15:46.810 --> 03:15:50.233]  Plans to vaccinate the world with 500 new vaccines by 2030.
[03:15:50.233 --> 03:15:51.974]  These people aren't going to stop.
[03:15:51.974 --> 03:15:53.856]  I'll see you just on the other side of the break.
[03:15:58.567 --> 03:16:02.909]  I've been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:16:02.909 --> 03:16:09.312]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:16:09.312 --> 03:16:14.434]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:16:14.434 --> 03:16:16.155]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:16:16.155 --> 03:16:22.578]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had the success.
[03:16:23.278 --> 03:16:28.720]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:16:28.720 --> 03:16:33.042]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:16:33.042 --> 03:16:42.206]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:16:42.206 --> 03:16:43.607]  God bless you all.
[03:16:43.607 --> 03:16:44.667]  I salute you.
[03:16:44.667 --> 03:16:45.768]  I thank you.
[03:16:45.768 --> 03:16:51.110]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:16:51.770 --> 03:16:53.091]  The fight is my fight.
[03:16:53.091 --> 03:16:53.731]  It's your fight.
[03:16:53.731 --> 03:16:54.472]  It's our fight.
[03:16:54.472 --> 03:16:56.553]  God bless you all.
[03:16:56.553 --> 03:17:00.055]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[03:17:00.055 --> 03:17:03.177]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[03:17:03.177 --> 03:17:04.798]  Now, I knew that.
[03:17:04.798 --> 03:17:07.619]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people.
[03:17:07.619 --> 03:17:09.040]  And together, we've had a great effect.

[03:17:11.521 --> 03:17:12.682]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:17:12.682 --> 03:17:15.083]  But they can't beat the power of we the people.
[03:17:15.083 --> 03:17:15.804]  Of you and I together.

[03:17:40.451 --> 03:17:43.193]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[03:17:43.193 --> 03:17:48.917]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge, tip of the spear.
[03:17:48.917 --> 03:17:53.760]  And when we talk about the products at InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you
[03:18:10.213 --> 03:18:10.373]  I think?
[03:18:26.684 --> 03:18:27.544]  We're good to go.
[03:18:56.425 --> 03:19:08.351]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[03:19:09.181 --> 03:19:12.384]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[03:19:12.384 --> 03:19:21.292]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[03:19:21.292 --> 03:19:23.274]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[03:19:23.274 --> 03:19:24.795]  I don't plan to be Mr. Health.
[03:19:24.795 --> 03:19:32.422]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarshaw.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.

[03:19:57.173 --> 03:20:01.794]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:01.794 --> 03:20:16.399]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:16.399 --> 03:20:18.899]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.899 --> 03:20:24.581]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z, coming to you live from the testing ground of the New World Order that is Australia.
[03:20:25.316 --> 03:20:29.318]  I want to talk about the importance of supporting Infowars.
[03:20:29.318 --> 03:20:38.921]  I haven't been asked to do this plug, but working in independent media, I really understand the need for people to support independent media.
[03:20:38.921 --> 03:20:44.404]  See, most independent media is funded by the people because they serve the people.
[03:20:44.404 --> 03:20:45.864]  We exist for the people.
[03:20:48.214 --> 03:20:57.345]  And this broadcast, InfoWars, has been instrumental in providing a platform for people who are seeking the truth and telling people the truth.
[03:20:57.345 --> 03:20:59.387]  The truth that the mainstream media would never tell you.
[03:20:59.387 --> 03:21:03.312]  So you will never get this crucial information that is literally life-saving.
[03:21:04.033 --> 03:21:04.874]  In the mainstream.
[03:21:04.874 --> 03:21:11.162]  They will hide this from you until their very last breath because they're funded and paid by the globalists.
[03:21:11.162 --> 03:21:12.583]  So please support InfoWars.
[03:21:12.583 --> 03:21:21.375]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com and support your favorite broadcasters whenever you get the chance because the truth reaching you depends on your support.
[03:21:21.915 --> 03:21:26.177]  I want to go back to this Emergency Management Amendment Bill.
[03:21:26.177 --> 03:21:30.139]  Interestingly, it talks about COVID-19 in this bill.
[03:21:30.139 --> 03:21:36.123]  It's a Western Australian bill that was introduced and there's been a lot of noise about this one.
[03:21:36.123 --> 03:21:40.565]  See, what they did was they ended the temporary emergency powers in the state of Western Australia
[03:21:41.005 --> 03:21:48.449]  Then they introduced this bill which as it stands is in place for two years but they specified COVID-19 in there.
[03:21:48.449 --> 03:22:00.596]  Now my assumption here, I'm making an assumption, is because COVID-19 is the flavour of the day and it's easiest to get away with if they put COVID-19 in and later on just make an amendment.
[03:22:00.596 --> 03:22:05.259]  Say, oh well it's not COVID-19 anymore it's influenza or it's this, that and the other.
[03:22:05.259 --> 03:22:09.021]  Whatever new disease they decide to concoct
[03:22:09.736 --> 03:22:13.858]  In their bio labs where they are creating more and more viruses.
[03:22:13.858 --> 03:22:16.580]  We just saw that article come out of Boston University.
[03:22:16.580 --> 03:22:23.703]  There's also been another one where they have announced that they've created a more dangerous version of monkey pox.
[03:22:23.703 --> 03:22:26.044]  I'll talk about that a little bit later.
[03:22:26.044 --> 03:22:33.048]  But I think that what's happened since we at Z Media made noise about this particular bill in Western Australia.
[03:22:33.977 --> 03:22:35.159]  This went around the world.
[03:22:35.159 --> 03:22:42.028]  Let me tell you, we had support from people in the United States, former military sending us videos saying, we stand with you.
[03:22:42.028 --> 03:22:44.711]  People created sub-stacks.
[03:22:44.711 --> 03:22:48.296]  This video of me talking about this legislation was shared on Twitter.
[03:22:48.296 --> 03:22:51.019]  The last time I checked, it was almost 300,000 people had seen it.
[03:22:53.177 --> 03:22:59.400]  And we raised awareness about this to the point where they've actually pulled down the bill from their website.
[03:22:59.400 --> 03:23:00.781]  You can't find it anymore.
[03:23:00.781 --> 03:23:04.123]  We've got copies, thankfully, and we found a link that works.
[03:23:04.123 --> 03:23:12.607]  But they've taken the bill down from the website because of the amount of public pushback that occurred as a result of this report.
[03:23:12.607 --> 03:23:14.068]  So that's just proof to you
[03:23:14.961 --> 03:23:19.606]  The power of independent media in raising awareness about these issues.
[03:23:19.606 --> 03:23:27.793]  The mainstream did report on it, but it was nowhere near the truth about this bill and what it actually allows.
[03:23:27.793 --> 03:23:30.796]  And following our report, people were horrified.
[03:23:30.796 --> 03:23:32.137]  It resulted in protests.
[03:23:32.137 --> 03:23:36.922]  It resulted in people going to the front of Parliament and protesting and saying, we will not allow for this.
[03:23:37.262 --> 03:23:39.003]  This is absolutely insane.
[03:23:39.003 --> 03:23:44.347]  And why on earth would we be doing it at this stage, this late in the game, when Biden says the pandemic's over?
[03:23:44.347 --> 03:23:45.948]  Why do we need to do this?
[03:23:45.948 --> 03:23:52.893]  You can find that report, New Legislation to Force Australians into Quarantine and Force Injections.
[03:23:52.893 --> 03:23:58.457]  I don't know the exact title, but it is on the Z Media channel on Banned.Video.
[03:23:59.815 --> 03:24:16.364]  I want to talk about the fact that, you know, maybe they've introduced this bill to distract from the fact that we've actually made changes to the Public Health Act of 2005 as of September 2022, the 7th of September 2022.
[03:24:16.364 --> 03:24:21.347]  And again, this was done in Queensland, which means that it applies to all states.
[03:24:21.347 --> 03:24:23.949]  This is the first time that I'm presenting this information.
[03:24:24.449 --> 03:24:30.576]  And I'm going to give everyone a brief overview of this legislation and then I'm going to release a detailed report this week.
[03:24:30.576 --> 03:24:32.498]  It'll be up on zmedia.com.
[03:24:32.498 --> 03:24:34.701]  It'll also be up on band.video.
[03:24:34.701 --> 03:24:40.988]  I think the world really needs to see this report and understand the extent of what these people have planned.
[03:24:41.548 --> 03:24:59.848]  This legislation, I'm repeating, applies to all of Australia and they are writing it in to the law that they can then go and take citizens to these quarantine facilities and forcefully inject them and I'm not even kidding, this is what the law says.
[03:24:59.848 --> 03:25:03.292]  So it talks about notifiable conditions.
[03:25:04.105 --> 03:25:11.230]  In this legislation and it says it uses words like declared health services to minimize infection risks.
[03:25:11.230 --> 03:25:28.623]  So basically what it allows for is the chief health officers of whatever state to convert certain health services to quarantine facilities or nominate health services for the purpose of quarantining people.
[03:25:28.623 --> 03:25:33.307]  It talks about protecting children and responding to public health emergencies.
[03:25:34.375 --> 03:25:38.758]  Now, there's so much in here about public health.
[03:25:38.758 --> 03:25:56.451]  We recently had a bill pass in the state of Queensland, which is very, very similar to what Gavin Newsom has just introduced in his state, which basically makes what one Australian doctor described to me on air as it turns doctors into agents of the governments.
[03:25:56.451 --> 03:26:02.936]  They are not allowed to disagree with anything that would undermine public health or public confidence.
[03:26:03.846 --> 03:26:06.267]  In the government's recommended program.
[03:26:06.267 --> 03:26:14.189]  I mentioned before that the World Health Organization has released their plan to vaccinate, introduce 500 new vaccines by the year 2030.
[03:26:14.189 --> 03:26:20.710]  I recently interviewed Professor Dolores Carhill and she says we are in the killing years of Agenda 21.
[03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:21.571]  It's between the years 2020 and 2026.
[03:26:23.598 --> 03:26:42.888]  So it's no wonder that they're introducing all of this by that year and then Australia's pandemic preparedness plan that they've released in conjunction with CSIRO, who was previously involved or accused of being involved in gain-of-function research in Wuhan and has been involved in weather modification activities in Australia previously.
[03:26:43.763 --> 03:26:47.810]  They want this pandemic preparedness plan in place by 2027.
[03:26:47.810 --> 03:26:52.136]  And what people really need to grasp is that this is a slow burn plan.
[03:26:52.136 --> 03:26:54.220]  They're not going to do it suddenly.
[03:26:54.978 --> 03:27:05.042]  Again, so soon after COVID, that all of these little things that they're writing into the law right now will enable them to, at the drop of a hat, do it to you again.
[03:27:05.042 --> 03:27:07.683]  So people need to remain involved in this information.
[03:27:07.683 --> 03:27:08.463]  But I will go on.
[03:27:08.463 --> 03:27:12.144]  It gives power to state or local governments.
[03:27:12.144 --> 03:27:13.385]  The Public Health Act of 2005
[03:27:14.898 --> 03:27:17.080]  Last updated 7th of September 2022.
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:24.446]  It allows them to remove anything from a place, kill animals and tell people how long they cannot use a place.
[03:27:24.446 --> 03:27:32.954]  So say they decide that your home or your place of residence or your place of work is not safe, for whatever reason they can shut down an establishment indefinitely.
[03:27:34.691 --> 03:27:40.055]  And it says that they have to go to a magistrate to get enforcement orders or warrants.
[03:27:40.055 --> 03:27:53.925]  Essentially, the only criteria of whoever these authorised officers are, that are going and applying for these things, is that they need to just believe that someone will be a risk to public health.
[03:27:53.925 --> 03:28:03.853]  They just need to have reasonable belief that an area could be at risk to a public health emergency or a notifiable condition.
[03:28:04.969 --> 03:28:07.651]  So there's no real evidence required.
[03:28:07.651 --> 03:28:08.752]  They just have to believe it.
[03:28:08.752 --> 03:28:20.221]  And there are multiple places inside this legislation where they've actually allowed for this to be overridden, the need for it to go through a magistrate and the due process.
[03:28:20.221 --> 03:28:23.384]  Because if it's an emergency, they can just go ahead and do it.
[03:28:23.384 --> 03:28:30.730]  They make special note of these notifiable health conditions, which is essentially whatever they define as notifiable, they can make it influenza.
[03:28:31.744 --> 03:28:38.511]  And they've also listed this in the preparedness plan, the Australian pandemic preparedness plan that I keep making reference to.
[03:28:38.511 --> 03:28:45.298]  They've spoken about how influenza is going to be a pandemic driver and we need to be prepared for it.
[03:28:45.298 --> 03:28:51.944]  Talks about the powers of people like contact tracing officers and I'll get into that right on the other side of this break.
[03:28:51.944 --> 03:28:53.346]  You don't want to miss this next part.
[03:28:56.283 --> 03:29:07.528]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:29:07.528 --> 03:29:09.429]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:29:09.429 --> 03:29:10.890]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:29:10.890 --> 03:29:12.411]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:29:12.411 --> 03:29:14.132]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:29:14.132 --> 03:29:15.392]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:29:15.392 --> 03:29:16.773]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:29:17.193 --> 03:29:22.037]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:29:22.037 --> 03:29:24.440]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[03:29:24.440 --> 03:29:26.461]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:29:26.461 --> 03:29:33.408]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:29:34.048 --> 03:29:39.434]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:29:39.434 --> 03:29:48.385]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[03:29:55.987 --> 03:29:59.168]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[03:29:59.168 --> 03:30:03.710]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[03:30:03.710 --> 03:30:05.391]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[03:30:05.391 --> 03:30:09.292]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[03:30:09.292 --> 03:30:13.194]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[03:30:13.194 --> 03:30:15.735]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[03:30:15.735 --> 03:30:16.895]  It does just give you more energy.
[03:30:16.895 --> 03:30:18.056]  It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[03:30:18.536 --> 03:30:24.739]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[03:30:24.739 --> 03:30:29.141]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[03:30:29.141 --> 03:30:33.183]  Take a few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[03:30:33.183 --> 03:30:34.664]  Plus, it funds the InfoWar.
[03:30:34.664 --> 03:30:38.486]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[03:30:56.077 --> 03:30:58.940]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[03:30:58.940 --> 03:31:05.806]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge, tip of the spear.
[03:31:05.806 --> 03:31:09.149]  And when we talk about the products at InfoWarStore.com, they all blow you away.
[03:31:09.872 --> 03:31:10.132]  I think so.
[03:31:29.085 --> 03:31:38.687]  So X3, despite the fact it was run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:31:38.687 --> 03:31:41.348]  And it funds the Info War, which is a 360 win.

[03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:20.273]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[03:32:20.273 --> 03:32:27.396]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[03:32:27.396 --> 03:32:30.017]  Essential means without these things you die.
[03:32:30.017 --> 03:32:38.101]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.

[03:32:58.111 --> 03:33:04.014]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.872 --> 03:33:13.914]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.914 --> 03:33:23.181]  Today we're talking about insane legislation that has been introduced into Australia and we're talking about the Public Health Act of 2005.
[03:33:23.181 --> 03:33:28.105]  Going on from what we were saying before, the contact tracing officers have been given these powers
[03:33:28.871 --> 03:33:37.534]  That they only need to reasonably suspect that a person has a notifiable condition or may have been in contact with someone who has a notifiable condition.
[03:33:37.534 --> 03:33:39.355]  It literally says may have been.
[03:33:39.355 --> 03:33:46.838]  So there's no proof required of the fact that this person is actually sick.
[03:33:46.838 --> 03:33:49.819]  And again, they tested this during COVID.
[03:33:49.819 --> 03:33:54.581]  They put a lady named Hayley Hodgson into a quarantine facility
[03:33:55.330 --> 03:33:57.493]  Because she was a close contact.
[03:33:57.493 --> 03:34:09.870]  Even though she was negative, she was a close contact and she breached her home quarantine conditions and therefore she was taken against her will to Howard Springs
[03:34:10.690 --> 03:34:12.692]  Quarantine facility in the Northern Territory.
[03:34:12.692 --> 03:34:15.253]  This was an example of what is going to happen.
[03:34:15.253 --> 03:34:17.775]  And we see what's happening to the people of China right now.
[03:34:17.775 --> 03:34:19.956]  They're taking them to these quarantine facilities.
[03:34:19.956 --> 03:34:21.857]  They're building more and more of these.
[03:34:21.857 --> 03:34:29.062]  They just announced over $300 million, if I'm not mistaken, dedicated to a new facility in China.
[03:34:29.062 --> 03:34:30.282]  Again, another one.
[03:34:30.282 --> 03:34:31.763]  I mean, look at this.
[03:34:31.763 --> 03:34:32.964]  What do you need?
[03:34:32.964 --> 03:34:36.306]  Something of this magnitude being built now, another $300 million.
[03:34:38.442 --> 03:34:45.524]  For what they're calling zero COVID policy, which we all know is not achievable and it is a lie, a means to control the people.
[03:34:45.524 --> 03:34:50.005]  They are building more and more of these all over the whole world.
[03:34:50.005 --> 03:34:58.887]  And in Australia, it's in this legislation, it says that the chief health officer may order detention if they suspect someone has a notifiable condition.
[03:34:59.707 --> 03:35:09.834]  They're expected to counsel that person on how they're affecting their community by potentially spreading this notifiable condition that they don't even have proof that that person has.
[03:35:09.834 --> 03:35:11.415]  But they don't have to.
[03:35:11.415 --> 03:35:16.598]  If it's an emergency, they don't even have to counsel that person or try and educate them.
[03:35:16.598 --> 03:35:24.023]  And it's interesting that they use the word counsel because this is very reminiscent of 1984 and the re-education camps.
[03:35:26.556 --> 03:35:34.883]  They want to re-educate you about what public health means and re-educate you about how you're putting the community at risk.
[03:35:35.677 --> 03:35:38.159]  By spreading, I don't know, a cough.
[03:35:38.159 --> 03:35:39.140]  It's unbelievable.
[03:35:39.140 --> 03:35:57.676]  It is unbelievable and the reason why they're doing this now and writing this into legislation is because they were so successful over the past two years in fooling the public and my hope and my prayer is that throughout this broadcast people will realise that we can never, ever, ever let them fool us like that again and they will try.
[03:35:57.676 --> 03:35:58.697]  Mark my words.
[03:35:58.697 --> 03:35:59.438]  Play this back.
[03:35:59.938 --> 03:36:08.083]  In a few years time and you will see that they will try this again unless we get a mass awakening happening but it is happening more and more.
[03:36:08.083 --> 03:36:20.069]  Now it says that these Chief Health Officers or Authorised Officers can apply for certain orders such as an initial examination order, a behavioural order or a detention order.
[03:36:20.069 --> 03:36:24.612]  There's different types of orders but essentially they can force you into a medical examination.
[03:36:25.333 --> 03:36:36.924]  They can force you into a behavioral assessment, which obviously includes someone who doesn't believe that this is a notifiable condition or that this is a real pandemic.
[03:36:36.924 --> 03:36:39.166]  You know, they allowed protests.
[03:36:40.342 --> 03:36:45.844]  Well, they didn't even allow them, actually, during the time of COVID, if you were protesting against vaccines.
[03:36:45.844 --> 03:36:51.585]  We had one of the largest protests, I think, in Australian history that was not allowed.
[03:36:51.585 --> 03:37:02.428]  Over 150,000 people turned up in Sydney in July of 2020 to a protest that was not allowed by the government to protest what was happening to us.
[03:37:02.428 --> 03:37:09.470]  And, you know, if the people just resisted more back then, if they didn't get scared by the heavy handedness of the police,
[03:37:10.525 --> 03:37:21.834]  They actually came back and said that they were using surveillance technology to look through and analyze mainstream media footage to then go and send fines to people that were at that protest.
[03:37:21.834 --> 03:37:28.419]  But if people stood up against it and kept going, you know, how many more times can they repeat the same tactics?
[03:37:28.419 --> 03:37:31.402]  We can't be afraid of standing up to tyranny.
[03:37:31.402 --> 03:37:32.162]  We just can't.
[03:37:32.162 --> 03:37:35.405]  There has to be no fear in the fight for freedom.
[03:37:36.824 --> 03:37:41.347]  So, these people can approve orders without the person being present.
[03:37:41.347 --> 03:37:46.591]  So, it also makes reference to people that run away when they know that this is happening.
[03:37:46.591 --> 03:37:52.355]  The fact that they can go and they can get a warrant to apprehend them at wherever they think that that person may be.
[03:37:52.355 --> 03:37:57.658]  A warrant to break into the home of wherever they think that person might be residing.
[03:37:57.658 --> 03:37:59.399]  It's absolute insanity.
[03:37:59.399 --> 03:38:04.743]  And we know that, for example, Israel was using their intelligence
[03:38:05.635 --> 03:38:06.175]  I don't know.
[03:38:35.464 --> 03:38:37.986]  This is written in the legislation.
[03:38:37.986 --> 03:38:40.368]  I want people to understand the insanity of this.
[03:38:40.368 --> 03:38:43.530]  We have this in our law.
[03:38:43.530 --> 03:38:45.251]  It's unbelievable.
[03:38:45.251 --> 03:38:52.136]  And it makes regular references to the person with the notifiable condition and their behaviour, putting others at risk.
[03:38:52.136 --> 03:38:57.100]  For example, not getting vaccinated.
[03:38:57.100 --> 03:38:59.802]  And again, we know that more vaccines are coming.
[03:38:59.802 --> 03:39:04.225]  This is the biggest moneymaker and depopulation tool that these people have.
[03:39:05.649 --> 03:39:12.873]  Pfizer's putting up the cost after they've added the COVID-19 injections to the child immunisation record.
[03:39:12.873 --> 03:39:34.345]  Pfizer shot up their profits and the cost of their injections because, I don't know, making money off killing kids is apparently fine these days and the mainstream media will support that and these people are disgusting and they will pay for what they've done to humanity, whether it's on this side of heaven or where they're going, which is hell.
[03:39:35.743 --> 03:39:46.414]  It then goes on to discuss how they must explain the details of the medical treatment to the person to give them an opportunity to submit.
[03:39:46.414 --> 03:39:52.260]  Give them the opportunity to submit before they use whatever force is necessary.
[03:39:52.260 --> 03:39:54.823]  Guys, I'm not kidding.
[03:39:55.734 --> 03:40:02.739]  This is in Australian law, and it's coming to you if you don't fight back against this.
[03:40:02.739 --> 03:40:08.262]  It also makes reference to what they call reckless spread of a notifiable condition.
[03:40:08.262 --> 03:40:23.753]  And in this section, it actually says that those who recklessly spread by not getting vaccinated aren't committing an offence under this particular section in this legislation, but they are subject
[03:40:24.195 --> 03:40:33.157]  to Criminal Code Section 317, which actually says that these people can be imprisoned for life.
[03:40:33.157 --> 03:40:37.479]  So they've made sure to write that special note there into this section.
[03:40:37.479 --> 03:40:41.300]  So I want to spend a bit of time breaking this down.
[03:40:41.300 --> 03:40:52.743]  They've purposely written here that reckless spread, they've alluded to the fact that this does, that reckless spread is attributed to those who have refused to get vaccinated.
[03:40:52.743 --> 03:40:52.983]  Right?
[03:40:54.115 --> 03:40:57.879]  Keep in mind, we're done with COVID-19 now, yeah?
[03:40:57.879 --> 03:40:59.861]  Biden says the pandemic's over.
[03:40:59.861 --> 03:41:10.790]  Australian mainstream keeps telling us that we have to move on from this, and Dominic Perrottet, the Premier of New South Wales, is talking about how we need to start focusing on smart cities now.
[03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:11.471]  Unbelievable.
[03:41:11.471 --> 03:41:13.933]  Shifting our focus.
[03:41:13.933 --> 03:41:19.518]  Meanwhile, the smart cities seek to control every single aspect of our lives.
[03:41:20.612 --> 03:41:28.696]  But this is actually talking about reckless spread, making reference to people that have not been vaccinated.
[03:41:28.696 --> 03:41:43.383]  And it says they're not committing a crime under this part of the legislation, but those who contribute to reckless spread of diseases are referenced under the criminal code, which does allow for imprisonment for life.
[03:41:44.318 --> 03:41:55.583]  For anyone who's been accused and proven of spreading a notifiable condition or a transmittable disease or a dangerous disease, which we know.
[03:41:55.583 --> 03:41:59.145]  They told us COVID was deadly.
[03:41:59.145 --> 03:42:05.008]  They told us that it was easily transmitted from person to person.
[03:42:05.008 --> 03:42:08.950]  I don't know about you, but I attended protests in the middle of lockdowns.
[03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:10.811]  I hugged and kissed people.
[03:42:10.811 --> 03:42:13.552]  I'm not saying that people weren't getting sick.
[03:42:14.284 --> 03:42:16.925]  But the transmission that they told us was a lie.
[03:42:16.925 --> 03:42:21.166]  And it was a liar telling us that these so-called vaccines stopped that transmission.
[03:42:21.166 --> 03:42:29.229]  So what makes us think they won't lie to us again, considering it was so effective last time in controlling the people?
[03:42:29.229 --> 03:42:34.790]  And this type of information is literally crucial to your very existence.
[03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:37.391]  This information, if this was in the mainstream,
[03:42:38.436 --> 03:42:40.057]  This would be over tomorrow.
[03:42:40.057 --> 03:42:46.759]  The globalist control would be over tomorrow, but these people will never tell you the truth.
[03:42:46.759 --> 03:42:51.581]  Because the mainstream media is complicit in this genocide against humanity.
[03:42:51.581 --> 03:42:54.122]  It is absolutely crucial to get this out.
[03:42:54.122 --> 03:42:54.822]  Share this everywhere.
[03:42:54.822 --> 03:42:56.603]  I'll see you in a moment.
[03:42:56.603 --> 03:43:02.665]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[03:43:02.665 --> 03:43:05.746]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[03:43:06.852 --> 03:43:11.774]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[03:43:11.774 --> 03:43:16.155]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[03:43:16.155 --> 03:43:21.857]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[03:43:21.857 --> 03:43:26.439]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[03:43:26.439 --> 03:43:32.601]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[03:43:33.081 --> 03:43:45.050]  And that's why when you go to Infowarsstore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[03:43:45.050 --> 03:43:51.175]  The fight starts at Infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:51.175 --> 03:43:56.619]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[03:43:56.619 --> 03:43:59.882]  Think about a world without Infowars.
[03:44:01.448 --> 03:44:11.034]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[03:44:11.034 --> 03:44:27.263]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[03:44:27.263 --> 03:44:30.165]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[03:44:31.050 --> 03:44:37.656]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[03:44:37.656 --> 03:44:39.338]  I don't take the credit.
[03:44:39.338 --> 03:44:41.059]  I give you the credit.
[03:44:41.059 --> 03:44:43.681]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[03:44:43.681 --> 03:44:45.283]  It isn't going to give up.
[03:44:45.283 --> 03:44:47.124]  Without your support we could be shut down.

[03:45:03.246 --> 03:45:16.354]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the globalists and their censorship and tyranny.
[03:45:17.034 --> 03:45:31.102]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.

[03:45:39.171 --> 03:45:41.633]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[03:45:41.633 --> 03:45:46.275]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[03:45:57.481 --> 03:45:59.844]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[03:45:59.844 --> 03:46:01.445]  It's the bad halogen.
[03:46:01.445 --> 03:46:05.289]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[03:46:05.289 --> 03:46:06.970]  What's the good halogen?
[03:46:06.970 --> 03:46:09.773]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[03:46:46.955 --> 03:46:50.976]  You know, in that ad, Alex just said the threat of the globalists
[03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:19.542]  And I really want to recap what that threat is.
[03:47:19.542 --> 03:47:25.608]  These people will kill adults and children without blinking an eyelid.
[03:47:25.608 --> 03:47:30.772]  They did it through lies, they did it through propaganda, they did it through fear, and they will do it again.
[03:47:30.772 --> 03:47:40.121]  And I want to reiterate that everything that I've shared with you today about these insane Australian laws is coming for the whole world.
[03:47:41.710 --> 03:47:43.851]  The plan is the same for everyone.
[03:47:43.851 --> 03:47:46.813]  Look how they operated in Loksep last time.
[03:47:46.813 --> 03:47:49.855]  And some people would think that some of that was chaotic.
[03:47:49.855 --> 03:47:50.936]  It wasn't chaotic.
[03:47:50.936 --> 03:47:53.357]  It was chaotic on purpose.
[03:47:53.357 --> 03:47:57.780]  They wanted to make it look like they needed a uniform approach next time.
[03:47:57.780 --> 03:48:02.763]  Because the fact that we didn't handle COVID well enough was because too many countries did different things.
[03:48:02.763 --> 03:48:08.986]  The World Health Organization is meeting in secret this week to talk about amendments to the international health regulations.
[03:48:08.986 --> 03:48:10.067]  Thanks for that, Joe Biden.
[03:48:11.420 --> 03:48:30.165]  These people are going to implement this worldwide, and while they're doing their plans through the World Health Organization treaty or international health regulations amendments, they are planning on superseding your country's constitution and the very laws that we've discussed here today, and I'll recap really quickly.
[03:48:30.165 --> 03:48:39.487]  Forced injections, breaking into people's homes without a warrant, seizing people, taking them to camps that they are building all over the world.
[03:48:40.675 --> 03:49:02.209]  And forcibly injecting them, refusing them the right... UN members interrogating citizens in quarantine camps and counselling them, aka re-educating them about public health so that they can jab 500 new vaccines into everyone in the world and it says no one left behind.
[03:49:02.209 --> 03:49:06.471]  That means they want to jab you all.
[03:49:06.471 --> 03:49:08.753]  Specifically talking about how those
[03:49:09.682 --> 03:49:17.467]  Who display dangerous behaviour in not getting vaccinated are referred to in the criminal code that seeks to imprison them for life.
[03:49:17.467 --> 03:49:24.591]  Do we understand the danger of what is coming our way if we don't put a stop to these people?
[03:49:24.591 --> 03:49:25.792]  I'm not understating this.
[03:49:27.037 --> 03:49:28.659]  This is not an exaggeration.
[03:49:28.659 --> 03:49:32.342]  It is written into law and everyone needs to know about this.
[03:49:32.342 --> 03:49:33.803]  The whole world needs to know about this.
[03:49:33.803 --> 03:49:41.270]  So I'm asking whoever is watching this broadcast, when it's posted separately as the fourth hour or send the whole show, the whole show is important.
[03:49:41.270 --> 03:49:43.813]  Everything that InfoWars tells you is important.
[03:49:44.844 --> 03:49:46.905]  But specifically this segment.
[03:49:46.905 --> 03:49:48.145]  Share it everywhere.
[03:49:48.145 --> 03:49:49.966]  Replay it if you've missed the start.
[03:49:49.966 --> 03:49:54.907]  We're talking about the Public Health Act of 2005 in Australia that covers all states.
[03:49:54.907 --> 03:49:58.008]  They've just amended it as of the 7th of September 2022.
[03:49:58.008 --> 03:50:00.269]  It's over 400 pages long.
[03:50:00.269 --> 03:50:07.211]  I will be releasing a more detailed report on zmedia.com this week and it will be uploaded onto zmedia on band.video.
[03:50:07.811 --> 03:50:09.611]  Please share this everywhere.
[03:50:09.611 --> 03:50:14.273]  It is so crucial for people to know what these maniacs plan on doing.
[03:50:14.273 --> 03:50:20.354]  I cannot believe that we are at the point where they are writing this into law.
[03:50:20.354 --> 03:50:22.875]  It is outrageous.
[03:50:22.875 --> 03:50:24.355]  And I mean, there are no words.
[03:50:24.355 --> 03:50:25.595]  There are no words.
[03:50:25.595 --> 03:50:29.496]  These people want you dead.
[03:50:29.496 --> 03:50:33.537]  Just look at what they've done to Alex Jones through this ridiculous trial.
[03:50:35.410 --> 03:50:40.495]  This is an effort to silence free speech, but it's an example.
[03:50:40.495 --> 03:50:49.063]  It's an example through the current methods that they have, which is, you know, phony cases in court.
[03:50:49.063 --> 03:50:59.132]  Meanwhile, they're writing into legislation that they can take you by force and forcibly inject you in these places because you are a threat to so-called public health.
[03:51:01.596 --> 03:51:07.518]  And meanwhile, while they're doing all of this, they're also talking about liquefying human corpses in different places.
[03:51:07.518 --> 03:51:12.860]  We've got an example from Washington State, which legalized flesh goo, essentially.
[03:51:12.860 --> 03:51:21.643]  It's a mechanism for liquefying human corpses known as alkaline hydrolysis.
[03:51:21.643 --> 03:51:23.604]  Many of you would have heard of this.
[03:51:23.604 --> 03:51:25.985]  It went into effect, I believe, on May 1st, 2020.
[03:51:27.717 --> 03:51:39.822]  The law is RCW 68.50.110 and the passage refers to alkaline hydrolysis as the new legal means to dispose of human corpses.
[03:51:39.822 --> 03:51:53.688]  Washington State has developed this method to dispose of large masses of human bodies without having to dig mass graves or run incinerators, which would be detectable by drones.
[03:51:53.688 --> 03:51:56.989]  But I'm not, I'm not, it's not just Washington State that's done this.
[03:51:58.007 --> 03:52:05.532]  In the state of Queensland, Whitsunday Funerals in Mackay has applied to build the Gentle Way cremator.
[03:52:05.532 --> 03:52:07.213]  The Gentle Way.
[03:52:07.213 --> 03:52:09.375]  Listen to how they word this.
[03:52:09.375 --> 03:52:10.276]  It's unbelievable.
[03:52:10.276 --> 03:52:21.063]  And what they're saying is that after an application to build a traditional crematorium was rejected, a Queensland undertaker has lodged a new zero emissions plan to dissolve the departed.
[03:52:21.063 --> 03:52:23.745]  Zero emissions, of course, because this is good for climate change,
[03:52:24.545 --> 03:52:31.731]  Which is the new religion that they have introduced into the world for the good of Mother Earth or whatever the heck these people say.
[03:52:31.731 --> 03:52:40.317]  They're talking about this being environmentally friendly and any waste or emissions could operate in the back room.
[03:52:40.317 --> 03:52:44.480]  Sorry, this new technology does not result in any waste or emissions.
[03:52:44.480 --> 03:52:49.004]  So again, really hammering home that this is good for the climate if they do this.
[03:52:49.004 --> 03:52:51.446]  This is going to stop emissions
[03:52:53.387 --> 03:52:54.989]  Of cremating bodies.
[03:52:54.989 --> 03:52:57.372]  So let's just liquefy the human corpses.
[03:52:57.372 --> 03:52:58.253]  But why are they doing this?
[03:52:58.253 --> 03:53:00.575]  We'll go into that in a minute.
[03:53:00.575 --> 03:53:04.840]  There's actually a photo on that article, if the team can bring up the second photo that I sent through.
[03:53:04.840 --> 03:53:06.321]  It is so dystopian.
[03:53:06.321 --> 03:53:11.447]  It is unbelievable what these facilities look like.
[03:53:11.447 --> 03:53:13.449]  I mean, I look at it and I'm terrified.
[03:53:14.252 --> 03:53:15.833]  Hopefully we get that photo up very soon.
[03:53:15.833 --> 03:53:24.015]  There it is for everyone to see the new environmentally friendly way to liquefy human corpses coming to the state of Queensland.
[03:53:24.015 --> 03:53:29.697]  Of course, the state of Queensland first and foremost, because that's how they slip everything else through.
[03:53:29.697 --> 03:53:30.537]  California.
[03:53:30.537 --> 03:53:36.399]  Governor Gavin Newsom signs law allowing human bodies to be turned into garden soil.
[03:53:36.399 --> 03:53:40.420]  That article was posted on the 20th of September.
[03:53:41.624 --> 03:53:49.725]  I believe the legislation is AB351, which permits residents to select to have their remains composted after they die.
[03:53:50.481 --> 03:53:53.524]  This is enabled by the year 2027.
[03:53:53.524 --> 03:53:55.086]  Again, it's that key year of 2027.
[03:53:55.086 --> 03:54:11.762]  The Australian Pandemic Preparedness Plan says that we need to put these systems and measures in place by 2027, which, by the way, include collecting samples from human beings, so probably your DNA, regular monitoring and testing, so preemptively testing.
[03:54:12.362 --> 03:54:21.631]  No doubt using a faulty PCR that will produce the result of whatever so-called disease they're going to come up with.
[03:54:21.631 --> 03:54:23.653]  They'll just do what they did with COVID last time.
[03:54:23.653 --> 03:54:35.645]  The PCR, they'll run it at a higher cycle than what it's supposed to be run at and it'll detect whatever they want to be detected and they will create a new public health emergency the same way that they did last time.
[03:54:36.437 --> 03:54:42.981]  And of course, you know, we really need to talk about what sort of a precedent this sort of stuff sets.
[03:54:42.981 --> 03:54:51.006]  When you put this, these things into legislation, allowing human bodies to be turned into garden soil for the sake of climate change.
[03:54:51.006 --> 03:54:52.767]  I mean, I'm disgusted by this.
[03:54:52.767 --> 03:54:56.309]  I'm sure that anyone watching is disgusted by this.
[03:54:56.309 --> 03:55:00.411]  But it's the same thing as, you know, bake the cake.
[03:55:00.411 --> 03:55:01.492]  Just bake the cake.
[03:55:02.498 --> 03:55:04.280]  And everything will be okay.
[03:55:04.280 --> 03:55:06.221]  Don't stand up for your beliefs.
[03:55:06.221 --> 03:55:10.725]  Don't stand up for your religious freedom to say, no, actually that violates my conscience.
[03:55:10.725 --> 03:55:12.787]  I'm not okay with this.
[03:55:12.787 --> 03:55:14.108]  Please go see someone else.
[03:55:14.108 --> 03:55:17.692]  I'm sure there's someone out there who would be willing to bake the cake for you.
[03:55:17.692 --> 03:55:26.239]  I'm sure that people watching know what I'm talking about, but a few years ago, in case you don't, there was a couple that asked a bakery to make them a cake.
[03:55:26.239 --> 03:55:29.342]  They were same-sex couple getting married and the bakery didn't want to do it.
[03:55:30.746 --> 03:55:43.829]  And rightfully so, because if it violates your conscience, you should have the right to say, I'm so sorry, this is a violation of my conscience and my religion, I can't do this for you, but just go see Tom down the road, he'll do it for you.
[03:55:43.829 --> 03:55:45.730]  But no!
[03:55:45.730 --> 03:55:53.472]  We want to sue these people, or try to sue these people into oblivion, because you don't agree with me and you're violating my gay rights or whatever.
[03:55:55.310 --> 03:56:17.989]  And there's a double standard all the time with these people, but what I'm trying to establish here is this bake-the-cake precedent where we're introducing these things as new ideas, we're saying that this is okay now to sign laws allowing humans to be turned into compost and flesh goo.
[03:56:17.989 --> 03:56:21.672]  And the normalisation of this, what does it lead to later?
[03:56:22.518 --> 03:56:31.602]  Does it lead to the dissidents that have gone into these facilities when they don't want to comply with all the laws that I just told you about today?
[03:56:31.602 --> 03:56:35.284]  Does it set the precedent for them to be turned into flesh goo?
[03:56:35.284 --> 03:56:40.026]  And them to be composted to help climate change?
[03:56:40.026 --> 03:56:41.026]  We don't need these people.
[03:56:41.026 --> 03:56:42.207]  Our facilities are overrun.
[03:56:42.207 --> 03:56:47.769]  We've spent all this money on these quarantine facilities and these damn dissenters don't want to comply.
[03:56:48.916 --> 03:56:50.437]  They're going to be in prison for life anyway.
[03:56:50.437 --> 03:56:52.057]  Let's just liquefy them.
[03:56:52.057 --> 03:56:54.138]  I mean, it sounds crazy.
[03:56:54.138 --> 03:57:00.200]  It sounds crazy, but need I remind you of Soylent Green?
[03:57:00.200 --> 03:57:15.986]  Soylent Green, which by 2022, if you read the plot, says the cumulative effects of overpopulation, pollution and an apparent climate catastrophe have caused severe worldwide shortages of food, water and housing.
[03:57:15.986 --> 03:57:17.527]  So are we setting the precedent
[03:57:18.444 --> 03:57:28.529]  For the implementation of what we were shown in Soylent Green in their propaganda by the year 2027 because they keep talking about this year.
[03:57:28.529 --> 03:57:31.771]  And we know that this part of the agenda ends in 2030.
[03:57:31.771 --> 03:57:34.192]  It's been an honour to be with you all today.

[03:58:47.635 --> 03:58:52.518]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globalist.
[03:58:52.518 --> 03:58:58.921]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:58:58.921 --> 03:59:04.044]  We are engaging the Globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:59:04.044 --> 03:59:05.764]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:59:05.764 --> 03:59:12.188]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support an InfoWars are the real reason you have this success.
[03:59:12.908 --> 03:59:18.330]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the Newell Order we've ever had.
[03:59:18.330 --> 03:59:22.651]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.

[03:59:35.375 --> 03:59:40.717]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:59:41.397 --> 03:59:42.719]  The fight is my fight.
[03:59:42.719 --> 03:59:43.359]  It's your fight.
[03:59:43.359 --> 03:59:44.100]  It's our fight.
