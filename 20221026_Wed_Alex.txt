[00:00.000 --> 00:26.560]  It's Wednesday, October 26, 2022, I'm your host Alex Jones, and I'm about to play in
[00:26.560 --> 00:33.720]  the next segment, a clip of Yvon Noah Harari, the high priest of the World Economic Forum,
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.040]  that's what they call him, laying out their ultimate in-game secret.
[00:39.040 --> 00:45.000]  They are engineering the artificial collapse of human civilization, and the quote, elites,
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.240]  as he calls himself, and the other globalist, are going to extract the technological know-how
[00:50.240 --> 00:57.560]  and resources of human Earth while they cut it off from us to build undersea, underground,
[00:57.560 --> 01:05.360]  and space-based redoubts that will protect them from the organized collapse of civilization.
[01:05.360 --> 01:10.320]  And that's what the COVID release was, was a beta test of far more deadly bio weapons
[01:10.320 --> 01:12.160]  they're planning to release.
[01:12.160 --> 01:19.320]  Remember Ian Fleming was number two in the OSS, and very high level in MI6 after World
[01:19.320 --> 01:26.840]  War II, and he wrote the James Bond books, and one of them was Moon Raker before we even
[01:26.840 --> 01:33.160]  gone to space, and in it he described a group of mad scientists that wanted depopulation
[01:33.160 --> 01:38.680]  building a space station they can go to, while on Earth a deadly bio weapon is released that
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.640]  will kill all life on Earth, they can then return with all the best genetic specimens
[01:43.640 --> 01:46.880]  and the Earth will be basically like a national park for them.
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.280]  We've now seen statements like this out of Jeff Bezos, and we've now seen statements
[01:52.280 --> 01:57.280]  like this out of basically all of the globalist except Elon Musk who says he wants a pro-human
[01:57.280 --> 02:01.680]  future and he's actually more and more moving towards our direction of standing against
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.680]  it.
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.040]  I don't know if he's hedging his bets, but regardless he's saying and doing the right
[02:06.040 --> 02:13.360]  things, but all of them from Bill Gates to Klaus Schwab to Tim Cook are espousing this.
[02:13.360 --> 02:16.440]  This is their transhumanist religion.
[02:16.440 --> 02:22.920]  So when we come back from break, we are going to play the latest clip of Yvonne Noah Harari
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.000]  spilling his guts to the world and admitting the plan.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.840]  And it's not just what Harari is saying, all the major globalist publications and television
[02:32.840 --> 02:37.520]  programs both fiction and non-fiction promote a world without humans and how great it's
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.840]  going to be and how we're bad for the planet and how this cataclysm is coming sometime
[02:41.840 --> 02:45.280]  after 2030 and our populations got to be reduced.
[02:45.280 --> 02:51.040]  So what they're doing is corralling us, locking us down, taking away our resources, turning
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.560]  us against each other while they build what they believe an accelerated path of evolution
[02:56.560 --> 03:02.560]  to merge with cybernetic systems and genetic engineering systems to become quote, God's.
[03:02.560 --> 03:06.560]  You've all heard Harari make similar statements to that where he actually says we are going
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.560]  to be God's.
[03:07.560 --> 03:12.080]  Ray Kurzweil, the head futurist at Google says I don't believe in God yet, but I'm going
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.760]  to become a God, but for them to become a God they must play God and artificially create
[03:18.760 --> 03:26.040]  a cascade of cataclysms or Armageddon's that lead to this planetary crisis out of which
[03:26.040 --> 03:34.160]  they build their breakaway civilization or their Noah's arcs, not arcs, arcs to separate
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.000]  themselves from humanity.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.920]  They believe it is their evolutionary job to cull us and to carry the sound and that
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.000]  we're too stupid when they publicly admit their plans to speak out against them and
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.400]  to resist them and to build a different cosmology for a different future.
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.400]  If we don't lay out other ideas and other destinies for people to get behind, we then
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.080]  cede the entire brain trust and future to these monsters.
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.680]  This could not be a more important issue.
[04:03.680 --> 04:06.560]  This is the central issue of the elite capture.
[04:06.560 --> 04:09.640]  Yes, the megacorporations of the world are out of the comments China.
[04:09.640 --> 04:11.240]  Yes, they control the media.
[04:11.240 --> 04:13.840]  Yes, they control most academia and the banks.
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.480]  And yes, they are selling us that we deserve to die and that this is just part of a foregone
[04:19.480 --> 04:25.520]  conclusion, a self-fulfilling prophecy that for them to transcend, we must die.
[04:25.520 --> 04:32.280]  They are self-appointed doing what Hitler did, but on a much wider, more complex scale.
[04:32.280 --> 04:33.560]  And that's why they're dividing us.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.640]  That's why they're poisoning us.
[04:34.640 --> 04:36.200]  That's why they're dumbing us down.
[04:36.200 --> 04:39.720]  That's why they're trying to destroy all the educational systems, turn us into a bunch
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.880]  of mindless idiots so that we don't contend for them for the future.
[04:43.880 --> 04:47.720]  This is a war for the future, a war for the world, a war for the species.
[04:47.720 --> 04:48.720]  We are at the crossroads.
[04:48.720 --> 04:51.600]  Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday broadcast.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.600]  We're going to go to break.
[04:52.600 --> 04:56.640]  I'm going to come back and lay all of this critical information out.
[04:56.640 --> 04:58.280]  Nothing is more important than this information.
[04:58.280 --> 05:00.280]  Stay with us.
[05:00.280 --> 05:02.680]  It's our best seller.
[05:02.680 --> 05:07.160]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[05:07.160 --> 05:11.720]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[05:11.720 --> 05:15.680]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[05:15.680 --> 05:19.080]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[05:19.080 --> 05:24.520]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.520]  function of the body.
[05:25.520 --> 05:30.320]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[05:30.320 --> 05:32.440]  need to live and be healthy.
[05:32.440 --> 05:35.160]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[05:35.160 --> 05:36.880]  And so much of the food is debased.
[05:36.880 --> 05:42.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  with a product like this.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.680]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[05:46.680 --> 05:50.200]  very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the infill war.
[05:50.200 --> 05:54.360]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[05:54.360 --> 05:58.160]  back in stock at infillwarstore.com for 50% off.
[05:58.160 --> 06:05.160]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, infillwarstore.com.
[06:28.160 --> 06:35.160]  It's Wednesday, October 26, 2022, I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm about to lay out
[06:35.160 --> 06:42.620]  the most important information on this planet without a doubt.
[06:42.620 --> 06:48.760]  This is the most central, critical information facing not just our species, but all life
[06:48.760 --> 06:51.720]  on this planet.
[06:51.720 --> 06:57.280]  The globalists are transhumanist technocrats who believe they are forcing an accelerated
[06:57.280 --> 07:06.960]  evolution of humanity into a new uber-mentioned or super-species that is a hybridized homo sapien
[07:06.960 --> 07:15.680]  sapien merge with new biotech and cybernetic forms of life, and they believe they are the
[07:15.680 --> 07:17.960]  guardians of this planet.
[07:17.960 --> 07:25.600]  And to step into that position, they need to play God and need to carry out the forced
[07:25.600 --> 07:29.880]  depopulation of at least 90% of Earth.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.320]  Now I've been talking about this for 28 years on air because I've been reading their own
[07:33.320 --> 07:38.400]  reports, their own books, their own white papers, and watching their speeches on C-SPAM.
[07:38.400 --> 07:43.320]  And now we've gone from this being a very esoteric thing decades ago to being out of
[07:43.320 --> 07:51.240]  the open because they're going from testing phase or beta phase into operational phase.
[07:51.240 --> 07:55.480]  And we've played a lot of clips here on air of the high priest of the World Economic Forum,
[07:55.480 --> 08:01.320]  a medieval studies professor, Yuval Noah Harari, who did not come up with any of these ideas
[08:01.320 --> 08:02.320]  himself.
[08:02.320 --> 08:05.480]  They're actually ideas of Julian Huxley and others that first founded the transhumanist
[08:05.480 --> 08:09.720]  movement after World War II, changing the name from the World Eugenics Society to the
[08:09.720 --> 08:16.200]  World Transhumanist Society, to forcibly take control of what they believe is human evolution
[08:16.200 --> 08:20.400]  and again merge humans with advanced biotech and machines.
[08:20.400 --> 08:25.720]  So before that process can be carried out, they have to step into the evolutionary position
[08:25.720 --> 08:33.520]  of God in their words and direct the direction of human development.
[08:33.520 --> 08:39.640]  There's a new clip of Noah Yuval Harari that we're about to play in a moment where he explains
[08:39.640 --> 08:41.840]  the big secret of secrets.
[08:41.840 --> 08:43.680]  The general public's not going to make it.
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.920]  The general public's going to be destroyed in a cataclysm, in a flood-like event that
[08:48.920 --> 08:52.640]  they're going to orchestrate and implement, and that the elites will then steal all the
[08:52.640 --> 09:00.120]  technological development and ideas of humanity to build their escape ship off of the earth.
[09:00.120 --> 09:05.440]  Now national media in the last 20 years made a lot of fun of me when I explained that interdimensional
[09:05.440 --> 09:11.520]  off-world influence, the Bible tells us is Satan, is manipulating humans here on the planet
[09:11.520 --> 09:18.120]  to build a escape system to get off the planet in which this interdimensional entity is trapped
[09:18.120 --> 09:25.600]  in a vortex, and that we are actually more advanced than this fallen species that's more
[09:25.600 --> 09:32.840]  robotic the way it's described in the bottom Bible, and that it is, again, seeking to manipulate
[09:32.840 --> 09:40.000]  us into building this new system that it can then escape with.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.480]  Now again, this sounds completely fantastical and wild, but you'll notice now in a moment
[09:45.480 --> 09:50.160]  that Yuval Harari says exactly that, that the elites are going to break away from humanity,
[09:50.160 --> 09:56.000]  become a new species, and escape in a new Noah's Ark from humanity.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.440]  The reason I've been laying this out for years is studying their documents, their reports.
[10:01.440 --> 10:04.120]  This is actually what they believe.
[10:04.120 --> 10:10.920]  That's why we've seen Elon Musk begin to break with these globalists and openly say,
[10:10.920 --> 10:17.080]  we wear those that worship AI gods, and those that believe they're going to become AI gods,
[10:17.080 --> 10:20.840]  because they've made the decision that you don't deserve to go into the future, and they've
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.840]  made the decision that they're going to direct every facet of not just human life, but all
[10:25.840 --> 10:28.480]  life on this planet.
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.160]  Here is the short 56 second clip of Harari laying out their plan.
[10:34.160 --> 10:42.240]  You have a small elite that pushes things in its own interests, even if it doesn't benefit
[10:42.240 --> 10:44.160]  the vast majority of the population.
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.400]  This has happened so many times previously in history, and it's probably going to happen
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.400]  again.
[10:50.400 --> 11:01.840]  One of the biggest dangers to the planet today is this technological utopia, because probably
[11:01.840 --> 11:04.560]  for the elite it will work.
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.160]  If bad comes to worst, and when the flood comes, the scientists will build a Noah's
[11:10.160 --> 11:16.520]  Ark for the elite, leaving the rest to drown, the rest of the people, and then the rest
[11:16.520 --> 11:17.520]  of the ecosystem.
[11:17.520 --> 11:24.040]  But they are likely to be able to construct this technological Noah's Ark, which is probably
[11:24.040 --> 11:27.000]  what much of the elite is counting on.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.920]  There are countless other clips we've played of Harari that I would remind you of.
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.520]  A few months ago he said, he doesn't believe in God, but that we're going to become gods,
[11:35.520 --> 11:39.960]  similar to what Ray Kurzweil and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and others have said.
[11:39.960 --> 11:42.160]  This is their transhumanist cult.
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.120]  This is their, get out of jail, free card, live forever system.
[11:46.120 --> 11:48.000]  This is their ethos.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.760]  This is their religion.
[11:51.760 --> 11:58.520]  When you study the Bible, and you study other ancient texts from Mesopotamia and other areas
[11:58.520 --> 12:03.000]  of the world, it's the same story repeated over and over and over again.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.840]  That's why in the movie Prometheus, in the prequel to the Alien series, you see this
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.760]  same Anunnaki line coming to Earth, creating humans, and then deciding to come back and
[12:14.760 --> 12:15.760]  destroy us.
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.840]  When the Bible, it says that God, who also created the Anunnaki, and us, decided to
[12:20.840 --> 12:26.280]  destroy the Anunnaki, and most humans on Earth, because they were manipulating the genetics
[12:26.280 --> 12:27.280]  of humans.
[12:27.280 --> 12:30.560]  They say, well, that's just a book, or, you know, that was written in ancient times.
[12:30.560 --> 12:34.760]  Who knows if the Sumerians or the Israelites are before them, the Jews were correct.
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.840]  But regardless, the globalists are manifesting everything that's in the Bible, and everything
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.120]  that's in the Sumerian text, and everything that's in the Vedic text that are over 3,000
[12:44.120 --> 12:45.560]  years old from India.
[12:45.560 --> 12:47.120]  It's all the same story.
[12:47.120 --> 12:48.320]  They believe it.
[12:48.320 --> 12:49.320]  They know it.
[12:49.320 --> 12:56.680]  That's why Revelation, written by John the Revelator, the Isle of Patmos 2,000 years ago, is being
[12:56.680 --> 13:02.080]  followed exactly with a world government, three global regions, ten sub-regions, a mark
[13:02.080 --> 13:05.640]  in the forehead and hand to buy and sell.
[13:05.640 --> 13:09.800]  Everything in there describes how everyone on Earth will be able to watch the beast when
[13:09.800 --> 13:14.760]  it communicates to them and gives the public orders, and engages in signs and wonders, and
[13:14.760 --> 13:21.280]  cures the sick, and ends war, and brings in global peace, but only for a very, very short
[13:21.280 --> 13:29.440]  time, and that is the AI system of the beast system that serves the Antichrist.
[13:29.440 --> 13:35.960]  So pull back and look at Yvonne O'Haraari and all of his different statements.
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.000]  And if you put them together and read his books and watch his speeches, it's everything
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.240]  the Bible says.
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.760]  He even quotes the Bible.
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.640]  But he's put himself and the other globalists in the place of God who are building this
[13:48.640 --> 13:55.240]  technological Noah's Ark or breakaway civilization to separate themselves from us, while they
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.080]  teach us we're failed, while they teach us that we've got to die to save the Earth, while
[13:59.080 --> 14:06.200]  they go after our life force, our self-preservation instinct, so that we will stand down, not
[14:06.200 --> 14:12.280]  create our own dreams, our own ideas, and hand total control of these monsters to the
[14:12.280 --> 14:15.520]  future development of our species.
[14:15.520 --> 14:20.040]  They know there have been previous cataclysms on this planet, and now they're trying to artificially
[14:20.040 --> 14:27.480]  create a cascade of cataclysms where they position themselves as God and basically manipulate
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.040]  humanity into the idea that we deserve to be destroyed and starved to death and hit
[14:32.040 --> 14:38.400]  with radiologicals and 5G and bio weapons because we are bad for the Earth, that the
[14:38.400 --> 14:43.400]  viruses don't come out of labs, they come out of the jungles because of global warming.
[14:43.400 --> 14:50.520]  These people are self-appointed globalist control freaks, hell-bent and completely dedicated
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.200]  to ensuring that none of us are able to make decisions about the future development of
[14:55.200 --> 14:56.200]  our species.
[14:56.200 --> 15:21.200]  When we come back, I'm going to lay out the ways we can expose these people and stop them.
[15:21.200 --> 15:34.680]  Attack and threaten, because we are effective, the great awakening is here, go to band.video,
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.080]  download the videos and share.
[15:39.080 --> 16:05.840]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[16:05.840 --> 16:11.520]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.160]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[16:15.160 --> 16:19.560]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over, and
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.680]  all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[16:24.680 --> 16:29.880]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[16:29.880 --> 16:35.120]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com
[16:35.120 --> 16:36.120]  it changes the world.
[16:36.120 --> 16:41.120]  And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products that empower you
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.800]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the

[20:14.200 --> 20:26.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining us on this live Wednesday broadcast.
[20:26.200 --> 20:31.920]  I'm Troyer and a ton of news and analysis is coming up here in the next segment, but
[20:31.920 --> 20:36.000]  I wanted to continue with the most important issue in the world.
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  This is a spiritual battle.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.480]  There is good and evil in the universe.
[20:40.480 --> 20:42.520]  Humans are made in the image of God.
[20:42.520 --> 20:46.440]  Whatever we envision, give it enough time and energy we're able to build.
[20:46.440 --> 20:50.000]  I think how far humans have come the last six, seven thousand years.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.440]  Think about how far we can go and the globalists know this and they're in a race to control
[20:55.440 --> 21:01.040]  the future and create a new dark age for the general public or a Hunger Games type scenario
[21:01.040 --> 21:08.760]  where a massively depopulated group of serfs live basically in subsistence level dark age
[21:08.760 --> 21:16.160]  farming systems for the controllers and the controllers live in high tech compact cities
[21:16.160 --> 21:20.920]  and then build off world spaces and more.
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.400]  So they've decided to take control of human development.
[21:24.400 --> 21:29.120]  They've decided to try to steal the future from humanity while at the same time selling
[21:29.120 --> 21:34.800]  us a cosmology and a self-fulfilling prophecy that we're bad and we're evil and we're ugly
[21:34.800 --> 21:40.280]  and we need to advocate our responsibility and our will and turn it over to sickening
[21:40.280 --> 21:44.360]  control freaks like Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and Yvonne Harari.
[21:44.360 --> 21:50.240]  If you just joined us last segment, I played the clip and it's just one of hundreds where
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.600]  he openly declares that the elite is going to break away using the science and technology
[21:55.600 --> 22:01.560]  we have and the resources of humanity and build an Elysium field type or moon raker
[22:01.560 --> 22:07.320]  type scenario where they are exempt from the hell they rain down on us.
[22:07.320 --> 22:12.200]  That we are simply here extracting resources from the earth to provide them with the science,
[22:12.200 --> 22:19.880]  the technology, and the know-how so they can escape their own system that they have helped
[22:19.880 --> 22:20.880]  develop.
[22:20.880 --> 22:28.280]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is a revelation writ large out in the open for the whole
[22:28.280 --> 22:35.840]  world to see because what the mainline churches don't teach you and what you don't see anywhere
[22:35.840 --> 22:41.280]  but in the globalist-owned admissions is what the Antichrist system is actually trying
[22:41.280 --> 22:42.360]  to build.
[22:42.360 --> 22:44.720]  They want to be God.
[22:44.720 --> 22:46.800]  They want to go interplanetary.
[22:46.800 --> 22:48.600]  They want to go interstellar.
[22:48.600 --> 22:50.280]  They want to go intergalactic.
[22:50.280 --> 22:55.360]  They want to go interdimensional with the CERN, superconducting, supercollider cyclotron,
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.040]  with their fission, fusion, artificial suns and black holes they are creating.
[22:59.040 --> 23:05.080]  They are endangering the whole planet, rolling the dice in the attempt to become gods.
[23:05.080 --> 23:12.400]  They have already set themselves up in the position of playing God to decide who lives
[23:12.400 --> 23:13.600]  and who dies.
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.840]  Think of what they have just done in the last three years, cooking up a deadly virus, releasing
[23:17.840 --> 23:22.640]  the virus, then giving people deadly shots that create artificial nanotech clots in the
[23:22.640 --> 23:29.160]  body, massive increase in death, conservatively more than 10 million worldwide have died from
[23:29.160 --> 23:32.400]  the injections and they are just getting started.
[23:32.400 --> 23:38.320]  But because they see us as animals and because we act like animals, many of us don't organize
[23:38.320 --> 23:42.520]  and fight back against them, they believe it is their right and their duty to carry
[23:42.520 --> 23:46.880]  this out because it is social Darwinism, survival of the fittest.
[23:46.880 --> 23:51.960]  They believe they are filling the predator role in culling of the useless eaters.
[23:51.960 --> 23:56.720]  But the good news is this, they thought they still have us in lockdown.
[23:56.720 --> 23:59.280]  They thought they would still be rolling out forced injections.
[23:59.280 --> 24:00.920]  They thought the public would buckle.
[24:00.920 --> 24:04.520]  They thought their censorship would suppress those of us that were aware of what they were
[24:04.520 --> 24:08.760]  doing and that they would be far, far further ahead than they are now.
[24:08.760 --> 24:15.560]  In fact, they have been fought to a standstill, a stalemate and all over the world, from Sweden
[24:15.560 --> 24:23.240]  to Canada to Australia to Brazil to the UK to the US, leaders are rising and getting
[24:23.240 --> 24:28.200]  elected that are breaking with the WEF, breaking with the globalist agenda, breaking with
[24:28.200 --> 24:32.320]  the great reset and saying no to it over and over again.
[24:32.320 --> 24:34.640]  Here's just one great example.
[24:34.640 --> 24:40.720]  The new prime minister, the new prime minister, ladies and gentlemen, in Sweden came out,
[24:40.720 --> 24:45.920]  moved Christiansen and says they're getting rid of their environment ministry that works
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.360]  with the UN and the WEF and they're ending all the restrictions on farming, on methane,
[24:51.360 --> 24:52.960]  on carbon and everything else.
[24:52.960 --> 25:00.160]  And he came out and said it's all a fraud to control society and create serfs and slaves.
[25:00.160 --> 25:05.320]  Let me give you the name of the headline so you can find it from Armstrong Economics.
[25:05.320 --> 25:08.760]  Sweden will not meet agenda 2030.
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.640]  And there are just so many countless examples of that just today, but I wanted to give you
[25:14.640 --> 25:16.720]  just one.
[25:16.720 --> 25:21.080]  My friends, our situation is far from hopeless.
[25:21.080 --> 25:26.480]  They would need, as I say every day, to be censoring and attacking and suing and threatening
[25:26.480 --> 25:34.280]  and indicting patriot, pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-Earth individuals if we were
[25:34.280 --> 25:35.280]  defeated.
[25:35.280 --> 25:37.320]  In fact, we are far from defeated.
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.960]  We are promoting truth and justice and prosperity and chivalry and honor and real human competition
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.080]  that makes us stronger and makes us thrive so that the best of us can raise the rest
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.080]  of us up.
[25:50.080 --> 25:53.160]  The rising tide raises all ships.
[25:53.160 --> 25:59.280]  If you look at the evil, corrupt, degenerate Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah
[25:59.280 --> 26:07.720]  Harari and the rest of them like Ray Kurzweil, they are degenerate, gross, ugly, sickening,
[26:07.720 --> 26:13.480]  parasitic individuals that have quite literally made a deal with the devil for what they believe
[26:13.480 --> 26:20.040]  will be artificial immortality in a matrix-like system they're building.
[26:20.040 --> 26:23.480]  That's their promise of artificial life.
[26:23.480 --> 26:28.280]  But everything, just like their shots, and just like all their other systems is a fraud,
[26:28.280 --> 26:30.200]  it doesn't work.
[26:30.200 --> 26:31.360]  It's a scam.
[26:31.360 --> 26:36.000]  They're never going to give us access to the technology that our brain trust actually
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  created.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.400]  They will only give us access to poisoned, twisted systems that lower us and bring us
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.480]  closer to their spiritual wavelength and remove us from God.
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.520]  Because if we're connected to God in the infinite, we will be given a blueprint, we will be given
[26:53.520 --> 27:00.280]  a residence, we will be given a transmission by what the Bible calls the Holy Spirit to
[27:00.280 --> 27:05.640]  be able to have discernment and transcend the enemy's plan and actually build God's
[27:05.640 --> 27:09.920]  plan here on earth, heaven on earth.
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.960]  Revelation will be fulfilled, Daniel will be fulfilled, Ezekiel will be fulfilled, all
[27:13.960 --> 27:19.520]  of it will be fulfilled, the Antichrist will rise, we will have a technocracy, a large
[27:19.520 --> 27:23.880]  portion of the planet will be killed, Satan will then be bound and defeated for a thousand
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.200]  years and let loose yet again for a short time to test the faithful yet again, then
[27:30.200 --> 27:36.520]  at that point, this entire dimension, we think of as the third dimension, that is not a simulation,
[27:36.520 --> 27:42.040]  but is a artificial creation of God for us to be able to be tested, will be rolled up
[27:42.040 --> 27:49.000]  from its four corners like a scroll and will be disappeared into eternity.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.560]  And we will go forward with God into infinity.
[27:52.560 --> 27:57.240]  Now if that isn't heavy, I don't know what is, and the globalists know it's true, they're
[27:57.240 --> 28:04.280]  attempting to fill the void they see and be God and carry out and execute God's plan.
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.120]  Just as the Bible says, Satan is actually fulfilling God's plan and Satan even knows
[28:09.120 --> 28:10.120]  it.
[28:10.120 --> 28:16.440]  Satan simply wants to take as many souls as he can with him again in a hope that someday
[28:16.440 --> 28:23.880]  and some eon into the infinity, they will somehow be able to break away and escape to
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.580]  another artificial dimension from the system God's created.
[28:27.580 --> 28:32.280]  They are trying to run from God, we must run towards God, this is the truth.
[28:32.280 --> 28:36.600]  Noah, Yvall, Harari and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are not God, in fact they're the opposite
[28:36.600 --> 28:41.960]  of God, they are disconnected from God and by reaching out to God, we can and will transcend
[28:41.960 --> 28:42.960]  them.
[28:42.960 --> 28:47.680]  God is God or Satan, the choice is yours, even not making a choice is a choice.
[28:47.680 --> 28:59.680]  We'll be right back, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.960]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[29:04.960 --> 29:05.960]  you.
[29:05.960 --> 29:10.240]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence infowars because they rightly see
[29:10.240 --> 29:15.360]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[29:15.360 --> 29:19.520]  the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[29:19.520 --> 29:25.760]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links, infowars.com and
[29:25.760 --> 29:30.320]  to also financially support infowars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.200]  promo code 1776 at checkout to get additional 10% off.
[29:35.200 --> 29:38.800]  These people are coming for your birthright, they're coming for your First Amendment, they
[29:38.800 --> 29:42.080]  admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.080]  I'm in your hands, and I'm asking of your support now, you have my commitment to never
[29:46.080 --> 29:49.440]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[29:49.440 --> 29:52.880]  Thank you for all your past support, and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts

[29:58.960 --> 29:59.960]  and huge discounts.
[29:59.960 --> 30:06.120]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[30:06.120 --> 30:11.480]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[30:11.480 --> 30:15.320]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[30:15.320 --> 30:16.320]  to speak freely.
[30:16.320 --> 30:19.520]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[30:19.520 --> 30:21.000]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.160]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[30:25.160 --> 30:29.480]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[30:29.480 --> 30:30.480]  your support.
[30:30.480 --> 30:34.520]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[30:34.520 --> 30:38.120]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[30:38.120 --> 30:41.760]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[30:41.760 --> 30:43.440]  because of your past support.
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.320]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[33:43.840 --> 33:49.960]  If you just joined us here on this live Wednesday broadcast, I want to invite you to go to the
[33:49.960 --> 33:53.080]  archives and band up video later today.
[33:53.080 --> 33:58.640]  Once the analysis I just laid out is posted, it's only about 25 minutes long and it's
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.520]  so important whether you believe the globalists are going to be successful or not in creating
[34:04.520 --> 34:10.240]  the system they say they're building and they are building it, it's so central to understand
[34:10.240 --> 34:17.520]  that it's a nightmare authoritarian world where full control is taken over human development
[34:17.520 --> 34:23.160]  and human evolution in their words to not empower humanity but to depopulate the vast majority
[34:23.160 --> 34:29.160]  of us and on its ashes build their world, government, technocracy where they believe
[34:29.160 --> 34:31.240]  they're going to be gods.
[34:31.240 --> 34:36.600]  They have decided to bring down civilization as we know it and the adherents, the cult
[34:36.600 --> 34:40.360]  members that joined the system and go along with it, believe they're about to be given
[34:40.360 --> 34:44.520]  everlasting artificial life and be gods.
[34:44.520 --> 34:52.720]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a psychotic cult of transhumanists is setting up a planetary
[34:52.720 --> 34:58.800]  world government and their holy grail is life extension technology.
[34:58.800 --> 35:06.440]  I covered my film in game made in 2007 and it's more pertinent today because their agenda
[35:06.440 --> 35:09.080]  is now out of the open.
[35:09.080 --> 35:16.200]  That's why I ask listeners to realize that this broadcast is so important in the fight
[35:16.200 --> 35:21.040]  against these people because we have their battle plan, we have their number, we have
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.560]  their MO, their modus operandi and we know how to stop them.
[35:25.560 --> 35:32.240]  That's why the corporate media, the globalists left wing, the technocracy absolutely hate
[35:32.240 --> 35:37.280]  us because they want the public blissfully distracted by Netflix and sports and all
[35:37.280 --> 35:45.440]  the entertainment, not realizing that a forced planetary collapse and a new dark age is
[35:45.440 --> 35:48.480]  being implemented as we speak.
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.640]  That's why I want to thank the long-term listeners and viewers and also all the new
[35:51.640 --> 35:56.680]  viewers that are tuning in because without you, humanity literally would not have a fighting
[35:56.680 --> 35:57.680]  chance.
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.360]  That's why it's important to take time out to thank the crew, all of our AM and FM affiliates
[36:02.360 --> 36:08.080]  our TV affiliates, our sponsors, our listeners and viewers particularly and all the prominent
[36:08.080 --> 36:12.680]  people that now realize that our analysis has been dead on and understand that the globalists
[36:12.680 --> 36:17.640]  are coming after us because we're on to something, we're on to the new world order agenda and
[36:17.640 --> 36:19.000]  we know how to stop it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.960]  Not just resisting their agenda, not just exposing their agenda, not just warning the
[36:22.960 --> 36:29.000]  public about their operations but also promoting a better system that's pro-human, that's based
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.440]  on truth and justice and in God and family and competition.
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.320]  I'm about to hand the baton to Owen Schreuer in the big broadcast he's got lined up today
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.880]  but I just want to encourage listeners again to let it sink in that you're the reason
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.120]  Info Wars is still here despite the desperate globalist attacks and that they're far from
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.280]  all powerful and that when you take action nothing can stop you so please take advantage

[39:05.200 --> 39:12.320]  here and tell you what's coming up we are going to be joined in the next hour and for
[39:12.320 --> 39:20.200]  the hour by Steve Bannon and Jack to talk about all kinds of midterm election issues
[39:20.200 --> 39:27.120]  specifically the debates that have just happened where Federman was just an unmitigated disaster
[39:27.120 --> 39:36.960]  and the only defense that the democrat media collusion has is oh he's a victim of a stroke
[39:36.960 --> 39:40.800]  oh he's recovering from a stroke so before it was he's fine it's no problem his health
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.400]  is fine then you see the debate last night and the disaster that Federman is and it's
[39:45.400 --> 39:51.240]  well he's recovering from a stroke and that's basically all they can do to promote him but
[39:51.240 --> 39:59.560]  every poll had Oz winning last night's debate in a landslide folks if you watched it I mean
[39:59.560 --> 40:04.280]  you know how bad it was there's really no words to describe it's actually sad it's actually
[40:04.280 --> 40:09.880]  quite sad from from the beginning to the end of the hour long debate Federman was just
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.280]  not well just not well at all so we'll be talking about that I'm going to come back and talk
[40:15.280 --> 40:22.200]  about some of the latest vaccine news we also have some internet censorship news there were
[40:22.200 --> 40:31.400]  some big legal developments I guess you could say or rather you had Daryl Brooks found guilty
[40:31.400 --> 40:35.640]  on all accounts that just happened moments ago Daryl Brooks guilty on all accounts the
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.760]  Waukesha massacre now you notice you didn't have mainstream media foaming at the mouth
[40:39.760 --> 40:47.520]  over that story you didn't have the cameras rolling in the courtroom 24-7 why is that
[40:47.520 --> 40:53.600]  why it wasn't more attention paid to the Waukesha massacre killer oh because he was a radicalized
[40:53.600 --> 41:03.240]  leftist a radicalized leftist and so he can't be covered he can't be talked about when he
[41:03.240 --> 41:10.080]  killed six white people and ran over 70 plus people in an attentional race-based political
[41:10.080 --> 41:16.360]  based attack oh no I'm sure it was just a coincidence how dare I say that well he was
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.240]  found guilty but there was another school shooting that happened in st. Louis this week
[41:22.240 --> 41:28.360]  that you didn't really hear about either now why would that be also some of the big crime
[41:28.360 --> 41:33.720]  wave news that's so important head of the midterms as well where you have stores in Philadelphia
[41:33.720 --> 41:38.440]  and Los Angeles and San Francisco and Chicago and New York City saying we're closing our
[41:38.440 --> 41:48.400]  doors permanently it's too dangerous here so that's going to be coming up as well we've
[41:48.400 --> 41:55.960]  got some border news we'll be covering oh and also Greg Manorino is going to be joining
[41:55.960 --> 42:01.560]  me in the third hour to discuss some of the latest economic news with the bond market
[42:01.560 --> 42:09.320]  instability US dollar the lie that low rates of the cause for inflation the rising possibility
[42:09.320 --> 42:14.560]  of false flags specifically with the developments in Ukraine between Russia Ukraine and the
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.800]  United States that are embedded in that war they're just now admitting it it's been going
[42:19.800 --> 42:23.680]  on for months but now they're telling you that that's what's going on so imagine what
[42:23.680 --> 42:27.640]  they have planned next so you can imagine six months ago the US was already boots on
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.280]  the ground now they're telling you that so what are they doing now that you're going
[42:32.280 --> 42:39.360]  to learn about six months from now or perhaps less so all of that coming up here on the
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.640]  Alex Jones show but when we come back I'll get into some of the vaccine news as Joe Biden
[42:44.640 --> 42:51.200]  just got his fifth vaccine they claim you believe that fifth booster for Joe telling
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.640]  you it's time to get yours but some new vaccine data has even the Washington Post alarmed
[42:57.640 --> 43:05.760]  don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.000]  you and the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.320]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people not as of America but
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.400]  the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny that's why it's

[47:30.120 --> 47:38.240]  getting his fifth booster at least that's what they're claiming here now you see the
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.720]  propaganda oh there's the doctor with the mask on he's got to wear the mask just to
[47:43.720 --> 47:49.920]  remind you to be in fear and you need your face muzzle joe biden allegedly getting his
[47:49.920 --> 47:55.600]  fifth covid vaccine if you believe that I have a hard time actually believing that they
[47:55.600 --> 48:00.440]  know a fifth vaccine I mean you got to be up to probably a 25% chance after a vaccine
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.320]  number five to have a life altering side effect although who knows Joe Biden did say he could
[48:05.320 --> 48:10.360]  drop dead any day now maybe he was referencing the vaccine they were about to hit him with
[48:10.360 --> 48:15.400]  but actually if you go back to the clip you can hear the audio is really low but you can
[48:15.400 --> 48:22.800]  hear in the clip Joe Biden is asked because you know the media doesn't get any access
[48:22.800 --> 48:28.400]  to the president he's he's he's hidden he's protected and so this was some of the only
[48:28.400 --> 48:33.160]  time the media had access to him to ask about the Saudi Arabia situation to which he responded
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.040]  get the shot and so guys let's let's let's pull up the audio it's going to need some
[48:37.040 --> 48:41.760]  serious boost but you might as well just hear it so here's here's joe biden getting his
[48:41.760 --> 48:47.640]  fifth booster shot and then since the media can't get any access except when he's in the
[48:47.640 --> 48:51.760]  fake white house by the way that's that's him in the fake white house basement the little
[48:51.760 --> 48:58.760]  tv studio they have set up they don't they don't actually want media in the white house
[48:58.760 --> 49:16.160]  so it's so she asks what what is your thought on the Saudis in the oil problem that you
[49:16.160 --> 49:20.600]  have oh get your covid shot as he laughs get your covid shot that's the answer to everything
[49:20.600 --> 49:29.000]  it's the answer to every problem in the history of mankind just get your covid shot damn it
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.640]  but if you can't see how this is obvious propaganda here's the president's twitter account i guess
[49:35.640 --> 49:41.960]  after joe got the injection there and it's a picture of him smiling pointing at his arm
[49:41.960 --> 49:46.520]  on the injection site and then it's a picture he's apparently face timing here with anthony
[49:46.520 --> 49:54.560]  Fauci and i i forget the other gentleman's name big big vaccine promoter there in the
[49:54.560 --> 50:01.560]  biden administration yeah that's that's such clear propaganda oh yeah thumbs up yeah way
[50:01.560 --> 50:10.240]  to go joe you did it your fifth vaccine yeah and how sick is it they promote this to americans
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.880]  as if it's safe and effective when it's neither and i would be surprised if he actually took
[50:14.880 --> 50:20.800]  the real covid vaccine i would be surprised if that's the case oh fauci giving you the
[50:20.800 --> 50:26.040]  thumbs up and biden's other health director giving you the thumbs up oh yeah oh yeah it's
[50:26.040 --> 50:38.000]  great man yeah get that vaccine yeah just 50 000 dead from it that we know of vivic murphy
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.960]  that's the guy's name thank you crew yeah just 7.7 percent of the people that get it
[50:43.960 --> 50:52.880]  have a life altering side effect yeah get that vax get that vax but okay here's some
[50:52.880 --> 51:00.640]  of the post vax press conference moments and so we're rehashing this argument remember
[51:00.640 --> 51:04.840]  the winter of death joe biden said it would be a winter of death for the unvaccinated
[51:04.840 --> 51:11.720]  uh that was a lie but here he is rebranding that in clip d saying you better get your
[51:11.720 --> 51:17.320]  shots the people that don't well it's not going to be good for you virtually every
[51:17.320 --> 51:23.000]  covid death in america is preventable virtually everyone almost everyone who will die from
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.120]  covid this year will not be up to date on their shots or they will not have taken pex
[51:29.120 --> 51:35.920]  lovin when they got sick so he's just lying in fact the dad is the exact opposite most
[51:35.920 --> 51:43.240]  the covid deaths are vaccinated people in fact it's like 90% now 90% of covid deaths
[51:43.240 --> 51:49.480]  are from individuals that are vaccinated so just an outright lie but hey maybe you're
[51:49.480 --> 51:55.160]  not falling for the propaganda maybe a bribe hmm how about a little bribe to get you to
[51:55.160 --> 52:00.800]  join this join the vax side how about a little bribe here's here's biden bribing the american
[52:00.800 --> 52:07.240]  people to get the vaccine in clip c get the shot five ten twenty dollars off that your
[52:07.240 --> 52:12.120]  drugstore grocery purchase next or grocery purchase next time at the same time you get
[52:12.120 --> 52:19.240]  the shot this is they're all laughing they're all laughing at you it's such a joke at this
[52:19.240 --> 52:23.320]  point joe biden can't say it with a straight face when he's talking the people behind
[52:23.320 --> 52:29.120]  them are laughing this is all a joke it is all a big fat joke they know the vaccine is
[52:29.120 --> 52:35.000]  not safe not effective and here they are pushing it to you laughing in your face thinking the
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.560]  american people are so stupid that they won't know any better but the american people do
[52:41.560 --> 52:49.520]  know better and sadly many of them have learned to know better and covid or the vaccine has
[52:49.520 --> 52:56.960]  been the red pill to swallow to learn better but the washington post who you know liberal
[52:56.960 --> 53:03.040]  washington post loves to make everything about race normally you'd you'd call that a racist
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.040]  and they're confused because remember they were saying how covid disproportionately
[53:08.040 --> 53:14.040]  affects black americans and so therefore it's a more serious problem but now the data doesn't
[53:14.040 --> 53:19.960]  actually bear that out and they're concerned the post analysis found that black deaths
[53:19.960 --> 53:27.520]  declined while white deaths never eased until the mortality gap flipped because it's all
[53:27.520 --> 53:32.840]  about race because that's what racists care about from the end of october through the
[53:32.840 --> 53:37.800]  end of december twenty twenty one white people died at a higher rate than black people did
[53:37.800 --> 53:44.000]  the post found what white death rates have risen compared with others what could this
[53:44.000 --> 53:51.160]  be we can't have white people as the biggest victim of anything blacks must be the biggest
[53:51.160 --> 53:58.360]  victim or jews must be the biggest victim or the palestinians not the whites it's the
[53:58.360 --> 54:07.960]  minoritas oh no what could it be whites now more likely to die from covid than blacks
[54:07.960 --> 54:17.720]  why the pandemic shifted well there's a thing about that actually in a study latest data
[54:17.720 --> 54:28.920]  on covid-19 vaccinations by race by race and ethnicity and so let's go into the study
[54:28.920 --> 54:35.640]  here and let's see what they found black and hispanic people have been less likely than
[54:35.640 --> 54:47.640]  their white counterparts to receive a vaccine ah ah okay so we now know what it is then
[54:47.640 --> 54:53.240]  why are white people dying more than black people that can't be the case the washington
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.040]  post always says it's black people that are the biggest victim and then i guess brown
[54:57.040 --> 55:01.360]  people anybody but the whites but but now they see that the white people are the ones
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.080]  dying from covid and then you realize it's because the white people are the ones getting
[55:06.080 --> 55:12.920]  the vaccine yeah so joe biden says if you don't get the vaccine you're going to die
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.920]  from covid all of the data shows 90% of the covid deaths are people that have been vaccinated
[55:17.920 --> 55:21.680]  the washington post says why aren't black people dying from covid anymore and the research
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.920]  data says because black people aren't taking the vaccine isn't it fun having to correct
[55:26.920 --> 55:33.840]  all the democrat party propaganda here every day isn't it fun having to sort out all the
[55:33.840 --> 55:39.560]  mainstream fake news media propaganda all the big pharmaceutical propaganda cdc propaganda
[55:39.560 --> 55:47.600]  faulty propaganda every day isn't it fun but of course we were on the tip of the spear
[55:47.600 --> 55:51.260]  on this we were on the leading edge on this just like everything else here at info wars
[55:51.260 --> 55:55.680]  while others were promoting the vaccine like ben Shapiro who was not just promoting the
[55:55.680 --> 56:01.000]  vaccine he was then shaming individuals like alijah schaefer who were warning against
[56:01.000 --> 56:07.160]  taking the vaccine this is ben Shapiro this is ben Shapiro today though in fact guys let's
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.400]  just let's just play a brief moment of the clip so here's here's ben Shapiro i believe
[56:11.400 --> 56:17.080]  we have it here guys do we have the clip here's ben Shapiro after telling you to take the vaccine
[56:17.080 --> 56:21.920]  saying the vaccine is safe and effective saying it should be mandated and criticizing people
[56:21.920 --> 56:27.040]  that disagreed here's ben Shapiro today it is now perfectly clear that we were lied to
[56:27.040 --> 56:30.160]  and we were lied to and we were lied to at a very high level from very very early on
[56:30.160 --> 56:36.160]  by both the alright that's enough that's enough oh it's now perfectly clear guys it's now
[56:36.160 --> 56:42.560]  perfectly clear because ben Shapiro says so it's now perfectly clear he says phyzer has
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.240]  now admitted they did not test whether the covid vaccines prevented transmission before
[56:46.240 --> 56:52.880]  releasing them no that was always known all of this was always known but hey ben Shapiro
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.840]  being two years late it's perfectly fine but he's not going to apologize because he lied
[56:57.840 --> 57:02.760]  about it too he's not going to apologize because he repeated the propaganda too no no no he's
[57:02.760 --> 57:08.460]  going to act like he's the one telling you the truth now yeah ran paul demands answers
[57:08.460 --> 57:14.400]  over vax company pr firms embedded staff within cdc to promote vaccines well yeah i mean of
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.120]  course and they got their lobbyists too and then and then joe biden says we beat big pharma
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.520]  remember that he says we beat big pharma now go take your vaccine potential violation of
[57:23.520 --> 57:29.840]  hip up mother outraged after cdc called her for survey asking number of kids in the household
[57:29.840 --> 57:33.400]  eligible for vaccination yeah because then they want to send their little minions out
[57:33.400 --> 57:38.160]  there to force inoculate your children don't you know that's how it works safe and effective
[57:38.160 --> 57:43.120]  safe and effective and then a year later oops not safe not effective but hey it's mandated

[1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:20.480]  be covering the debates that have been going on specifically the big senate debate between fetermann
[1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:28.240]  and oz which was beyond a disaster for fetermann just just beyond a disaster we'll we'll play some
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:34.560]  of those clips coming up but i bring in steve bannon and jack basobic now and and guys let's
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:41.120]  just kind of give a brief reaction to the debates whether it's the zelden hokel debate and the
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:46.240]  fetermann oz debate or just all the debates or in some cases lack thereof just what's been your
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:52.240]  kind of initial response to this now 13 days from the midterm steve bannon uh well first off last
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:57.120]  night tutor dixon took it to whitmer and uh lee zelden took it to hokel and i think this is the
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:02.480]  issue every time you're on a debate stage with a maga republican they're bringing heat and this is
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:08.160]  why people don't want to debate this is why joshapiro is not debating mastriana you know uh
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:14.320]  possobix a son of the commonwealth of pennsylvania for a place that has that much history that means
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:18.400]  that much to the american people all the way from the revolution from the founding of the nation to
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:24.080]  the revolution the civil war down to the current day it was uh oh and i think there's nothing more
[1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:31.120]  than a humiliation it shows you that how crass and cynical the uh the democrats are he's a guy
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:36.240]  who's very ill i mean we cover him as the cyborg because it's half man and half machine and now
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:39.760]  you're seeing that they're complaining about that oh and that it wasn't done right and we knew that
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:45.440]  was going to happen that's a problem with having a cyborg but i actually felt for the guy he's he's
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:52.320]  seriously ill he has a very tough uh you know a rehab to go for him and the democrats are so callous
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:56.800]  uh to put it out there and possobix i think nailed it this morning on his twitter that they
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:01.600]  want they want shapiro to sneak in here without debating to win and then to appoint the wife
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:09.840]  to be the uh to be the senator so jack i know this had to hurt you last night being a son of pennsylvania
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:13.600]  no steve that's exactly right so what they're trying to do and richard barris actually just
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:19.040]  covered this on his show but he said look if they can get both democrats in by fortifying the election
[1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:23.200]  as hard as possible the same way we've seen fortified elections before what they'll do is
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:29.920]  john fetterman if he's elected the plan is for him to not serve a single day in the united
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:34.160]  states senate they will appoint and they have a list of people as a short list but of course at
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:38.640]  the very top of that list as i've and steve i've been saying this on war room for months now it's
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:44.800]  the wife they want to appoint that what i think of it she's endorsed and blue checked on twitter
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:52.160]  as a verified twitter user as the second lady of pennsylvania doug mestriano the actual republican
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:56.080]  candidate isn't even verified when the only statewide's in pennsylvania where twitter won't
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:01.120]  allow this and so we can see the fix has been in from the start at the end of the day steve
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:06.880]  i came on this program last week with alex and i said they're putting fetterman up as a prototype
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:12.240]  this isn't even about the election they want to see if they can take someone whose mind
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:18.800]  is already been damaged and then combine them with this machine assistance in order to show a
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:24.800]  prototype of the technology roll it out and and for the transhumanist agenda now i don't think
[1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:29.440]  the technology is there yet as we saw last night the technology ain't there or you have to show
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:35.520]  that you need uh you need the subject to be at a certain mental acuity which of course fetterman
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:40.480]  was not yet for the technology to be successful so we didn't get that last night we saw and of
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:44.080]  course we see him complaining he's blaming on the technology he's blaming on the system but
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:49.040]  what are they doing what are they doing in the midst of all of this while we see fetterman
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:52.720]  while he's complaining about these campaigns complaining about the system the computer
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:04:00.400]  they're normalizing the idea of candidates using computer assistance and computer technology
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:09.280]  impacted directly into their mind a mind man merger on stage right before our eyes they're
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:13.120]  normalizing this they're normalizing it to the point where they're saying oh the computer was
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:18.560]  just malfunctioning but it's totally normal for a candidate to be hooked up like this oh and oh
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:22.720]  and this is i know we got just a short segment here but this is what they've been condemning alex
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:28.320]  jones as a conspiracy theory guy for a decade right are we not seeing what alex jones has
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:33.120]  warned about last night you saw a man machine merger it's just not closed caption we had our
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:38.400]  transhumanist editor there joe allen it's a whole system to kind of make it right for his brain
[1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:44.480]  and they complained this morning that the system wasn't set up correctly they had to gall to complain
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:49.760]  that the uh that the system they had the man machine merger oops the president the president
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:54.800]  just got us in a nuclear war because the system wasn't working his brain implant wasn't working
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:05:04.160]  oh oops our bad sorry i am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one
[1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:11.840]  enemy i am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore but the enemies of humanity are
[1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:18.400]  obsessed with silencing us they know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed

[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:34.080]  last night's debates specifically what happened with the featherman os debate and folks if you
[1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:41.360]  don't think it was that bad it really was worse here is the opening statement from featherman
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:49.200]  just an example of what a disaster last night was hi good night everybody i'm running to serve
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:55.280]  pennsylvania he's running to use pennsylvania here's a man that spent more than 20 million dollars of
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:07:04.800]  his own money to try to buy that seat i'm also having to talk about something called the os rule
[1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:12.000]  that if he's on tv he's lying he did that during his career on his tv show he's done that during
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:20.960]  his campaign about lying about our record here and he's also lying probably during this debate
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:26.240]  and let's also talk about the elephant in the room i had a stroke he's never let me forget that
[1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:33.120]  and i might miss some words during this debate much two words together but it knocked me down
[1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:38.480]  but i'm going to keep coming back up and this campaign is all about to me is about fighting for
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:44.400]  everyone in pennsylvania that ever got knocked down that needs to get back up and fighting for all
[1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:49.840]  forgotten communities all across pennsylvania that also got knocked down that needs to keep get back
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:57.360]  up okay i mean the fumbles the stutters admitting he's having problems steven and what did we just
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:06.800]  see there that was i mean at the beginning it was um it's so awful that you sit there and go what
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:11.360]  what are they doing here i mean this guy can't can't have and look if you look at the new york
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:19.200]  and michigan debate uh and and i think tutor dixon and lee zeldin crushed their democratic
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:24.400]  opposition right two sitting governors but it was give and take it was thrust and parry they were at
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:28.960]  each other from the entire time and oh and court frank is someone to get to your last segment about
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:33.520]  the vaccines was a big part of both of those but there you had people defending policy and other
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:38.160]  people all of them that's where the debate's supposed to be what you saw last night was was
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:42.480]  pathetic it was beneath the commonwealth of pennsylvania to have to watch that and here's
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:48.320]  where i really got a problem with josh apiro has not come out he's still hiding from asciano
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:51.760]  and he will not come out and condemn to what happened last night by the democratic party
[1:08:52.400 --> 1:09:00.160]  jack europe pennsylvania voter what did you see last night look i i saw it was disrespectful
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:07.360]  it was disrespectful to john fetterman to his family in a sense though i know obviously his wife
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:13.520]  plays a huge role in this uh and it was disrespectful to my family it was disrespectful to the people of
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:18.000]  pennsylvania the people of our commonwealth look pennsylvania is hurting right now whether you're
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.920]  looking at the fentanyl that's pouring into our state from all over the world obviously across
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:28.400]  the southern border coming directly from the chinese communist party whether it's the crime
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:34.400]  that's pouring out of philadelphia murdering children in our streets coming out into the
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.960]  suburbs there from philadelphia people getting killed at football games people getting uh
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.800]  killed in the street there and then nobody getting locked up over this you see a massive
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:50.400]  amount of disrespect for the people of our state who are hurting because of these economic policies
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:56.400]  and one of the big policies that did come up in terms of this was this idea of fracking and
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:04.240]  should the people of pennsylvania be able to utilize the resources that god bequeathed to them
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:10.240]  underneath this the very ground of the state itself the marcellus shale fine the same as a
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:16.400]  permian base in the bracken formation out west fetterman when they asked him about this you
[1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:21.440]  could tell that he forgot what he was supposed to say he couldn't tell where he was well jack let's
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:25.120]  play the clip let's let's let's give the clip let's give the evidence to what you're talking about
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:29.840]  and then respond here is the clip that jack is talking about fetterman stumbling over the question
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:39.920]  on fracking clip two mr os I do want to clarify something you're saying tonight that you support
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:45.440]  fracking that you've always supported fracking but there is that 2018 interview that you said quote
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:56.160]  I don't support fracking at all so how do you square the two I I do support fracking and
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:04.800]  I don't I don't I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking okay thank you mr
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:10.160]  okay so obviously the answer was a bunch of fumbling and and jack to me he got confused I
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:14.000]  guess at the beginning he didn't even know the question was directed towards him and then he
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.600]  knows that the left-wing ideology is ban fracking but he knows he also can't say that on the debate
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:25.520]  stage it would crush him that's what I saw what you see yeah my guess is that in and I'll put my
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:30.720]  my analyst hat on here is that he probably had a prepared statement that his campaign had given him
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:34.400]  if I were staffing him if I were gone the left one of these operatives I would have given him a
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:38.720]  prepared statement that kind of threaded the needle to say that you know we have to have resources
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:43.440]  but it has to be safe and environmental he completely went into vapor lock that was like a
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:49.840]  flashing 404 error up on his head and look oh and when I just went up to Pennsylvania and I was in
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:54.560]  Erie Pennsylvania we talked about the Mastriano plan to build a Pennsylvania pipeline for that
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:12:00.160]  freedom gas straight up to Erie another one out to to Philadelphia to put this Pennsylvania freedom
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:05.440]  gas out on the world market actually be able to undercut OPEC and then ensure American energy
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:10.320]  dominance it was the probably the biggest applause line that I got because we're talking
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:16.000]  sick your jobs that would be coming back to the people of Pennsylvania whether you're a trucker
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.080]  whether you're a worker whether someone who can go and actually work on these sites these are
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.360]  massive massive and then the secondary tertiary economic effects thereof in terms of utilizing
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:30.880]  this josh apiro he wants to ban this uh federman he's never been on the side of this um the coal
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:34.560]  mining of course obviously this would be a huge boon for Pennsylvania to actually start bringing
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:39.040]  this back this is an agenda that it's not like the dobs decision it's not like some of these other
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:42.720]  decisions that just kind of you know democracy is democracy at stake and what does that even
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:47.360]  mean you can't put that in your fuel tank you can't put that on your kitchen table and eat it
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:51.680]  at dinnertime you can't serve the dobs decision and democracy to your children these are things
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.200]  that actually matter people are starting to go you go to that northern tier of Pennsylvania
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:59.360]  people can go to the dentist for the first time because dentists are opening up in some of these
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:03.680]  small towns because that's how bad it's been since they shipped all of our manufacturing
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:07.840]  jobs or steel jobs over to the far east that's how bad it's been we can now bring it back
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:12.480]  with mastery on it and you have to stop odds you have to stop Shapiro in order to make this happen
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:18.400]  yes steve this has actually been one of your big issues uh when you are specifically working with
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:24.320]  trump was the jobs being sent out of america specifically to china and this is one of the
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:28.640]  agendas has shipped the energy off it offshore the energy too we can bring the energy back
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:34.080]  look that's a policy discussion and we should have that and the people of pennsylvania have that
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:38.880]  that's not what we just saw what we just saw is the cyborg had a malfunction
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:44.960]  this is monumental and i that's why i think it's humiliating but everybody america should watch it
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.480]  so we just laid out a rational and if you were in new york or if you were in michigan you had
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:56.320]  that thrust and parry of two conflicting ideas of what american industrial life should be in the
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:02.640]  economics around that that's not what we just saw what we just saw is the cyborg had a malfunction
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:08.960]  okay for whatever reason and this is why it's a disgrace this thing is at such a level we
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:14.160]  can't even honor it to even put it up to having a policy discussion means that we're buying into
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:19.920]  the cyborg and it's and and and i don't say that to try to hurt this guy's feelings or try to hurt
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:25.680]  people's feelings or hurt his family this is something that's very dangerous it showed last
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:30.480]  night and to have the political class on this morning we woke up to the political class sitting
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:35.760]  there oh gosh we didn't really know it was that bad he's hidden it so much that's a bald face lie
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:41.040]  but so big has talked about this he's been up there he's talked about this on war room for weeks
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:46.560]  and weeks and weeks and weeks everybody knew the shape this guy was in right everybody knew it
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.000]  everybody in the democratic party all the media last night on msmc a the lead reporter for new
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:57.360]  york magazine covering it she went on and tried to make an excuse about how it was so amazing he
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:02.960]  was really countering ableism and he was up there this is dangerous you had man machine merger and
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:08.160]  what you just saw right there is the man machine merger at the cyborg man malfunction on global
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:14.560]  television well and and we can't because it's a difficult line that we walk now to where hey we're
[1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:18.720]  sympathetic right i mean we're sympathetic we don't like seeing somebody up there struggling
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:22.960]  like that we don't want to see people in that position but this is the country's future this
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:28.800]  is our prosperity we're talking about here so we have to tell the truth john fetterman is not even
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:35.360]  capable of having a debate let alone being in the senate but it's oh see but it's steve you say that
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:40.800]  it's like they had no idea how ill he was but they all knew it notice how they've changed their
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.160]  rhetoric now notice how the rhetoric today and this morning is look at how brave fetterman is look
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:50.080]  at how he's going up there knowing he'll be humiliated because of the after effects from a
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.760]  stroke wait a second two months ago you were saying he was fine and there were no after effects
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:16:01.040]  now you're telling us to be sympathetic because he can't talk i am extremely honored to be seen
[1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:06.960]  by the globalist as their number one enemy i am blessed to know that our information is so hard

[1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:47.120]  fetermen i am john i fracking and az doctor anyway uh what was the next question you had for me
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:48.000]  in clip j
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.880]  the person on the stage who's broken the law we believe john fetermen took a shotgun
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:21:01.040]  chased a unarmed african-american man and put the gun apparently according to that man to his chest
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:05.600]  john you weren't pulled over by the police they let you go you were the mayor at the time why haven't
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:11.440]  you apologized to that unarmed innocent black man who you put a shotgun to his chest all right we
[1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:16.160]  will allow a 30 second response to that mr. fetermen specifically what he was saying referring to
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:22.240]  the incident in braddock i i made the opportunity to defend our community as the chief law enforcement
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:28.080]  officer there everybody in braddock i know overwhelmingly majority community of black
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:34.240]  community all understood what happened you know they they understood what happened and
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:40.320]  everybody agreed that and nobody believes that it was anything about me making a split second
[1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:49.040]  decision to defend our community as well why not apologize well jack obviously the hypocrisy here
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:56.400]  is uh is pretty obvious and and as inconsequential as that event may have been you know the inconsistencies
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:02.480]  here we know the incongruencies with applying that if if let's say any republican let alone
[1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:06.480]  dr os would have done something similar that would have been the end of their political career
[1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:13.040]  but john feterman can just say i did the right thing uh black and he gets away with it well i
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:20.800]  mean look you know it's not hypocrisy though really it's hierarchy the idea that a republican or a
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:25.680]  conservative can say anything have their words twisted have the way you pronounce words twisted
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:31.520]  as i've had done to me uh they smear who they fear right this is nothing to do with whether or not
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:36.880]  someone is actually uh you know you know racist or not racist what it has to do with power and
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:43.200]  control because in order to institute their agenda of total power and total control they need people
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:49.280]  that are human sponges mush minds like feterman in there in office look what they got in the oval
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:54.560]  office if you need any further indication of that or any further verification because it's not about
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:58.720]  this guy isn't the one who's going to be pushing the button this guy's not the one that's actually
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:04.480]  going to be weighing and measuring the limits on abortion or whether we go to nuclear war with
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:09.280]  russia over ukraine or what we're going to do in terms of uh you know are doing climate policies
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:13.360]  this that and the other thing are we going to allow ai to take over our world even more that we do
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:19.200]  are we going to continue spending and printing money to keep people in global economic slavery
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:23.040]  right they don't want someone in there that's actually going to ask questions they don't
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:27.200]  want someone in there that can actually think through these things by themselves and what better
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:33.280]  way than to actually have someone who physically cannot think for himself unless he's hooked up
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:38.480]  to a computer that they control that's who john feterman is that's who joe biden is that's why
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:42.960]  they're trying to stop him that's why they want people that are either number one simply going
[1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:47.760]  to be there because they're ambitious and will say whatever the regime wants like josh apiro or
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:53.360]  someone that they can actually control at a cerebral level like john feterman steve let's
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:56.960]  think about how this applies to the midterms or you had a comment you can respond to jack go
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:02.880]  ahead here hang on this is key because remember and i know we'll talk about some geo politics later
[1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:08.160]  in the show a geo strategic uh initiatives are going around right now this is about control the
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:13.440]  senate they understand that these four or five seats were defending this is the one they thought was
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:18.960]  the the lowest hanging fruit okay they see the senate slipping away from them in the control
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:22.960]  the senate right now with all the important issues the senate deals with separate from the house
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:30.800]  this is why it's so central and they would go to have a man machine merger to try to have that up on
[1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:36.160]  stage and fool the folks in the commonwealth of pennsylvania that's what's so shocking and they
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:42.320]  got out at last night this is why this thing is so much deeper and more troubling than just a normal
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:48.000]  senate race one shifting the entire power of the senate to maga right they're trying to defend it
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:53.280]  at all costs and they would do it with a man machine merger they did it with it with a essentially a
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:58.720]  cyborg and what are they complaining about today their first thing they came out with is that oh
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:04.080]  the moderators didn't have the cyborg programmed right because it wasn't they're pointing out their
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:10.080]  lie on that it wasn't just closed caption this was something something much deeper if you had
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:15.760]  said a year ago or valox jones has said on this very show that you're going to see a cyber a man
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:22.000]  machine merger and the entire senate is going to hang in the balance on one debate where he's up on
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.280]  stage about what the man machine merger actually works they would laugh this off as this is not
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:32.640]  more crazy talk from alice jones this is ridiculous that's what you saw in philadelphia last night
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:37.520]  it's quite ironic that it's back to the very beginning of american liberty that there you see
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:43.600]  what transhumanism has in store for the future of us well and the incredible thing now we now we
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:49.920]  have more of an idea of why there was that her fuffle over the nbc interview where he needed
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:55.200]  multiple machines just to conduct the interview and the nbc interviewer was like this is really
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:59.520]  strange this is odd i'm going to report this as a news story and they said oh how dare you
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:04.320]  you're ableist that's not the case he's perfectly fine but he only had one or two machines to work
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:09.280]  with him last night he needed four or five and we saw the results so but let's talk about the mid
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:14.160]  terms now 13 days away i want to get uh the opinion from jack besobic and steve bannon
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:20.320]  our guests here today is the race over i mean how is it not i mean federman it was such was
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:25.280]  so bad last night all the polls are indicating that os one i'm not telling people not to vote
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:31.840]  but i'm just saying i mean where do you view the race now after last night look no no no i mean
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:38.320]  this is just like 2020 all over again because they know when they don't have the candidate what do
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:43.760]  they do they flip the switch and they begin to fortify the elections there was a headline from
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:49.040]  the associated press just today just today a few hours ago talking about this that said well you
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:54.000]  know there's times where a machine might switch your vote there's times where there's some issues
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:57.760]  but we're going to work on that you got the department of justice under biden putting out
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:01.280]  these statements saying by the way you know these systems these are the critical election
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:05.280]  infrastructure systems they're susceptible to cyber attack there's many issues we've got to
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:10.560]  look forward to this and at the end of the day the biggest one for specifically pennsylvania but a
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:14.640]  lot of these states have this issue as well the united states supreme court came out and put out a
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:19.440]  decision that said hey you can't count these ballots if they come in without dates if they
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:24.640]  don't come out without the paperwork filled out properly you cannot count them the state of pennsylvania
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:29.600]  which is currently controlled by democrats including josh apiro came out and said well that's a nice
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:34.560]  opinion supreme court but we're not going to follow it you're setting up a constitutional crisis
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:39.200]  for both of these elections statewide in pennsylvania really all the elections in pennsylvania
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:44.720]  for mastriano for Shapiro because they've said they're going to they're going to include ballots
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:49.200]  which the supreme court united state supreme court has said are illegal that's how they're
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:54.160]  going to try to do that and that was my question is of course any any common sense state would not
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:28:00.000]  elect john fetterman but whether that exists or not the voter fraud exists i mean how we did go
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:05.600]  it's reported that the republicans it's there on game day the patriots need to show up on game day
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:10.400]  you need to stand in line as met as long as it takes as many hours as it takes bring the water
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:16.960]  bring your wah wah or sheets provisions whatever you need stand in line patriots do not step step
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:22.160]  back take no step back no surrender well wah wah's are shutting down now uh i want to get
[1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:27.440]  steve bannon's take on the other side of this because um i'm here here's the good news apparently
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:35.360]  republicans went from about 250 poll watchers in 2020 to 6 000 heading into the midterm elections so
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:40.560]  i mean they're well aware we saw them blocking the windows at philadelphia we saw the ballot boxes
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:44.800]  coming in in the middle of the night we saw the vote viagra for biden he's losing all day and then
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:48.880]  it goes straight up and then they stopped the counting how concerned are we about that in the
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:54.080]  2022 midterms we ask steve bannon on the other side of this break don't go anywhere it's the alex
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:29:04.160]  joneshell don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:09.840]  you and the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see us

[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:32.880]  there were other highlights from last night the fetterman senate debate obviously getting most
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:38.240]  the attention it's it's the balance of the senate and just the example of the cyborg fetterman that
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:45.360]  was such an embarrassment but zeldin got huckle to admit she doesn't care about crime tutor dixon
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:52.160]  got kretchen whitmer to lie about school closures and lockdowns that received the major backlash
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:59.440]  today but steve let's just look at the midterms overall uh how concerned are you where we stand
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:05.200]  because i see all of the the political momentum obviously moving in the direction of republicans
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:12.720]  it really has since 2016 but as in 2020 i'm afraid it's not going to be fairly represented with the
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:18.080]  votes uh steve bandon what are you thinking when it comes to midterms and the odds of a republican
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:24.320]  victory against all the election fraud we know is going to exist look right now we have two things
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:28.640]  get out the vote everybody's got to man the ramparts and also you got to sign up and volunteer
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:33.840]  to be an election official a poll worker not just a poll watcher it's got to be the yonkin model
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:38.560]  in in virginia remember yonkin's not our guy i know he's not an alex jones guy but it showed you
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:45.600]  100 participation by maga plus these uh suburban moms and that's why that segment you did right
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:50.400]  before i came on on when i was watching the show about the vaccines is critically important
[1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:55.440]  that's the thing nobody's talking about it's it's the three eyes it's it's it's immigration it's
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:35:00.880]  inflation it's injections that is what's bringing this coalition together and we know that we're
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:05.440]  expanding the battlefield right on the votes now we got to figure out how we're going to close on
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:10.480]  this and i have a stolen but look in new england in connecticut there are two house seats that are
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:15.680]  totally in play right now we could win why suburban connecticut the moms up there are furious you add
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:20.080]  a maga vote to these suburban moms and dads the parental rights thing but particularly about
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:24.720]  the injection they're very silent about it but they're vocal at the school boards of what they
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:31.440]  what they don't want to have happen rhoda island to main two two seats new hampshire the vermont
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:36.800]  senate is two two or three points away on the senate seat in vermont bernie sanders home state
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:42.240]  in new hampshire general boldix almost dead heat the republicans are actually coming back in with
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:48.560]  money new york state they're 12 to 15 house seats in play 12 to 15 house seats but it's
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:54.800]  lee zeldin with no money is in a dead heat uh... with hoka leticia james is two or three points behind
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:36:00.000]  henry who's had no money to spend a by the way one of the house seats in in in the hudson valley
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:04.960]  is the head of the dcc is the head guy for the strategy and don't let the money that is had to
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:09.840]  put six hundred thousand dollars into his house that's never happened before in history you look
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.720]  at washington state you got a dead heat there in the senate race you got joe kent winning you got
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:19.760]  three house seats in oregon that maga candidates right now are on the cusp of winning you've got
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:24.960]  the oregon governorship we've expanded this battlefield all over so what we have to do now
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:31.440]  on and that's why i think this vaccine thing cdc gave us a gift a political gift last week by this
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:36.400]  unanimous vote when they didn't have any debate they bring up any facts i think people are furious
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:41.440]  about this about the the children that is the secret weapon going in to build this coalition
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:46.080]  everybody in this audience particularly the alex jones info wars audience and know the
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:51.680]  fight we've been fighting for decades against the globalist we're right on the cusp of having the
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:57.680]  opportunity to destroy the democratic party as a national political institution from school boards
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:02.240]  all the way up to the house in the senate and oh and here's the big tell today in the hill the
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.280]  lead story this morning was about how the knives are already out internally at the white house on
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:12.720]  the hill they're blaming pelosi hoyer kyburn the younger progressives saying these people are in
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:18.400]  their 80s they didn't get the right you know issues j6 never really mattered abortion played out
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:23.840]  climate change is not somebody somebody's going to vote on its crime its inflation it's uh it's
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:28.480]  it's the injection that's what's playing on people's minds right now they said and here's the number
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:34.560]  they gave they said anything 30 seats and above in the house and any flip of the senate and that's
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:39.440]  why pennsylvania is so big that immediately all the house and senate leadership is going to be
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:45.280]  groomed immediately and that joe biden they're going to force biden to announce in like 24 48
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:52.000]  hours he's not running again for president because this is a repudiation of his presidency look this
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.760]  shows so much number one oh and you know that you can do the math no a regime could have collapsed
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:03.840]  this quickly when we had no money if they actually had 81 million votes the first time around this
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:10.560]  proves the case more than ever they didn't win in 2020 okay what we have to do now is an overwhelming
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:15.920]  show of force everywhere to converge own your vote get out the vote help get out the vote go
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:21.840]  volunteer phone phone bank walker precinct and in addition we have to close the deal remember
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:26.400]  in 2020 we won but we didn't close and it's like in mergers and acquisitions if you don't close the
[1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:30.400]  deal it doesn't matter the way we got to close and we still got the problems with the machines i
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:35.440]  understand that and in you see the wall street journal day the op ed or the editorial page talks
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:39.520]  about we still got problems with the mail-in ballots in in pennsylvania and these are going
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:45.200]  to be fights but the way you do that you get into the room and become a poll worker this is 100
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:50.400]  percent on within our hands to grasp this will never come again we have a unique opportunity
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:54.480]  to have something like 1932 or right after the civil war when you had these massive
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:59.520]  realignments in american politics we could blow these people out of the house in the senate for a
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:07.040]  decade okay if we pick up 40 or 50 seats that gets us up to what 260 270 and those guys below 150
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:10.800]  you kill them for a generation because they're going to sit there with no power all of your
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:14.960]  great talents going to leave they're not going to sit in dc and just be on a minority in the
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:20.560]  committee it doesn't work like that because you have no power this is our opportunity to destroy
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:25.200]  the groomer party to destroy the globalist party to back off their wall street and their corporate
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:29.760]  interest and to go for it so that's why i say everything is the next 13 days sir well and i
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:34.400]  actually want to focus on that cause in the next segment ending what i believe is the biggest hate
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:38.800]  group and terror group in american history the democrat party but i want to get into that
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:42.880]  with you on the other side because i know you've you've dedicated a lot of your effort and work to
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:48.720]  that but getting back to the to the vote issue we spoke in the last segment republicans went from
[1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:55.120]  about 250 poll watchers in the 2020 presidential election they've got over 6000 now we have
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:00.080]  been seeing the stories about and of course the the liberal media is is panicked they hate
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:04.800]  poll watchers they don't like people watching the mail in drop box ballots oh i wonder why they
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:10.880]  don't like that i think the answer is obvious but do you think it's enough i mean how do you think
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:15.440]  it'll back the democrats off do you think there'll be enough evidence to prove if they do go forward
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:20.960]  with voter fraud i mean there were two stories today ballots found in rogue river in organ
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:26.400]  um another one here georgia mail truck potentially carrying absentee ballots destroyed by fire
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:32.080]  is this them covering up their crimes is it a coincidence i mean so so how do you see that
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:38.160]  issue solving itself coming up here here's what happened in 2020 look in 2016 we were prepped we
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:43.440]  were ready to go into court into fight we had people on the ground remember we won just by
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:49.200]  what 10 000 votes in in in michigan or 10 000 wisconsin 20 000 michigan 40 000 in pennsylvania
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:54.480]  we were able to fight any kind of a protest they had right we were able to close the deal with very
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:41:00.240]  thin uh numbers in 2020 you know for whatever reason they weren't prepared and marco lyson
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:03.920]  these guys warned us they told us exactly what was going to happen they walk you through the
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.400]  preset of the the uh transition integrity project they told us how they're going to steal it with
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:12.560]  the mail in ballots and let's let's leave the machines off to our side for a second we can do
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:17.040]  this because you're quoting stories right there owns of people finding it now that's why they're
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:23.600]  in meltdown with guys in cammy by the law with the open carry in arizona total solid citizens
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:28.240]  they're in meltdown they're in federal court even as we speak to try to get that shut down why we
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:34.320]  don't want any more 2000 mule situation that's why the audience if you see it report it we can't
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:39.600]  wait till after the fact we have to be now to report it all and you have to be in the counting
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:44.720]  room you have to sit around that green table and argue about every ballot that's the way we stop it
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:49.040]  it's not a perfect system it worked in the commonwealth of virginia with yonkin i think it's going
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:54.080]  to work now we get we got to out vote the algorithm we got to out vote the money we got to out vote
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:58.720]  the corruption stealing it but with this close away and i think with every patriot in a counting
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:04.480]  room we can pull this off you know and another issue too with the early voting you know pennsylvania
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:09.200]  i think has already had early voting for a week or so now so people went and voted for feterman
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:13.920]  before seeing that disastrous debate they probably regret it that's why early voting is a problem
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:17.920]  especially before any debates but you know another thing i understand why people do early voting in
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:22.240]  fact i've done early voting myself i get it it's it's sometimes it's more convenient for you sometimes
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:28.480]  it's quicker but recall recall this fact folks if they know how many vote how many votes are there
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:33.520]  before election day if somebody wanted to steal it they'd know how many votes they need to steal it
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:37.440]  do you really want to give them that ammunition it might be worth waiting an extra 30 minutes to
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.960]  an hour on election day to cast your ballot instead of doing it early and perhaps giving somebody
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:48.240]  some intel that they might use that day all right when we come back i want to talk to steve bannon
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:54.240]  about dedicating his work which i am in complete agreement with to finally eradicating this country
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:43:01.200]  of the cancer known as the democrat party everybody says they want people to stand up and fight

[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:31.280]  talked about dedicating a lot of your work energy and time into eradicating this country
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:38.000]  of the cancer known as the democrat party it's we're kindred spirits in that i i have also
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:43.200]  basically made a formal announcement of the same thing my reasoning being the democrat party formed
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:49.600]  out of the ashes of the kkk it was then resurrected into cultural political power with the violent
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:56.640]  terrorist of the weather underground to now be introduced as the violent communistic democrat
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:03.760]  party with the violence of antifa and blm that it is today and with all of that history behind us
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:10.080]  how could we not be looking to eliminate the democrat party as a political party from this
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:15.440]  country you laid out how there's a path to that specifically in these midterms but i ask you steve
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:19.520]  why would you want to dedicate so much of your work your time your effort into destroying
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:26.080]  the democrat party despite what we've seen it's already cost you so much well number one elin
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:30.320]  you bring up a great point about the weather underground i come from a working-class irish
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:36.480]  democrat family i mean my from you know my dad and my grandfather everybody were because irish
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:42.240]  came over here we were just democrats by birth you didn't even consider voting for a republican jack
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:47.360]  kennedy i remember my brother says you know what being a democrat is when he walked precincts
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:51.520]  for adlie stevens in the second time it was just something by culture and then the vietnam
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:56.160]  more came up and you saw these radicals at the universities and particularly the weather underground
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:00.640]  and they were killing police officers and they were you know throwing stuff on servicemen coming
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:06.880]  back and and denigrating the service in vietnam that these young men had never really had had
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:12.560]  either been drafted or volunteered to went to go to defend you know for the defense of their country
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:17.280]  what they believe was the defense of their country and you saw what the democrat party did and now
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:22.560]  it's so radical this is why oh and the win in 16 i keep telling people because i had a ringside seat
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:27.920]  for that it was totally providential i mean we had a plane we had a candidate the great you know
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:32.560]  greatest candidate since reagan we had a set of issues uh we had a little bit of money but not much
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.080]  not much organization it was self-organizing and we had hillary clinton the globalist as the opposition
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:42.640]  it was providential we won we saw what going against the administrative and deep state what
[1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:48.640]  president trump had to fight every day then in 20 the steel was also providential because you saw
[1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:53.840]  this is not your fathers or grandfathers democratic party we're not arguing about difference in
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:59.600]  in kind of education policy or difference in marginal tax rates uh you know you're talking about
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:05.760]  a radical cultural marxist this these people are as radical on the family side and the cultural side
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:10.720]  as malseitongue and the red guards during the cultural revolution or during the french revolution
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:15.920]  their whole purpose is to destroy the nuclear family and they're trying to weaponize the kids
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:21.440]  to do that whether it's gender ideology crt the mass mandates in particularly that's what they're
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:26.800]  trying to do with the vaccines which was your seven before which quite brilliantly talks about
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:31.680]  the undertones of what this election is about in addition it's a totally globalist party now it
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:36.480]  doesn't represent working class people look we've shifted the republican party in less than 10 years
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.920]  to be a working class working folks party that's why african americans are not voting for the democrats
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:46.560]  the hill newspaper has been all over that they've had low turnout in the last couple of days uh to
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:52.240]  support democrats hispanics in the real grand valley and south texas are now flocking to republicans
[1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:58.640]  like never before we have built a working class coalition that is not just populace it's nationalist
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:02.880]  it believes in the sovereignty this kind of doesn't believe in america is an idea believes in america is
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:08.160]  a nation a nation with borders a nation with sovereignty and most important a nation with
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:14.000]  american citizens and we're prepared to step up whether the enemy is in davos whether enemies
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:19.200]  in brussels the city of london wall street are a nation's capital prepared to stand up against it
[1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:24.160]  and that's why the democratic party should go the way of the wigs before the civil war we need to
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:30.000]  break the back of the democratic party expose their funding expose their relationship with
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:34.160]  corporations and ultimately subpoena their relationship with the chinese communist party
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:40.480]  and other influence of pet other influence peddlers from all five shores sir well and
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:47.600]  you know if god is still divinely guiding this nation and and we pray that that's the case then
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:52.640]  maybe this was all part of the plan allow the democrats to steal the 2020 elections to show
[1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:58.080]  the people just how bad it really is allow them to show their lust their desire for power and then
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:03.680]  what they'll do with it from the from the most sorted political cultural aspects of the democrat
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:09.440]  party ideology of grooming children calling it trans kids calling it drag queen stripper time
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:15.440]  to the basic economic policies and energy policies that have crippled this nation to the degree of
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:20.880]  which most people can't even believe it uh with record inflation record gas prices the consumer
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:26.320]  price index the the producer price index no maybe this was all part of the plan yeah let biden and
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:30.480]  the corrupt biden crime family get up there let them sniff and grope little kids when they come to
[1:52:30.480 --> 1:52:35.040]  the white house maybe america really had to see this moment steve really had to live in this moment
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.440]  experience this moment with their own eyes to understand what we need to do to save this country
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:44.320]  oh and i think that brings us back to the beginning of the show that's why what happened last night
[1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:50.000]  in philadelphia is so important it's ironic it happened in the birthplace in the cradle of liberty
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:55.360]  right there near independence hall right in the in the same city where where the great documents of
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:53:00.480]  the declaration and the constitution were negotiated and and and signed and brought forth
[1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:06.560]  that really set up ourselves as the new jerusalem that's what america is america is a divinely
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.960]  inspired country and we've got to get back to that but we had to fight this battle last night
[1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:15.920]  for the control of the senate what could be the whole shooting match which they're so in
[1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:21.280]  they actually had a cyborg a man machine merger up there you could see it for and for every and
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:25.760]  they didn't pull it off and that's what i think shocked the democrat the operatives in the democratic
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:32.640]  party it should shock the nation there is nothing too low that these people won't do to can maintain
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:37.360]  power that's what we're gonna see in the next 13 days i mean alex has warned us about false flags
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:43.680]  cyber attacks everything people have to be on watch you have to be uh focused the next 13 days
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:48.880]  should all be about how we take this country back and we're taking back at the ballot box we have to
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:54.640]  both show up to get the vote out and we have to both show up to get it on and we have to secure it
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:58.240]  well yeah you got to have your head on a swivel democrats are not just going to relinquish this
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:05.680]  power um so easily and and i and my biggest fear is they now see the power that they truly desire
[1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:11.200]  at an arms length away i'm talking about adding a 51st 52nd state so they can add their votes in
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:15.920]  electoral college rig it that way we're talking about amnesty so they can overwhelm the popular
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:21.120]  vote as well i'm talking about ending the filibuster so there'll be no means of stopping them when they
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:26.320]  try to write their legislation they see all of this right there at an arms length and that's why
[1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:30.800]  i'm afraid uh the moves that they're going to make here with 13 days left till the midterms
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:35.360]  are are going to be paramount but the but i think people see it i mean i don't know about you steve
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:40.560]  but in my walk of life when i go around when i talk to people random people strangers friends family
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.200]  i don't know anybody that supports the democrats right now we're talking about lifelong liberals
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:50.480]  even democrat voters and and even they're kind of like yeah i don't yeah i don't know if i can
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:55.600]  support these guys i think you're right i think look they they're so over the top what they've
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:02.000]  done is destroying the economy what they've done geopolitically right putting unlimited arms into
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:06.720]  and money into ukraine and not really paying attention to taiwan or the south china sea or the
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:10.800]  rise of the chinese communist party you see what they've done to capital markets in this country
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:15.920]  whether it's 401k's or the bond market you see what you've done to your income you see it across
[1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:19.600]  the board but the most radical thing they've done if everything they've done to destroy
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:24.560]  american life and and shut out shut our full spectrum energy dominance it's what they've
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:30.000]  done around the family that exposes their true cultural Marxism because this is what the french
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:35.920]  revolution wanted to do this is what Mao Zedong attempted to do the chinese people to break the
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:41.040]  back allowed by zheng break the back of the family and weaponize the children against the parents
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:46.240]  you're seeing it all right now in real time and but everybody has an opportunity to stop it if we
[1:55:46.240 --> 1:55:52.320]  don't stop it now oh and it's over we have one opportunity and god has given us this opportunity
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:58.640]  divine providence but divine providence works through a human agency and trust me divine

[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:26.320]  dollars a billion dollars 100 billion dollars this is actually a larger warning for other
[2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:31.840]  liars and conspiracy theorists in our society and our politics it's a rebuke and a punishment that
[2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:36.800]  we believe according to a lot of experts will set this new precedent the mother of george
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:44.560]  floyd's daughter now filing a 250 million dollar lawsuit against kanye west kanye west
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:50.080]  may quote false statements about the manner of floyd's death he says the family could sue for
[2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:56.560]  intentional inflection of emotional distress citing the recent alex jones trial as an example
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:03.840]  alex jones is patient zero take him out now what does this mean
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:12.800]  lying and conspiracy theories part of their business model or politics fox news is clearly
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:18.880]  watching this closely they are facing this suit by dominion voting systems for over a billion dollars
[2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:24.160]  you heard that right billion with the capital bye
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:32.480]  this is not a trial there was no jury trial in this case no judge in us history has ever
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:36.080]  told somebody what they can and can't say everybody knows you're supposed to get your
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:42.000]  day in court yet the one person who is being denied any day in court is alex jones alex jones
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:46.240]  didn't kill anybody you were clear and that you had a change of heart or you believed that you were
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:49.920]  wrong or you believed you made a mistake which i think is admirable and i think the fact that they
[2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:55.120]  want to browbeat you after that is what is so scary and i think that people out here would do well
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:02:00.720]  if you're watching to understand that apologies do nothing with these monsters the whole purpose of
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:06.560]  the first amendment is to keep the government the hell out of the business of speech totally
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:12.880]  disregarded by the connecticut courts when they decided to write their alex jones rule this judge
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:18.640]  barbara nellis is a disgrace to the rule of law a disgrace to the judiciary a disgrace to the
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:23.280]  justice system so the regime has come for alex jones they always start with alex jones when it
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:28.080]  comes to these things you don't have to be an alex jones fan to understand that he is most
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:35.360]  definitely being made an example of the law industrial complex in collusion with the media
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:41.680]  can work in harmony to completely obliterate somebody financially that's a billion dollars for
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.400]  expressing an opinion which under the prevailing supreme court case law is absolutely protected
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:55.520]  the question is do they really care about what alex jones said or do they want to destroy alex jones
[2:02:55.520 --> 2:03:02.080]  do you now believe that the first amendment is absolute or do you believe that the first
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:08.400]  amendment has limitations i believe that the first amendment is absolute and that you can't be
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:14.560]  priorly constrained obviously if you get found guilty by a real jury in a real trial for defamation
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:20.880]  reliable then it doesn't have absolutes it does have limits but i wasn't a free trial the first
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:24.240]  amendment is unique in the world most countries don't have that i think the united states is the
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:30.880]  only country that has this right this enshrined freedom of speech in our highest law that's
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:35.600]  what they want to take away this is our rights being taken this is a hollywood production
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:39.440]  i'm not saying sandy hook didn't happen i'm saying the production of what i supposedly did
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:44.000]  and how big it became in this huge event i'm not the sandy hook guy i'm the guy that wrote the
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:48.720]  number one best-selling book in the world the great reset in the war for the world that's why

[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:35.360]  we are now joined by reg manorino traders choice dot net and we will be getting into the economic
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:43.840]  news with him and greg you know even let's say we try to put politics aside when when we have these
[2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:52.480]  discussions about where the u.s economy is or where it's going you try to put politics aside is it
[2:06:52.480 --> 2:07:02.000]  not just a universal fact that the u.s economy has gotten drastically worse in the last two years
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:07.440]  with all the things we've seen like inflation producer price consumer price again remove the
[2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:13.040]  politics you can sit here and point at one side or the other that that can flesh itself out but
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:17.200]  you know some people would act like that's not even happening what is the true state of the
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:24.800]  u.s economy right now greg manorino it's it's a complete disaster area it couldn't possibly be
[2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:31.520]  worse but i can promise you this it's going to get much much worse this is going to get very very
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:37.680]  real for people people honestly have no clue as to what is going on why it's happening to them the
[2:07:37.680 --> 2:07:45.520]  lies the distractions the propaganda from the mainstream uh what do we want to call these
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:52.800]  things here they're nothing to me but some kind of a mind twisting uh program that's all they do
[2:07:52.800 --> 2:08:01.120]  here is try to convince people that what they're seeing is not real now this issue clearly you
[2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:06.800]  understand it just by listening to your statement here yeah it's over here the united states economy
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:12.800]  is in collapse along with the rest of the world here and um i don't think it's getting the attention
[2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:17.760]  that it deserves here we have a major issue and i've read i've been trying for a very long time
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:23.840]  years many years as a matter of fact to try to raise awareness here though that central banks
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:31.040]  are pushing the world into a global forget about a depression we're talking about a meltdown
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:37.040]  in the in the debt market that very few people on the planet are prepared for let me show you
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:43.040]  this real quick for everyone that's watching this is a headline from bank of america this just came
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:48.480]  out a couple of days ago that explains what i've been covering for years that is that the debt
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:54.480]  market is a clear and present danger and a meltdown here in the global debt market is going to bring
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:09:00.880]  the financial system to its knees by design this is what central banks are doing here did deliberately
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:05.600]  inflating they're going out of the way to create inflation meanwhile they are lying to everyone
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:11.920]  trying to say hey this is a rate problem has nothing to do with rates anyone that follows my work new
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:17.040]  from day one follow reserve central bank and erase rates oh yeah they're going to fight inflation i
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:22.880]  said it would not work because this is not a rate problem i said they could raise rates until kingdom
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:29.680]  come it's not the issue the issue here is a currency freefall central banks around the world
[2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:35.040]  are on a mission to destroy their own currencies and to destroy the people along with it the root
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:42.000]  cause of surging inflation globally not just here in the united states is the fact that currencies
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:48.560]  are the dying has nothing to do with rates if central banks for example really wanted a slow
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:52.960]  down inflation what have they been doing for months now we've been hearing about okay we're
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:57.200]  gonna you know raise the federal funds rate the overnight lending rate this is what central banks
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:07.120]  have been doing month after month no result okay imagine my shock here okay uh the issue is a ballooning
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:12.160]  hyper ballooning money supply issue now central banks can actually do something about this if
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:17.440]  they really want to but they're not concerned at all what they could do is have the the commercial
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:23.040]  banks here raise their capital requirements from zero in other words the capital they're supposed
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:28.320]  to hold in reserve and that would contract the money supply and we would see inflation abate
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:33.920]  very rapidly but no central banks here in collusion with each other this is the real issue here
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:39.040]  central banks around the world crushing the global economy i mean honestly anyone who has
[2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:46.240]  who has taken economics 101 realizes that a central bank raises rates to do one thing
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:51.920]  to crush demand okay has nothing to do with inflation but people being duped as they always are
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:57.040]  by the mainstream propaganda ministry and they're out of control right now so absolutely we have an
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:03.040]  economy in freefall and we haven't seen a deck exactly a damn thing yet this is going to get
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:09.840]  very real very fast what is going to what we're on the cusp of here i mean just you know looking at
[2:11:09.840 --> 2:11:17.200]  headlines like this one from bank of america is a meltdown in the global debt market and what people
[2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:22.000]  don't realize you know he was looking over here at the stock market okay the stock market is not an
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:30.160]  independent entity of itself the stock market as as itself and globally derives value from what's
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:36.080]  happening in the debt market so the global equity markets are derivatives as to what is happening
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:42.160]  in the debt market now we are existing underneath a frankenstein monster that is this global debt
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:49.200]  bubble it's going to burst and when it bursts here like i said it's going to change everything the
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:53.280]  economies of the world are going to lock up in other words there'll be no transactions once the
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:12:00.240]  debt bubble pops what do we have at its core here what we have is a top of all that yeah is a debt
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:08.800]  based economic model what does that mean that means that every conceivable idea a reason to
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:15.440]  pull cash into the now from the future is going to be created wars expanding wars this app that
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:20.640]  policy whatever they got to do to continue to pull cash into the now and allow central banks to
[2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:27.280]  continue to inflate the power of any central bank resides in one thing that is their ability to inflate
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:32.240]  if we can take that power away and we can do it in a nanosecond i'll outline that in a second we
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:39.440]  win otherwise we all lose we live under the rule and guide of central banks who run the economy
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:42.960]  and they run the financial system you want to take down a central bank i'll tell everyone how
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:48.320]  to do it right now real simple prevent them from issuing one single dollar of new debt if we could
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:54.160]  prevent the federal reserve from issuing one dollar just one of that they implode we take back
[2:12:54.160 --> 2:12:59.440]  the system but you see people are being distracted they're not being told the truth that central
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:06.960]  banks especially the federal reserve here a gift from george gabin public enemy number one okay we
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:11.440]  need to end this organization in central banks who are a curse on the world and they are driving
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:19.360]  the world and its people uh off of a cliff here very very rapidly so that's where we stand that's
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:23.680]  where we're going and i hope people are ready for what's coming because i don't think there are well
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:29.440]  and here's where i kind of see it going and maybe it's both aspects of this or maybe it's one you
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:34.400]  know when they talk about house prices are going down and some people are celebrating this like oh
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:38.080]  well maybe you know maybe i can afford a house again now and they don't even realize well you
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:42.800]  just went from a two percent interest rate to a six and a half percent interest rate you're actually
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:47.520]  paying the same price for the house it's just a different number but it's the same price they just
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:53.440]  haven't realized it yet but when you talk about it's not work yeah but but when you but when you
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:59.840]  talk about the debt bubble and raising rates so okay when they raise the rates how much of that is
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:05.040]  for say let's say personal gain or they're trying to make up their own margins versus how much of
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:10.800]  that is to actually collapse the whole thing to centralize the currencies on the planet or is it
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:16.160]  both what do you think absolutely what their goal is here is very simple and i've been outlining this
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:24.720]  for probably almost an entire decade is a move to a new a completely new system absolutely digital
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:30.320]  full control and that's really what's behind this entire thing here and i'm glad you brought up the
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:34.960]  issue with housing and most people have no idea of what you what you just covered just real quick
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:39.040]  and let me just follow that up with this despite the fact that we're seeing
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:45.840]  this issue here with home prices falling a home affordability is at a record low people are being
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:50.960]  destroyed they're being wiped out this is an extermination of an entire class of people on
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:55.440]  a global level i'm we're talking about the middle class a warning i have been screaming from rooftops
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:01.760]  about for probably a decade and it's getting very real very fast and but you know what bothers me
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:05.920]  i don't think i don't see the protests i don't see anyone in the streets they're being distracted
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:10.480]  they're being propagandized they're being lied to and deceived and that's that that's really the game
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:14.640]  keep people in some kind of state of learned helplessness they feel like they can't do anything
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:19.120]  so they throw up their arms and they surrender and then of course they're told where to look what to
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:25.120]  do who to love who to hate people's lives are dictated literally by the mainstream propaganda
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:28.640]  well that's the big issue as we go to break here that i was going to bring up
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:34.320]  i mean we can we can inject the politics or remove the politics but the story is still
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:41.280]  going to be the same the mainstream media is protecting the biden administration right now
[2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:47.360]  by not telling you how bad the economy really is and it's a direct protection of the biden
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  administration because they're trying to point the finger at donald trump and republicans and say
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:57.920]  they're to blame for the economy vote democrat in november when that's not the truth once a
[2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:05.120]  tragedy reaches a level of national significance american citizens should be allowed to basically
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:10.480]  question that event in any way that they deemed fit the first amendment is unique in the world
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:14.560]  that's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely so they're going to go from michael
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:18.400]  indel next or they're going to go for steve bannon are going to go for tucker carlsson i
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:23.120]  studied the globalist 30 years ago but on air 28 years and i knew they were planning all of this

[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:38.320]  so the news we're discussing here the economic news is really not debatable but why don't you
[2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:42.480]  see it in mainstream news why isn't it on the nightly news why isn't it in the weekend reports
[2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:47.040]  well because there is an agenda right now to protect the biden administration head of the
[2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:53.120]  midterms and they don't want any bad economic news out there but greg no matter how much mainstream
[2:20:53.120 --> 2:20:59.120]  media protection of the biden administration in regards to this news there is it doesn't change
[2:20:59.120 --> 2:21:05.520]  the reality of the situation why why why is there this blind spot from the american media
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:12.720]  that oh if we just ignore this to protect our political allies then we'll just be fine no that
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:16.800]  you can ignore the tidal wave you can ignore the shark about to bite your leg off it's still going
[2:21:16.800 --> 2:21:22.320]  to bite your leg off where is this mentality of oh let's just kick this can down the road or ignore
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:28.800]  it it won't it won't affect us well you know look i think it's very simple for the mainstream
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:34.160]  media to keep people in the dark to not allow people to understand what's really happening
[2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:39.360]  and then what they do it's it's an incredible thing seriously is they tell people that what
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:44.640]  they're seeing with their own eyes isn't real it's it's an incredible phenomenon that they're
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:50.640]  trying to push this already with downplaying inflation okay oh central banks are fighting it
[2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:57.040]  oh it's getting better really i don't see that at all but this is their their mo constantly to
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:03.600]  deflect to tell you oh no that's not really what's happening i don't care what you think you're seeing
[2:22:03.600 --> 2:22:09.680]  it's not true this is what's going on and that's what they always do you see it's it's just part
[2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:15.760]  of the game that they play and unfortunately they have huge huge audiences of people who are being
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:20.640]  literally programmed okay hence forth why these are called programs and i quote the tell live vision
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:28.800]  here people sit there and they allow themselves to be kind of brainwashed into whatever the mainstream
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:35.520]  media wants to sell them this is just a game the mainstream media's goal is to twist people's minds
[2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:41.520]  get them to focus on some nonsensical things so they can pull off whatever they want on the other
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:47.600]  side look we all know that the mainstream media outlets all of them are controlled they all talk
[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:53.520]  about the same things really isn't that kind of shocking that every single mainstream media outlet
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:58.160]  will have you look over here while something else is going to talk about the same stories the same
[2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:03.360]  kind of guests repeating the same stories they'll never have a guy like me on if i were to go on
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:08.000]  any one of these financial channels i mean they wouldn't know what to do with themselves here because
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  i'm telling people how it's really working and people can see this for themselves people know
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:16.160]  the truth when they hear it it's not that hard to understand but that's what they do it's always
[2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:21.680]  a deception it's a distraction these people are there reading a script unlike you and i you and
[2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:26.240]  i we're just going for it right here we're telling people what's on our minds and people know that
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:32.720]  it's real but when you've got these mainstream media commentators reading some kind of nonsense
[2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:38.480]  script fed to them well you know what look they're out there to do one thing to to dupe people to
[2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:44.080]  convince them that things are better than they are in there and of course that you know the
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:48.640]  administration here has and everybody has their best interest in mind here nothing could be further
[2:23:48.640 --> 2:23:53.120]  from the truth there is an agenda going on here and i personally believe it all stems from central
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:58.240]  banks who control it all they control the economy they control the financial system they control the
[2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:05.040]  disbursement of information they float out whoever they want to to say whatever they want to to get
[2:24:05.040 --> 2:24:12.960]  a reaction out of the market here and it's so sick to me as a guy who is immersed in the markets
[2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:18.720]  to i mean i don't know anybody else who's more immersed in this than i am it's all i do so i
[2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:23.040]  understand how it works i understand the dark underbelly of it i realize the distractions the
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:28.000]  deception the lies and all of this i mean look what people need to do is turn that off turn off the
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:34.240]  mainstream period in the end and realize that by by by focusing on that all you're doing is allowing
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:40.400]  yourself to be programmed to be propagandized to uh you know told one thing well the polar opposite
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:45.040]  is actually true and that's a phenomenon that's literally been going on since forever but it
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:51.360]  really is reaching a fever pitch right now it's it's pretty bad and of course you know we've been
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:55.600]  hearing about the debt bubble for a while you know donald trump didn't really help it very much of
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:25:00.720]  anything he was quite frankly one of the worst for it as far as printing money and adding money
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:05.360]  uh and inflating the debt bubble is concerned now the biden administration is is claiming
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:12.960]  they're claiming that they are actually now in a um they they have it at a deficit now
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:17.120]  and they're not they're not spending money okay well yeah you react to that joe biden the democrats
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:23.680]  claim that spending is at a deficit now no it's enough it's an absolute joke you'll joe biden
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:28.160]  stein i call them biden stein like frankenstein or mommy man because he looks like the freaking
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:34.320]  mommy to me he really does you know look the man he can't walk and chew gum at the same time i think
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:39.600]  that's pretty obvious to most people right now okay but the fact of the matter is we see look what
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:46.000]  what the people can't be told is the fact that we have a debt-based economic model okay that's at
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:51.520]  its core this whole thing every developed nation has a debt-based economic model meaning the debt
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:58.080]  must inflate it can't stop the moment it stops in inflating we implode here and you know yes the
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:02.320]  fact is that what you said about donald trump is correct but at the same time look at every other
[2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:07.280]  president they do the same thing they must what what presidents cannot tell people sure and that's
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:11.040]  what i'm saying is biden is claiming i let me correct myself biden is claiming they're not
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:15.920]  running at a deficit biden is claiming that in his years they have cut the deficit yeah how
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:19.440]  about his other lie that we're not having an inflation did you hear that one yeah inflation
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:26.800]  is zero yeah doesn't even exist it's you can't make this stuff up it's impossible to do but every
[2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:33.520]  president must outspend the last president the debt must rise exponentially it can't stop if we had one
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:39.040]  fearless leader that would tell people the truth that this this debt-based economic model is a curse
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:44.160]  upon the world and because of that this is why we have wars expanding wars and things like the
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:49.280]  inflation reduction act really so let's see we're going to spend we're going to spend hundreds of
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:53.040]  billions of dollars and that's going to reduce inflation or why don't we just spend five trillion
[2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:57.040]  dollars and then we'll go to zero how about there is no inflation though they tell you there is no
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:01.520]  inflation but we need to sign the inflation reduction act to stop the inflation that doesn't
[2:27:01.520 --> 2:27:08.000]  exist it's it i love that you see that this is exactly what i'm talking about what you just said
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:13.440]  it's just so in our face but look we can expect unfortunately that the lies the propaganda and
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:19.200]  the distractions to get worse they right now unfortunately we do have an economy that is
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:24.240]  it couldn't be worse off in my opinion here people getting crushed under surging inflation with no
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:31.360]  end in sight and there's no help coming here it's only going to get worse although what's the media
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:34.640]  you're going to do they're going to tell you it's not happening this is not happening they're going
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:38.640]  to convince you or try at least to convince some people that what they're seeing is not real it's

[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:43.680]  greg manorino is my guest traders choice dot net and greg i ask you this now
[2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:50.240]  what are the winners doing there's always winners during economic crisis there's always winners
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:55.200]  during economic downturns usually it's the one causing it but there are others out there that
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:34:01.120]  know how to win in these markets as well what are the winners doing right now with all the economic
[2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:08.160]  volatility and instability greg manorino well it's pretty simple in my book uh something i've
[2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:12.880]  been talking about for many many years what do we realize the problem is uh from the from a financial
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:18.640]  standpoint looking at the global situation and understanding that central banks are not going
[2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:26.000]  to stop they're on a mission here to inflate they're going to continue to inflate and drive the world
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:32.320]  economy to the ground as they fulfill their their end game here and their end game is pretty
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:40.960]  straightforward here a collapse of the financial system and with every collapse comes opportunity
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:47.200]  here now from a financial standpoint here you want to be betting against the current hyper bubble
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:54.400]  in debt and you do that very simply by holding a unit of wealth what are units of wealth in my
[2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:59.120]  opinion and i want don't listen to anything i'm saying i want people to do their own research here
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:05.040]  is uh look my this is my favorite asset on the earth this is physical silver all right physical
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:12.160]  gold and physical silver in my view uh well they've only been real money for thousands and thousands
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:16.320]  of years and when you have a central banker like ben brunen can tell you that these are not real
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:22.000]  money you know of course the polar opposite is true so how this is going to play out is a very
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:27.040]  is very simple and there's no guesswork involved here okay we have a situation where the global
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:32.880]  debt is inflating at a staggering pace here and it's got nowhere to go and it can't possibly go
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:38.800]  anywhere else but get much worse until this whole thing implodes which is where central banks are
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:43.680]  leading us to by continuing to hyperinflate the money supply making sure inflation crushes
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:49.120]  the middle class and um you know that's just the way it's going to play out here unfortunately
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:53.600]  we're seeing an elimination of a class of people their wealth is being stolen on an unprecedented
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:58.800]  scale has been going on since the meltdown of 2008 when the Fed jumped in here started buying
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:03.040]  all the debt keeping rates suppressed you have an interest earning account even today
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:07.840]  you're being robbed blind okay so people are not being allowed to make any money in the market so
[2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:12.000]  what are you going to do if we realize that ultimately this whole thing is going to
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:16.800]  implode on itself here from a financial standpoint again because I could go on about the human
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:20.880]  aspect of this but if we're talking about it from the financial standpoint you need to be in an
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:25.680]  anti-debt unit like I said physical gold physical silver no I want people to do a little homework
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:31.920]  here look at what's called the Dow Dow Jones industrial average gold ratio and then the gold
[2:36:31.920 --> 2:36:37.200]  silver ratio okay with regard to that you will see why I say and I've been telling people for
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:42.000]  years that physical silver is the most undivided asset in the earth I don't sell this stuff I just
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:46.240]  believe that this is how people can protect their wealth in a meltdown which is going to occur in the
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:50.560]  debt market look everyone's foot fixated on the stock market there's a reason for that you got the
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:55.200]  mainstream financial channels telling people look the Dow Jones industrial average 30 companies
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:59.840]  that's all but the driver here remains the debt market here we've been seeing all this instability
[2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:06.400]  lately but this did turn around on Friday when they floated out the Fed whisperer to say come
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:14.160]  December the Fed may pivot and start scaling back their aggressive rate raising stance which has
[2:37:14.160 --> 2:37:18.560]  done nothing to stop inflation but the the end game is very simple an implosion of the financial
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:25.200]  system on an unprecedented scale globally and that will cause the yields to spike in an uncontrolled
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.000]  fashion which we're witnessing lately a lot of pressure on the stock market global stock markets
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:34.320]  are going to sell off very very rapidly at one point then you're going to see cash move it's just
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:40.560]  going to move from one set of assets into another I tell people all the time when markets drop you
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:46.240]  know cash doesn't fly grow little wings and fly away to money heaven it just moves from one reality
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:50.800]  into another so in my view understanding that the debt market is the biggest bubble in the world and
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:57.120]  the greatest threat to humankind bar none as a clear and present danger here um as because
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:03.440]  when this debt market bubble implodes we're going to have a resource problem on an unbelievable
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:09.280]  scale pandemonium industries are locking up of the financial system people are going to just that
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:13.680]  that will force people to take to the streets of course then you're going to get the same people
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:18.480]  as you alluded to who created the problem are going to institute oh we have a solution for you
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:24.400]  so to protect your wealth yet again it's pretty simple debt market implosion pressure on global
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:29.920]  stock markets cash will move into commodities I happen to my favorites are gold and silver
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:33.840]  because I think they're massively suppressed as it has been a suppression game going on for many
[2:38:33.840 --> 2:38:39.520]  many years here um so look that's what you do uh become your own central bank bet against the debt
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:46.480]  this has been what I've told people since day one um understanding clearly that this thing is just
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:51.440]  you know being fueled out of control by design it's not going to stop until it does no we have
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:55.920]  clues here by watching the global debt market by following the us 10 year yield which is the
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:00.640]  benchmark by looking at the relative strength of the dollar or the dixie um and I have a little
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:06.000]  neat little thing right on my website trades choice dot net it's called the m m r i manorino
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:12.640]  market risk indicator right now we just crossed 300 which is extreme risk on friday okay we've
[2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:17.840]  come down a little bit when I first put the m m r i out is it Haiti all right it's free to anyone
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:24.400]  just go over to my website and look at it and it's really gauges market risk based on what's
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:28.880]  happening in the debt markets a neat little equation I came up with it works so look we don't
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:33.120]  have to guess people don't have to guess when this is going to happen we have clues here um
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:37.840]  so that's where we see where I stand protect yourself from that from that standpoint meaning
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:42.960]  betting against the debt become your own central bank here uh look but what is our greatest resource
[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:48.080]  look people who know my work realize what I'm about to tell everyone here we people we are
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:51.760]  each other's greatest resource we gotta support each other we gotta you gotta get together with
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:57.280]  like-minded people understand that the divide and conquer conquer mechanism being propagated
[2:39:57.280 --> 2:40:03.520]  by the mainstream just it just doesn't work um you know we need to come together all of us
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:10.320]  if we can do that we win if we can't we lose period I want to come back in the final segment
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:15.600]  with you and and really kind of hone in on the the debt bubble and and what the burst will look
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:19.360]  like and even maybe even play a little bit of a devil's advocate role there to get a better
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:24.000]  understanding of it uh at least for the audience but let me ask you this as we close out this segment
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:28.720]  it's been well it hasn't been in the news lately I just I just happen to know this because I'm
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:32.800]  interested in precious metals myself and I and I talk to people in the industry there have been
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:39.040]  major runs of gold in the in the private sector the public sector runs kind of already happened
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:42.720]  China bought up a lot of gold Russia bought up a lot of gold the US treasury that that run kind of
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:48.000]  already happened that kind of tailed tailed off now the private sector is rushing to get gold
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:52.960]  rushing to get silver uh it's hard to actually make a purchase now you're going to be waiting
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:57.600]  there's a wait period now to get precious metals um if you're looking to make a big purchase at least
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:03.760]  definitely and so why is that going on right now what are you seeing with the delay and and
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:09.200]  individuals being able to make precious metal purchases I've been telling people for years
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:14.400]  that at one point uh I it's going to be very difficult to acquire these things because look
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:20.080]  these are these are actually scarce they're real things and and I think at least I'd like to believe
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:26.720]  that people are are are raising their awareness they understand what's happening at least I would
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:32.240]  really hope that's the case here most people unfortunately don't have a clue but more people
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:38.640]  are waking up to the grand plan here the final solution of central banks what they're doing how
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:43.920]  they're driving the economy how inflation is not going to stop the lies the transitory
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:50.640]  it was temporary how that got pushed by members of congress how it got pushed by central bankers
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:55.520]  uh you know brain dead president biden you know all this stuff it's just it's just not going to
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:42:01.040]  stop it's it's just it's a mind screwing incredible scale but people are waking up so this is what
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:05.600]  we're seeing this look I can promise you that anyone that I know that has a few dollars laying
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:11.040]  around well they have they have a nice stash already and they've been buying in gold and silver
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:17.360]  for I've been buying silver since it was eight bucks and gold was like 750 maybe even less than
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:23.040]  that and I and I haven't bought any in a while but I intend to maybe buy some more here but I've
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:26.480]  been prepared for this for a very very long time and people need to get ready and they need to get
[2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:31.680]  ready now for an implosion of that dead market yeah and the one thing that is so obvious even
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:37.600]  to a layman just looking at it you can see the anomaly of the US dollar or call it inflation
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:42.320]  whatever you want looking at a chart it goes straight up and then you look at a chart for
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:48.240]  gold or silver somehow that doesn't actually go up at the same rate why would that be going on why
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:53.360]  do those prices stay synthetically there while the dollar loses value or ask that and the debt

[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:24.720]  our final segment here with dreg manorino traders choice dot net is his website i want to do one
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:29.760]  more question on the gold silver issue before we ask uh the kind of devil's advocate question
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:37.840]  about the debt bubble bursting why is it that gold and silver prices have not rose with the
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:44.880]  rate of inflation or why doesn't it properly reflect reflect rather the devaluation of the
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:49.040]  dollar over those times but gold and silver prices still remain the same why does that
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:56.560]  phenomenon happen isn't that interesting let's talk about that a little bit to truly understand
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:04.640]  why that mechanism uh plays out the way that it does you have to understand how unfortunately uh
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:13.040]  the price of gold and silver is is is valued or is is calculated now generally when you're looking
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:20.880]  at let's say for example you're looking at apple stock okay ticker aap l here okay um the value
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:26.240]  of that stock is the value of that the stock not the underlying value of let's say a derivative
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:30.880]  now let's talk about a derivative real quick what what is a derivative when people hear this word
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:36.800]  their brain explodes it's a very very simple thing to understand a derivative is simply
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:48.240]  a side bet on an underlying asset now uh so the derivative derives value derived derivative
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:55.840]  from that underlying asset okay so how they keep the price of gold and silver artificially suppressed
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.800]  is by manipulating the derivative okay the derivative market it's it's funny that we're
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:04.960]  talking about this here right now is uh they just had a long conversation yesterday with a friend
[2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:11.200]  of mine on about it is is the most poorly understood aspect i believe of the entire global
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:15.840]  financial system and it's going to be the derivative market that really brings the world economy and
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:19.760]  the financial system to its knees when we're talking about a derivative or something that
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:24.480]  derives value from something else there's not just one layer of these things these are there's
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:28.800]  one side bet and there's a side bet on a side bet and a side bet on a side bet and a side
[2:49:28.800 --> 2:49:35.440]  bet on a side bet in both directions both up and down um and it's it's it's enormous and every one
[2:49:35.440 --> 2:49:40.160]  every time you get another side bet off of a derivative there's more leverage involved and
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:43.680]  what people need to understand is these things don't even really exist they're not on the
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:50.000]  elemental chart it's just something that's something that's a woozy it's a wazzy it's
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  it's out there it's not on the elemental chart yeah exactly and so understanding that mechanism
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:01.520]  here this is how they're able to manipulate the price of gold and so it's not going to stop until
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:06.720]  it does until we see actual physical shortages of this stuff um because they can do whatever they
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:11.680]  want to we're talking about adding digits to a screen removing digits from a screen here
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:16.400]  kind of like how the financial system itself works here um creating cash from nothing this
[2:50:16.400 --> 2:50:21.040]  is how central banks work it's an incredible situation here uh you know people don't even
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:28.240]  understand money what is the cash that we have i mean you know you we work to to get these things
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:34.160]  you know so we can go out and buy uh but these are are they're not even ours okay you go out
[2:50:34.160 --> 2:50:39.840]  and you work for these dollars these dollars that are issued by central banks here they're not ours
[2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:46.000]  it's they own them battling do they own the currency it's owed back to the issuing central bank
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:51.520]  plus cash that they create a thin air imagine that kind of a so these are iou's just like
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:56.480]  how uh treasury is okay there's just iou's and we owe all of this back to the central banks
[2:50:56.480 --> 2:51:01.200]  never meant to be paid back you have to understand that it's just meant to be inflated on and then
[2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:05.760]  inflated larger and larger and larger and larger has created this incredible monster now if you were
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:11.520]  to add in the derivatives market on top of you know people look at things like for example the
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:16.960]  national debt whatever it might be and they look at it at face value but if you look at the derivatives
[2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:24.000]  on that it's in the quadrillions we and the issue is no one knows how big it is it cannot be calculated
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:31.280]  and there's the monster in the room and um it's going to implode just like uh like people have no
[2:51:31.280 --> 2:51:35.200]  idea how bad this is going to actually end up getting and this is what people need to prepare
[2:51:35.200 --> 2:51:40.160]  themselves from every level you know mentally physically spiritually absolutely here making
[2:51:40.160 --> 2:51:45.840]  alliances with people in their neighborhoods here realizing where we're going uh how we're being pushed
[2:51:45.840 --> 2:51:52.240]  deliberately down a pathway uh being literally led to the slaughter and this is accelerating it's
[2:51:52.240 --> 2:51:57.280]  very fast uh and in my opinion going back to the debt bubble and i think we're going to talk a
[2:51:57.280 --> 2:52:00.720]  little more about that but let me just but let me just ask you quickly though to try to try to
[2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:06.320]  put a bow on this so okay so let's just i i'm i'm making these numbers up just as an example
[2:52:06.320 --> 2:52:12.960]  let's say in 1940 uh an ounce of gold was one dollar okay and now you're in the year 2020
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:20.720]  and one dollar compared to a dollar in 1940 is now say 20 cents but the ounce of gold is
[2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:27.440]  not 20 cents it's still a dollar or it's it's a bad example my point is though how has the price
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:32.880]  of pretzels gold and silver specifically not properly responded to the rate of inflation
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:39.520]  or to the rate of the valuation of the dollar well you know if you look at what an ounce of gold
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:45.280]  would buy today and an ounce of gold would be would buy back then you will see that it actually
[2:52:45.280 --> 2:52:52.400]  by the same thing um but based upon what i was saying earlier is you got this issue of the
[2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:59.040]  hard asset deriving value from the derivative it's upside down in no it's it's unbelievable
[2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:04.880]  how this works here how a hard asset because of the way the derivative is set up is deriving value
[2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:09.440]  from the derivative and it can be rigged and pulled and twisted any way they want it to go
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:15.120]  the financial system itself is a farce it it again it's not all the elemental chart it doesn't
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:21.200]  exist well how does actually the financial system itself work it works on confidence
[2:53:21.200 --> 2:53:25.840]  confidence notice the word here that it will work here central banks are in full control of
[2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:28.880]  this thing they control the economy they control the financial system and they have their
[2:53:28.880 --> 2:53:33.680]  puppets that they put in charge of us all by you know our representatives that our that our
[2:53:33.680 --> 2:53:39.200]  votes are supposed to count for which they clearly don't um you know to uh look at it for our best
[2:53:39.200 --> 2:53:44.160]  interest but nothing could possibly be further from the truth here and all they're concerned with
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:49.680]  here central banks is there is to continue to inflate to issue more debt to find any reason
[2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:54.400]  imaginable whatever it might be and this is the frightening part let me just end off with this
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:54:02.000]  real quick uh to continue to expand the debt if people were to guess for a moment what is the
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:07.680]  fastest easiest and most simple way to vastly continue to inflate the debt it would be uh
[2:54:07.680 --> 2:54:16.560]  expanding a war no money no no endeavor of human existence uh is able to generate more cash flow
[2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:23.120]  to the military industrial complex than war yeah and we've already seen that yeah we've seen that
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:26.640]  with the ukraine situation they say six billion dollars could solve world hunger well then they
[2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:31.200]  gave a hundred billion to ukraine it's funny how that works so so let me just so let me just play
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:35.200]  devil's advocate here quickly because obviously we talk about the financial systems you got kind of
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:39.440]  the with the central banks you got the mix of corruption and policy causing the problems but
[2:54:39.440 --> 2:54:43.600]  okay i've been here in the debt bubble is going to collapse for years i've been here in the debt
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:49.040]  bubble collapse i've been here in eminent danger for years now why why should i listen to that
[2:54:49.040 --> 2:54:54.240]  concern now why should i heed that warning now because it's happening look at the the side
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:55:01.120]  effect here of all this money creation is inflation and it's going to get much much worse here
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:06.160]  especially when this whole thing you know look we can see it it's actually unfolding before our eyes
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:13.200]  if there's artificial suppression of rates now since the last meltdown has inflated the the global
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:21.440]  debt multiple times and it's starting to manifest itself in the way it's hurting people via inflation
[2:55:21.440 --> 2:55:26.400]  which it was meant to do from the get go so this is just the opening act we haven't seen anything
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:31.680]  yet look if we if they really wanted to get a handle on on on this whole financial situation
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:36.160]  they could have taken action years ago but what people don't get is it's this debt-based economic
[2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:42.080]  model is dying and we're seeing the proof of that by actions of central banks who continue to keep
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:46.560]  rates suppressed you can't just central banks have no magical power they can't just say hey we're
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:50.080]  going to keep rates at this level of that level they have to get into the market and make it happen
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:55.520]  they have to make the cash out of thin air and buy the debt that's how it works people have no idea
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:59.760]  how this whole thing is it works but and they're desperate right now to keep it afloat for as
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:04.400]  long as possible i don't think they're done they're going to continue to do this until they suck in
[2:56:04.400 --> 2:56:08.720]  every last available person what they're trying to do is create more slaves to the system the more
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:14.160]  people that they can get dependent on the system the easier it is for them to sell it yeah a new
[2:56:14.160 --> 2:56:20.080]  system to people as they beg for help because that's what i think that to me you just put it and
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:24.080]  we're out of time here i'm sorry to cut you off but to me you just put it on the most relatable
[2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:30.480]  level where the way the the way the american financial system is set up it promotes debt
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:35.520]  it promotes you to go into debt and and and and then the financial experts will say or the bankers
[2:56:35.520 --> 2:56:38.880]  will say well this is a good thing you should go into debt you should do this and then the credit
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:44.720]  cards on top of it that's horrible policy it will always lead to failure it has caused collapse in
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:50.560]  the past and i agree that it we're on the verge of another one so folks take greg manorino's advice
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:56.800]  go to his website traderschoice.net get yourself in a smart position in case of the collapse and look
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:57:01.920]  i understand why people leverage debt i understand why people take debt out believe me i get it but
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:07.760]  you got to understand that um that's not a smart way to protect your wealth into the future so
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:12.080]  greg manorino thank you so much for joining us today brother absolutely thanks for having me

[3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:21.360]  fourth hour of the alex jones show and reporting to you from the testing ground of the new world
[3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:28.400]  order here in australia and the us midterms are coming up and i want to give everyone some motivation
[3:00:28.400 --> 3:00:34.720]  as to why it is so important to vote and get people with integrity in power steven ohan
[3:00:34.720 --> 3:00:40.080]  we're talking about this earlier and it is truly crucial we really have to fight in every way that
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:46.480]  we possibly can with integrity and god does honor those who do things with integrity now i'm saying
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:53.040]  all of this because what i'm about to share with everyone today is some of the most alarming laws
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:59.360]  in the world that have been introduced into australia and some of these have already been passed
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:05.200]  and if we don't win against these maniacs this will come to every single country because australia
[3:01:05.200 --> 3:01:13.120]  is the testing ground of the new world order we are treated like lab rats here and and i know that
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:19.040]  the people of america certainly do not want to be treated like lab rats no one does we are all
[3:01:19.040 --> 3:01:24.000]  fed up with these maniac eugenicists doing what they're doing to the whole world but we have a
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:29.520]  bunch of leftists and climate change cultists in power here in australia and since they were uh
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:38.720]  selected not elected into the parliament we've had some insane laws passed in our country some of
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:44.080]  the most extreme laws in the world to the point where they've even made the mainstream media so
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:49.200]  i want to talk to everyone about that and warn everyone and and remind everyone to keep an eye
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:55.680]  out on australia because whatever they do to us here they will do to you in your country if our
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:01.200]  people don't rise up so the first one that i want to talk about is a law called the monitoring of
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:09.280]  places of detention by the united nation subcommittee on prevention of torture op cap bill 2022 this
[3:02:09.280 --> 3:02:15.840]  this bill was introduced um under the guise of preventing torture and it allows the united nations
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:21.440]  to come into our facilities such as mental health wards or prisons and make sure that
[3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:26.640]  everyone's being treated fairly there or that that's what they say is the reason why they're
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:30.800]  allowing the united nations into our facilities but when you actually start reading through the
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:37.360]  legislation you see that that's not the case and funnily enough i i we released this report in uh
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:44.560]  in august on zmedia.com and all of the predictions that i made reading through this legislation
[3:02:44.560 --> 3:02:51.280]  came true unfortunately you know most people don't have the time to read through pages and pages
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:56.240]  hundreds of pages of legislation and so this is how they slip this stuff in it's unbelievable but
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:02.400]  basically it says that it's a bill for an act to facilitate visits to places of detention
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:10.480]  and access to information by the united nation subcommittee it talks about people that get taken
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:19.040]  for for public health reasons to quarantine facilities though you know what happened in
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:24.800]  australia during the period of the so-called pandemic we know that it wasn't a real pandemic
[3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:29.200]  where people were actually taken to these facilities for not complying with things like
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:36.000]  contact tracing or home quarantine and things of that nature uh the places of detention of course
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:40.880]  like i said at least prisons mental health facilities and then uh it talks about public
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:47.840]  health orders and pandemic orders and even lists direction given in the exercise of a pandemic
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:55.040]  management power and of course what they call emergency powers and you know the the agenda with
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:59.440]  climate change in the future australia's just released this report i've been talking about it for
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:05.680]  for weeks now it's australia's pandemic preparedness report and we have five separate pandemics that
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:10.640]  they have identified uh that are going to hit the whole world and they talk about how these are going
[3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:18.400]  to be uh it's dependent on climate change when these pandemics just shift because of human
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:23.920]  encroachment on animal environments and things like that so at any given time they can say that
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:30.240]  there's a public health need there's an emergency because we're impacting the climate all of these
[3:04:30.240 --> 3:04:36.000]  things and they can do it to us yet again and you saw how quickly the people fell for it last time
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:44.080]  they will fall for it again the un has unrestricted access to any part of the place of detention
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:47.920]  and i'm telling you this has even made the main mainstream in the next segment we're
[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:51.760]  going to keep talking about that and i'll let you know what the mainstream has to say about it
[3:04:51.760 --> 3:04:59.680]  we'll be back right after this short break look it's not hype that info wars has changed the
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:05.600]  world it's not hype that your support of info wars is the reason we were able to do this so i
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:10.880]  salute you and i thank you now you know about fluoride the bad halogen on the periodic table
[3:05:10.880 --> 3:05:15.360]  well high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride and when you've got
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:18.640]  it in your body it doesn't just supercharge yourselves it does just give you more energy

[3:05:56.160 --> 3:06:05.200]  info war store dot com
[3:06:05.200 --> 3:06:10.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host today maria z we're talking about
[3:06:10.800 --> 3:06:15.200]  what the australian government has brought in under the guise of preventing torture in
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:20.960]  quarantine facilities in prisons but what this actually is is a means for the united nations to
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:27.120]  come into quarantine facilities and interrogate citizens uh and and and that's actually evidenced
[3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:32.160]  in the bill that was introduced into australia it goes on to talk about how the united nations
[3:06:32.160 --> 3:06:36.880]  have unrestricted access to any part of the detention facilities where people might be
[3:06:36.880 --> 3:06:42.640]  held under the guise of public health it talks about the un being able to interview any person
[3:06:43.200 --> 3:06:49.760]  and also deny them a support person so it's it says that uh you're allowed a support person
[3:06:49.760 --> 3:06:56.320]  but the united nations representative has the ability to deny you the right to have that support
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:07:02.480]  person present so it's a one-on-one interrogation with the united nations who we know are serving
[3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:09.440]  the globlest satanic cabal and uh and i want to say here if this is for your health if they are
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:14.880]  there to make sure that you're not being tortured or or you're you're actually there because this
[3:07:14.880 --> 3:07:22.000]  is for public health why would they specifically go to the effort of writing into law that the
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:27.280]  united nations have the right to deny you a support person if this is for your health if it's for
[3:07:27.280 --> 3:07:33.360]  your well-being why would they need to deny you that right in fact it should be a human right
[3:07:33.360 --> 3:07:38.480]  here to be able to have that support person present if if we're doing everything above
[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:43.200]  board but every single person around the world knows that these people are psychopaths we know
[3:07:43.200 --> 3:07:48.400]  what they did to us over the past two years we know how capable they are of producing lies
[3:07:49.040 --> 3:07:55.280]  that despite the fact that people see straight through the lies despite the the evidence mounting
[3:07:55.280 --> 3:08:00.640]  all over the world of the fact that these people have lied about the safety of these shots have
[3:08:00.640 --> 3:08:08.240]  lied about their efficacy and have openly gone out killing people with their shots and i mean that
[3:08:08.240 --> 3:08:14.960]  these people are murderers despite all of that they've still kept going because they don't care
[3:08:14.960 --> 3:08:21.120]  they will just keep lying to you but people are waking up and for that i am grateful we we've
[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:25.920]  actually had this reach the mainstream media news and i predicted this back in august when we
[3:08:25.920 --> 3:08:32.720]  reported on it and i said this is going to be uh brought in under the guise of protecting people
[3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:37.920]  and protecting their human rights but that is just a front for the fact that they want to bring
[3:08:37.920 --> 3:08:43.600]  this into legislation this was introduced into the state of victoria and it turns out the daily
[3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:49.040]  mail has actually reported on this and said that there's been outrage as the united nations shows
[3:08:49.040 --> 3:08:55.680]  up for unannounced australia's prisons for random inspections go to saudi arabia instead they say
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:00.400]  where they still put people to death for being gay so that they're feigning this outrage now
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:05.280]  they're faking this that it says the un prison inspectors were sent packing after being denied
[3:09:05.280 --> 3:09:09.600]  access to new south wales prisons but then it says that the inspectors left the country for new
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:16.880]  york after a 12-day australian tour so be warned americans these so-called prevention of torture
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:22.240]  inspector inspectors are coming to new york right after they were denied access to some prisons here
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:28.320]  it goes on to talk about the fact that uh that they have suspended plans to look at australian
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:33.280]  detention facilities after new south wales and queensland these two states blocked access
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:40.640]  and it actually mentions here the representatives from the un subcommittee and you know they really
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:45.040]  want to hammer home that they're there to make sure that they're preventing torture uh were
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:50.720]  obstructed from carrying out listen to these words their protective mandate there's that word
[3:09:50.720 --> 3:09:58.400]  mandate again violating the country's uh agreement or obligations they say so we now we're now
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:04.560]  obligated to allow these un goons into our detention facilities and again i'm telling you
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:10.720]  they've specifically written into here quarantine facilities under the public under public health
[3:10:10.720 --> 3:10:16.160]  measures there's one more alarming thing in this daily mail article which actually says that um
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:21.680]  un inspectors were given access to commonwealth run detention facilities but did not specify which
[3:10:21.680 --> 3:10:27.040]  ones so they have actually been to other commonwealth run detention facilities uh they're just not
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:34.960]  telling us which ones now within the next breath another article was released by the mainstream
[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:40.400]  media which said that queensland is now going to change laws that prevented un inspectors
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:45.360]  entering mental health wards so they come out with this article look how the mainstream coordinates
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:50.240]  to lie to the people they come out with an article saying oh there's been outrage what are you doing
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:55.120]  in our prisons but they talk about the then they talk about the fact that there's a mandate
[3:10:55.120 --> 3:11:01.040]  our country has an obligation to the united nations to let them into our facilities and then in the
[3:11:01.040 --> 3:11:07.840]  next breath queensland goes and changes laws to allow the united nations into mental health wards
[3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:13.440]  but that's where it starts it's all done under the guise of protecting you under the guise of human
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:19.680]  rights just like this insane trans agenda oh it's about equality it's about human rights
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:26.080]  we want to treat everyone fairly and make sure we're all equal meanwhile they're plotting to lock
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:30.960]  dissidents up in facilities and this is exactly what this is about and i'm going to prove it to you
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:37.920]  in the coming segments but basically the delegations head he has said uh aisha shoujuni muhammad
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:44.480]  has condemned both states for uh restricting access to un officials and has said that it is deeply
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:50.160]  regrettable that the limited understanding of the subcommittee on preventing tortures again
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:55.440]  there's that word mandate lack of cooperation stemming from internal disagreements especially
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:12:00.160]  with respect to the states of queensland has compelled us to take this drastic measure what
[3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:04.240]  they're doing at the moment in australia is they're introducing laws through queensland because
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:10.240]  there's some sort of a loophole uh where this ends up applying to the rest of the country
[3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:15.760]  and again i'll prove that to you later on in the show but it it says they go on to talk about the
[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:22.400]  fact that this looks like either gross incompetence or deliberate obstruction this is gross incompetence
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:26.640]  why aren't we letting the united nations into our facilities my goodness look out look at the
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:32.560]  propaganda and the level of brainwashing here and most people will believe it because they think
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:37.440]  it's for public health and human rights it's unbelievable based on what we've heard from
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:42.640]  advocacy groups i dread to think what the government might be hiding as they duck and weave these
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:50.880]  inspections and then they go on you know they create this outrage they create this outrage
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:57.040]  in order to justify bringing in tougher laws this is what they do they create a stir in the
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:01.200]  mainstream they create a stir in the people who think that the mainstream serves the good of the
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:07.040]  people which is a complete lie because they're working hand in hand with these people to kill you
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:12.480]  and then they buy this stuff and then you get virtue signaling activists saying oh we're gonna
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:16.960]  we're gonna get involved in this we need the united nations here to make sure that we're safe
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:22.080]  all these poor people with mental health issues it's unbelievable how they do it and how they spin
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:29.200]  it but they go on to say that last week's disastrous un visits shows the importance of
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:35.360]  uh relate realizing this protection they're calling it protection allowing the united nations to
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:41.440]  come in and interrogate citizens one on one and deny them a support person it is absolutely horrendous
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:50.320]  and it is past time for human rights to be fully protected including all closed settings in Queensland
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:14:00.080]  I mean literally two months ago I warned that this was coming that report is up on zmedia.com we've
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:06.960]  also got the emergency management amendment bill temporary COVID-19 provisions bill of 2022 that
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:13.040]  I want to talk to you about and again you know most people don't find it interesting breaking
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:18.960]  down legislation but while outweigh distracted while they're trying to sweep COVID under the rug
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:23.520]  and call it you know oh well we just did the best that we could with the information that we had and
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:30.160]  we had to move at the speed of science the most unscientific statement I've ever heard made
[3:14:30.160 --> 3:14:35.200]  by these people while they're distracting you with that this is the kind of stuff that they're
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:40.880]  slipping right under our noses and I would caution the people of the United States to watch for this
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:47.040]  someone should take the responsibility of watching for new bills like this and reporting on it

[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:33.360]  of supporting info wars i i mean i haven't been asked to do this plug but working in independent
[3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:40.720]  media i really understand the need for people to support independent media see most independent
[3:20:40.720 --> 3:20:46.640]  media is funded for the people because they buy the people because they serve the people we exist
[3:20:46.640 --> 3:20:53.600]  for the people and this broadcast info wars has been instrumental in providing a platform for
[3:20:53.600 --> 3:20:58.240]  people who are seeking the truth and telling people the truth the truth that the mainstream
[3:20:58.240 --> 3:21:02.480]  media would never tell you see you will never get this crucial information that is literally
[3:21:02.480 --> 3:21:08.080]  lifesaving in the mainstream they will hide this from you until their very last breath
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:13.840]  because they're funded and paid by the globalists so please support info wars head to infowarstore.com
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:19.920]  and support your favorite broadcasters whenever you get the chance because the truth reaching you
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:25.200]  depends on your support i want to go back to this emergency management amendment bill
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:31.600]  interestingly the it talks about covert 19 in this bill it's a western australian bill that was
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:37.360]  introduced and it there's been a lot of noise about this one see what they did was they ended
[3:21:37.360 --> 3:21:42.160]  the temporary emergency powers in the state of western australia then they introduced this bill
[3:21:42.160 --> 3:21:49.920]  which as it stands goes is in place for two years but they specified covert 19 in there now i my
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:54.560]  assumption here i'm making an assumption is because covert 19 is the flavor of the day
[3:21:54.560 --> 3:22:00.400]  and it's easiest to get away with if they put covert 19 in and later on just make an amendment
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:05.920]  say oh well it's not covert 19 anymore it's influenza or it's this that and the other whatever
[3:22:05.920 --> 3:22:13.280]  new disease they desired decide to concoct in their bio labs where they are creating more and more
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:17.600]  viruses we just saw that article come out of boston university there's also been another one
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:23.840]  where they have announced that they've created a more dangerous version of monkeypox i'll talk
[3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:30.800]  about that a little bit later but um i think that what's happened since we we at z media made noise
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:35.760]  about this particular bill in western australia this went around the world let me tell you we
[3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:41.200]  had support from people in the united states former military sending us videos saying we stand with
[3:22:41.200 --> 3:22:47.760]  you people created sub stacks this video of me talking about this legislation was shared on
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:54.160]  twitter the last time i checked it was almost 300 000 people had seen it and we raised awareness
[3:22:54.160 --> 3:22:59.600]  about this to the point where they've actually pulled down the bill from their website you can't
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:04.640]  find it anymore we've got copies thankfully and we and we found a link that works but they've taken
[3:23:04.640 --> 3:23:11.040]  the bill down from the website because of the amount of public pushback that uh that occurred as a
[3:23:11.040 --> 3:23:17.520]  result of this report so that's just proof to you that independent the power of independent media in
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:24.480]  raising awareness about these issues the mainstream did report on it but it was nowhere near uh the
[3:23:24.480 --> 3:23:30.640]  truth about this bill and what it actually allows and following our report uh people were horrified
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:35.200]  it resulted in protests it resulted in people going to the front of parliament and protesting
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:40.080]  and saying we will not allow for this this is absolutely insane and why on earth would we
[3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:44.720]  be doing it at this stage this late in the game when biden says the pandemic's over why do we need
[3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:50.880]  to do this you can find that report uh new legislation to force australians into quarantine
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:57.840]  and force injections uh i don't know the exact title but it is on the z media uh channel on band
[3:23:57.840 --> 3:24:04.800]  dot video i want to talk about um the fact that you know maybe they've they've introduced this
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:12.320]  bill to distract from the fact that we've actually made changes to the public health act of 2005 as
[3:24:12.320 --> 3:24:18.240]  of september 2022 the seventh of september 2022 and again this was done in Queensland which means
[3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:24.480]  that it applies to all states this is the first time that i'm presenting this information and i'm
[3:24:24.480 --> 3:24:29.520]  going to give everyone a brief overview of this legislation and then i'm going to release a detailed
[3:24:29.520 --> 3:24:34.960]  report this week it'll be up on z media dot com it'll also be up on band dot video i think the
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:41.360]  world really needs to see this report and understand the extent of what these people have planned
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:48.720]  this legislation i'm repeating applies to all of australia and they are writing it in to the law
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:55.680]  that they can then go and uh take citizens to these quarantine facilities and forcefully
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:25:01.600]  inject them and i'm not even kidding this is what the law says so it talks about um
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:08.880]  notifiable conditions in this legislation and it says um it uses words like declared health
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:15.040]  services to minimize infection risks so basically what it allows for is the chief health officers of
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:24.320]  whatever state to convert certain health services to quarantine facilities or or nominate health
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:29.920]  services for the purpose of quarantining people it talks about protecting children
[3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:38.560]  and responding to public health emergencies now there's so much in here about public health
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:44.160]  we recently had a bill passed in the state of Queensland which is very very similar to what
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:50.640]  Gavin Newsom has just introduced in his state which basically makes what one australian doctor
[3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:55.600]  described to me on air as it turns australia it turns doctors into agents of the governments
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:26:02.160]  they are not allowed to disagree with anything that would undermine public health or public
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:08.080]  confidence in the government's recommended program i mentioned before that the world health
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:14.720]  organization has released their plan to vaccinate introduce 500 new vaccines by the year 2030
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:19.280]  i've recently interviewed professor delores carhill and she says we are in the killing
[3:26:19.280 --> 3:26:25.920]  years of agenda 21 it's between the years 2020 and 2026 so it's no wonder that they're introducing
[3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:31.200]  all of this by that year and then australia's pandemic preparedness plan that they've released
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:36.320]  in conjunction with CSIRO who was previously involved or accused of being involved in gainer
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:42.160]  function research in wuhan and has been involved in weather modification activities in australia
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:48.560]  previously they want this pandemic preparedness plan in place by 2027 and what people really
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:56.400]  need to grasp is that this is a slow burn plan they're not going to do it suddenly again so soon
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:00.880]  after covid but all of these little things that they're writing into the law right now
[3:27:00.880 --> 3:27:06.800]  will enable them to at the drop of a hat do it to you again so people need to remain involved
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:12.480]  in this information but i will go on it gives power to state or local governments the public
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:19.920]  health act of 2005 last updated 7th of september 2022 it allows them to remove anything from a place
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:26.000]  kill animals and tell people how long they cannot use a place so say they decide that your home or
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:31.440]  your place of residence or your place of work is not safe for whatever reason they can shut down
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:38.000]  an establishment indefinitely and they it says that they have to go to a magistrate to get enforcement
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:45.440]  orders or warrants essentially the only criteria of whatever these authorized officers are that
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:52.000]  are going and applying for these things is is that they need to just believe that someone will be
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:59.520]  at risk to public health they just need to have reasonable belief that an area could be at risk
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:07.440]  to a public health emergency or a notifiable condition so there's no real evidence required
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:12.640]  they just have to believe it and there are multiple places inside this legislation where they've
[3:28:12.640 --> 3:28:18.800]  actually allowed for this to be overridden the the need for it to go through a magistrate and
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:24.320]  the due process because if it's an emergency they can just go ahead and do it they make special note
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:28.720]  of these notifiable health conditions which is essentially whatever they define as notifiable
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:34.480]  they they can make it influenza and they've also listed this in the preparedness plan the the
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:39.600]  australian uh pandemic preparedness plan that i keep making reference to they've spoken about how
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:46.480]  influenza is going to be a pandemic driver and we need to be prepared for it talks about the powers
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:51.600]  of people like contact tracing officers and i'll get into that right on the other side of this
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:29:00.000]  break you don't want to miss this next part once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:06.960]  american citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:11.520]  fit the first amendment is unique in the world that's what they want to take away your ability to
[3:29:11.520 --> 3:29:15.440]  speak freely so they're going to go from michael indel next or they're going to go for steve bannon
[3:29:15.440 --> 3:29:20.160]  are going to go for tucker carlson i studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years

[3:32:55.440 --> 3:33:11.680]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:11.680 --> 3:33:17.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show today we're talking about insane legislation that has been
[3:33:17.840 --> 3:33:24.080]  introduced into australia and we're talking about the public health act of 2005 going on from what
[3:33:24.080 --> 3:33:29.360]  we were saying before the contact tracing officers have been given these powers that they only need
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:35.520]  to reasonably suspect that a person has a notifiable condition or may have been in contact
[3:33:35.520 --> 3:33:41.040]  with someone who has a notifiable condition it literally says may have been so there's no proof
[3:33:41.040 --> 3:33:48.400]  required of the fact that this person is actually sick and again they tested this
[3:33:48.400 --> 3:33:54.560]  during covid they they put a lady named hailey hodgson into a quarantine facility
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.720]  because she she was a close contact even though she was negative she was a close contact
[3:34:00.720 --> 3:34:08.400]  and she breached her home quarantine conditions and therefore she was taken against her will
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:14.000]  to howard springs quarantine facility in the northern territory this was an example
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:17.600]  of what is going to happen and we see what's happening to the people of china right now
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:22.080]  they're taking them to these quarantine facilities they're building more and more of these they just
[3:34:22.080 --> 3:34:27.520]  announced over 300 million dollars if i'm not mistaken dedicated to a new facility
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:34.800]  in china again another one i mean look at this what do you need something of this magnitude
[3:34:34.800 --> 3:34:41.200]  being built now another 300 million dollars for what they're calling zero covid policy which we
[3:34:41.200 --> 3:34:46.400]  all know is not achievable and it is a lie a means to control the people they are building
[3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:52.400]  more and more of these all over the whole world and in australia it's in this legislation it says
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:34:58.880]  that the chief health officer may order detention if they suspect someone has a notifiable condition
[3:34:59.520 --> 3:35:03.120]  they're expected to counsel that person on how they're affecting
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:07.920]  their community by potentially spreading this notifiable condition that they don't even have
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:14.000]  proof that that person has but they don't have to if it's an emergency they don't even have to
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:18.720]  counsel that person or try and educate them and it's interesting that they use the word council
[3:35:19.680 --> 3:35:27.200]  because this is very reminiscent of 1984 and the reeducation camps they want to
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:32.640]  reeducate you about what public health means and reeducate you about how you're putting
[3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:40.080]  the community at risk by spreading i don't know a cough it's unbelievable it is unbelievable
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:44.480]  and the reason why they're doing this now and writing this into legislation is because they
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:49.920]  were so successful over the past two years in fooling the public and my hope and my prayer
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:55.040]  is that throughout this broadcast people will realize that we can never ever ever let them
[3:35:55.040 --> 3:36:01.120]  fool us like that again and they will try mark my words play this back in a few years time and you
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:06.640]  will see that they will try this again unless we get a mass awakening happening but it is happening
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:13.600]  more and more now it says that these these chief health officers or authorized officers can apply
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:19.920]  for certain orders such as an initial examination order a behavioral order or a detention order
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:24.560]  there's different types of orders but essentially they can force you into a medical examination
[3:36:25.200 --> 3:36:32.160]  they can force you into a behavioral assessment which obviously includes someone who doesn't believe
[3:36:32.160 --> 3:36:39.040]  that this is a notifiable condition or that this is a real pandemic you know they allowed protests
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:44.400]  well they didn't even allow them actually during the time of of covid if you were protesting
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:50.800]  against vaccines we had one of the largest protests i think in australian history that was
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:58.560]  not allowed over 150 000 people turned up in sydney in july of 2020 to a protest that was not allowed
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:04.560]  by the government to protest what was happening to us and you know if the people just resisted more
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:11.280]  back then if they didn't get scared by the heavy handedness of the police they actually came back
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:17.520]  and said that they were using surveillance technology to look through and analyze mainstream
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:22.640]  media footage to then go and send fines to people that were at that protest but if people stood up
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:28.240]  against it and kept going you know how many more times can they repeat the same tactics
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:34.640]  we can't be afraid of standing up to tyranny we just can't there has to be no fear in the fight
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:42.160]  for freedom uh so these these people can approve orders without the person being present so it
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:46.560]  also makes reference to people that run away when they know that this is happening uh the
[3:37:46.560 --> 3:37:51.040]  fact that they can go and they can get a warrant to apprehend them at wherever they think that
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:37:56.400]  that person may be a warrant to break into the home of wherever they think that person might be
[3:37:56.400 --> 3:38:03.840]  residing it's it's absolute insanity and we know that for example israel was using their
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:11.760]  intelligence uh database or systems to monitor people during covert without their knowledge
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:17.040]  or consent so it's not very hard for them to track people down considering all of the technology
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:22.800]  that we have in place throughout the document it repeatedly states that any authorized person
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:29.760]  can use whatever force is necessary to achieve the submission of the person it uses the word
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:37.040]  submission whatever force is necessary to get the person to submit this is written in the
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:43.680]  legislation i want people to understand the insanity of this we have this in our law it's
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:49.680]  unbelievable and it makes regular references to the person with the notifiable condition
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:55.280]  and their behavior putting others at risk for example not getting vaccinated
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:01.680]  and again we know that more vaccines are coming this is the biggest money maker
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:08.320]  and depopulation tool that these people have visas putting up the cost after they've added
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:14.960]  the covert 19 injections to the child immunization record visas shot up their profits and the cost of
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:21.600]  their injections because i don't know making money off killing kids is apparently fine these days
[3:39:21.600 --> 3:39:27.200]  and the mainstream media will support that and these people are disgusting and they will pay
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:33.760]  for what they've done to humanity whether it's on this side of heaven uh or where they're going
[3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:39.840]  which is hell it then goes on to discuss how they must explain the details of the medical treatment
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:48.240]  to the person uh to give them an opportunity to submit give them the opportunity to submit
[3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:59.040]  before they use whatever force is necessary guys i'm not kidding this is in australian law
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:04.080]  and it's coming to you if you don't fight back against this it almost also makes reference to
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:11.840]  what they call reckless spread of a notifiable condition and in this section it actually says
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:19.040]  that those who recklessly spread by not getting vaccinated aren't committing an offense under
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:26.800]  this particular section in this legislation but they are subject to criminal code section 317
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:34.400]  which actually says that these people can be imprisoned for life so they've made sure to
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:39.840]  write that special note there into this section so i want to i want to spend a bit of time breaking
[3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:45.680]  this down they've purposely written here that reckless spread they've alluded to the fact
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:51.520]  that this does uh the reckless spread is attributed to those who have refused to get vaccinated
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:59.760]  right keeping mind we're done with COVID-19 now yeah biden says the pandemic's over
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:04.640]  australian mainstream keeps telling us that we have to move on from this and dominic perate the
[3:41:04.640 --> 3:41:08.560]  premier of new south wales is talking about how we need to start focusing on smart cities now
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:18.160]  unbelievable shifting our focus meanwhile the smart cities choose seek to control every
[3:41:18.160 --> 3:41:25.760]  single aspect of our lives but this is actually talking about reckless spread making reference
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:30.560]  to people that have not been vaccinated and it says they're not committing a crime
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:37.280]  under this part of the legislation but those who contribute to reckless spread of diseases
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:45.280]  are referenced under the criminal code which does allow for imprisonment for life for anyone
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:52.960]  who's been accused and proven of spreading a a notifiable condition or a transmittable disease
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:42:02.240]  or a dangerous disease which we know they told us COVID was deadly they told us that it was easily
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:07.840]  transmitted from person to person i don't know about you but i attended protests in the middle
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:13.520]  of lockdowns i hugged and kissed people i'm not saying that people weren't getting sick
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:18.640]  but the transmission that they told us was a lie and it was a lie telling us that these
[3:42:18.640 --> 3:42:23.280]  so-called vaccines stopped that transmission so what makes us think they won't lie to us again
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:29.920]  the considering that it was so effective last time in controlling the people and this type of
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:36.720]  information is literally crucial to your very existence this information if this was in the
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:44.240]  mainstream this would be over tomorrow the globalist control would be over tomorrow but these people
[3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:50.480]  will never tell you the truth because the mainstream media is complicit in this genocide against
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:55.600]  humanity it is absolutely crucial to get this out share this everywhere i'll see you in a moment
[3:42:56.320 --> 3:43:01.120]  i am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:09.520]  i am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:15.360]  with silencing us they know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed it's
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:21.120]  came over and all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:26.880]  and our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech that's why when you

[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:18.320]  you know in that ad alex just said the threat of the globalists and i really want to recap
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:25.920]  what that threat is these people will kill adults and children without blinking an eyelid they did
[3:47:25.920 --> 3:47:30.640]  it through lies they did it through propaganda they did it through fear and they will do it again
[3:47:30.640 --> 3:47:36.160]  and i want to reiterate that everything that i've shared with you today about these insane
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:44.320]  australian laws is coming for the whole world the plan is the same for everyone look how they
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:50.160]  operated in lockstep last time and some people would think that some of that was chaotic it wasn't
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:56.480]  chaotic it was chaotic on purpose they wanted to make it look like they needed a uniform approach
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:01.680]  next time because the fact that we didn't handle covid well enough was because too many countries
[3:48:01.680 --> 3:48:06.480]  did different things the world health organization is meeting in secret this week to talk about
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:13.200]  amendments to the international health regulations thanks for that joe biden these people are going
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:18.160]  to implement this worldwide and while they're doing their plans through the world health organization
[3:48:19.280 --> 3:48:24.880]  treaty or international health regulations amendments they are planning on superseding
[3:48:24.880 --> 3:48:28.960]  your country's constitution and the very laws that we've discussed here today when i'll recap
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:34.800]  really quickly forced injections taking the breaking into people's homes without a warrant
[3:48:34.800 --> 3:48:41.600]  seizing people taking them to camps that they are building all over the world and forcibly
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:48.240]  injecting them refusing them the right u n members interrogating citizens in quarantine camps
[3:48:49.280 --> 3:48:56.800]  and counseling them aka re-educating them about public health so that they can jab
[3:48:56.800 --> 3:49:03.040]  500 new vaccines into everyone in the world and it says no one left behind that means
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:11.360]  they want to jab you all specifically talking about how those who display dangerous behavior
[3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:16.880]  in not getting vaccinated are referred to in the criminal code that seeks to imprison them
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:23.120]  for life do we understand the danger of what is coming our way if we don't put a stop to these
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:31.280]  people i'm not understating this this is not an exaggeration it is written into law and everyone
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:35.600]  needs to know about this the whole world needs to know about this so i'm asking whoever is watching
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:40.240]  this broadcast when it's posted separately as the fourth hour or send the whole show the whole
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:46.800]  show is important everything that info wars tells you is important but specifically this segment
[3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:51.840]  share it everywhere replay it if you've missed the start we're talking about the public health
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:57.520]  act of 2005 in australia that covers all states they've just amended it as of the 7th of september
[3:49:57.520 --> 3:50:04.160]  2022 it's over 400 pages long i will be releasing a more detailed report on zmedia.com this week
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:10.960]  and it will be uploaded on to zmedia on bandot video please share this everywhere it is so crucial
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:17.280]  for people to know what these maniacs plan on doing i cannot believe that we are at the point
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:24.240]  where they are writing this into law it is outrageous and i mean that there are no words
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:30.720]  there are no words that these people want you dead and they just just look at what they've done to
[3:50:30.720 --> 3:50:39.040]  alex jones through this ridiculous trial this is an effort to silence free speech but it's it's an
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:46.640]  example it's an example through the current methods that they have which is you know phony cases in
[3:50:46.640 --> 3:50:54.880]  court meanwhile they're writing into legislation that they can take you by force and forcibly
[3:50:54.880 --> 3:51:02.720]  inject you in these places because you are a threat to so-called public health and meanwhile
[3:51:02.720 --> 3:51:07.040]  while they're doing all of this they're also talking about liquefying human corpses in different
[3:51:07.040 --> 3:51:12.800]  places we've got an example from washington state which legalized flesh goo essentially
[3:51:15.040 --> 3:51:21.760]  it was done it's a mechanism for liquefying human corpses known as alkaline hydrolysis many
[3:51:21.760 --> 3:51:29.680]  of you would have heard of this it went into effect i believe on may 1st 2020 the law is rcw
[3:51:29.680 --> 3:51:37.040]  68.50.110 and the passage refers to alkaline hydrolysis as the new legal means to dispose of
[3:51:37.040 --> 3:51:45.680]  human corpses washington state has developed this method to dispose of large masses of human bodies
[3:51:45.680 --> 3:51:52.400]  without having to dig mass graves or run incinerators which would be detectable by drones
[3:51:53.440 --> 3:51:59.680]  but i'm not i'm not it's not just washington state that's done this in the state of queensland
[3:51:59.680 --> 3:52:06.400]  with sunday funerals in mackay has applied to build the gentle way cremator the gentle way
[3:52:06.960 --> 3:52:11.840]  listen to how they word this it's unbelievable and what they're saying is that after an application
[3:52:11.840 --> 3:52:17.920]  to build a traditional crematorium was rejected a queensland undertaker has lodged a new zero
[3:52:17.920 --> 3:52:22.800]  emissions plan to dissolve the departed zero emissions of course because this is good for
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:29.360]  climate change which is the new religion that they have introduced into the world for the good of
[3:52:29.360 --> 3:52:34.000]  mother earth or whatever the heck these people say they're talking about this being environmentally
[3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:41.760]  friendly and and any waste or emissions could operate in the back room of it's sorry this new
[3:52:41.760 --> 3:52:47.040]  technology does not result in any waste or emissions so again really hammering home that this is good
[3:52:47.040 --> 3:52:55.040]  for the climate if they do this this is going to stop you know emissions of of cremating bodies so
[3:52:55.040 --> 3:52:59.440]  let's just liquefy the human corpses but why are they doing this we'll go into that in a minute
[3:52:59.440 --> 3:53:04.080]  it says that the there's actually a photo on that article if the team can bring up the second photo
[3:53:04.080 --> 3:53:09.840]  that i sent through it is so dystopian it is it is unbelievable what these facilities look like
[3:53:11.280 --> 3:53:16.400]  i mean i look at it and i'm terrified hopefully we get that photo up very soon there it is for
[3:53:16.400 --> 3:53:23.200]  everyone to see the new environmentally friendly way to liquefy human corpses coming to the state
[3:53:23.200 --> 3:53:28.160]  of queensland of course the state of queensland first and foremost because that's how they slip
[3:53:28.160 --> 3:53:33.680]  everything else through california govern govern new governor gavin knew some science law allowing
[3:53:33.680 --> 3:53:40.400]  human bodies to be turned into garden soil that article was posted on the 20th of september
[3:53:41.440 --> 3:53:48.160]  i believe the legislation is ab 351 which permits residents to select to have their remains
[3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:56.320]  composted after they die this is enabled by the year 2027 again it's that key year of 2027 the
[3:53:56.320 --> 3:54:01.040]  australian pandemic preparedness plan says that we need to put these systems and measures in place
[3:54:01.040 --> 3:54:06.400]  by 2027 which by the way include collecting samples from human beings so probably your dna
[3:54:07.360 --> 3:54:15.520]  regular monitoring and testing so preemptively testing no doubt using a faulty pcr that will
[3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:20.640]  produce the result of whatever so-called disease they're going to come up with
[3:54:20.640 --> 3:54:26.480]  it they'll just do what they did with covered last time they'll you know the the the pcr they'll run
[3:54:26.480 --> 3:54:31.040]  it at a higher cycle and what it's supposed to be run out and it'll detect whatever they want to
[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:35.360]  be detected and they will create a new public health emergency the same way that they did last
[3:54:35.360 --> 3:54:41.040]  time and of course you know we really need to talk about what's sort of a precedent this sort of
[3:54:41.040 --> 3:54:48.160]  stuff sets when you put this these things into legislation allowing human bodies to be turned
[3:54:48.160 --> 3:54:53.520]  into garden soil for the sake of climate change i mean i'm disgusted by this i'm sure that anyone
[3:54:53.520 --> 3:55:00.880]  watching is disgusted by this but it's it's the same thing as you know bake the cake just bake
[3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:07.200]  the cake and and everything will be okay don't stand up for your beliefs don't stand up for your
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:13.520]  religious freedom to say no actually that violates my conscience i'm not okay with this please go see
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:17.760]  someone else i'm sure there's someone out there who would be willing to bake the cake for you i'm
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:22.400]  sure that people watching know what i'm talking about but a few years ago if in case you don't
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:27.600]  there was a couple that asked a bakery to make them a cake they were same-sex couple getting
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:33.120]  married and and the bakery didn't want to do it and rightfully so because if it violates your
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:38.160]  conscience you should have the right to say i'm so sorry this is a violation of my conscience
[3:55:38.160 --> 3:55:44.240]  and my religion i can't do this for you but just go see tom down the road he'll do it for you but no
[3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:50.880]  no we want to sue these people or try to sue these people into oblivion because you don't agree with
[3:55:50.880 --> 3:55:56.640]  me and you're violating my gay rights or whatever it's it and and there's a double standard all
[3:55:56.640 --> 3:56:01.360]  the time with these people but what i'm what i'm trying to establish here is this bake the cake
[3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:08.320]  precedent where we're we're introducing these things as new ideas we're saying that this is okay
[3:56:08.320 --> 3:56:15.520]  now to to sign laws allowing humans to be turned into into compost and flesh goo
[3:56:17.760 --> 3:56:24.960]  and the normalization of this what does it lead to later does it lead to the dissidents that have
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:29.680]  gone into these facilities when they don't want to comply with all the laws that i just told you
[3:56:29.680 --> 3:56:36.720]  about today does it set the precedent for them to be turned into flesh goo and them to be composted
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:42.560]  to help climate change oh we don't need these people our facilities are overrun we've spent
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:47.680]  all this money on these quarantine facilities and these damn dissenters don't want to comply
[3:56:48.720 --> 3:56:53.440]  they're going to be in prison for life anyway let's just liquefy them i mean it sounds crazy
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:56.960]  it sounds crazy but need i remind you of soylent green
[3:57:00.080 --> 3:57:05.840]  soylent green which by 2022 if you read the plot there's by the cumulative effects of over
[3:57:05.840 --> 3:57:11.920]  population pollution and an apparent climate catastrophe of course severe worldwide shortages
[3:57:11.920 --> 3:57:20.160]  of food water and housing so are we setting the precedent for the implementation of
[3:57:20.960 --> 3:57:26.480]  what we were shown in soylent green in their propaganda by the year 2027 because they keep
[3:57:26.480 --> 3:57:32.400]  talking about this year and we know that this part of the agenda ends in 2030 it's been an
