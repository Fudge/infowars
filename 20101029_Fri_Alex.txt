[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.040]  it is Friday the 29th day of October 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next
[00:31.040 --> 00:35.440]  three hours as we are every weekday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central many days we go
[00:35.440 --> 00:39.360]  over into the fourth hour then of course I return live this Sunday for the
[00:39.360 --> 00:46.040]  abbreviated transmission 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time obviously they've
[00:46.040 --> 00:50.640]  got all of the suspicious package bomb threat hysteria going ahead of the
[00:50.640 --> 00:57.520]  election right now with the two UPS planes stopped on the East Coast in New
[00:57.520 --> 01:03.120]  York New Jersey and of course in Philadelphia they're also tracking down
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.880]  UPS vehicles in Queens New York and it all started in England they admit dealing
[01:09.880 --> 01:18.360]  with a suspicious box from Yemen with a printer ink cartridge in it very scary
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.680]  but if we give up all of our rights and give all of our tax money to foreign
[01:23.680 --> 01:30.760]  banks they will protect us remember that when our grandchildren ask why we live
[01:30.760 --> 01:35.240]  in such a police state you tell them honey it's because you know the government
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.840]  wanted to protect us from evil men with turbines on their heads the government
[01:38.840 --> 01:42.560]  wasn't involved in any of the terror the government hated the takeover and all
[01:42.560 --> 01:46.680]  the trillions they were able to steal they just did it to protect us okay and
[01:46.680 --> 01:50.320]  the bankers took your pension funds they're getting ready to take your
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.840]  pension funds to keep you safe to keep you safe from financial collapse as well
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.640]  there and then and they're trying to put carbon taxes on California and other
[01:59.640 --> 02:04.760]  states to keep us safe from the oceans rising and killing us it's all real
[02:04.760 --> 02:13.720]  global warming al-Qaeda terrorism the headless horsemen the Easter Bunny it's
[02:13.720 --> 02:21.520]  all real Santa Claus is real Santa Claus is real he keeps you safe from al-Qaeda
[02:21.520 --> 02:25.400]  all right I'm gonna get serious here we'll break down this ridiculous
[02:25.400 --> 02:29.440]  propaganda fear-mongering who knows that they may even you know produce some
[02:29.440 --> 02:32.600]  fake bombs or something for everybody to remind you of how much they care about
[02:32.600 --> 02:38.040]  you and I want to recap that last Christmas's attack was staged by the
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.600]  government but Talib was currently drugged out of his gourd drooling and
[02:42.600 --> 02:48.080]  disheveled let on the plane by US intelligence personnel state department
[02:48.080 --> 02:51.120]  admits they were ordered to help get him on the plane and then his underwear
[02:51.120 --> 02:56.280]  popped was a I guess some type of black cat firecracker in his underwear and his
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.120]  knickers so again got to give all your rights up because in America we give our
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.880]  rights up when anybody attacks us and in every case the government's holding the
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.080]  terrorist hand right to dummy it's like and more all a locky fox news two weeks
[03:11.080 --> 03:16.720]  ago yeah he dined at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 he's on the news is

[03:20.120 --> 03:25.160]  the Pentagon but hey that's no big deal okay we got to give our rights up or a
[03:25.160 --> 03:33.360]  locky is gonna get us he's scary looking he wears a hood he's got a little
[03:33.360 --> 03:41.200]  mustache and beard he doesn't look like us he's scary all right all right I said
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.000]  I'd stop the satire I I just can't handle it anymore ladies and gentlemen if
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.040]  you want to know who the terrorist are the people that run our government you
[03:50.040 --> 03:53.440]  want to know who finances most the radical Muslims the occasional real
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.600]  nutball they can get to attack us the government I mean what came out in AP
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.960]  and Reuters this week oh is FBI staging terror they go out and find mentally
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.480]  deranged people and their al-Qaeda contact is the FBI is the CIA ordering

[04:12.520 --> 04:19.480]  out and they create them and they find drug doubt lunatic nut cases listen
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.320]  folks anybody I could spend a month and go out and find schizophrenic homeless
[04:23.320 --> 04:28.000]  people hypothetically I'd never do this but you could go out spend a month give
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.920]  a few thousand dollars to schizophrenic homeless people and I can assure you you
[04:32.920 --> 04:37.120]  that you without even knowing psychological tactics could get them to
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.520]  bring in some firecrackers into a police station and set them on fire and
[04:41.520 --> 04:48.800]  then it'd be now would I be guilty if I got a homeless person to go do that yes
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.680]  well is the government guilty you bet they are look it's all coming up the

[08:26.640 --> 08:30.280]  want to thank some of those affiliates in the last two months we've been
[08:30.280 --> 08:35.080]  carried in Dallas the sixth largest market in the country on Sundays they

[09:22.640 --> 09:28.040]  starting next Monday and that is official done deal very excited about
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.320]  that because look a lot of stations in the past have said look Alex Jones is a
[09:34.320 --> 09:40.240]  9-11 truther and we like his positions on the Bill of Rights Constitution
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.200]  libertarian ideas we know he's a popular talk show host we know he gets good
[09:44.200 --> 09:50.240]  ratings we know that but we don't like 9-11 truth well now the stations are
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.040]  calling up saying look it's on Fox News that the number one head of Al Qaeda
[09:55.040 --> 10:00.960]  number three on 9-11 was at the Pentagon meeting with brass two months after
[10:00.960 --> 10:04.800]  when there was an arrest warrant out for him and it's come out Operation North
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.760]  Woods the plan to state stage 9-11 and the Gulf of Tonkin's been declassified
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.160]  and all these videos have been released of bombs going off in the towers and the
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.840]  FBI director saying it and you know I I guess he's right I guess he isn't as
[10:16.840 --> 10:22.040]  radical as we first thought this information is unstoppable I just tell
[10:22.040 --> 10:29.400]  the truth okay period period and and it's very simple and you know now Michael
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.560]  Savage every week talks about Obama planning clearly to hype up terror and
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.160]  stage terror attacks in the US a lot of other mainstream hosts are talking about
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.040]  it and so government-sponsored terrorism inside job is now an issue that has
[10:43.040 --> 10:49.080]  become very very mainstream Oklahoma City clear inside job and presidents
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.760]  come and go but these staged events they continue and and and so many other
[10:54.760 --> 10:59.040]  things have come out concerning government-sponsored terror I mean it's
[10:59.040 --> 11:05.720]  Associated Press it's the Detroit Free Press it is mainstream news two months
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.600]  after we told you last year in December the Christmas Day underwear bombing
[11:10.600 --> 11:16.800]  that Mutalib was led on the plane by an agent of the US government that he was
[11:16.800 --> 11:20.080]  protected that the State Department was ordered to help get him on the plane
[11:20.080 --> 11:23.640]  that's the undersecretary of the State Department Mr. Kennedy the head of
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.040]  visas globally he got under heat saying why did he how did he get on without all
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.840]  this stuff without a passport how did the US you know help get him a visa then
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.000]  he didn't even have it that day but they still helped him get on and he said
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.840]  look I was ordered to do this by an unnamed US intelligence agency two months
[11:41.840 --> 11:45.040]  before that was in the news who do we have on the show
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.840]  Kurt Haskell the lawyer his wife saw the same thing on the plane from Europe
[11:50.840 --> 11:54.760]  from Amsterdam to Detroit the FBI came to his office and told him you're wrong
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.000]  shut up basically he said I'm not gonna shut up and then other witnesses on the
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.800]  plane went public okay and then it came out that it was all true why would Kurt
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.120]  Haskell and the other witnesses lie okay it's on record and they were on the
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.120]  airplane videotaping Mutalib somebody a sharp-dressed guy through the entire
[12:16.120 --> 12:28.960]  12-14 hour flight and all of this is coming out all of this look and war all a
[12:28.960 --> 12:36.880]  lucky the CIA lackey who on record was in command of the Fort Hood shooter in
[12:36.880 --> 12:45.280]  command of the Christmas Day dud bomber a few months ago the Times Square event
[12:45.280 --> 12:54.680]  this is the guy this is the guy who is in charge of all of this stuff and we
[12:54.680 --> 13:03.600]  know with Major Hassan at Fort Hood for two years he was sending emails to Anwar
[13:03.600 --> 13:13.120]  all a lucky reportedly getting orders from him on what he was supposed to do
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.320]  and it even came out in mainstream news you can pull this up we covered at the
[13:17.320 --> 13:23.960]  time when they had the Fort Hood shooting that this is so important that
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.400]  the Pentagon and the CIA knew all about it and didn't warn Fort Hood didn't warn
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.680]  the other bases that the psychiatrist Major Hassan was at and that they allowed
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.680]  it to happen and they were having a drill that day of a mass shooting and
[13:38.680 --> 13:45.120]  another drill the day before and at the time witnesses at Fort Hood said they
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.240]  took our cell phones and they made us erase the video of the shooting and
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.080]  there were reports of multiple shooters so we don't even know what really happened
[13:53.080 --> 13:59.040]  there now it's come out in court two weeks ago that indeed they've been ordered
[13:59.040 --> 14:05.760]  to erase the cell phone footage exactly what we heard at the time now this guy
[14:05.760 --> 14:09.240]  Anwar all a lucky it's why I spent so much time on it last week and then these
[14:09.240 --> 14:12.960]  are facts that this doesn't go away just because some people want it to or
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.200]  because it's scary I'm sorry it's the truth that Anwar all a lucky two months
[14:18.200 --> 14:23.520]  after 9-11 was at the Pentagon in a secret meeting with the entire top brass
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.600]  including the Secretary of the Army this is two months after he's all over the
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.440]  news as the number three in Al Qaeda they now say he's the number one in Al
[14:33.440 --> 14:40.720]  Qaeda who's the number three now Adam Gadahn the admitted grandson of the
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.480]  former head of the ADL who got arrested beating up Arabs outside mosque 12 years
[14:46.480 --> 14:53.880]  ago then he's Jewish he becomes the American spokesman for Al Qaeda with a
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.040]  turban and a beard popping up every time a president you know says Al Qaeda is
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.960]  about to get us and then he pops up and says yes we are right on time and then
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.640]  of course Wired Magazine and others at major digital conferences looked at the
[15:08.640 --> 15:12.640]  videos of these Al Qaeda leaders being uploaded to the web and found that the
[15:12.640 --> 15:17.800]  Intel Center run by former directors of black ops and the CIA and the Pentagon
[15:17.800 --> 15:23.520]  adjuncts of Donald Rumsfeld that the Intel Center uploaded their logo over
[15:23.520 --> 15:30.480]  it with in the same video layer as the Al Qaeda logo you understand that you know
[15:30.480 --> 15:34.480]  we're not video geniuses but we understand video layers here I'd even
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.560]  done that before it was news and blown it up on our big screen plasma screens
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.200]  back there and looked at the video layers and you can tell the pixelation
[15:43.200 --> 15:48.080]  was the same in the layer when you blow it up we'd already talked about that I
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.760]  mean I'm not a rocket scientist but I knew that fat bin Laden whose nose had
[15:52.760 --> 15:57.640]  grown by an inch sitting around supposedly getting drunk with young boys
[15:57.640 --> 16:03.400]  remember that footage nine years ago right after 9-11 a few months after I
[16:03.400 --> 16:09.000]  could look at it and tell you it wasn't bin Laden the CIA told spy talk five
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.960]  months ago in the Washington Post that yes the government put out that fake
[16:13.960 --> 16:19.240]  video well I don't need them to tell me it's fake I mean it'd be literally like
[16:19.240 --> 16:23.160]  sticking a beard on me and and putting a fake nose on me and saying it was
[16:23.160 --> 16:27.840]  bin Laden it looked nothing liking then they put out a computer generated bin
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.960]  Laden video that looked like something from a cheap video game that's how dumb
[16:31.960 --> 16:38.600]  they think you are and don't forget I told you in 2004 2005 2006 that they
[16:38.600 --> 16:42.960]  were issuing fake terror alerts for political gain then Ari Fleischer the
[16:42.960 --> 16:46.200]  the White House spokesman got up in the press conference and said these have
[16:46.200 --> 16:49.640]  been issued for political gain I guess to protect himself he didn't want to be
[16:49.640 --> 16:53.800]  part of it and then Ridge writes a book that's published last year the former
[16:53.800 --> 16:57.440]  head of Homeland Security saying he was pressured to issue fake terror alerts
[16:57.440 --> 17:01.680]  ahead of elections look we're only covering the facts here I mean do you
[17:01.680 --> 17:05.160]  want me to not tell you that and more all the lockies at the Pentagon do you not
[17:05.160 --> 17:08.920]  want me to open up Newsweek right after 9-11 when they admittedly said the
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.760]  hijackers were trained at US military bases AP Washington Post they just hide
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.800]  it in plain view or that six of the 10 9-11 commissioners say they were lied
[17:17.800 --> 17:23.680]  to and they weren't allowed to truly investigate I mean facts are facts are
[17:23.680 --> 17:29.880]  facts are facts period end of story that's the way it is it doesn't change
[17:29.880 --> 17:35.640]  because we want them to I wish every day it was Muslim extremist I wish every
[17:35.640 --> 17:40.880]  day because that's not scary I'm not scared of a few hundred lunatics running
[17:40.880 --> 17:43.920]  around with turbines on their heads but I'll tell you what I am scared of a
[17:43.920 --> 17:47.800]  globalist corporate takeover that wants to set up a police state for the
[17:47.800 --> 17:51.720]  American people staging events and allowing lunatics to attack us as a
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.240]  pretext to take our rights and as I told you nine years ago and as I put my
[17:56.240 --> 18:03.760]  police state films 12 13 years ago and as is on record now 95% or more of all
[18:03.760 --> 18:08.640]  of the Homeland Security apparatus this is New York Times Washington Post but
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.000]  we got the secret documents last year my I can homeland security from law
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.520]  enforcement confirmed to be real 95% the number one threat returning veterans
[18:17.520 --> 18:24.280]  with guns conservatives libertarians land rights activists anti-global warming
[18:24.280 --> 18:30.160]  activists Ron Paul supporters Bob Barr supporters libertarian supporters Chuck
[18:30.160 --> 18:35.520]  Baldwin supporters people that like Aaron Russo's film exposing the IRS
[18:35.520 --> 18:42.800]  American freedom to fascism that's who they say the number one enemy is and all
[18:42.800 --> 18:46.440]  these new Southern Poverty Law Center ADL reports who do they say the number one
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.040]  evil Alex Jones I'm not gonna hurt a fly I'm not gonna blow anything up I'm
[18:52.040 --> 18:55.760]  fighting against violence I want to through our Constitution take our
[18:55.760 --> 18:59.320]  government back the way we're supposed to legally and lawfully and
[18:59.320 --> 19:04.600]  constitutionally but they want to stage events and terror events to demonize
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.400]  the American people and shut down the true political process in this country
[19:08.400 --> 19:12.200]  and we've got to get out ahead of these stage terror events because those are
[19:12.200 --> 19:15.920]  you Republicans that won't wake up to 9-11 you better wake up with Barry
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.120]  Sataro aka Barack Obama's people set something off we've read all the quotes
[19:21.120 --> 19:24.200]  by his people in his White House the Financial Times of London and others
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.440]  saying without an Oklahoma City or a new 9-11 Barack Obama won't be able to
[19:28.440 --> 19:32.080]  look strong for the public and Oklahoma City saved Bill Clinton when he was in
[19:32.080 --> 19:35.720]  the low 40s went to the high 60s right before the election with the Oklahoma
[19:35.720 --> 19:39.820]  City bombing that saved Bill Clinton we need another terror attack they're so
[19:39.820 --> 19:43.640]  dumb they're right out in the open bragging about it but I'll read it and
[19:43.640 --> 19:48.960]  we come back I'll briefly get into the latest fear mongering hysteria dealing

[24:19.440 --> 24:24.480]  the break then into the economy today there's huge developments there here's
[24:24.480 --> 24:28.840]  the Christian Science Monitor is hard currency on its way out introducing the
[24:28.840 --> 24:33.440]  new virtual world currency you're not going to get a new global paper currency
[24:33.440 --> 24:38.560]  your currencies will be denominated by the new global digital SDR you will
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.360]  face scan and thumbprint globally part of it will go to an international VAT
[24:43.360 --> 24:49.800]  tax and a carbon tax it's all been announced in 1975 by the Trilateral
[24:49.800 --> 24:53.600]  Commission exactly how all this would happen that's how you can listen to my
[24:53.600 --> 24:58.080]  show from 15 years ago and hear the same thing you can watch my films from 13
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.160]  years ago and hear the exact same thing or the show from a year ago or a month
[25:02.160 --> 25:07.000]  ago but I told you now is the time they're going to announce this did I
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.800]  pull a rabbit out of a hat am I am I'm not an incredible person you know I
[25:10.800 --> 25:16.440]  didn't have a crystal ball I read their own documents and I've seen them do
[25:16.440 --> 25:19.400]  everything they say they're going to do or at least try it so we're gonna be
[25:19.400 --> 25:26.040]  covering that but about an hour and a half ago the fair mongering began I get
[25:26.040 --> 25:29.480]  ready at home I was driving into the office and was listening to MSNBC on
[25:29.480 --> 25:37.040]  XM serious and they were going oh my gosh there could be multiple bombs out of
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.960]  the Middle East on multiple aircraft there are two aircraft one in Newark
[25:41.960 --> 25:47.720]  New Jersey and another in Philadelphia and oh my gosh the government's saving
[25:47.720 --> 25:52.120]  us and there's another courthouse up in Maine where there might be a bomb and
[25:52.120 --> 25:59.080]  there's a UPS truck in Queens New York and the FBI's on it could it be a big
[25:59.080 --> 26:06.000]  attack oh my gosh bombs bombs and within 30 minutes drop driving in they had
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.400]  shifted it and said well this is a over response out of you know a caution but
[26:12.400 --> 26:18.160]  it's a good thing to do this and now we know it was England and there was a
[26:18.160 --> 26:23.680]  shipment out of Yemen of a printer cartridge and the printer cartridge
[26:23.680 --> 26:30.000]  looked very suspicious and so basically any shipments now out of that airport
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.680]  we're gonna have to search them and the terrorists you know we've got the naked
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.480]  body scanners to keep you safe from mutalib and the underwear bomber they
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.040]  actually said that and but we've got to put more security on the packages and
[26:42.040 --> 26:45.360]  we've got to do something about private aviation people are able to just go get
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.960]  on their own planes and oh my gosh what are we gonna do it's going into the
[26:49.960 --> 26:55.000]  holiday season and Al Qaeda loves to ruin our our holidays they they love to do
[26:55.000 --> 27:03.280]  this and on and on and on so two UPS planes isolated it Philly and in
[27:03.280 --> 27:07.600]  Newark and it it goes on to say that they are trying to keep us safe and
[27:07.600 --> 27:10.960]  they've isolated the planes they're going over them cargo planes grounded in
[27:10.960 --> 27:17.240]  US security scare and police around UPS planes and they are looking at UPS
[27:17.240 --> 27:24.520]  trucks in New York State and in Queens and just in Long Island and just just
[27:24.520 --> 27:29.800]  just everywhere it's so scary and now as this unfolds we'll continue to tell you
[27:29.800 --> 27:35.680]  everything that's that's going on oh my gosh and and every day I hear news
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.720]  reports even in Texas where it's always starts around deer season somebody's
[27:39.720 --> 27:42.920]  putting their deer rifle in their car or somebody sees somebody with a deer
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.480]  rifle in their gun rack and it's totally legal but they call the police and we
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.720]  saw a man with a rifle we saw a man getting in his car heard that yesterday
[27:51.720 --> 27:56.320]  on local news it's so scary we've got an alert the police are on the ground they
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.640]  may lock down areas of college station somebody was seen with a rifle oh my
[28:01.640 --> 28:09.120]  goodness it's this it's this culture of total and complete hysteria but then
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.440]  the flu vaccine last year conservatively maimed and and brain damaged tens of
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.360]  thousands in the US admittedly caused deaths in the US Europe Australia
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.120]  mainstream news people died and it's like oh well that's just a side effect
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.840]  sometimes it's worth it overall to protect you from the flu that's so deadly
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.000]  and then they admit oh by the way the H1N1 shot was filled with all sorts of
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.200]  things that cause serious health problems oh and then meanwhile remember
[28:37.200 --> 28:42.760]  two years ago it finally hit the news that FedEx and others were shipping
[28:42.760 --> 28:49.280]  weaponized flu and other things to thousands of labs five thousand plus
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.800]  labs in the US had a super weaponized flu and we found out about it when a
[28:53.800 --> 29:00.000]  truck a FedEx truck crashed and this stuff was all over the highway oh remember
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.000]  early last year it was in BBC it was in LaFigaro it was in Der Spiegel it first
[29:06.000 --> 29:14.840]  broke in the Czech Republic 14 labs had super weaponized flu sent to them and
[29:14.840 --> 29:21.280]  one technician happened to test it on ferrets and it killed them and Baxter
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.360]  pharmaceutical said it was all just an accident but then we have the headline
[29:25.360 --> 29:30.440]  where in Poland and other countries large portions of the homeless population
[29:30.440 --> 29:33.440]  died when they were given another experimental flu shot you just type
[29:33.440 --> 29:37.880]  homeless die after flu shot but that's okay that's you know that's no big deal
[29:37.880 --> 29:42.440]  but a package it could be a bomb bombs are so scary
[29:42.440 --> 29:48.560]  all right we're gonna get into the election the economy and a lot more
[29:48.560 --> 29:55.440]  straight ahead we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the

[31:20.280 --> 31:24.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and

[31:28.920 --> 31:33.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[33:33.680 --> 33:38.840]  having our rights violated and in every case they do it for the drug war and
[33:38.840 --> 33:42.680]  it's on record that the government ships in the majority of the drugs they've
[33:42.680 --> 33:46.680]  been caught over and over again they create the crisis they make the drugs
[33:46.680 --> 33:51.040]  illegal jacking up the price they offer the solution total police state they
[33:51.040 --> 33:56.080]  provocateur or stage the terror attacks they offer the solution total into the
[33:56.080 --> 34:01.560]  bill of rights and Constitution and here's a story out of ABC News they're
[34:01.560 --> 34:07.200]  nudging you oh you won't go through the naked body scanners well they'll just
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.000]  force women to do it because on average women are more compliant and I watch
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.120]  that in California Tuesday morning taking off from San Jose I sat there for
[34:18.120 --> 34:22.560]  15 minutes after I went to the checkpoint watching the naked body
[34:22.560 --> 34:26.840]  scanners and they were only putting women and children through and women with
[34:26.840 --> 34:36.280]  children no men no men they'll also just randomly say today at the ferry we're
[34:36.280 --> 34:42.040]  searching all black cars or all red cars or today we're searching all men or
[34:42.040 --> 34:47.120]  we're searching all RVs so that may have been it too but there they were naked
[34:47.120 --> 34:50.440]  body scanning pounding them with radiation recording their naked bodies
[34:50.440 --> 34:53.160]  the government's now been caught lying about that they admit they record them
[34:53.160 --> 34:59.080]  mobile trucks state courthouses federal courthouses they are putting out the
[34:59.080 --> 35:01.960]  mobile trucks looking through your walls with incredibly high-powered
[35:01.960 --> 35:06.880]  radiation dwarfing even the naked body scanners and the head of the TSA what
[35:06.880 --> 35:11.200]  three months ago told the Chicago Tribune he said in the future in the next
[35:11.200 --> 35:17.560]  few years it will be mandatory you won't be able to opt out for a pat down and now
[35:17.560 --> 35:24.400]  they have secondary checks at the gate after you've already gone through and I
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.880]  I've witnessed it Aaron who flies a lot doing interviews for the films has
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.440]  witnessed it where they make old women and men who cannot stand up who were
[35:33.440 --> 35:39.720]  paralyzed get up and they make other passengers if they're by themselves
[35:39.720 --> 35:44.960]  stand them up and old woman's crying I can't I mean these are people with
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.320]  serious health problems going to get cancer therapy going to visit their
[35:48.320 --> 35:53.960]  family one more time I've seen groups one time in San Francisco flying out to
[35:53.960 --> 35:58.360]  Hawaii I wasn't flying to Hawaii I was flying out of San Francisco back to
[35:58.360 --> 36:03.520]  Texas but they were going to Hawaii and it was a group of World War two vets this
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.880]  was this is about six years ago who were because I talked to them and they all
[36:07.880 --> 36:12.520]  had their hats on and their vest on they were Pearl Harbor battle survivors and
[36:12.520 --> 36:17.000]  you've seen an old man who looks like he's about to die where the eyes start
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.160]  sagging where they droop down you can see the red of the inside of the eyelids
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.080]  and their their eyes are seeping and they've got you know crusty stuff all
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.560]  over their skin and they're on a walker just battling to go with their buddies
[36:29.560 --> 36:35.720]  back one more time and they had weird secondary checks then with some type of
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.280]  security firm a memory service was called Wolverine security and it was
[36:39.280 --> 36:42.880]  kind of bright blue fatigues and it was foreigners who could barely speak
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.280]  English whatever the security group this was it was mainly Asian men and they
[36:47.280 --> 36:52.640]  were literally going hurry up and go get up and and you know these old guys are
[36:52.640 --> 36:56.320]  getting up and there one of them has an oxygen tank and they're all what is that
[36:56.320 --> 37:02.280]  what are you doing and the guy's like he can't even really understand them and
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.480]  this has been written about all over the news that the strip searching women to
[37:06.480 --> 37:09.480]  make them take their shirts off making women drink their own breast milk like
[37:09.480 --> 37:13.600]  what's in that bottle well it's baby breast milk I just pumped it well drink
[37:13.600 --> 37:20.360]  it and then TSA workers flipping out repeatedly and saying I'm God I'm God
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.400]  don't believe me guys just search the term TSA worker says he's God or tea and
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.200]  they just go crazy on the power trip it started announcing I'm God I'm God and
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.960]  started started stripping off naked running around I mean these are the type
[37:33.960 --> 37:41.760]  of lunatics they have this police officer in Austin named Katana and that's
[37:41.760 --> 37:50.600]  his last name in fact I had the article yes I never got to it and Katana turned
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.520]  off a squad car video shot a youth in a car he got sued over at the city's
[37:56.520 --> 38:02.880]  defending the suit then he got a DWI and they still kept him hired they still
[38:02.880 --> 38:12.720]  kept him on and now he got fired because another police officer who's a
[38:12.720 --> 38:18.600]  female says that he came and invaded her house here's the article police chief
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.000]  fires Quintana domestic incident involving another officer leads to
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.040]  firing less than a week after Quintana was reinstated six days after Austin
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.560]  police officer Leonardo Quintana was released and reinstated to the force
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.320]  police chief Art Ace Vado fired him Wednesday for a second time this year
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.480]  saying Quintana trespassed in the home of another officer and assaulted her the
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.440]  seven-page disciplinary memo said the officer with him Quintana had been
[38:43.440 --> 38:48.720]  romantically linked hit her on the hit her head on the wall on the incident
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.040]  breaking the drywall and requiring her to seek medical treatment the officer
[38:53.040 --> 39:00.040]  Lori Norgella said she is identified in the memo only as officer a also told
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.000]  internal affairs investigators of Quintana pinned her against the door to
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.080]  take a ring from her on multiple occasions he reportedly assaulted her I
[39:08.080 --> 39:14.080]  mean you know these are these people are unstable if a cop gets a DWI fired
[39:14.080 --> 39:20.520]  you're at a higher standard if a cop turns his squad car video off and then
[39:20.520 --> 39:25.840]  there's a suspicious shooting gone but but they keep the bad guys in there
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.600]  until their exploits get more and more insane more and more and crazy back you
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.080]  guys actually found the NBC article about the guy saying he was God put that
[39:35.080 --> 39:41.480]  back up on screen for me thank you TSA agent arrested at LAX and it goes on to
[39:41.480 --> 39:47.920]  say he was behaving erratically and saying I'm God I'm in charge I'm God and
[39:47.920 --> 39:50.960]  I guess it was another one he started saying something similar and running
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.040]  around stripping naked that was a different one and then how many times
[39:55.040 --> 39:57.960]  they get a good-looking woman cornered and they're they're doing a pat down of
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.720]  her and they say listen I'm gonna say you got drugs or bombs unless you give
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.400]  me your phone number and become my sex slave at least they get in trouble for
[40:06.400 --> 40:11.840]  that or other TSA workers have to go through the scanners every day because
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.360]  they you know they like to abuse the abusers and they keep making fun of the
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.880]  guys genitals day after day so he punches a supervisor in the nose and the
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.520]  government says he's arrested it doesn't matter we're allowed to make fun of your
[40:23.520 --> 40:28.960]  genitals member almost a year ago in England we we reported how TV stars
[40:28.960 --> 40:33.520]  over there repeatedly the women will print off their genitals and ask them to
[40:33.520 --> 40:36.880]  sign it that was confirmed and the and our government and the British
[40:36.880 --> 40:40.040]  government said this is ridiculous there's no way to even save these or
[40:40.040 --> 40:45.320]  print them turns out in the manuals they look at your genitals to tune the
[40:45.320 --> 40:50.200]  machine they they they look at the genitals for details to see if the
[40:50.200 --> 40:53.680]  machine's tuned to look for weapons so in the training they look at your
[40:53.680 --> 40:57.880]  genitals because that's an area that has different folds and a shape that they
[40:57.880 --> 41:01.160]  can clearly tell if it's focused kind of like if you're a videographer you
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.000]  focus in on some on the cracks of on somebody's eyes their their their
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.800]  crow's feet or you focus in on their pupil and then make sure you can see the
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.480]  different colors in their eye that's how you know you got a true focus before
[41:13.480 --> 41:18.120]  you back the camera out will they look at your genitals and they record it and
[41:18.120 --> 41:23.200]  TSA now admits they record it and at one courthouse in Florida they saved over
[41:23.200 --> 41:29.080]  40,000 images in a few months alone of your children now there was a lawsuit in
[41:29.080 --> 41:33.440]  Denver at the state courthouse over this and they brought in the state and
[41:33.440 --> 41:39.080]  federal law that people under 18 it is child porn and so now at that one
[41:39.080 --> 41:43.640]  facility they don't scan under 18 all right I've got to get into the election
[41:43.640 --> 41:47.120]  news in the economy I'm just illustrating all of this right now how it
[41:47.120 --> 41:53.920]  all ties together and here's ABC news today this is today got links to it up
[41:53.920 --> 41:59.800]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com pat downs or full body scan
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.680]  security gets more personal in airports and they're gonna do enhanced physical
[42:05.680 --> 42:08.800]  searches and I've they already do these sometimes during high security alerts and
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.080]  I've seen it on the news where they actually put their hands on a woman's
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.400]  breast and squeeze in a circle and women described as very painful they put
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.320]  their hand between your legs and squeeze your genitals because there might be a
[42:22.320 --> 42:26.640]  bomb now they're talking about chest x-rays because their al-qaeda may may
[42:26.640 --> 42:33.040]  put fake breast implant bombs in that's AP and Reuters and ABC news in fact don't
[42:33.040 --> 42:39.840]  believe me just search authorities worried about breast bombs breast implant
[42:39.840 --> 42:44.320]  bombs and then in the articles they say that so so see we got to look for your
[42:44.320 --> 42:47.720]  house with high-powered radiation we got to do this to you we got to not give
[42:47.720 --> 42:53.000]  any radiation protection to the TSA workers who just all day are standing
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.520]  around right there at the machines they're just blasting radiation everywhere
[42:56.520 --> 43:00.720]  and and you know what they now call in the TSA and say do you have a problem
[43:00.720 --> 43:03.800]  with the body scanners you worry about radiation and if you say yeah I'm worried
[43:03.800 --> 43:09.080]  they say thanks a lot officer and then and then a week later you get your pink
[43:09.080 --> 43:14.120]  slip they can find idiots that'll sit there roasting themselves there it is
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.920]  Fox News terrorists could use explosives and breast implants to crash planes
[43:19.920 --> 43:26.400]  experts warn and they say they need full-body x-rays oh and you know doesn't
[43:26.400 --> 43:29.320]  matter there won't be any lead walls for those running them won't be lead walls
[43:29.320 --> 43:35.560]  for you it's just it's over yeah they're testing and practicing absurdity on us to
[43:35.560 --> 43:39.400]  break our will and make us accept it I mean what more will we put up with I'm
[43:39.400 --> 43:48.240]  in America watching small children being taken out of strollers and x-rayed three
[43:48.240 --> 43:54.560]  days ago I'm having to watch this and I was hoping they'd pull me out for it
[43:54.560 --> 43:58.720]  because I was gonna just just sit there and say so you're radiating yourself
[43:58.720 --> 44:03.520]  right now I've got to walk through this high-radiation area and spend ten
[44:03.520 --> 44:07.960]  minutes at a checkpoint being radiated just by the back scatter and you don't
[44:07.960 --> 44:11.760]  care about yourself and I know full well you were called aside all of you and
[44:11.760 --> 44:15.040]  ask if you had a problem with it and those that were smart you notice some
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.480]  of your co-workers aren't here now you're killing yourselves and they're you know
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.200]  arresting me for causing a disturbance well then I'd be in the news and I'd
[44:23.200 --> 44:27.000]  beat it in court saying you tried to stick me in a radiation chamber I'm
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.240]  here warning people how is the TSA exempt from federal radiological laws that
[44:33.240 --> 44:40.120]  every nurse and doctor are under how do our troops use DU weapons when the army's
[44:40.120 --> 44:44.600]  own manuals say it's gonna kill them soft kill deader than a hammer later but
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.080]  how are they gonna handle this months ago in the Chicago Tribune the head of
[44:49.080 --> 44:52.640]  the TSA said we will in the next few years it will be mandatory there will
[44:52.640 --> 45:02.040]  be no opt-out secondary search then we had a caller and 99% of the time if a
[45:02.040 --> 45:04.800]  caller's telling the truth which they almost always are you can search
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.000]  whatever they're saying and find it it's already open source there's so much
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.080]  media out there nothing gets gets gets missed that's where the real
[45:12.080 --> 45:15.800]  intelligence gathering is going on for the private individuals who are fighting
[45:15.800 --> 45:19.920]  the globalist and the globalist themselves and the caller was a pilot and
[45:19.920 --> 45:25.360]  he called in and said they're forcing everyone at this particular Texas
[45:25.360 --> 45:32.600]  airport it was El Paso to go through it and I searched El Paso times everyone
[45:32.600 --> 45:37.720]  being being body scanned wallah there it was already going on three months ago
[45:37.720 --> 45:44.240]  now if you try to refuse they get you in there and they want you and they squeeze
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.000]  your legs and they violate your privacy they got federal grants for cops to take
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.400]  blood at checkpoints it's all about them getting in your body Bill Clinton's got
[45:51.400 --> 45:54.960]  an executive order on record they never implemented to take urine and blood to
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.760]  get a driver's license now it's being proposed in New York it's being
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.600]  proposed in other states they're now trying to take blood or they're saying
[46:02.600 --> 46:09.080]  we'll waive your fees if you opt in to give us blood see I mean we know what
[46:09.080 --> 46:15.000]  the plan is so they're gonna harass you and squeeze your genitals and here it is
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.240]  ABC news and get their hands on you if they can't get that naked body scan of
[46:20.240 --> 46:25.160]  your body for their records if they can't bathe you in the radiation chamber
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.600]  pat downs or full body scan security gets more personal in airports as TSA
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.560]  changes airport pat down procedure some ask if security's gone too far and then
[46:35.560 --> 46:42.440]  it goes on to say they are increasing the pat downs it's more of an enhanced
[46:42.440 --> 46:46.320]  pat down and you can see it on the news where they literally grab a woman's
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.280]  breast and then just squeeze around the edges let me make sure these are real and
[46:50.280 --> 46:54.560]  there's a husband right there or there's a father or mother watching their
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.720]  14-year-old daughter and there's that TSA worker just oh yeah
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.520]  doesn't get any better than this they love it next time you pass through
[47:02.520 --> 47:05.680]  security in some airports around the country you may face a difficult dilemma
[47:05.680 --> 47:10.160]  would you rather have a revealing full body scan or what some are calling x
[47:10.160 --> 47:14.960]  rated pat down some passengers opt out of the full body scan concerned about the
[47:14.960 --> 47:18.280]  low dose of radiation emitted by the high tech body scanners that are being
[47:18.280 --> 47:21.600]  put in place in many terminals and what about them saving the image of your
[47:21.600 --> 47:28.440]  naked body the machines also are able to see beneath clothes creating a photo
[47:28.440 --> 47:31.960]  realistic picture of the passengers body but for those who refuse the scan the
[47:31.960 --> 47:37.800]  alternative pat down is about to get equally thorough and there's a video
[47:37.800 --> 47:42.120]  clip watch world news tonight with Dan Sawyer for more on the story starting
[47:42.120 --> 47:45.960]  Friday the TSA is changing its pat down procedure so they want to force you to
[47:45.960 --> 47:51.040]  do the naked body scan TSA officers used a pat down procedure with the backs of
[47:51.040 --> 47:54.240]  their hands but now they'll use the fronts of their hands to search more
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.880]  than ever before and see this is all about training the TSA people to to get
[47:58.880 --> 48:02.000]  the backs of their hands on a woman's inside of her thighs and you kind of see
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.600]  him going and then up over there their their hind in and then up over their
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.840]  sides and it's a feel down you know kind of like it's your wife oh baby you know
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.360]  and you you go upper upper thighs upper waist up under arms it's a romantic thing
[48:15.360 --> 48:21.240]  not anymore it's men and women doing this to you and it's about training the
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.160]  TSA well now the hands are going like this and now they're going on your
[48:26.160 --> 48:29.960]  breast and on your genitals and they squeeze them to make sure it's not an
[48:29.960 --> 48:39.560]  al-qaeda boopy trap oh boy now listen to this they will put their hands on body
[48:39.560 --> 48:46.000]  parts that were once off limits see well it's for al-qaeda starting Friday the
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.440]  TSA is changing its pat down procedure TSA officers used to pat down passengers
[48:49.440 --> 48:52.680]  with the backs of their hands but now they'll use the fronts of their hands to
[48:52.680 --> 48:56.920]  search more than ever before in some cases touching body parts that were once
[48:56.920 --> 49:02.800]  off limits genitals and breast genitals and breast they are gonna put their
[49:02.800 --> 49:09.240]  hands on your private parts they're gonna squeeze them they're gonna touch

[54:35.120 --> 54:38.400]  the economy the election all that's happening in fact I'm gonna get into it
[54:38.400 --> 54:44.680]  right now with Bob Chapman coming up then we have the head of one of the
[54:44.680 --> 54:47.320]  biggest unions and involved with the government the parliament the Prime
[54:47.320 --> 54:51.720]  Minister decrying him in Australia going public for 9-11 truth he's joining us
[54:51.720 --> 54:55.640]  from Australia during the last hour to get into people standing up and having
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.520]  courage because 9-11 is being used to enslave all of us regardless of what you
[54:59.520 --> 55:03.520]  really think happened with it. Shouldn't the head of Al Qaeda dining at the
[55:03.520 --> 55:07.640]  Pentagon two months after 9-11 be an issue or are we supposed to just forget
[55:07.640 --> 55:12.560]  that and send our kids to the naked body scanners by the way Rob do shot video at
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.160]  the airport a few months ago that we've never shown he's he just reminded me of
[55:16.160 --> 55:23.560]  it of people being sent through naked body scanners and then having the enhanced
[55:23.560 --> 55:28.040]  pat down done so oh you don't want to go through a body scanner we're just gonna
[55:28.040 --> 55:32.800]  we're just gonna humiliate you we're gonna touch your private parts there's
[55:32.800 --> 55:36.720]  nothing to do with fighting terror okay I'm done talking about that for now
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.840]  later we'll have that video and they always have these little stage fear
[55:41.840 --> 55:45.800]  mongering events to remind us of you know how important the whole police
[55:45.800 --> 55:49.160]  state is to all of us now I'm gonna go through the numbers and what's
[55:49.160 --> 55:56.480]  happening in the states but I've been really studying it in depth the last
[55:56.480 --> 56:02.480]  few weeks and Sharon angle is pulling away with about a five point lead in most
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.120]  of the polls what I do is go through an index of polls in Nevada against Harry
[56:07.120 --> 56:13.600]  Reid Rand Paul had lost some of his lead of on average about nine points down to
[56:13.600 --> 56:17.720]  about five now he searched back to nine points ahead in some polls ten eleven
[56:17.720 --> 56:22.440]  twelve points in others in scientific polls but that doesn't mean they're
[56:22.440 --> 56:28.240]  going to win because even Sharon angles lawyer has said clearly Harry Reid is
[56:28.240 --> 56:32.000]  trying to steal this election and in the biggest counting in Nevada there have
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.480]  been thousands of reports of not being able to vote for Sharon angle for Senate
[56:36.480 --> 56:40.400]  you can only vote for Harry Reid and they're calling that a glitch it's not a
[56:40.400 --> 56:43.920]  glitch that most the troops didn't get their their ballots or that the ballots
[56:43.920 --> 56:47.800]  they did get have been lost being shipped back to the United States from all
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.800]  the countries they're in different election officials have been indicted in
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.640]  Florida and several other states the last week caught red-handed it's usually
[56:56.640 --> 56:59.880]  people running for higher office who happen to be the election officials who
[56:59.880 --> 57:04.120]  are being caught with their hands directly in the cookie jar and that is a
[57:04.120 --> 57:09.400]  serious conflict of interest so we're going to see more dirty tricks but it is
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.600]  now starting to get picked up by more newspapers and TV in Kentucky the Jack
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.200]  Conway cover-up he and his prosecutor brother getting tipped off about an
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.960]  narcotics raid and then his brother and others lying about it once they got caught
[57:21.960 --> 57:25.640]  and the detectives lying about it they've been caught red-handed in in what
[57:25.640 --> 57:30.200]  is clear obstruction of justice that's really stinging him hard so good job
[57:30.200 --> 57:35.400]  for everybody getting that information out but I'm really worried about Rand
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.160]  Paul because he's more than just a man he's more than just a senatorial
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.320]  candidate who it looks like is going to win three days from now it's just three
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.320]  full days Friday Saturday Sunday or Saturday Sunday Monday so it's about
[57:48.320 --> 57:52.240]  three and a half days until Tuesday and the election and it looks like a
[57:52.240 --> 57:59.520]  complete wave of Republican victories if I had to guess the Republicans will get
[57:59.520 --> 58:06.120]  50 seats in the House of Representatives and 9 seats to 10 seats they get 10 they
[58:06.120 --> 58:13.920]  take the Senate back in the US Senate but there is election fraud and the good
[58:13.920 --> 58:17.920]  thing is this is a much better crop of Republicans than came in in 94 who were
[58:17.920 --> 58:24.320]  neocons led by Newdy Gennrich Boehner and others though he's a acolyte of
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.640]  Gennrich no they're all gone in two years if they don't deliver the end of
[58:28.640 --> 58:32.240]  Obamacare the end of carbon taxes and the rest of it the problem is they also
[58:32.240 --> 58:35.360]  want the naked body scanners in the police state but there are a lot of good
[58:35.360 --> 58:38.360]  candidates in there and this is a big victory against the globalist we'll be
[58:38.360 --> 58:49.040]  right back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[58:50.920 --> 58:55.680]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[58:55.680 --> 59:00.240]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[59:00.240 --> 59:03.600]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[59:03.600 --> 59:08.720]  I've determined its influence on our president in Congress and they really
[59:08.720 --> 59:13.520]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[59:13.520 --> 59:17.880]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[59:17.880 --> 59:23.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[59:23.120 --> 59:27.440]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[59:27.440 --> 59:30.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[59:30.920 --> 59:36.160]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.560]  elections across the country a lot of them are very close and that's where
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.800]  you're seeing the election fraud no doubt in Kentucky to try to beat Rand Paul
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.920]  no doubt in Nevada with Sharon Engel on average about five points ahead of Harry
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.920]  Reid but clear evidence of election fraud there election fraud in New York
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:02.480]  Illinois also I heard Ed Schultz on XM with his TV show yesterday driving home
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.040]  literally fear mongering about how the American people who support the Tea Party
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.720]  are brown-shirted Nazis who are beating people up nationwide there have been a
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.600]  few scuffles a woman in a wig running up to Rand Paul trying to throw stuff in
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.920]  his car one guy puts his foot on her to hold her down meanwhile we forget that
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:25.640]  move on org person cut a person's finger off I mean there's just countless
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.280]  videos of them beating people up the big union thugs beating people up in the
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.320]  last year I'd say it's five to one just from what I've seen we've written
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.400]  articles with just the hundreds of links to the violence and thugs beating
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.720]  people up and the police doing nothing meanwhile the Democrats are playing the
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.320]  part of poor victims who've been attacked but then we got a new video from
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.520]  we are change New York the head chapter and we heard about this a few weeks
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.400]  going on happen they've now released the video and the cops did arrest one of
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.320]  John Stuart's head writers they politely asked him questions they went up to him
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.920]  there to book signing at a Barnes & Noble and said Mr. Stuart why do you make
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.840]  fun of 9-11 truth and he's you know why are you with Glenn Beck on that and he
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.560]  said oh because I think I'll cut it at 9-11 they said okay thank you well they
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:15.040]  went outside and they were out there handing out literature on a city street
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.240]  and his guys came out got in their face screamed cussed at him we can't play it
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.320]  on there there's so much cussing it'd be unintelligible there's so many cuss words
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.520]  we have to cut out you can watch the video unedited up there and they broke
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.360]  one camera attacked him punched a guy in the face was being very polite to him
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.760]  saying please don't spit in my face please don't scream at me and the guy
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.520]  just punches him and they did arresting so you know that's pretty big news while
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.280]  Ed Schultz running around saying their brown shirts the Nazis are here no no
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.640]  the Nazism is the naked body scanners but also the big economic news as we
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.840]  told you they're now announcing the global digital currency Christian
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.120]  science monitor is hard currency on its way out introducing the new virtual
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.320]  world currency we're gonna talk about all of that we're about to go to break but
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.880]  I wanted to bring Bob Chapman up he always joins us once a week and he's on
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.640]  with us from the international forecaster and the two minutes we got
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.160]  left for the break what do you think of this election time fair mongering that
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.440]  they're now admitting basically was nothing it was a printer cartridge that
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.920]  scared them shutting down all these flights and things Bob it's just another
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:26.960]  piece of misdirection to get people all riled up I think they better address the
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.400]  fact that the president is even going to be in the country in a major election
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.120]  800 people going with them what is it 80 planes I've got it did the whole
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:43.880]  things crazy yeah tell folks about that trip well I don't know I don't know what
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.520]  they're doing over there but it looks like to me that they've taken all of
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.280]  their friends on vacation and you and I get the pay for it I mean it's
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:58.440]  incredible remember how bush was on vacation for a month before 9-11 right
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:05.520]  that's correct that's correct you're right so why is the emperor why is the
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.440]  emperor going on this out-of-country trip well it could be that they get
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:15.320]  something planned but I don't have any proof of it and and so that's a
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:21.080]  possibility but I think you have to understand the source so the players
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.200]  involve him and his wife and those that surround him I think it's just a fun
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.480]  package you know he's not going to be there in two years he may as well have
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.480]  a good time he figures in and everybody's leaving him you know that's
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.760]  another big issue when the Republicans win the house probably the Senate well

[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.320]  this hour than we have a guest joining us from Australia with key 9-11 truth
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.720]  information and the demonization campaign going on over there and worldwide
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.040]  guess anybody that points out the giant trillion ton elephants sitting on top
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:46.680]  of us Bob Chapman you just joined us we were getting into the election I'm
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.720]  really concerned about election fraud I mean it's all over the news that voting
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.640]  machines are going for the Democrats in key Senate and House races that people
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.120]  aren't allowed to vote for the Republican or the Tea Party of the
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.800]  libertarian candidates many of the military people never got their ballots
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.440]  though for two months this has been pointed out or the ballots that they
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.600]  did get have not been shipped back or disappeared we are really seeing
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:18.400]  desperate activity here that is going on and you know that's the issue Bush use
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.840]  these machines for fraud in Ohio and other places and got caught men
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.920]  Republicans are like oh there's no problem with the machines and now the
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.640]  Democrats are using them you know the issue is whoever's in power is going to
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.760]  use these we need to get rid of them and there's a big move to do that some
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.520]  counties and states are moving in that right direction Bob breaking down
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.040]  watching this election and the fact they pulled out all the stops against
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.360]  Rand Paul with this woman charging through security trying to throw a sign
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.400]  you know in his window and the media not showing this you know the start of the
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.440]  video I mean the good news is it's actually driven his his poll numbers
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.960]  up meanwhile it's starting to come out in mainstream news thanks to our listeners
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.440]  getting the word out in others that Jack Conway was obstructing justice with his
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.480]  brother in narcotics investigation of his brother give us your take on that Bob
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.680]  Chapman well I think these are the kind of things that would be expected and if
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:16.640]  you go back in history you will see back the last 150 years at least then in the
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.800]  United States and many many other countries people have done all sorts of
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.440]  desperate things to get elected because it's like a honeypot they steal from it
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.480]  and so you're going to see desperate people do desperate things and that's
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:36.480]  what's happening the tidal wave is going to be overwhelming how much or how badly
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:43.520]  will be affected by cheating through the machines I don't know I just know
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.960]  it's there the only way to solve it is go back to you know doing the way they
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:55.800]  used to before with paper ballot and hopefully all and or most will do that and
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:02.320]  yes we're going to get somewhat injured but I think overall the people realize
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.680]  that and I think what we're seeing particularly in the house races is you
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:13.320]  know 50 seats that's that's enormous and so and I assume that almost all of them
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:19.400]  are Democrats that's that's some some great gains and I think the American
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:28.560]  people the constituency can get those who are new in Congress to listen before
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:35.080]  Wall Street and banking pays them off or attempts to do so and I think we get
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:42.240]  some great chances here the numbers I've got from the from the sources that have
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.880]  been accurate in the past is 50 house seats in the house the Republicans take
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:53.360]  it with a nice majority and 9 to 10 Senate seats that's what all the polls
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.280]  show unless there's election fraud and we know that's going on what's your
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:05.960]  breakdown on that Bob it's just too hard to say I mean I I'm I just can't I
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.400]  don't know I know they're gonna try to do it they're gonna try to do but I don't
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.200]  know how effective they will be if they've got the packages that the Bush
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:24.480]  people have they might be very effective especially is in the close races I saw
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:32.320]  that happen in the election in Mexico five years ago there was no question
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:41.240]  that was rigged and who was down there doing that the Bush people and so do
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.560]  the Democrats have the same kind of abilities that the neocons had I don't
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:55.280]  know what do you expect the Republicans to do I mean if you look at the
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.840]  different people that are running I'd say more than half of them are some of
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.480]  the more patriotic type people not of Iran Paul or Ron Paul caliber but but
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:11.440]  certainly better than the mainline neocon Republicans a how do you see a
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:16.280]  repeat of 94 with the inside neocons and we've now got internal memos on this
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.520]  trying to dominate and suppress the more patriotic arm of the Republican
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.640]  Party that's about to get a lot stronger in Congress that's a and then B do you
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.280]  expect to see people kind of go to sleep now if the Republicans win the House and
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.120]  Senate and think everything's okay because our team won well first of all
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:43.000]  the neocons lost their credibility and yes they're going to be players but
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.160]  they're not going to be able to run over the people the good people that are
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:52.000]  now being elected new into the House and Senate I do not think they'll be
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.840]  successful it's just like Gingrich running around and he reportedly is
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:03.000]  going to run for the president in 2012 I mean you got to be kidding me I mean if
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.760]  he was in a dog show he couldn't win and they they just burned their bridges
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:14.040]  those kinds of people look you know there was a lot very bad with the eight
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:21.200]  years that we spent under junior Bush will call them and people don't want to
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.680]  go back to that and after these people get elected the people out there in the
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.120]  streets they're going to write and they're going to email to the new people
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.080]  in Congress they're going to tell them look we want you to get rid of this
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:44.160]  medical plan we want you to revisit and make changes in the financial reform we
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:52.160]  do not want a 1% transaction tax we do not want a Fed reserve nor do we want
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.760]  quantitative easing from them because they're just making the problem worse and
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:02.080]  on and on as many many things that can tackle and these are the things that the
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:09.440]  current administration is going to are going to try to pass between the end of
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:16.160]  the Congressional election next week and when the session ends and one of them
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:24.320]  is an attempt I think will happen to pass legislation for the government to
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.640]  commandeer retirement plans I don't whether it's going to be successful
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.880]  quite frankly I don't think it will but they're going to try well that's the
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.960]  point they're openly announcing to the different presidential commissions and
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.700]  the Democrats in Congress that they do want to quote take over the even private
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:46.080]  pension plans to quote protect them but then slap attacks on them well it
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:53.320]  taxes 5% it passed the way it stands on every worker and that money is supposed
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.360]  to go into Social Security so what they're saying in essence we want to
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.200]  increase Social Security taxes by 5% you know and that money will go into the
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:09.240]  general fund when in fact they'll squander it on some union plan or
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:16.640]  something and what's very very difficult about this snatching of six
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.840]  trillion dollars with the retirement plans is that there are a lot of
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.120]  corporations that are for it as well as the labor unions because they're all
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:33.600]  underfunded I mean even the S&P 500 companies are about 73% funded which is
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.160]  not bad but it's not good either so they need to pump up the Ponzi scheme because
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.720]  so many of the companies invested in derivatives that's right they lost
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:49.360]  gazillions of dollars and you know they were all involved in these CDOs as well
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.120]  collateralized debt obligations which are the bonds that hold the mortgages they
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.760]  they had lots of them and and they got a lot of real estate that they can't get
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.080]  rid of that they're buried in particularly the labor unions but some of
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.560]  the corporations as well but the main thing is it's underfunded they had
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.640]  never any intention of funding I don't know what the average is for labor unions
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:18.040]  but if I I would have guessed I'd say 50% at best so that's why they want that
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.240]  kind of legislation they want an extra 5% tax pouring into the general fund so
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.200]  they can squander it let me bring up another issue that ties into the
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.760]  election but obviously this lame duck is one of the biggest issues we're
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:37.640]  facing and not just a repealing stuff but but stopping them from passing even
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:45.800]  more draconian globalist agenda-linked garbage Rand Paul has surged ahead of
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:52.960]  Conway despite the stomp smear and that whole contrived manufactured story and
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.560]  the same thing with Sharon angle clearly the mainstream media is out of
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.920]  bullets the mainstream corporate media is imploding their ratings their
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.240]  advertising their trust meters and major polls of the lowest it's ever been
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.960]  according to Gallup and others and you know that's what I told four or five
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.320]  months ago I told Politico and Salon and others that quoted me that if they
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:22.080]  really wanted to hurt Rand Paul they would endorse him but but by by attacking
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:28.000]  him and lying about him and demonizing him people then go to him in droves and
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.760]  I still think they're so hubris filled they haven't completely figured that out
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  yet and that's good because as soon as they figure it out you know then they'll
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.200]  be a harder enemy to beat but I mean that Bob the hubris of them putting out
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.120]  all this cartoonish lies it's literally the emperor has no clothes but they
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:52.720]  don't understand that you know I think they've for many many years believing
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.360]  that the media would be able to control the public through propaganda
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:04.080]  propagandization they figured you know most of the job was done for them what's
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:10.040]  happened in the last couple of years actually before that probably three to
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:17.000]  four years back is that people are forcing themselves to get a grasp on
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.640]  what's going on with their government not only at the national but all levels
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:29.640]  and they're disgusted they see that when there is quantitative easing plans in
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.600]  other words a creation of money and credit where does it go it all goes to
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:39.360]  Wall Street and banking insurance companies transnational conglomerates
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.960]  none of it comes down to the people Bob employment Bob we got to go to break
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.200]  stay there and complete that important thought because I have some things I
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.720]  want to add as well but the awakening has happened people couldn't believe it
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.600]  was as bad as we said now they're finding out it's it's that bad and then
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.560]  some will break that down and where you see this going and we'll get into the
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.040]  economy and your phone calls let me tell you a little bit about one of our

[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.120]  planes and airports and SWAT teams chasing after UPS trucks an ink cartridge
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:06.480]  in England Bob Chapman is our guest I got some video we've never shown of TSA
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.600]  putting people through body scanners and then patting them down afterwards I'm
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.040]  gonna take a few phone calls later in the hour for Bob Chapman on the economy
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:24.960]  or the election 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 Bob finishing up your point
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.280]  about the permanent sustained awakening Brzezinski agrees with that that people
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.400]  are awake they're aware of the global corporate structure that controls our
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.600]  politicians as Ron Paul has said once you get past the puppets and identify the
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.360]  Federal Reserve and the global cartel it's only a matter of time till they fall
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.920]  because people are now identifying the corrupt power structure not the bait and
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:52.440]  switch of the two parties Bob Chapman well you're absolutely right and they
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:57.440]  see the 22 and three-quarter percent unemployment they're not befuddled and
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.000]  fooled by you three which is nine and a half or whatever is percent they they
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.840]  understand and they're forcing themselves to learn and we've talked about
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.480]  this in this program before and why is that because 15 years we've been
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.760]  hammering away on talk radio and on the internet and it's working the public has
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.240]  become involved and in this very concerned in all countries about their
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.480]  future and so they're listening and they're learning and they're opening
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.360]  their minds up and you and I and others are being invited to appear on radio and
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.760]  television and in print throughout the world that never happened before and so
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.160]  yes people are getting educated not all of them and not all of them ever will and
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:52.840]  we can't hope for that we need a strong backbone in America and in other
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.480]  countries as well to be able to carry forward the truth and this is what
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:04.440]  mr. Bershyninski and all of his ilk the elitist this is what they're terrified
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:12.840]  of and they are terrified well they are terrified Bob and 60 minutes I'm sure
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:18.440]  you saw it last Sunday at a special and said California is 22 plus percent
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.440]  unemployment nationally they said 17.6 in fact pull up that actual number for me
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:33.120]  at the headline 60 minutes unemployment 17 that nationally 22 22 in California but
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:39.720]  we know California is more than 30 and the national is above 22% Bob now
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.400]  that's correct and it's in fact it clicked up last month and I'm looking for
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:49.640]  another click up over the next six months because the money that's been
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.040]  already being shoved into the system started in June through the bond market
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.040]  and the Federal Reserve didn't tell you about that and they're not going to tell
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.840]  you about that because everything they do is a big secret the only thing that
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:10.160]  you hear at these meetings that they have is that yes this is what we're going
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.880]  to do when in fact they just fluff over it and they're doing all sorts of other
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.440]  things so the money that they are going to inject and I predicted on this
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:27.040]  program in early July it was 2.5 plus 2.5 trillion dollars for the next year two
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.040]  years that's five trillion dollars in two years and that's what they're going to
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.000]  pour in but it's going to go through the same spigots that went before it's not
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.360]  going to get down to the people and in between now and next June unemployment
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:46.440]  will move up to 25% but the issue here that I want you to speak to briefly
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.760]  before we go to bright and come back with more on the economy and the key
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.840]  intel that's now being admitted about the world global government currency that
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.040]  they've been trying to deny for two years that it's been above 22% nationwide
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:03.840]  why would 60 minutes now come out and admit at least a partial truth 17 plus
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.480]  nationwide 22 plus California I mean that's still a whitewash but it shows
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.320]  they're unable to just lie about everything they've lost all credibility
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:18.680]  telling us it's 9.6 percent that shows that they are falling apart it shows
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.760]  that they're under extreme pressure and it's working on them and that figure is
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:32.440]  17.1 percent so they're claiming 17.1 nationwide and 22.1 in California I
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.400]  don't know that figure I don't have it in front of me it's not realistic the
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.920]  real thing is over 30% and it's gonna get worse yeah but I'm gonna pull up the
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:45.240]  CBS headline just to make sure I mean I know it's 22 plus and 17 plus but we'll
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:51.280]  get the numbers straight ahead on the other side stay with us we're on the
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:59.440]  march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.560]  obviously here's the big news on the economic front I want to get your take
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.920]  on this than anything else you think absolutely key them will briefly look at
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.200]  gold and then go to phone calls here with us till five after next hour and we
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:24.040]  have a guest joining us from Australia this is out of the Christian science
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.800]  monitor and this doesn't tell Bob Chapman anything he didn't know it doesn't
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.080]  tell our listeners anything they didn't know but the fact that it's being
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.200]  announced every few days I see similar articles to this lets you know that we're
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:40.120]  now entering that system where they implode the globe's currencies with
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.040]  coordinated devaluation open g20 policy now for 18 months was it was already
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.280]  their policy secretly for a decade but publicly announced that inflation that's
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.040]  the New York Times headline inflation Bernanke says will fix the debt yeah
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.760]  that's like if one legs chopped off chopping off the other and shooting
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.360]  yourself five times in the head will fix it no it will not fix it we know the
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.360]  plan people keep saying where's the global currency Alex where's the global
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:08.040]  currency well we told you that's why I've always talked about this a marrow
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.440]  stuff that was one plan but not the plan that they green lighted they've always
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:16.920]  the CFR trilateral Commission UN rank corporation discussed them all but the
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.240]  main plan they've always been preparing that is a bypass of everything right to
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.720]  the finish line I'm gonna do this very simply here for people that don't
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.680]  understand this they already have a regional Asian currency where they try
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.280]  to unify their prices through the Asian Union they have the European Union that's
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.080]  openly unified their currency and then they already have dollarization for
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:40.520]  Canada Mexico and much of Latin America and the Caribbean and areas of the
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.360]  Pacific but that's halved up between the Asian cartel and the Anglo-American
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:51.560]  cartel what they're doing is with SDRs the IMF and World Bank start global VAT
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.960]  taxes they get governments to pass to them pay in to back it up global carbon
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:02.360]  taxes travel taxes and a raft of other taxes that are fed into it that
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:06.080]  supposedly then gives it limited fractional reserve backing they're already
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.760]  in the trillions every year trading SDRs they're already denominating foreign
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.120]  shipments under the USPS postal service under SDRs it's 1.5 SDRs for every
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:23.840]  dollar what is it 1.3 SDRs for every euro and we already have the global
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.680]  currency then they just have to get all the countries to agree that their
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:30.000]  currencies will be governed by this group they'll control the interest rates
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.960]  this basically gives the private fellow reserve cartel global control over the
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.640]  whole system and here's the Christian science monitor so you'll still have
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.840]  your dollar you'll still have your euro your yon your yen but it is set by the
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.160]  G20 and the private IMF World Bank XM International Bank of Settlements
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.000]  cartel now that's Alex Jones telling you that for 15 years Bob Chapman for 40
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.760]  plus we knew by the 70s the exact plan this is all directly trilateral
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:02.600]  Commission from 1975 76 is is hard currency on its way out introducing the
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.920]  new virtual world currency I'll give you a document cam shot of this for
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.500]  present planet TV viewers the new virtual world currency is an index the
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.200]  world's 15 largest economies weighed by their gross domestic product adjusted
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:21.360]  for purchasing power parity so that's the new SDR global index and they go on
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.480]  to say when discussing reserve currency alternatives the US dollar conversion
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:28.600]  almost inevitably returns the international monetary funds systemic
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.440]  reserve asset or the special drawing right SDR and then they go on here to
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.640]  announce exactly what we exactly exactly what we told you they would do but
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.960]  now they've got to further destroy the currencies to do that so they're gonna
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:46.400]  run them up and devalue them the bankers keep that money when it has limited
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.200]  value but but they get first come first serve so they get the purchasing power
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.000]  they pass on to you the devaluation and you've got to pay it back to them in
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.560]  taxes so they get you coming and going Bob Chapman tell us how big it is to have
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.720]  them openly announcing this now it's a very big thing and it was preceded here
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.600]  about a year ago by another minor announcement and some of the major
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:16.560]  countries buying SDRs and the reason for that was for funding purposes and as
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:22.560]  you know the IMF has been a seller of gold although I don't think they've
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.240]  sold as much as they say that they have because I think some of that goal was
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.040]  sold previously and it was a short covering operation which India handled
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  and some of these nations that are supposedly buying gold I don't think
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.600]  they get the money to buy it in the first place so I think some of them are
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.520]  the bogus transactions and I noticed they weren't selling any to Russia and
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.560]  every time they sold gold into the market which they said they wouldn't do
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:54.920]  and the reason was to suppress the price the Russians were there buying it all
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:00.680]  every single time they went in and so the Russians know what's up and they're
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.000]  not going to get their global currency to any further level than an
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.040]  international trade it'll never go further than that and one of the reasons
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:17.960]  why is they don't want to put a basis on that currency the SDR or the bank or
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:24.600]  they don't want to put a a backing on that currency and that's why it'll
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.960]  never work you've got to have gold or gold and silver backing and if you don't
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:38.160]  it's not going to work it's the the temptation for politicians worldwide is
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:45.360]  so great when you have a currency of any kind that has no backing at which the
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:52.120]  backing acts as a suppressor on the currency so that those who are running
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:58.080]  the currency central bank a government whatever it is it it doesn't allow them
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:03.280]  to create more and more and more currency and so they don't want that and
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.240]  that's why they'll not work and I don't think we'll get to a digital currency
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:15.320]  there's going to be a lot of uproar of all kinds worldwide that's going to be
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.480]  caused by the fact that we continue to make predictions that come true and we
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.000]  continue to tell more people every day what's going on and we are going to stop
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.560]  them now again just to finish up what their plan is whether they can get it
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.880]  done or not is that then you still have some paper currency controlled globally
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:41.240]  but most transactions are digital based in SDRs and you must thumbprint or face
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:47.440]  scan as part of the new VAT or global sales tax to apportion that because
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.320]  under $50,000 a year now you're going to quote be exempt what do you make of
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:58.840]  silver subject to price manipulation and there's now been a this came out two
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:03.800]  days ago a lawsuit and criminal investigations of major banks engaged
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:11.040]  in silver suppression well first of all the CFTC didn't want to carry it
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.080]  forward that is the commodity free futures trading corporation and they're
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.880]  in the arm of the US government and they've been trying to put it off and
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:24.240]  put it off finally two days ago when the lawsuit came now I said that there was
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:29.920]  the lawsuit and I think it's I said in May I said but I'm not going to say
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.280]  anything more about it because I don't want to disrupt what's going on at the
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:39.560]  law firm and I have a whole bunch of information and in Saturday's publication
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.520]  which is tomorrow in the international forecaster tells you how to join the
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.280]  lawsuit in the name of the attorney and the phone number everything's there and
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.320]  it's important because everybody who owns silver coins silver bullion mining
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:03.880]  stocks that have silver contracts derivatives futures contracts the silver
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.200]  ETF every one of you can sue because you have standing because you were ripped
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.840]  off by these people that's right you have standing something that the previous
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.720]  lawsuit they wouldn't allow to go forward several years ago because they
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:22.320]  said there was no standing which is not true but that's not the point now the
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.640]  word is Bob briefly because I want I need to get the calls here and a brief pop
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.080]  in from Ted or maybe I'll hold you over a little bit we got a guest from
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:34.600]  Australia coming up Bob this this is connected to Gata isn't it and their
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  inside sources yes it is and but I've been in you know in that for you know
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:47.480]  40 years more than Gata has and I've been tracking these people and it's
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.520]  happening what's going to happen I think Hong Kong Shanghai Bank could go
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:58.080]  under and they have a lot of other problems besides this and I think JP
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.800]  Morgan Chase could be taken to the edge I think what they're going to use as an
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.880]  excuse is that we were acting on the behalf of the US government well you've
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.760]  been saying that for years you said lawsuits would come and then they would
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.480]  say where we were acting under orders and that's okay let them do that but you
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:20.680]  see the game for them is over they can't continue to do that because everybody
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:23.960]  in the world is going to know that we're they're rigging it and they're going to
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:29.760]  know that all of the talk that's gone out about rigging the stock market is now
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.840]  true all right now there's going to be a hue and cry from people particularly in
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:37.920]  the United States that this has got to stop now Bob we're almost out of time
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.200]  because I've got to come back and take calls for two short segments but I want
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.400]  you to be able to continue on this but we've only got three minutes before break
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.000]  and I wanted to bring Ted Anderson in and you know give people a gold pitch at
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.720]  incredibly good prices to start protecting themselves gold is racing
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:59.960]  back up where do you see gold in the near future Bob I see it much higher please
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:07.360]  to take advantage of Ted's offerings and I feel tragically awful about all of
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:11.560]  these people have said gold we're gonna go down and now it's going flying right
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:16.760]  back up again my heart goes out to you yeah it's all part of the system trying
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:21.160]  to spook people away from it but there's overall currency devaluation that's
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:25.720]  gonna reflect commodities going up mainly gold and silver Ted Anderson good
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:28.600]  to have you here give us your take on this announcement of the global currency
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.480]  in all these mainstream publications and tell us today's golden silver offers
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:36.460]  well the one that bothers me the most Alex is that Bloomberg article that they
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:41.320]  posted it says gold will outlive the dollar once the slaughter comes it's by
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.800]  John Hathaway and this just the first chapter real quick it says the world's
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:51.120]  monetary system is in the process of melting down we have entered into the
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:54.840]  end game they must be listening to you we have entered in the end game for the
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:00.120]  dollar as the denominated reserve currency but most investors and policy
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:04.120]  makers are unaware of its implications people have to read this article they
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:08.240]  can call us for it we'll mail it to you but yeah to post it on the website I
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.240]  mean I'm my god I just I can't believe that one came from Bloomberg yeah gold
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:18.520]  is running up silver went up silver's at $24 and 62 cents gold is up over
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:23.800]  1,360 60 I mean the market is just raging right back upward after this
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.840]  little manipulation that we had a couple of days ago and and I just can't say it
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:34.280]  enough people really really need to move into golden silver and they have to get
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.120]  away from the US dollar that's just the bottom line I mean the food and
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:42.880]  everything else they needed to but I just need to say if you're sitting in
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:48.040]  dollar denominated assets man you better wake up I mean Ted that's another
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.240]  point we told people a year ago that they were going to run up the prices of
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.080]  food because the big central banks were manipulating it now that's all over the

[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:14.360]  before we get the next guest on at eight after the White House has put out a
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:18.320]  press release it's up on the drudge report I'm gonna have Watson to a story
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.320]  on this how Bush issued fake terror alerts and how Obama's doing it
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.920]  Obama got the word from the British about a deadly printer cartridge that
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.320]  didn't have explosives in it so he ordered the sweeps as part of a pre-election
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:36.400]  fair mongering White House press release I mean it just hidden in plain
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:41.980]  view let's go to Michael in Florida Michael you're on the air with Bob
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:47.160]  Shatman go ahead hey what's up Alex what's up Bob hey buddy what's up what's
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:52.720]  going on um well I was just thinking like how are they gonna change the money
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:59.160]  because FDR currency without letting us see what's in the reserve like that's
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:03.320]  that's sort of something that they they can't be so fast to do well they're
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:10.160]  already doing it with the Federal Reserve here the other thing is you know
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:15.520]  we have we have to uncover the corruption is basically like back from
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:21.920]  the voting scam in 2000 which allowed Bush to you know also scan his way in
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:28.160]  2004 into another election like we have to look at things like that because it's
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.680]  not really we get caught up and get upset at Bush or whatever but he's just a
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:40.840]  puppet well said Michael let me get Bob Shatman's take on your point Bob I
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:49.160]  agree and and I also agree that this package was just nothing but fair
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:54.560]  mongering and we've got to get the right people elected Florida looks like it's
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:59.800]  on the right track with Rubino and I mentioned that because you're from there
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:06.920]  and I think that all the states have got to work very very hard about getting
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.440]  themselves solvent how they're going to do that I don't know but they're gonna
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:15.960]  have to otherwise they're gonna have to lay off an awful lot of people and so
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:20.440]  but we're all pushing in the right direction we're outraged and if that's
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:26.680]  what it took to get people to listen to what Alex and others have to say then
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:33.040]  that's fine and I think it's gonna end up very very well in the future all right
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:38.360]  say let's talk to Bill in Wisconsin bill you're on the air yeah Alex how you
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:43.120]  been good brother what's up well a couple things and then I do have a
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.920]  question for Bob but first of all we've got a house race here seventh
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:56.200]  congressional district Dave will be retired all right which was a surprise
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:04.960]  but the Republicans are putting up what I believe is a neocon subversive Sean
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:12.840]  Duffy prosecutor from up north Ashland County Democratic area never had any
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:20.560]  opposition he's brought in newt gingrich and you know what newt has done and get
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:28.360]  an aftergap everything else carbon taxes carbon taxes open borders this weekend
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:35.840]  he's bringing in Rudy Giuliani oh boy yeah yeah so a lot of the people here
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:42.800]  are buffalo but there is a candidate running as an independent so if you're
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:49.880]  in the congressional district seventh district in Wisconsin go to gary
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:55.680]  carter.com okay we're almost out of time what's your question for Bob okay my
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:02.920]  question for Bob is Gerald Salenti says we're gonna have a collapse before the
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.760]  end of the year what's your take on that well I'm sorry to inform you that I
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:15.320]  don't think so and Gerald also said that goal was gonna get down to 1250 and I'm
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:18.680]  sorry that he did because that's not where it's headed it's headed the other
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:28.640]  way but you know we have to be very calm and very balanced in our approach to the
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:33.680]  information that we receive and Bob stay there we got to come back finish that
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:37.040]  point we'll take a few more calls but it depends on how you look at it I mean
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:42.160]  we're in a collapse right now with 22% unemployment

[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.840]  Alex Jones okay I want to cram in a few more calls and look at everybody else
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:30.040]  that's holding after Bob leaves this Bob chatting with the international
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:36.680]  forecaster calm Bob finishing up your statement about you know being calm we're
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:40.940]  talking about a further collapse coming down the road but clearly the
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:45.080]  generation of the economy is accelerating I mean I'm not saying Gerald's a
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.920]  hundred percent right but I do see your point go ahead yeah I you know we talked
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.560]  about this before when yourself you thought things were closer than we were
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:01:00.480]  and Paul Craig Roberts and I said look no you got to slow down things take a lot
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:05.040]  longer than you know you anticipate and you find that out by being around as
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:10.640]  long as we have and I'm always as old as he is but the point here is that it's
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:15.680]  coming yes it is get prepared we don't know what the timing is but it doesn't
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.200]  make any difference if we're prepared well as Robert says I mean as Robert
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.120]  says there was a lot of wealth in this country and in Europe it takes time for
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.760]  that to drain out that's right all right let's go to Chris absolutely let's go
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:34.040]  to Chris in California Chris you're on the air with Bob Chapman go ahead hey Bob
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:37.520]  hi looks a lot of long-time listener and prison planet prison planet
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.040]  subscriber and I respect both of you guys quite a bit I just wanted to I'm
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:46.560]  calling from LA by the way your favorite city Alex I just wanted to bring up with
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:52.600]  Bob kind of a similar question I mean we we've kind of gone through we've been
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.560]  going through this gradual crash for quite a while do you think that it's
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:00.920]  possible that the globalist could just you know have maybe lost control
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.760]  completely at some point maybe some kind of outside force or outside event
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:08.720]  causes a maybe a flashpoint maybe that's what so I'm talking about happening
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:13.320]  before the end of the year and my second question is kind of for both of you
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:16.640]  could you discuss a little bit more about this lame duck session coming up I
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.320]  tend to think that it could be actually hugely significant because a route is
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:26.080]  what it may be be that might be exactly what the globalist want a route of the
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.880]  Democrats because what better fodder with what would there be for the the
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:39.560]  Democrats to now have you know an opportunity or a incentive to be
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.960]  bribed or you know cashed out as they're basically walking away oh yeah
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:47.040]  the lame ducks very dangerous Chris thanks for the call let me get a quick
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:51.200]  comment from Bob Chapman on that Bob well the latter part about the lame duck
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:57.080]  session is extremely extremely dangerous and boy we got to climb all over
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:01.280]  people and to think some people who are going to be voted out we can't climb on
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:05.120]  because they just don't care and these people who are behind the scenes have
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:09.640]  paid them and said look we paid you off you got to do this so it is dangerous
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:15.280]  well Bob also remember Obama and he's still gonna have the US attorneys and
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:19.680]  the Justice Department you watch they are gonna be trying to set up and frame
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:25.880]  and go after all these new members of Congress that's correct as well and you
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:31.760]  know the projection projection of what's going to happen is that the shape
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:37.120]  it's going to come in we often don't know until we get rather close but we
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:45.200]  know it's coming and again it's all preparation even handed even minded we

[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:27.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:32.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:35.960]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:20.080]  preface this for a few minutes before we go to it but i've heard the audio
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:24.840]  clips online of him on national television national radio regional radio i
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:31.200]  love his spirit i love his courage and he's kevin bracken president of the
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:35.000]  victorian trades hall council one of the most powerful unions in the country
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.360]  sits on government boards the prime minister and others have demonized him
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.400]  in australia they've tried to tell him to basically shut up other members of
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:46.560]  parliament have called for him to be censured or to get in trouble for his
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:50.520]  free speech and the nation has stood up and said even if some people disagree
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:54.320]  with him which is really the minority he says 5050 that's what the polls show the
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:58.320]  newspaper polls show over 70 percent agree with him about 9-11 stinking to
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:04.840]  high heaven but even if you disagree with him he's got his right to common law
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:11.240]  free speech but i want to preface this was some new breaking news last year
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:15.280]  governor ridge the former head of homeland security wrote a book and
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.040]  admitted what we'd already gotten from the white house that bush would issue
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:23.000]  fake terror alerts ahead of elections the off-year elections and the
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.640]  presidential election of 04 that is an act of terrorism to issue fake terror
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:32.680]  alerts we know anwar al-alaki the number one in al-qaeda number three and set
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:38.480]  nine years ago fox news ap roiders it's now been leaked was meeting in secret

[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.080]  or a new 9-11 obama is over and the whole agenda is over we must have terror
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:11.880]  attacks so the president can look strong and look powerful i'm paraphrasing the
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:15.400]  quote we've read it many times on air fact i'm a pull back up that financial
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:18.960]  times of london headline and the present planet headline that has the quote
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.800]  what's his name robertson perot or clinton advisor says obama needs stage
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.800]  terror that'll pull it up i need that quote i forgot to ask you guys i want
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.720]  to read the actual quote before our guest leaves us he's with us for another
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.360]  fifty minutes and i'm moving quick because this is so important now this
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:39.680]  morning about four hours ago they started announcing multiple planes on the
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:48.440]  tarmac bombs from yemen oh my gosh we're all dead ups delivery trucks being
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:56.280]  stopped in areas of new york queens long island hysteria over backpacks at

[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:04.560]  mongering and i noticed they had former governor keating who covered up the
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:08.000]  oklahoma city event and others on saying well even if this doesn't turn out to be
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.160]  real it shows how we're trying to save you and how al-qaeda wants to hit us and
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:18.040]  i said when we started the show two hours before this came out it's now on

[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:40.720]  no explosive residue now that i said first hour the white house is behind
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:46.520]  this not a 99% chance ahead of the election in three days to demonize
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:52.680]  people and to demonize opposition against the war and to make himself look
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:57.640]  like a strong leader and they may stage other stuff now it's admitted no bomb
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:02.600]  residue completely made up and there's a statement by the white house press

[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:20.280]  transit united states based on those cooperating among u.s. government
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.080]  agencies with our foreign allies and partners authorities were able to
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:29.520]  identify and examine due suspicious packages one in east midlands united
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.360]  kingdom and the other from dubai both these packages originated from yemen as
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.040]  a result security precautions triggered this threat and additional measures were
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:40.680]  taken regarding the flights at newark liberty and philadelphia international
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:44.960]  airports the president was notified of potential terror threat on thursday
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:48.840]  night by john brennan assistant to the president of homeland security counter
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:52.760]  terrorism the president directed u.s. intelligence and law enforcement
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:56.640]  agencies and the department of homeland security takes steps to ensure the
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:00.080]  safety and security of the american people and determine whether these
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.640]  threats as part of an additional terrorism plotting the president will
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.600]  receive regular updates from the national security team he has alerted to
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:11.560]  the threat this was issued just about 30 minutes ago so they knew when they
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.880]  swiped it and tested it for bombs takes about 10 seconds that there was no
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:18.800]  explosives in the printer cartridge that we pull a printer cartridge out of a
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:22.560]  printer and will show people what causes you know lockdowns on the east coast
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:26.200]  but pulling out i want to show it to people they have this evil devil weapon
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:30.440]  now here's the financial times of london obama faces growing credibility crisis
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:36.200]  and we're going to our guest and he's quoted in here is saying quote the
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.280]  bottom line here is that americans don't believe in president obama's
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.800]  leadership says robert Shapiro clinton official in an obama supporter he also
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:48.080]  advises him quote he has to find some way between now and november of
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:51.880]  demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.720]  nine eleven event or an oklahoma city bombing i can't think of how he could
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:04.600]  do that now that was in july 13th 2010 three months ago i take you now to
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:08.200]  australia to a great patriot i'm going to read some of his quotes coming up
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:14.680]  later of kevin bracken president of the victorian trades hall council and the
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.240]  vthc is the coordination of union activities and campaigns with a union
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:23.160]  and it goes on he also sits on some government boards and the issue here
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.800]  is he's gone public for nine eleven truth he's an engineer trades hall
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:31.840]  president kevin bracken stands by his nine eleven conspiracy he was demonized
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:36.080]  and here is quotes when he was demonized on national media when he got a chance
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.480]  to respond he said unfortunately cowards like yourself have set the political
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:45.240]  agenda in this country for too long said kevin bracken i won't be cowered down
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:49.960]  to bullies like yourself and he just went through the control demolition
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:55.080]  information uh... and the prime minister is blasting many have called for him to
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.320]  get in trouble for his free speech joining us we got a lot of listeners
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.240]  australia as well in the internet satellite is kevin bracken a great
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:08.080]  patriot uh... they're in australia sir great to have you on
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.240]  excelance it's great to be on
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:12.160]  but i'm going to clarify this
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:14.400]  when i'm speaking on this i'm saying this
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.040]  uh... i've been asked to say this is my opinion we're going to take
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:20.440]  uh... these things back to our members
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:23.400]  and make sure that's fully recognized by them
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:26.600]  because a lot of people wanted to distance themselves and
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.080]  discussed it with the uh... victorian trades hall council and my own union the
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:31.320]  maritime union
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.000]  i'm letting everyone know that it's my
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.880]  these are my statements but
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:39.160]  they will be going to have a resolution from our union and it was taken to
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.480]  trade hall
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:43.960]  and it was a resolution that was passed it said we condemned the terrorist attacks
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.080]  tragic terrorist attacks of september 11th 2001
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:51.000]  they've been used to start two preemptive wars
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.720]  and the tax civil liberties
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:55.640]  and our legal principles which have been the core of starting civilized
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:56.560]  communities
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:15:58.960]  there's an urgent need to go back and reassess away
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:03.080]  uh... we've viewed the world after september 11th and we call for another
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:05.160]  proper independent inquiry
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.400]  into the terrorist attacks of that day
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.640]  so that was a resolution which was passed by trades hall council
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:12.000]  uh... but
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.880]  so that means your members have have have have have basically uh... that voted
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:16.560]  for that
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.800]  you're speaking as independent citizen
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:22.120]  uh... but but uh... i mean the resolution that was passed by the
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:25.560]  trades hall council which is the uh... supreme decision-making body of the
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:26.840]  trades hall
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.560]  so this is the group over all the major unions and they've basically
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:32.760]  then at least those that voted in the majority
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:35.080]  they have signed sealed and delivered
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:38.320]  and and and and and and and basically back to you
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.480]  well that was that was done in two days and eight
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:41.840]  yes so
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:45.320]  but uh... you've already spoken out as early as two thousand six right
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:46.200]  yeah yeah
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:47.560]  what was a bit suspicious
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.400]  but from the start and as you were talking about
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:51.880]  uh... really want to be at the bottom of the terror threat
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:54.640]  but with the george bush he had a twenty percent approval rating before
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:55.680]  september 11
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:59.200]  and after september 11th he had an eighty percent approval rating
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.520]  but we just hope that there is another terror event that people are enough people
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:03.960]  to watch it but
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:07.320]  to have a look at what's really happened
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:08.680]  uh...
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:12.560]  you talk about fifty percent of the public agreeing with you polls actually
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:14.600]  are showing seventy percent
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:18.440]  of australians questioning the attack quantify your statement of fifty percent
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:19.520]  back you
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:23.040]  well at this at the time that was accurate because after that there was a
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:24.340]  bit of a
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:26.840]  the creator that went right around the world actually
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:27.920]  and uh...
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:28.800]  the herald sun
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.080]  which is a
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:31.400]  uh... newspaper
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:33.040]  put a poll out
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:36.680]  do you um... think the comments made by kevin brack and reasonable
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.240]  and what's now seventy six percent support me
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:40.800]  and twenty three percent
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:42.920]  so it wasn't reasonable
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.920]  there's a big majority of people now but at the time when i spoke to them
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.800]  i want john fein on the phone
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:50.520]  it was about fifty fifty
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:52.640]  now it's seventy six to twenty three
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.120]  point something
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.560]  amazing uh...
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:00.880]  why did you as an engineer first begin to question the official story
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:03.280]  but i'll clarify this to a lot of engineer
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:04.540]  i'm actually a dot worker
[02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:07.120]  who um... stood for a position
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:07.800]  might
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:13.400]  okay well the newspaper says you're an engineer so i apologize
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:14.160]  uh...
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:17.160]  but what happened there was a debate about the war in afghanistan out of
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.440]  Australia's involvement in the war in afghanistan
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:24.400]  but they've and um... the day before there was a press release put out by paul mason
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.880]  who's a structural engineer he's been a structural engineer for thirty six years
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.440]  and he said you can't have a debate about
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:32.120]  Australia's involvement in afghanistan unless you go back and have a look at
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:33.280]  september eleven
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:35.720]  and that was done as a press release on top of that
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:36.600]  i pressed
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:37.840]  reply to all
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.240]  and i said that's right there are many unanswered questions about september eleven
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:42.520]  for example
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:43.120]  did it
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:43.840]  you know
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:46.760]  four planes hijacked for an hour and twenty minutes and no planes
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.880]  no u.s. air force
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:51.800]  uh... force but i think that's it but which is a good thing that protocols
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:54.360]  and i don't know that i think that i said there's a resolution from the
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:57.920]  victorian trials or council of the marathons in australia victoria bridge
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.960]  called for another inquiry
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:04.640]  john fein sent me an email back who's the presenter of the program
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:06.920]  and said we say it on the other day i said you just give me the time in a
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:08.000]  number to call
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:08.800]  and so
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:10.400]  you know when i did make a phone call
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:11.360]  he says
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:13.200]  uh... who are you hang on
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:16.360]  as if i just called at the boat
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:18.640]  so being disingenuous
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.360]  yeah well it's almost done the truth
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:23.680]  you know i have
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:25.240]  richard gauge actually came out

[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:29.000]  a meeting at the victorian trials or council
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.400]  i did a presentation from
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:32.360]  uh...
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:33.840]  and i think you know
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:34.320]  you could

[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:12.520]  Trades Hall Council the last two weeks has been one of the biggest stories in
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:17.840]  Australia and it's been in the news here as they tried to demonizing they they
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:20.480]  knew his opinion they wanted to you and I talked to him in the break he agrees
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:24.520]  they wanted to politically try to score points against the political party he's
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:28.240]  affiliated with and unions so they said come on as a guest and they acted like
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:33.560]  he just called in but I I said looks to me Kevin like this is backfired and he
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:38.680]  agreed so in your own words break down kind of how this unfolded and then we'll
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:43.880]  look at 9-11 itself and the attack on your free speech but please continue
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:54.720]  well as I said there was a debate on Afghanistan there was a press release
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.680]  released by a structural engineer from Melbourne replied to press release John
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:00.920]  Fein emailed back to me and said would you say it on air I said no I was giving
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:05.600]  a number at the time I started talking and then he said hang on who are you
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:11.480]  where are you from so yeah but actually I stuck to what the fact is and that is
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:16.400]  that the official story doesn't stand up to scientific scrutiny and yeah I was
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:21.080]  ridiculed throughout that the next day I'll ring him back again and he says oh
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:24.960]  I'm on the horns of a dilemma here he said yesterday a man rang up he later
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:28.320]  identified himself as the president of Victorian Tribal Council on Secretary
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:32.120]  of Maritime Union he came out with outrageous statements he's been ridiculed
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:36.680]  all over the world including in the parliament by the Prime Minister and
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.000]  he's come on for another whacking around the years and I said we'll first of all John
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.920]  thank you for inviting me on the program he goes like this by John I said yes
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.720]  he did I said let's put out a press release you replied back to me I've got
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.920]  the email give me the number and the time to ring back and it said exactly who I
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:58.240]  was on the YARM email so yeah I was quite happy with the way the it went out
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:04.240]  and as I said before later on earlier on there is 76% of the people in the
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:08.720]  poll that was taken by the YARM arriving newspaper here supporting what I
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:15.200]  said and they don't like that do they so I thought the eyes of it was there
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:20.160]  put out there to ridicule you know myself in years and actually backfire on it
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:23.640]  and I've had you know tremendous support from people I've seen and I've been
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.240]  flooded with emails you know with people saying congratulations for
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:33.240]  speaking up but I've sort of been on it for a long time so yeah now now my the
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:37.640]  break interrupted you you were trying to talk about Richard Gage the head of now
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:42.160]  over 1200 architects and engineers who have exposed the official story as
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:48.360]  defying the laws of physics and Newton Isaac Newton but you got interrupted
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:52.880]  there finish up your point about Richard Gage coming Richard Gage gave a
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:27:00.520]  presentation at the Victorian Trails Old Council and told us all about exactly
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:06.280]  the science behind 9-11 so it was it was very convincing and so we've been
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:15.240]  distributing you know email that is our blueprint for truth and that's he had the
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:20.440]  support of a number of structural engineers from Melbourne so on the back
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:25.680]  of that we replied and I sent out the press release so but if you have a look
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:29.160]  at it there was it and some of the emails I've got back have been fantastic
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:32.600]  they're estimating that there's been eight million people killed because of
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:36.240]  September 11 now you know there's a three thousand you know nearly three
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:40.880]  thousand originally you know but there's all the people from Iraq Afghanistan
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:45.360]  there's all the people who've been killed through the the flooding of opium you
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:53.840]  know since you know but America and Australia had invaded Afghanistan
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:57.280]  where they'd stopped the production of opium and now the places are washed with
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:02.240]  it so unless we actually speak up about it this is going to keep going on and
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:05.480]  they've already said if you read that blueprint for the project for a new
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:09.120]  American century the wars will not end in our lifetime you know their tax on
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:13.520]  civil liberties have started but they didn't actually start with September 11
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:18.240]  we actually had them before we had the Olympic Games in Melbourne the year
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:23.600]  before September 11 and it was true to kill legislation came coming that was
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:27.600]  going to have a three-year sunset clause and guess what it's still in in this
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:32.720]  country so you know it wasn't the start of it it was happy things were
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:36.480]  happening before but it's a catalyst for the acceleration of it you know we've
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:41.320]  got ridiculous laws in this country now which I mean it was actually state that
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.200]  people can be charged for possession of a thing well I remember the shoot to kill
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:49.640]  orders and now they're still I see headlines out of Australia where it
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:54.320]  says protesters can be shot for no reason I mean they just say if they want
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:57.880]  to kill you they can just shoot you that's right and they can't there's no
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:01.400]  room they can't be charged with anything if the order of the police or the
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:06.760]  army they shoot our own citizens they can't be charged there was only who said
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:12.800]  I work just bring it in for the for the Olympic Games but actually I can just say
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:17.480]  something about this Alex is it one year before September 11 there was a
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:22.800]  World Economic Forum in Melbourne and there was a protest that was organized
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:29.400]  it was called the S11 protest and it was on September 11, 2000 and the
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.800]  World Economic Forum met at a crime casino here in Melbourne. Stay there stay

[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:13.320]  finish up his point that he was just making about an event the year before

[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:45.520]  interrupted by the break you've got the floor on that issue any other points you
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:49.600]  want to make that I've got some questions it was the S11 protest which is
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.800]  was against the World Economic Forum that was a very peaceful protest the first
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:58.040]  day we successfully stopped all nearly every all the participants from
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:01.480]  getting in there on the second day they put pressure on the Victorian government
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.840]  and I am allowed they said to go ahead and give me the green light to attack
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:11.480]  the protesters so yeah there's a tax on them and then since then they've been
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:17.360]  paid compensation because of you know it was illegally done but it was just when
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:21.560]  it happened on September 11th you know the next year you know it just thought
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:24.920]  this is strange so we started going through and there's a timeline you know
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.120]  about a month later start to get put together about true movements you know
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:33.280]  before Afghanistan and hello you know those pre-position before September 11
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.400]  actually happened and then it becomes suspicious I started emailing information
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:41.760]  around to people and anyway I sent it around next thing I pressed off a little
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:45.960]  look at see what I've sent here when I pressed it all this pornography started
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:49.800]  coming up and so actually you know it's stopped actually stopped doing it for a
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:54.480]  while because I thought she said I want that to go here you know as if as if you
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:37:00.080]  know that stuff I'd never ever look better and I don't do it but yeah I
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:03.600]  thought she's only going to send out this so I was shut down you know from
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:06.880]  actually now share any information around and it's been there's a number of ways
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.760]  that you know people use it have shut people down so but the good thing is
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:16.200]  I'm so happy that the stories actually got it got out now you know people I
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:24.000]  was listening to it and starting to ask questions for themselves now other
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.200]  points other issues that you want to talk about before I get to my
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:38.160]  questions yep I suppose it's not only um it's so far reaching the effects of the
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:41.960]  September 11 that effect has had on our place for start at our work you know
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:45.800]  going to work on the wall now is what you know going to prison I mean you've got
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:50.040]  swath cards you know you've got a maritime security identity card if you
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.640]  don't get if you haven't got a maritime security card you can't work on the
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:57.520]  wall for you can't go work on a ship you can't work in the offshore oil and gas
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:02.400]  industry you know but so far so well because it's so far as you know from
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.680]  overseas they're actually in there I wouldn't know where they're from so I
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:11.200]  think they've just introduced another 190 crimes which were gonna stop people
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:16.040]  from having an MC card so I was about to say it's the same it's the same model
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:20.360]  worldwide where this cashless grid they're now seeing if you have bad credit
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:22.840]  they're not going to let you have a security clearance and they're going
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.040]  to basically make almost all jobs be under this infrastructure protection so
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.760]  this is a new form of tyranny to decide who can have jobs and who can't exactly
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:36.160]  right and at first of what starts about terror in ideal they've got we've got
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:39.440]  legislation in this country with the Australian Building Control Commission
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.000]  which actually is similar you know if people no longer have the right to
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:46.520]  remain silent if they're brought up they were going to build inside if they
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:51.280]  don't tell the the Australian Building Control Commission then they actually
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.040]  face a six month jail term so it's actually takes away from you the right
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:00.160]  to remain silent in this country so it starts off first is against terrorism
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:03.480]  and then it's against building workers and it's against biking gangs then it's
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:07.840]  against the next thing they'll say oh why do we have what do we let criminals
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:12.160]  go out like this so everyone will be guilty without even being charged you know
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:15.680]  the whole basis that you know you innocent until proven guilty has been
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.080]  turned on anybody's legislation what we need to go back and have a look at is
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.280]  that September 11 was a crime it was mass murder why hasn't one person been
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:31.360]  charged with with that and remember if there was 19 people on those planes it
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:36.160]  would be at least 300 people you know backing up to support them why isn't one
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:40.480]  of those persons being charged you know and if you have a look at the 9-11
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:45.280]  you know commission it was a it was a fast you know and there's an urgent need
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.400]  to actually have another another look because if we do that then we could
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:51.760]  probably have a look at what we're doing in Afghanistan what we're doing in
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:55.880]  Iraq that's not about liberating people it's about corporate control you know
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:59.320]  innocent Australian people getting killed the people in Afghanistan and
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:04.400]  American you know people if you were going to send out young people off to
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:07.680]  work and you ask them to put their life on the line you want to make sure you've
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:11.960]  got bloody good reasons to do it and those that hasn't been done so you know
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:16.880]  what's there a number of things to be fixed up you know if we start operating
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.240]  on truthful principles then everything will be alright well absolutely if we
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.440]  start operating on the lie no good's gonna come up but well they don't need to
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:29.760]  call for an urgent inquiry back into September 11 and let's find out who
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:33.520]  really did it and let's actually bring justice to bear on them and let's
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:39.560]  conduct a young conductor without fuel favor it's whoever it takes you know well
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:43.720]  very well said and and what's happening in England the continent of Europe
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:50.080]  Australia New Zealand Mexico the US it doesn't matter everywhere where we get
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:54.280]  the internal documents in England in Australia in the United States and
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:41:00.600]  law enforcement sends them to us 95% of the Homeland Security or Security
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:05.920]  Service training has nothing to do with foreign Muslims it's all about gun owners
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:14.480]  property rights activists farms ranches could I live in this pardon me trade
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:19.080]  you in this absolutely about that it stops you know organize it stops the
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:23.480]  all the ability to organize you know we can't get on the job half the time now
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:27.160]  because we're gonna go through the security protocols you know so it's not
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:32.200]  just you know it's anyone from operating independent and it's to take
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:36.160]  pay away from people and actually give it to you know big business and you know
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:41.280]  corporations and government absolutely it's their pretext to take over society
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:45.760]  and it's aimed at anyone who wants to be independent and free this is the
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.720]  shadowy terror enemy that can never be defeated never can be identified and
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.800]  now they're saying here in the US it's gun owners it's returning veterans it's
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.200]  people that are against big government it's people that are against police
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:02.440]  state that we're the number one terror threat I mean this is so transparent so
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:07.360]  people say oh 9-eleven's nine years ago why do you care because 9-eleven has been
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.400]  used as the foundational event to totally take our free societies and turn
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:18.240]  them into nightmare police states exactly right so you know unless the ball
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:22.360]  we could go along with this you know it's gonna get worse and worse so I was
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:26.920]  saluting he said he was supposed to be the first fascist leader he said I
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:30.760]  prefer not to call it that fascism or prefers to call it corporatism it's the
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:34.920]  merger of the state and the corporation we'll have a look what's happening now
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:39.400]  people are gonna wake up to it well we appreciate your courage I want to get
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:44.200]  into some of my questions now specifically for you there's a quote here
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.520]  where you got back on his radio show with your right to respond because he'd
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:53.000]  been demonizing you and you expose the host you know because you had his email
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.240]  that he'd invited you on before and then acted like you just called in just
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:43:02.040]  showing the deception and mr. Bracken stood by his comments and said he had
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:06.040]  the support of 50% of the community he also attacked feign claiming he was
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:10.120]  ridiculed on yesterday's program here's your quote unfortunately and I love it
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:13.720]  unfortunately cowards like yourself have set the political agenda in this
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:20.200]  country for too long said Kevin Bracken I won't be cowered down to bullies like
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:24.680]  yourself and the fact is you stood up to him you didn't care about the
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:29.440]  demonization when the prime minister here's the sitting morning herald p.m.
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:34.080]  blast stupid 9-11 conspiracy comment there's quotes here by members of your
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.680]  parliament calling for you to be shut up or for you to get in trouble for your
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.360]  speech and they really showed people the naked tyranny that they want to try to
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:49.400]  bring in can you speak to that yeah well actually I'm a member of the ALP which
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:57.400]  is a party you know that they are duly good I represents so and it's not this
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:02.800]  is about not questioning it in Australia this hasn't got any oxygen at all you
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:06.200]  know so that's why I'm so happy that actually the news was coming up even
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:10.360]  though I didn't mind being really good because you know what I'm saying is
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:15.560]  right and actually everyone wanted to interview me that night since then not
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.480]  one person's grown up when the polls started to say on that they supported
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:24.280]  me I haven't had one offer from the mainstream media to speak the only
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:30.000]  time I've spoken it's on a podcast and there's a good one there's John Bursall
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.720]  he's been doing a lot he's a an aircraft engineer from Sydney he's got
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:41.760]  the visibility 9-11.com there's a podcast I've done on there and 9-11 isosid.com
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:46.080]  so there's another one too which John's been very active about he's probably
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:49.960]  been the number one person that's kept this kept this going too so to be clear
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:54.720]  they coaxed you on to the air thinking they were going to be able to demonize
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:58.960]  9-11 truth it blew up in their face but for the first day or two they didn't
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:02.200]  know that so they were really trying to hype it but as soon as they saw the
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:07.120]  public agreed with you you know 70 plus percent they panicked and they're hoping
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:11.320]  this goes away showing the power we have in continuing to raise this issue
[02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:15.000]  we've just got to speak up that's all there is you know and I congratulate all
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.040]  the people who have done it hard over the years you know going out on the street
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:23.120]  hand out to DVDs you know that works actually taking benefit now enough
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.400]  people sort of have questioned it and most of the people I see give me
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:30.800]  tremendous support and said good on you for you know for doing it a lot of
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:35.120]  people don't believe you know that's what I've said but what was what they do
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:38.920]  say is wrong is you know hell was just ridiculed they're not once did he
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:42.800]  engage in a debate on the subject but just tried to ridicule me and that's
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:46.960]  been a modus operandi you know to get whatever whatever agenda they want to
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:49.840]  get up in this country there's a shock jocks and I suppose you've got them
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:55.240]  over there in the USA and you know they set the news agenda for the day in the
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.800]  country you know whatever they people unfortunately don't think for themselves
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.680]  you know as I said people have been treated like sheep but that doesn't mean
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:07.240]  you have to actually behave like cheap now we've got the we've got our own you
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.120]  know our own reason you know we have to use those powers of reason you know to
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:15.760]  find out you know what's really going on but but the picture we've been painted
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:20.280]  down isn't actually the way the world operates yes well to Kevin you know 70
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:23.840]  plus percent agreeing with you and in this major poll and in other polls the
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:28.160]  vast majority it shows though that really people aren't sheep except they
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:32.440]  still feel like they're the minority or alone when we are the majority the polls
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:35.960]  show it here they show it in your country we're just not connecting to each
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:40.040]  other because the dominant corporate media tries to make us feel like we're
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:47.120]  isolated and on our own exactly right so yeah I'm actually been really heartened
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:51.080]  with all the support messages supported I've had through emails also just people
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:54.960]  I've been in the street to who said you know good on you for speaking up I think
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:59.000]  people are wholeheartedly see you know with the we've got a two-party system
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:03.440]  in this country which is a bit of a fast you know it's they have policies which
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:07.560]  really aren't any different than the other one now I think in Australia and
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.200]  we become you know women there's over to economic rationalism in the 80s you know
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.360]  they started you know closing down all these things which were set up which
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.320]  were actually very good and my father said I don't know what they've got to shut
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:22.080]  them down I said that they've got to do it because they've got no money he said
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.960]  don't tell me about that he said I grew up kids there was no money around for
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:30.400]  there wasn't enough food for people to eat kids had no shoes he said we'll
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:33.920]  like that until the Second World War started when the Second World War started
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:37.360]  80 out of 10 people were working for the government and after six years of that
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:39.960]  we ended up one of the strongest economies in the world he said don't
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:44.080]  worry about the money they find it when they want to and he's exactly right now
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:49.440]  a few final questions for you when we've got a final segment coming up but
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:53.400]  specifically I remember the Sydney Morning Herald headline and others a year
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:59.760]  ago Australia to implement Chinese style net censorship in fact search that guys
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:03.800]  I want to show people that headline Australia to implement Chinese style
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:08.400]  net censorship and they said we're gonna shut down tens of thousands of sites
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:12.080]  you won't be able to get access to them then they tested it for about a month
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:16.880]  most people in Australia couldn't get info wars.com or prisonplanet.com
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:21.240]  people in New Zealand couldn't the ISPs were doing it without the law even
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:25.800]  passing but the Aussies and the Kiwis stood up and said no and they backed
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:29.920]  off but that's an illustration of the attack on free speech they know we're
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:33.600]  starting to get organized it scares them so they're trying to and they were
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:38.440]  even putting dental offices on the list that people couldn't get to their
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.240]  website just any list they want to put you on I've got a article out of New
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:48.520]  York where somebody that protested was put on the terror list somebody that
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:53.840]  took photos of cops was put on the terror list so so can you speak to the
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:49:00.360]  moves for Australian style Chinese net censorship yeah first of all you know
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:04.200]  they start off for you know if I make an outlook it's a good thing because you
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:06.880]  know they're gonna stop patrol pornography which is you know is a good
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:12.320]  thing be great if they shut that down but once then they say right now as you
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:18.680]  said they'll shut down sites like 9-11 proof and yeah once you can't give them
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:23.440]  the control of that because if they have got out by censorship you know
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:26.760]  especially on the net and that's one of the this story's got out because of the
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:31.080]  net and actually Facebook I don't go on Facebook but I know a really young
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:35.600]  people I know but actually just the places this story sort of really spread
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:40.000]  and I got support through Facebook and things like that so they actually operate
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.360]  it really opens up another agenda you know another opportunity for people to
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:50.960]  circumvent you know the corporate news and speak freely to each other so yeah
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:54.400]  well they always there's always a good reason you know when they bring things
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:58.320]  in in the first place you know they say I was to stop patrol child pornography
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:03.080]  which is great you know they want to have that filter around but then it gets
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:08.920]  used to actually censor people and censor actually views and opinions so it's a
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:13.160]  scary proposition that's not supported by the Australian people either well
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:16.320]  that's the good news is they're trying to shut people down but it's not working
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:20.640]  yep that's right and first off you know before they do anything you know they
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.520]  do things which are a problem people find the problem you know and I've got it
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:29.240]  but actually they use that as an agenda you know to actually stop down shut
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:34.400]  down a lot of other things too so yeah no the censorship but then that isn't
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:38.440]  supported well actually you know this story got out so well because we've
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:42.360]  got you know the internet and we have got Facebook and things like that so even
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:45.480]  though I've never gone on Facebook because I believe it's a massive you
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:50.400]  know information mining exercise it is sir stay there final segment final points
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:55.280]  from Kevin Bracken we should have our Obama issues fake terror alert article

[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:14.240]  we're gonna find out from him in a moment but search the term fake terror
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.960]  ladies and gentlemen Kevin Bracken any other points you'd like to make here
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:22.400]  I just want to salute you for what you've done and you told me you are aware
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:26.240]  of infall wars and prison planet when's the first time you saw those sites
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:36.480]  probably your be a few years ago now so yeah I think there was a BVD and
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:43.760]  actually from then I went on to the website so I saw the BVD first
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:51.120]  um it was a it was dying just trying to think what was the BVD produced Alex
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:55.920]  well I produced loose change final cut but I also put yeah it was after loose
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:59.680]  change I saw that uh true truth rising
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:03.680]  truth rising might have been one of them so yeah but can we
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:07.600]  know it's good work yourself that people are aware starting to wake up now
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:11.280]  you know what's going on Alex and I think I don't know whether I made the point
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:15.680]  I started speaking about early about the process it was a year before
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:20.000]  September 11th it was called the Acyton protest the um
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.560]  Channel 9 reporter got a award for it and made it look like World War 3
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:28.400]  now it was totally not the way at all it was a very peaceful protest the only
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:31.520]  time there was any violence was in the police you know bash the you know
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:37.200]  broker pick a line open um so they made it look like um a very
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:40.240]  violent protest and any time there's people protesting about the other
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:44.160]  corporates happening this corporate there's always the violent protest of
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:46.720]  the violent protest there's a G20 meeting in
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:51.760]  Seoul later in November um and that'll be no dear
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:55.120]  they'll play up as violent protesters but I'll be it the protesters don't do
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:58.640]  any violence it'll be the police and actually um army you know who are
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:01.920]  there who do all the violence and actually blame it on the other side
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:05.120]  so while they keep doing that they take the focus away with what they're
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:07.760]  actually doing in there you know they're all going away just speaking up the
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:11.200]  world about turning every every human
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:15.840]  activity into a financial transaction so you know people got to speak up about
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:18.880]  it you know we want to if we want a um better
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:21.360]  world you know we've got to actually be
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:25.120]  participants in life you know and make sure that we don't allow these people
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:28.560]  to take things away from us and we actually you know we can make the
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:31.840]  build a better place and we can do you know without weapons
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:35.680]  without violence without hatred we just need to actually be informed on what's
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:38.640]  going on and actually be prepared to do something about it
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:41.840]  well kevin bracken amen to that and we support you and
