[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:35.200]  Texas Alex Jones well it's like Dave Jean Vu all over again it was 24 hours ago
[00:35.200 --> 00:40.000]  then I kicked off the last broadcast here and I said man I got a lot of news
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.200]  it's also incredibly important I got to calm down and try to go over all this
[00:44.200 --> 00:50.720]  piece by piece today and I'd say I got a c-minus on getting to everything
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.680]  barely a passing grade I must get an a-plus today or at least you know I'll
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.240]  try as best I can the problem is I get so outraged as I go back through the
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.880]  news and information that it's really hard to keep my composure going because
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.280]  ladies and gentlemen I am in the cockpit of the B-52 bomber with my crew
[01:11.280 --> 01:20.640]  loaded with 100 megaton hydrogen truth weapons logic bombs in over globalist
[01:20.640 --> 01:28.920]  controlled areas dropping just just just massive 100 megaton bombs of awakening
[01:28.920 --> 01:35.400]  and enlightenment and truth on people and the enemy the enemy is absolutely
[01:35.400 --> 01:40.920]  flipping out across the board I don't even have time to track it but I mean
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.880]  there's got to be 15 news articles a day and newspapers and TV in places just
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.840]  absolutely lying and misrepresenting what we do what we say and I expect that
[01:50.840 --> 01:55.760]  because I'm in this to win it I'm in this to try to find the levers to awaken
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.840]  humanity to try to turn the tide against tyranny before it gets really bad
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.880]  because I live here just like you do and I'm in it to win it I'm committed to
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.760]  this 110% in fact it's exhilarating to be in this much political and physical
[02:09.760 --> 02:12.960]  danger and I'm not a thrill-seeker overall but I'm doing this for the right
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.680]  reasons and my body my intellect my gut is saying good job buddy and I know many
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.480]  of you that fight for basic liberty have that same feeling as well I mean this is
[02:23.480 --> 02:26.840]  really living ladies and gentlemen when you've got the White House attacking you
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.200]  when you've got MSNBC absolutely slandering and libeling and trying to
[02:32.200 --> 02:37.720]  damage us this is what it's all about now that does not mean that I'm not going
[02:37.720 --> 02:44.480]  to strike back because I've got to the the premeditated defamation reached a
[02:44.480 --> 02:48.120]  level yesterday I saw this yesterday evening we had time to put it on the
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.920]  nightly news that was staggering they basically say I influence the Boston
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.880]  bombers who basically are pats easy as everyone knows I mean even Glenn Beck is
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.040]  saying that I mean it's just overwhelming evidence and then they go on to
[03:06.040 --> 03:12.240]  say I'm deeply racist and then I'm paid to be racist the panel agrees including
[03:12.240 --> 03:17.400]  the former head of the RNC who just three years ago had to resign because of
[03:17.400 --> 03:24.120]  MSNBC showing how he spent $2,000 a pop on bondage bondage mistresses or
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.520]  whatever or bondage parties and I guess if you keep you can't beat them join them
[03:28.520 --> 03:35.200]  I mean you know I just can't I just unbelievable that this type of stuff is
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.120]  going on and I'm not even judging steel that he likes to you know go see women
[03:40.120 --> 03:43.720]  rest up in the leather with bull laps and stuff and teach their own but the
[03:43.720 --> 03:50.240]  point here is that he's lying about me so so steel and it's clearly all scripted
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.920]  100% scripted as they go to the line almost like in the the Superman 2 where
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.680]  the council's convicting Zod and his general and his girlfriend and they're
[04:01.680 --> 04:11.280]  saying we will now hear the verdict guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty and then
[04:11.280 --> 04:14.800]  I'm to be sent to the what is it the forbidden zone the Phantom Zone I mean
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.000]  this is unbelievable and so I consider and joke about it it's actually
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  incredibly dangerous because they're openly White House run that's on record
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.880]  and sure they have a diminishing audience and we're seeing the death
[04:25.880 --> 04:30.840]  throws of the collectivist politically but they could still really really pull
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.520]  some rabbits out of a hat so I'm gonna go over all of that today and then a

[08:50.560 --> 08:54.480]  quick interest rate spikes we've been telling you that that is coming we're
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.880]  going to be breaking that down also Egyptian Islamists target Christian
[08:59.880 --> 09:05.320]  churches in a wave of apparently coordinated attacks in Egypt and across
[09:05.320 --> 09:11.520]  the rest of Middle East the the Egyptian military responds by mowing them
[09:11.520 --> 09:16.520]  down because the Al Qaeda group is trying to take over Egypt and our
[09:16.520 --> 09:20.640]  Pentagon and Obama respond by saying we're going to cut off military aid to
[09:20.640 --> 09:25.160]  the Egyptian military and they basically say stand down and let Al Qaeda and the
[09:25.160 --> 09:32.120]  Muslim Brotherhood take over Egypt this is really the setup for World War 3
[09:32.120 --> 09:38.360]  they're trying to have here I mean this is this is off the charts this is even
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.040]  stuff I can't even believe it's so crazy and the average American doesn't even
[09:43.040 --> 09:48.840]  know this is going on that our supposed government is putting the most radical
[09:48.840 --> 09:54.040]  Muslims who have fought US troops all over the world directly into Libya Syria
[09:54.040 --> 09:58.120]  Egypt you name it and are just turning them loose to blow up churches and
[09:58.120 --> 10:02.640]  throw Christians off roofs I see new videos every day for the point I've
[10:02.640 --> 10:06.920]  almost got Christian mass murder fatigue where I'll see a new article by
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.000]  Watson or a new story we've posted on info wars.com or prisonplanet.com and I
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.560]  won't even click on it watching them take Christians up to the edge of a
[10:16.560 --> 10:19.820]  you know five-story building and throw them one after another off to their
[10:19.820 --> 10:27.440]  deaths or hack them up with machetes or blow up churches or go into Catholic
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.120]  churches Orthodox churches ancient churches burn them down blow them up I
[10:32.120 --> 10:39.520]  mean I just can't even look at it anymore and then you turn on MSNBC and
[10:39.520 --> 10:43.560]  it's Obama loves the children Obama loves Africa Obama wants you to have free
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.440]  health care as the premiums go up 50 plus percent as it raises payroll taxes
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.360]  on people making less than $20,000 a year as the economy just shuts down as
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.400]  over 50 million people they're announcing this last year are have
[10:58.400 --> 11:04.920]  already gone on to part time because of Obamacare I mean we're watching the
[11:04.920 --> 11:10.200]  shutdown of America the globalist Scorch shared policy and I just sit here
[11:10.200 --> 11:16.760]  watching it in absolute horror and I want to explain something I know the
[11:16.760 --> 11:22.960]  globalist operations I know how they operate I know what they do but now this
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.560]  is even weirder than I thought they would get this quick I mean this is just so
[11:26.560 --> 11:33.000]  naked and they're having drills and then real operations all over the country
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.480]  where the army just shows up with SWAT teams and sets up checkpoints and
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.120]  starts dragging people out of vehicles and helicopters and are crashing and
[11:41.120 --> 11:45.760]  drills and I've got articles today and and and police are SWAT teaming people
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.240]  over three-inch grass and in Arlington outside Dallas that's in mainstream news
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.560]  and they're SWAT teaming people over unpaid parking tickets and and just black
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.640]  uniforms everywhere they're putting up guard towers I've got news with face
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.280]  scanning cameras everywhere and then admitting that they're preparing for a
[12:05.280 --> 12:13.040]  war I have the state police out of Texas but also the state police out of New
[12:13.040 --> 12:16.680]  Hampshire I've got several of these articles I'm gonna be going over today
[12:16.680 --> 12:23.400]  in the city council meetings and I have a city police chief as well saying we've
[12:23.400 --> 12:29.760]  got to get armored vehicles because we're preparing for war with the Tea Party
[12:29.760 --> 12:35.360]  and libertarians actually shows that and they're being honest about it they're
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.760]  in meetings prepositioning weapons for us I mean and then a Marine Corps colonel
[12:40.760 --> 12:44.280]  recently retired went up and spoke to the council and said look I you know I've
[12:44.280 --> 12:47.960]  been part of this overseas this is the pre-deployment this is a takeover this is
[12:47.960 --> 12:54.240]  illegal that video is up on info wars.com and by the way it is people like
[12:54.240 --> 12:56.880]  him because they've got everybody's number we've got your number by the way
[12:56.880 --> 13:00.920]  globalist who they're going to come and kill with death squads when they try the
[13:00.920 --> 13:07.400]  total coup d'etat takeover and it will follow with a nuke going off in Dallas or
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.240]  Chicago or Austin or Denver by the way I'm listing cities the CFR have said
[13:13.240 --> 13:16.640]  they think Al Qaeda is gonna nuke that means they're gonna nuke and then
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.620]  blame it on their patsies this is an outside corporate takeover and when
[13:20.620 --> 13:25.520]  those nukes go off they're going to blame it on libertarian groups and
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.560]  patriot groups and it'll be so overwhelming the images of people with
[13:29.560 --> 13:32.880]  their eyes burned out from the nuke going off on the edge of the blast and
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.320]  the giant smoking crater and the civil emergency that's announced with all the
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.800]  grid lined up and ready to go up against the American people then even most
[13:40.800 --> 13:44.400]  libertarians and conservatives will say I didn't want to believe it but I guess
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.720]  these talk show hosts were working with them I guess
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.640]  Obama's got to arrest him and at that point folks if you give into it it's
[13:51.640 --> 13:55.200]  going to be a hot takeover and they're gonna end up coming and getting you as
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.400]  well but they're gonna wipe out most the generals most the colonels the retired
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.880]  people they know our patriots next they're gonna wipe out the state police
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.320]  who've been given the questionnaires you know will you go arrest Christians like
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.480]  they said a few months ago in Colorado that freaked out the state police
[14:12.480 --> 14:16.160]  commanders and they went public and said we were called in and said are you
[14:16.160 --> 14:19.400]  ready to arrest Christians and gun owners and libertarians and they were
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.080]  like is this a joke and the Homeland Security said this is not a joke they
[14:23.080 --> 14:26.720]  were there marking down everybody that wasn't gonna go along I mean you want
[14:26.720 --> 14:33.760]  front-row seats to a takeover folks let me tell you something that's what
[14:33.760 --> 14:36.800]  Obama deception to is about I was gonna have a little bit of that at the end
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.200]  saying they might try a military staged event and a coup d'etat but they've
[14:41.200 --> 14:44.120]  already basically taken over so they'll probably want to gut the country get
[14:44.120 --> 14:48.080]  rid of Obama in a few years bringing a new puppet but more and more the
[14:48.080 --> 14:53.800]  financial collapse they've engineered may catch up with them and they may go
[14:53.800 --> 14:58.680]  ahead and have to go with the staged event ahead of that because I'm seeing
[14:58.680 --> 15:03.040]  all the indicators that they may go ahead just try to keep Obama in office
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.520]  okay and I want to explain something to you I told my crew this last night at
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.200]  about 630 right before the nightly news I'm standing around with some of the TV
[15:14.200 --> 15:20.240]  crew and I said you know why MSNBC has come out and said I'm basically behind
[15:20.240 --> 15:26.600]  the Boston bombing and that I am a quote deep racist and they had the former
[15:26.600 --> 15:32.480]  head of the RNC agree with them it's because we've got their number folks
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.680]  we've got their number we know them better than they do because they're all
[15:36.680 --> 15:41.720]  compartmentalized kind of wicked lazy people on average the low-level and
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.400]  mid-level even high-level people are not master controllers we've reverse
[15:45.400 --> 15:48.680]  engineered their whole program gone and read all the white papers we know what
[15:48.680 --> 15:52.560]  their program is most these globalists work five six hours a day go play golf
[15:52.560 --> 15:57.480]  have mistresses party all day long I mean they're very decadent slobs okay and
[15:57.480 --> 16:02.480]  so the system does not like my broadcast because this is open humet
[16:02.480 --> 16:08.360]  organic intelligence network that's telling it like it is and we're blowing
[16:08.360 --> 16:13.440]  their cover within the Pentagon and within the CIA FBI private corporations
[16:13.440 --> 16:17.160]  people are all sitting around we can see the traffic coming in but I've talked
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.080]  to countless military officers and they're all openly listen with earpieces
[16:21.080 --> 16:24.160]  listening to the show right now they all know what's happening they're watching
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.120]  everything I'm saying on the outside the tumblers going into place where they're
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.880]  at going oh yeah and then they're giving us even more information and they're
[16:31.880 --> 16:37.520]  starting to go public and leak info they see what's going on folks military is
[16:37.520 --> 16:40.880]  meeting all over the country former and current saying what are we going to do
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.560]  about this and we do not need a counter coup folks preemptively we need to
[16:46.560 --> 16:51.160]  expose the plan for a false flag to be blamed on real Americans people that
[16:51.160 --> 16:57.200]  have basic American values and are not lazy pieces of filth those of us that
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.840]  have not been successfully psychologically destroyed by this high-tech psych warfare
[17:01.840 --> 17:05.840]  are the enemy because we're all that's left folks from capturing the nuclear
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.440]  weapons and even more advanced directed energy weapons particle beam weapons
[17:11.440 --> 17:19.160]  fish infusion any matter weapons the air forces admitted they have but details
[17:19.160 --> 17:22.200]  are classified yeah I mean they were making a bombs in the 40s folks they
[17:22.200 --> 17:25.600]  don't they got a little bit more than that now they got stuff will blow up the
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.240]  whole solar system according to my intel so the point here is is that you got
[17:30.240 --> 17:35.280]  crazy globalists that want control of all that fully bio weapons that will
[17:35.280 --> 17:40.360]  kill 98% of people and that's old stuff 30 years old they got stuff that kills
[17:40.360 --> 17:45.640]  everybody reportedly and and you got a bunch of crazies that want full control
[17:45.640 --> 17:50.960]  of that and there are a lot of people now in the military seeing that they're
[17:50.960 --> 17:54.000]  being replaced with robots seeing if they're being replaced with computers
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.200]  seeing that police departments are getting rid of the police everywhere
[17:58.200 --> 18:03.960]  only having rapid reaction paramilitary forces backed up by helicopters and
[18:03.960 --> 18:07.120]  they're going to phase out the regular beat cop and have the cameras give the
[18:07.120 --> 18:10.600]  tickets and surveil they're putting up these command towers all over the
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.400]  country laying off half the police forces on average in these cities you're
[18:15.400 --> 18:19.240]  going to be out of a job to I mean this is the total end of humanity if they're
[18:19.240 --> 18:24.760]  able to get this program rolling and it's because I understand this and you
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.160]  understand this we're the enemy and let me just tell the globalist something we
[18:29.160 --> 18:35.200]  have you in check and you know that you can kill me tomorrow and my conscience
[18:35.200 --> 18:40.040]  is clear that I was not part of this okay I will not be part of what you're
[18:40.040 --> 18:44.160]  doing to people I will not passively go along with this or or back off just
[18:44.160 --> 18:47.880]  because I know I'll be destroyed if I don't I have sworn on the altar of God
[18:47.880 --> 18:53.920]  to go 110% against the enemy and I just pray that I'm up to do there but you know
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.320]  as good as I can into the face of this but I told you folks they're lining up
[18:58.320 --> 19:02.280]  against us right now they're opening up the Pentagon has announced domestic
[19:02.280 --> 19:07.200]  operations in psyops against the American people that's freaking out the
[19:07.200 --> 19:11.400]  people in Pentagon realizing just how evil this is they're gonna go to private
[19:11.400 --> 19:16.480]  contractors with disinfo operations it's gonna get crazy and let me tell you
[19:16.480 --> 19:21.320]  something folks if they gun me down in my yard or say I get car jacked I predict
[19:21.320 --> 19:26.040]  within 48 hours of being killed you're gonna see a nuke go off or a bio weapon
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.960]  released and they're not just gonna kill me they're gonna go wipe out a bunch of
[19:29.960 --> 19:35.080]  military officers they're gonna wipe out a lot of FBI agents just listen folks
[19:35.080 --> 19:38.680]  they'll probably kill Ron Paul you'll just see everybody start getting killed
[19:38.680 --> 19:44.280]  or arrested if they'll do it 24 to 48 hours out they're not gonna want us
[19:44.280 --> 19:47.080]  running around when all this goes down they're gonna try to cut off the
[19:47.080 --> 19:52.200]  communications as well so understand this is not a game this is not a joke and

[23:58.840 --> 24:26.360]  yeah folks we're living in the science fiction era here we're living in 2013
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.880]  and coming up the next segment this is a short segment I'm gonna get into MSNBC
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.040]  Blames Boston bombing on quote deeply racist Alex Jones and I'm gonna muse
[24:38.040 --> 24:46.160]  here openly on air and I've got to talk to my lawyer today about what the best
[24:46.160 --> 24:53.800]  course is because they're so discredited that even though I know I could with a
[24:53.800 --> 24:57.600]  jury get a little judgment on them and undoubtedly this is gonna cause us
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.000]  damage it's designed to cause damage to us just that I've accepted that my name
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.800]  will be damaged and everything still doesn't mean it's okay for them to do
[25:04.800 --> 25:09.640]  that is it in the final equation something I should do because I've got
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.280]  films to make I've got bigger fish to fry at a certain point I pretty much
[25:14.280 --> 25:20.320]  have to sue them like NBC got sued for editing George Zimmerman together to make
[25:20.320 --> 25:23.880]  it sound like yeah he's walking around he's a black guy instead of yeah he's
[25:23.880 --> 25:27.680]  walking around looking in cars blah blah blah later what what what what what
[25:27.680 --> 25:33.960]  color is he oh he's black they edited that you know this isn't even editing
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.040]  something together they show no proof they just say he's deeply racist and
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.880]  connected to white supremacist and they just and and the bombers I mean you
[25:42.880 --> 25:50.320]  couldn't say something worse except for maybe I'm a child molester and I fully
[25:50.320 --> 25:55.520]  expect on this trajectory of these guys that if I don't sue them they're gonna
[25:55.520 --> 25:59.920]  next say I am the bomber I mean God forbid I don't come get arrested tomorrow
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.760]  and they say I'm a bomber and MSNBC says he's the bomber he's the bomber they
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.800]  already say that about the livings aren't have brother who's pled not a
[26:08.800 --> 26:14.400]  zoo car who's you know living brother clearly set those guys up his brother
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.400]  worked for the CIA that came out they've killed their witness friends
[26:18.400 --> 26:22.200]  arrested the others killed FBI agents that were part of the arrest covering
[26:22.200 --> 26:25.960]  that up clearly a drill clearly a national security deal Saudis running
[26:25.960 --> 26:28.760]  all around the place they're mad folks let me tell you why they're coming
[26:28.760 --> 26:31.800]  after us let me first say this and then go to break and come back with the full
[26:31.800 --> 26:36.360]  break now on this they're coming after us with what I just said in the last
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.720]  segment because I guess they're so arrogant about the general public or
[26:41.720 --> 26:45.800]  they control the press that nobody go read ran corporation documents nobody
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.120]  go read club of Rome documents UN documents council on foreign relations
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.280]  documents State Department documents I mean we've listed them all here I've
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.920]  made films about it their whole program UN documents on sterilizing people with
[26:59.920 --> 27:05.920]  vaccines Bill Gates documents and it's like they go around and talk about all
[27:05.920 --> 27:09.680]  this in their white papers I get the white papers I go look at all horrible
[27:09.680 --> 27:13.440]  this is they come out and say I'm a liar people go look and find out it's true
[27:13.440 --> 27:20.080]  I'm talking about unity of humanity to go to the stars and fighting racism I've
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.080]  protested the Ku Klux Klan no exaggeration probably 15 times and I'm
[27:25.080 --> 27:29.240]  not here saying oh look I'm a good trendy or something I protest them because
[27:29.240 --> 27:35.200]  they're a bunch of feds and prove that and had police SWAT teams aiming guns at
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.280]  me and nobody else and threatening me the police in Waco were with the Klan
[27:39.280 --> 27:45.200]  basically in one case and so it's basically like saying Martin Luther
[27:45.200 --> 27:53.440]  King is anti-black to say I'm racist I mean it's just that asinine and so if
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.680]  they can get away with that I mean they're gonna start saying well what's
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.080]  next I mean it's worse than saying I'm a deep racist without showing a clip any
[28:02.080 --> 28:08.200]  proof anything to then say I'm connected and influenced bombers Alex Jones and
[28:08.200 --> 28:15.760]  white supremacist influenced the bombers homeland security says and I've
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.440]  already gone through this before when Richard Pliploski and I got five
[28:19.440 --> 28:27.000]  retractions because I threatened to sue him that time Richard Pliploski came
[28:27.000 --> 28:35.160]  out shot three cops he was drunk Marine Corps picked out of the Marine Corps he
[28:35.160 --> 28:38.120]  got another pit bull they're defecating and you're netting all the floor his
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.440]  mother gave testimony she says I'm calling the police you gotta you won't
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.120]  leave the house the cops come he throws a fit kills three of them turned out the
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.800]  guy hated me she was a troll on all the white supremacists and on my side
[28:48.800 --> 28:51.840]  attacking me they knew that within two hours of getting in his computer they
[28:51.840 --> 28:56.320]  said he did it for Alex Jones we went and searched his name said you know he's
[28:56.320 --> 29:00.460]  one of our biggest critics because I don't make things racial and because I
[29:00.460 --> 29:06.160]  don't hate black people and Jews and I said I'm gonna sue you and they had five
[29:06.160 --> 29:10.560]  retractions in newspapers and I was going to sue them had my lawyer put them
[29:10.560 --> 29:14.840]  on notice with an overnight cease and desist and you know tort letters saying
[29:14.840 --> 29:19.240]  we're getting ready to sue you retract now so I'm gonna send a registered letter
[29:19.240 --> 29:26.120]  in the next few days to MSNBC and I guess I'm just gonna have to sue them I
[29:26.120 --> 29:33.640]  mean I just because next folks they're gonna say I am the bomber okay when we
[29:33.640 --> 29:37.280]  come back I'm gonna break all this down play it play the clip and then dovetail
[29:37.280 --> 29:40.720]  it into why they're coming after us because we're pointing out they're
[29:40.720 --> 29:43.600]  setting up martial law in America we're pointing out they're shutting down our
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.000]  power plants shipping our jobs overseas we're pointing out that the Federal

[33:46.760 --> 33:52.280]  because for anybody that can think it's it's it's a joke but it's not a joke
[33:52.280 --> 33:58.560]  with their target audience it's not a joke with their with their target
[33:58.560 --> 34:01.480]  audience we're gonna be getting to that in just a moment and talk about what a
[34:01.480 --> 34:06.880]  big deal this is and then again it's some very serious geopolitical news stock
[34:06.880 --> 34:12.280]  market financial news and things that the establishment does not want us to
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.120]  really focus in on obviously I mean what is it about this broadcast and info
[34:16.120 --> 34:20.440]  wars.com and prismplanet.com that makes them so upset by the way occasionally
[34:20.440 --> 34:25.400]  I'm wrong about things in the media and I'm always happy to admit it when I am
[34:25.400 --> 34:37.200]  wrong the current issue of Esquire came out and there is a big story on yours
[34:37.200 --> 34:46.240]  truly in it I guess about 6,000 words and it asks am I paranoid or a patriot and
[34:46.240 --> 34:52.280]  basically it ends as a positive article now I talked to the reporter and he
[34:52.280 --> 34:58.600]  didn't say this was off record he said he's getting a lot of heat over this I'm
[34:58.600 --> 35:01.960]  just gonna leave it at that it's the fact that he is one of the top the top
[35:01.960 --> 35:07.600]  three profilers in the country or not the world John Richardson his dad was CIA
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.640]  section chief over Southeast Asia and we're gonna get him on next week to talk
[35:11.640 --> 35:16.640]  about his the book about his dad my father the spy he promised to come on he
[35:16.640 --> 35:19.840]  doesn't do a lot of interviews if I would do an interview with him I tried to
[35:19.840 --> 35:25.960]  get him on years ago and he was too busy and he wanted to talk to me to
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.640]  explore of what I was saying was true or not and the piece was gonna come out
[35:30.640 --> 35:34.720]  more negative but then all the NSA stuff he's been working on this like four
[35:34.720 --> 35:40.480]  months then all the NSA stuff and things broke and a lot of what I said
[35:40.480 --> 35:46.560]  turned out to be true and he really really had his own many awakening and
[35:46.560 --> 35:49.520]  he was already a pretty smart guy and I did the interview because he's done
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.080]  hundreds of profiles with prime ministers presidents top movie stars top
[35:55.080 --> 36:00.240]  directors I mean you name it he's in the top three profilers in the world and so
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.720]  he said look I don't do hit pieces unless the person's really a horrible
[36:04.720 --> 36:07.880]  person he goes out of hundreds of pieces two or three turned out to be really
[36:07.880 --> 36:11.720]  bad because they were bad people and he said I will try to tell the truth and
[36:11.720 --> 36:15.480]  it's only because he's so senior that this even ended up they ended up cutting
[36:15.480 --> 36:19.160]  a couple thousand words out of it that were more you know hardcore info and
[36:19.160 --> 36:23.120]  moving into the back of the magazine it barely got published that's inside
[36:23.120 --> 36:32.840]  baseball basically folks so and it's stuff like this that's going to save
[36:32.840 --> 36:40.160]  our civilization somebody just being honest and he kept his word I mean I'm
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.200]  flabbergasted to a certain extent the Rolling Stone writer because he gets
[36:44.200 --> 36:50.000]  being a big profiler was a little more of a hit piece but but you know the guy
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.360]  was quasi honest because you know once you talk to somebody for weeks on and
[36:55.360 --> 36:58.520]  off again you know they they have but that barely got published because that
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.080]  this though is the first time someone's actually kept their word and I've got a
[37:03.080 --> 37:08.840]  few problems with the current issue of Esquire because it's out of context and
[37:08.840 --> 37:13.360]  again I try to put out complex thoughts here that are multifaceted to really
[37:13.360 --> 37:18.320]  give you where I stand like I've made the point of I have zero dislike for gay
[37:18.320 --> 37:25.920]  people I don't have some knee-jerk dislike of people just like I'm not a
[37:25.920 --> 37:29.760]  racist because I don't go off what somebody looks like I go off who they
[37:29.760 --> 37:34.640]  are I mean that's fundamentally offensive to me to go off what somebody
[37:34.640 --> 37:37.960]  looks like oh that person's got a cleft palate they must be an idiot I don't want
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.960]  to hang out with them because they're not perfectly beautiful I mean that person
[37:41.960 --> 37:45.600]  can play the piano and it tells good jokes or likes to do the same things I
[37:45.600 --> 37:48.840]  do I don't care what they look like I don't care they got warts on the top of
[37:48.840 --> 37:54.120]  their head but I don't like the authoritarian fake left homosexual
[37:54.120 --> 37:59.280]  agenda that's always trying to beat everybody over the head it's like a
[37:59.280 --> 38:03.240]  tension-getting or something it's like parading around and trying to
[38:03.240 --> 38:09.160]  sexualize children and you know trying to inject it and recruit the schools I'd
[38:09.160 --> 38:14.520]  be a heterosexuals doing that and so you know he has in there that well I'm not
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.040]  against people living together or you know if people want to quote but you
[38:18.040 --> 38:23.400]  have partnerships but it needs to be a state issue a Ron Paul type position then
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.600]  it turns into Alice Jones is for gay marriage no the institution of marriage
[38:27.600 --> 38:31.320]  for a man and woman because of the children you're going to have and there
[38:31.320 --> 38:35.280]  is an assault on that from the eugenics perspective and they're using the whole
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.920]  fake gay thing as a liberation angle of that so there's some quotes taken out of
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.500]  context like no I get a woman who's raped wanting to have an abortion but
[38:44.500 --> 38:48.160]  the difference is this is pushed as a dehumanization program and so that's
[38:48.160 --> 38:52.000]  why I'm against abortion well that turns into Alex Jones gets the reasons
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.480]  sometimes why women want to have abortions yeah I get the arguments for
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.080]  it but I'm fundamentally against it because of the larger issue so then
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.800]  some of the left publications that are really authoritarian publications they
[39:05.800 --> 39:11.120]  can then run around and go well look he said he was against abortion here but
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.480]  for it in this magazine see if if I'm one thing folks I'm consistent I don't
[39:17.480 --> 39:21.320]  judge people that had abortions because they're told oh it's not a human it's no
[39:21.320 --> 39:25.240]  big deal it's a I get in a tooth pulled just come on in it's the right you all
[39:25.240 --> 39:28.720]  this peer pressure sacrifice your children to Mollick quits caught
[39:28.720 --> 39:35.320]  Lepodal sacrifice them to you know on salwan if you're a druid people thought
[39:35.320 --> 39:38.680]  it was normal to sacrifice their kids in ancient times not because they were even
[39:38.680 --> 39:41.880]  evil people they thought this is what you do to make the crops grow the high
[39:41.880 --> 39:47.160]  priest says so see I don't judge those people I judge the conscious globalist
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.580]  that you go pay 300 500 a thousand dollars for an abortion depending on the
[39:51.580 --> 39:56.160]  type of clinic and you don't know your child could be sold for as much as
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.960]  $10,000 for their organs and body parts you didn't know that they run off
[40:00.960 --> 40:05.240]  sometimes keeping the baby alive to get it on ice at the nicer clinics so they
[40:05.240 --> 40:11.280]  can go you sell those organs you mean you weren't given that newsflash that
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.920]  every part of your child their stem cells everything is rendered down sold to
[40:15.920 --> 40:22.560]  be flavoring testing for PepsiCo I mean I mean you didn't know that see see see
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.680]  I'm against what it really is I don't judge someone that goes out and it's
[40:27.680 --> 40:30.320]  done it through ignorance you see because I've done things that are wrong
[40:30.320 --> 40:44.000]  folks I undoubtedly had girlfriends that had abortions and I was not a party to
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.440]  it but you know the woman gets real mad at you doesn't want to see you anymore
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.920]  and then you hear she's had an abortion that's how that works and so I've had
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.240]  my children killed and I have to deal with that but I was young I was stupid
[40:57.240 --> 41:04.280]  I didn't understand it I didn't know and I'm not shooting blanks either you know
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.240]  even when you wear a condom folks that doesn't mean you're not going to get
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.520]  somebody pregnant and I hate to have to sit here and get off into all this with
[41:11.520 --> 41:19.920]  people but the point is is that I'm not here judging you they know you go do
[41:19.920 --> 41:22.960]  these abortions you get older you know it's wrong deep down so you fervently
[41:22.960 --> 41:27.200]  defend it and go be part of a billboard campaign saying I got an abortion it
[41:27.200 --> 41:33.560]  it's cool you need to get one to make it sexy instead of making it embarrassing
[41:35.360 --> 41:40.040]  so this broadcast is about being genuine this broadcast is about being true
[41:40.040 --> 41:45.800]  this broadcast is about being real this broadcast is about really trying to
[41:45.800 --> 42:03.960]  break things down and that's what it comes down to so they can take what we
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.640]  say out of context to try to twist it that's one thing we expect that because
[42:08.640 --> 42:11.960]  we know we're on to the enemy we know their program they're freaked out by it
[42:11.960 --> 42:16.680]  and again they're freaked out by their operatives in media at every level
[42:16.680 --> 42:21.080]  figuring out what's really going on because we're decompartmentalizing it
[42:21.080 --> 42:26.600]  for them that's what the globalists are afraid of and I'm sorry your formulae is
[42:26.600 --> 42:31.760]  already out how you work the system is already out because of this broadcast and
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.600]  others and now you can kill me or politically assassinate my name which I
[42:37.600 --> 42:41.320]  would much rather I mean no you're gonna attack me you may even kill me but I like
[42:41.320 --> 42:45.720]  to keep living but whatever happens happens because I realize how bad this
[42:45.720 --> 42:52.600]  system is that people are being signed on to and young people need a chance to
[42:52.600 --> 42:58.520]  hear the truth and common sense not the globalist corporate plastic culture of
[42:58.520 --> 43:04.760]  lies people deserve a real shot at being good guys and I want prosperity and I
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.560]  want justice and I want equality that's what I stand for and that's what I'm
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.520]  here to promote and it's one thing to twist what I say or to take it out of
[43:12.520 --> 43:19.080]  context it's another thing entirely
[43:20.800 --> 43:27.120]  to make things up about me with no proof and to insult your audience by doing
[43:27.120 --> 43:35.040]  that it is truly outrageous and here's the statement I spoke into Curt Nimo's
[43:35.040 --> 43:40.760]  iPhone last night when he wrote the article of Paul Watson no one should
[43:40.760 --> 43:46.120]  feel safe in this climate where they are making all the rodeo clowns take
[43:46.120 --> 43:49.280]  federal sensitivity training and pay for it because one guy did something they
[43:49.280 --> 43:52.040]  stays wrong I mean that's authoritarianism no one should feel safe in
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.160]  this climate the establishment media can put out whatever lie they want and the
[43:56.160 --> 44:00.160]  Republican Party who was there the former chairman of it represented on
[44:00.160 --> 44:04.680]  Wagner's show by Michael Steele will just agree with it because it shows the
[44:04.680 --> 44:08.560]  establishment itself is threatened by the awakening that is happening and
[44:08.560 --> 44:12.120]  again they said I'm behind the terrorist and I'm a deeply racist person
[44:12.120 --> 44:16.320]  which anyone that heard my show knows is it true but again they know it's a lie
[44:16.320 --> 44:21.600]  folks they think they're protected because the White House is behind them
[44:21.600 --> 44:27.440]  they've identified info wars dot com and the journalistic system were building
[44:27.440 --> 44:33.800]  as a major threat that's what the MSNBC segment is a premeditated attack so
[44:33.800 --> 44:39.920]  anyone who supports freedom of the press needs to get behind info wars com and
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.480]  all the other alternative media that is under attack like investigative
[44:44.480 --> 44:48.480]  journalist Glenn Greenwald and whistleblower Edward Snowden and so many
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.760]  others this is exactly how countries fall to authoritarianism because if they
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.040]  can intimidate us and have a chilling effect and shut us down and be famous
[44:57.040 --> 45:02.200]  they can defame anybody and then intimidate everyone else if you care
[45:02.200 --> 45:07.680]  about freedom. Remember this quote from German pastor Martin Niemğlar who
[45:07.680 --> 45:12.560]  resisted the Nazis ended up in a FEMA camp first they came for the
[45:12.560 --> 45:16.400]  communist and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist then they came for
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.640]  the socialist I didn't speak out because I wasn't a socialist then they
[45:19.640 --> 45:22.380]  came for the trade unionist I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade
[45:22.380 --> 45:25.800]  unionist and they came for the Jews I didn't speak out because I wasn't a
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.480]  Jew then they came for the Catholics I did speak out because I wasn't a
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.360]  Catholic, then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.
[45:32.360 --> 45:37.720]  Well, Hitler was more of a fascist, first socialist, what Nazi means, national socialist,
[45:37.720 --> 45:41.080]  but then double-crossed the socialist was more of a fascist.
[45:41.080 --> 45:43.360]  This is more of a Soviet-style deal with Obama.
[45:43.360 --> 45:46.480]  I mean, these are real authoritarians.
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.920]  The Army's training with, quote, reeducation centers, Army document, just type in Army
[45:50.920 --> 45:55.520]  document, reeducation camp, Army.mil, show it to the folks, guys, if you're watching
[45:55.520 --> 45:56.520]  on TV.
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.800]  I mean, it's the real deal.
[46:00.800 --> 46:02.240]  And people are watching this happen.
[46:02.240 --> 46:07.240]  Of course they're coming out and saying, I'm a deep racist and I'm behind the Boston bombing.
[46:07.240 --> 46:16.360]  What else can they do?
[46:16.360 --> 46:17.680]  I continue here.
[46:17.680 --> 46:22.320]  This meets the precise definition of willful, conscious defamation with malice and forethought
[46:22.320 --> 46:23.320]  with intent to do harm.
[46:23.320 --> 46:26.480]  I've sued people before for defamation successfully.
[46:26.480 --> 46:31.520]  I don't like to do this, but clearly if I don't respond to this, they will make up even
[46:31.520 --> 46:33.400]  more outrageous stuff.
[46:33.400 --> 46:35.760]  Will I be a child molester according to them tomorrow?
[46:35.760 --> 46:37.560]  Will they say I am the bomber?
[46:37.560 --> 46:42.000]  They're already saying I made these people bomb stuff and I'm deeply racist without showing
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  a shred of proof.
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.880]  They could have dumbed down their audiences if they could do that.
[46:45.880 --> 46:48.040]  This is outrageous, authoritarianism.
[46:48.040 --> 46:49.280]  So I'm putting them on notice.
[46:49.280 --> 46:51.400]  I want massive retractions now.
[46:51.400 --> 46:52.880]  This is your tort warning.
[46:52.880 --> 46:53.880]  You are now on notice.
[46:53.880 --> 46:58.440]  Do you guys think you're invincible because you have the White House behind you?
[46:58.440 --> 47:00.640]  Richard Nixon thought he was invincible too.
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.280]  The American people are going to stand up against this intimidation against the press.
[47:06.280 --> 47:07.720]  And then the article goes on with other examples.
[47:07.720 --> 47:12.840]  Bill O'Reilly a few months ago said, we have sexual predators on the internet attacking
[47:12.840 --> 47:13.840]  women.
[47:13.840 --> 47:20.840]  And he cut to a clip of me ranting about Obama out of context saying I'm sick of it.
[47:20.840 --> 47:23.120]  We need to stand up in my face turning red.
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.960]  And then did a still shot of me saying hate speech.
[47:27.960 --> 47:32.160]  I mean, a sexual predator on women.
[47:32.160 --> 47:34.840]  I mean, they're already doing it, folks.
[47:34.840 --> 47:37.120]  I expect child molesters next.
[47:37.120 --> 47:39.560]  They could swat team me tomorrow, plant some of my computer.
[47:39.560 --> 47:40.560]  They've done it to others.
[47:40.560 --> 47:42.160]  I mean, this is not a game.
[47:42.160 --> 47:43.800]  And I guess they think you're a coward.
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.640]  They think I'm going to get up here and say all this and you're going to get in your
[47:46.640 --> 47:51.320]  shell pulling like a turtle duck and cover waiting for him to come dig you out of your
[47:51.320 --> 47:52.320]  hole.
[47:52.320 --> 47:53.320]  It's like the shooting training.
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.040]  When a shooter's in a building, you're supposed to FEMA says get in a fetal position so they
[47:57.040 --> 48:01.160]  can get the maximum number of deaths.
[48:01.160 --> 48:04.680]  I mean, you know, don't have a gun, folks.
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.680]  They actually say you're supposed to vomit or poop on them in training for women.
[48:08.680 --> 48:10.200]  In fact, pull that up.
[48:10.200 --> 48:11.720]  Women are supposed to pee, poop or vomit.
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.320]  I'm not joking.
[48:13.320 --> 48:16.920]  Slide bust in to kill you, just, you know, pull your pants down and crap on them.
[48:16.920 --> 48:19.920]  I mean, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, to have to talk like this.
[48:19.920 --> 48:21.600]  This is how crazy these people are.
[48:21.600 --> 48:23.080]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[48:23.080 --> 48:24.280]  I'm bankrupting this doing this.
[48:24.280 --> 48:25.280]  I just can't help it.
[48:25.280 --> 48:28.400]  I got to keep going.
[48:28.400 --> 48:30.760]  The point here is, yeah, there it is.
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.440]  College women told to urinate and vomit to deter rapists.
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.360]  Anyways, and they actually say, yeah, I do the same thing of a shooter's coming after
[48:37.360 --> 48:38.360]  you.
[48:38.360 --> 48:39.360]  But it's not funny.
[48:39.360 --> 48:40.360]  It's sick.
[48:40.360 --> 48:42.440]  The dehumanization that's going on.
[48:42.440 --> 48:45.280]  You're not supposed to defend yourself with a gun, but the government's arming to the
[48:45.280 --> 48:48.080]  teeth to defend themselves from who?
[48:48.080 --> 48:50.840]  The Sovereign Citizen Libertarian Movement.
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.000]  All over the country in the Homeland Security Grants, it says, for the number one terror
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.720]  threat, gun owners, veterans, yeah, because they're going to start persecuting people
[48:59.720 --> 49:02.560]  and coming to get us.
[49:02.560 --> 49:05.920]  And of course, people are going to then fight back and it's going to be called terrorism.
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.880]  They've got the police gearing up for all out war with us.
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.920]  And then they're going to phase out those cops as well.
[49:14.920 --> 49:21.720]  I mean, this has all been planned and we've got to say no and have an awakening to it.
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.840]  So I want to get into this attack and I want people to understand this attack is taking
[49:26.840 --> 49:30.920]  place because we know what we're talking about.
[49:30.920 --> 49:33.240]  Now remember, they don't attack us on anything we say.
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.440]  Rachel Maddow says that I said Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma City without showing
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.520]  me say that.
[49:39.520 --> 49:43.200]  She says I say giant wasp live under the UN building.
[49:43.200 --> 49:44.200]  We have those clips.
[49:44.200 --> 49:49.320]  I've never said anything like that.
[49:49.320 --> 49:50.720]  No one's ever acted like this.
[49:50.720 --> 49:56.480]  Joseph Garbles wasn't this ridiculous in Nazi Germany.
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.440]  It's because folks, their constituents are in a trance.
[50:00.440 --> 50:03.040]  That's why Mark Dice can go out or we can go out and say, we're going to kill babies
[50:03.040 --> 50:04.040]  at age three.
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.040]  It's for Obama.
[50:05.040 --> 50:06.040]  Yeah.
[50:06.040 --> 50:07.040]  Kill babies.
[50:07.040 --> 50:08.040]  We're going to kill people over 65 for Obama.
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.040]  Yes.
[50:09.040 --> 50:12.200]  We're going to arrest all gunners and put them in forced labor camps for Obama.
[50:12.200 --> 50:13.200]  Yes.
[50:13.200 --> 50:17.000]  They can say anything now and these people think they're on the winning team.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.400]  Oh, you're going to raise my payroll tax if it's for Obama.
[50:19.400 --> 50:20.400]  Go ahead and do it.
[50:20.400 --> 50:21.400]  You're going to break all your promises.
[50:21.400 --> 50:22.960]  If it's for Obama, I'll do it.
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.920]  Now the good news is people like Oliver Stone, who I know is a listener through his son,
[50:28.920 --> 50:36.760]  Oliver Stone came out and said, Obama is a dangerous, evil snake exactly because he
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.080]  can get everybody to stand down the so-called left.
[50:40.080 --> 50:41.880]  There is no left now in this country.
[50:41.880 --> 50:44.240]  There's a bunch of foaming at the mouth.
[50:44.240 --> 50:46.600]  I'm telling you folks, they make the Soviets look tame.
[50:46.600 --> 50:49.000]  I mean, these are vicious people.
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.560]  Even the Soviets would have propaganda that sounded good to say he's behind bombers and
[50:54.560 --> 51:02.840]  influences them and a white supremacist connected and he is a deeply racist with no proof.
[51:02.840 --> 51:04.560]  That's open and shut with a jury.
[51:04.560 --> 51:07.320]  They don't care if a jury gives me a million bucks.
[51:07.320 --> 51:11.200]  I know folks, I've sued people for defamation twice and had them settle because I only sue
[51:11.200 --> 51:13.280]  you if I absolutely have to and I know I'll win.
[51:13.280 --> 51:14.280]  I know the law.
[51:14.280 --> 51:16.480]  I've got the lawyers done it before.
[51:16.480 --> 51:19.320]  Jury will reward me because they're definitely, I've been damaged.
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.000]  They're saying I shouldn't be on the air.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.080]  They're trying to, the people are trying to shut down our YouTube and Facebook stuff.
[51:24.080 --> 51:25.400]  We've been shut down before.
[51:25.400 --> 51:26.480]  They're trying to shut us down.
[51:26.480 --> 51:31.200]  They want us shut down because we're behind bombings, folks.
[51:31.200 --> 51:35.400]  That is the definition of defamation, okay?
[51:35.400 --> 51:36.400]  They don't care.
[51:36.400 --> 51:41.160]  They get hundreds of millions of stimulus money in NBC and MSNBC, billions of government
[51:41.160 --> 51:42.800]  contracts to Microsoft.
[51:42.800 --> 51:43.800]  They don't care.
[51:43.800 --> 51:44.800]  Okay?
[51:44.800 --> 51:47.960]  They'll just pay with their, with tax money.
[51:47.960 --> 51:50.080]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[51:50.080 --> 51:52.120]  Do you understand that?
[51:52.120 --> 51:58.040]  I've studied propaganda and other regimes that's never been this cuckoo.
[51:58.040 --> 52:01.280]  Let's, let's, let's, let's start going to this clip as I analyze it here, the clips
[52:01.280 --> 52:04.560]  up on infowars.com, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.040]  The bombing suspects may not have been the radical jihadists they were initially believed
[52:09.040 --> 52:10.040]  to be.
[52:10.040 --> 52:15.640]  Older brother Tamerlin Sarnaev was reportedly a fan of far right-wing conspiracy theorist
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.120]  Alex Jones.
[52:17.120 --> 52:18.120]  This guy.
[52:18.120 --> 52:19.560]  Hey listen, I'm here to warn people.
[52:19.560 --> 52:21.160]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[52:21.160 --> 52:22.880]  This isn't a game, okay?
[52:22.880 --> 52:25.160]  Our government in the U.S. is building FEMA camps.
[52:25.160 --> 52:27.440]  We have an NDAA where they disappear people now.
[52:27.440 --> 52:40.280]  Okay, now again they play a clip of me where they're saying there's no fluoride in the
[52:40.280 --> 52:41.280]  water.
[52:41.280 --> 52:42.280]  By the way, that's back in the news.
[52:42.280 --> 52:45.720]  They actually say on this piece, there's no fluoride in the water now because they're,
[52:45.720 --> 52:50.080]  everybody admits it gives you cancer now, Harvard studies, Princeton, UT, so, so, so
[52:50.080 --> 52:51.880]  there's no fluoride in the water.
[52:51.880 --> 52:56.480]  They make a joke about that and then show me going, hey NDAA, they're disappearing people.
[52:56.480 --> 53:00.360]  We should be yelling about this, but see, oh that's what discredits me.
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.520]  Did you hear anything racist there, though?
[53:02.520 --> 53:03.760]  Let's go back to the clip.
[53:03.760 --> 53:06.240]  Public, humanity is awakening!
[53:06.240 --> 53:09.920]  Today, Alex Jones' YouTube channel has over 300 million views.
[53:09.920 --> 53:10.920]  It's over 600 million.
[53:10.920 --> 53:15.000]  According to the Wall Street Journal, Sarnaev also read white supremacist publications,
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  including The First Freedom, an Alabama-based newspaper that espouses equal rights for
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  whites.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  They're conflating me with them.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.920]  For first belongs Alex Sites, Wald writes, Sarnaev illustrates how 21st century anti-government
[53:25.920 --> 53:31.320]  conspiracism melts down typical ideological barriers in a post-modern view of various
[53:31.320 --> 53:35.520]  radicalisms united by a common, deep distrust of the government.
[53:35.520 --> 53:38.520]  It's sort of an interesting confluence, and when we talk about this happening in some
[53:38.520 --> 53:39.520]  sectors of the world.
[53:39.520 --> 53:44.840]  Now they go to George Lucas' evil twin, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.640]  Radical libertarian agenda and a sort of southern, racist, post-confinial...
[53:49.640 --> 53:51.760]  See, libertarians racist, folks.
[53:51.760 --> 53:54.680] ...towards governance and...
[53:54.680 --> 53:56.400]  Did you know you're all racist?
[53:56.400 --> 53:59.400]  That view informing a certain sector...
[53:59.400 --> 54:03.480]  So now, not liking governance period, is racist.
[54:03.480 --> 54:04.840]  That's what Sebelius said yesterday.
[54:04.840 --> 54:09.720]  She said, we covered the news articles, she said, opposition to Obamacare is racist.
[54:09.720 --> 54:13.480]  See, if you didn't want your payroll tax raised, and I promised they wouldn't, or you didn't
[54:13.480 --> 54:19.240]  want your premiums to double, already up 50 plus percent this year, you're a racist.
[54:19.240 --> 54:23.080]  You're like, no, I don't want to be raked over the calls, no, no, you're racist.
[54:23.080 --> 54:24.080]  Let's get to the meat and potatoes.
[54:24.080 --> 54:29.400]  I mean, a certain sector of American politics, Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has
[54:29.400 --> 54:34.680]  300 million YouTube, well, he had 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube.
[54:34.680 --> 54:41.520]  And that sort of fringe, arch-conservative, deeply, I think, racist strain is being tapped
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.000]  into at crazy profit by people in the media.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  Well, it is, and I think the point you just made is the key thing, at crazy profit, these
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.600]  folks are getting paid to be racist, they're being paid to be ignorant, publicly.
[54:52.600 --> 54:54.240]  You're probably going to get sued, Steve.
[54:54.240 --> 54:57.280]  You know, I think you've got to espouse these views that a vast majority of Americans still
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.280]  subscribe.
[54:58.280 --> 54:59.280]  That's going to cut into your bondage money.
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.680]  But it does continue the narrative of the subtext of race, and how that plays into the
[55:04.680 --> 55:09.360]  stories politically, economically, educationally, and what people come out of, how they come
[55:09.360 --> 55:10.520]  out on the other side of it.
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.080]  And when you have, whether it's these brothers or others who kind of fall into this trap,
[55:15.080 --> 55:19.840]  this mindset, the question then becomes for us going forward is, how do we then graduate
[55:19.840 --> 55:23.000]  from just sitting around in your room, you know, musing?
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.560]  And of course, they've got my image up on the screen the whole time.
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.200]  And they've got the former head of the RNC, God knows what else they've got on him, to
[55:30.200 --> 55:35.840]  have him up there doing this, saying, oh, well, he's paid to be racist.
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.720]  Did you know that, folks?
[55:37.720 --> 55:41.600]  Unity, let's stop the black abortion, especially.
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.280]  Let's get the Planned Parenthood out, let's expose Margaret Sanger, and the fake left
[55:45.280 --> 55:50.080]  is deeply racist, with her own letters saying blacks are subhuman weeds to be killed.
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.240]  Did you know that was deeply racist?
[55:51.240 --> 55:55.840]  Talking about Martin Luther King and judging people by the character of their deeds, deeply
[55:55.840 --> 55:56.840]  racist.
[55:56.840 --> 56:00.400]  Protests in the Kloegos Klan, deeply racist.
[56:00.400 --> 56:02.600]  Where is the deeply racist stuff?
[56:02.600 --> 56:05.560]  And, I mean, let's play a little bit more.
[56:05.560 --> 56:06.560]  Here it is.
[56:06.560 --> 56:11.480]  To stand going out and publicly holding up a sign saying you're 47% Negro to actually
[56:11.480 --> 56:13.840]  doing what we saw these two idiots do in Boston.
[56:13.840 --> 56:18.320]  Okay, and though there may be only 10 people who take Alex Jones, seriously, there are
[56:18.320 --> 56:19.320]  people-
[56:19.320 --> 56:20.320]  All right, let's stop right there.
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.080]  I can't watch any more of it, folks.
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.640]  Now the Patsy Boston bombers, Claire Patsy's one of them is pled, not guilty.
[56:26.640 --> 56:30.720]  Nowhere in American history would they ever say the guilty bomber.
[56:30.720 --> 56:33.440]  Rolling Stone, MSNBC, he's now guilty.
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.080]  Forget the drills, forget his brother in CIA, forget all the Saudi Arabians.
[56:37.080 --> 56:38.080]  No, no, no.
[56:38.080 --> 56:39.080]  He's guilty.
[56:39.080 --> 56:48.520]  And now he's racist, a caucus, Middle Eastern, clearly, you want to get into who they are.
[56:48.520 --> 56:55.680]  It's Asian with a little bit of African mixed in with Central European.
[56:55.680 --> 56:56.680]  That's what those folks are.
[56:56.680 --> 57:00.040]  I mean, I guess you could call them white, nothing to do with race.
[57:00.040 --> 57:02.680]  They go into somebody's computer, probably visited thousands of sites.
[57:02.680 --> 57:04.600]  I visit sites all the time, I don't agree with.
[57:04.600 --> 57:07.200]  Now he's a Klan member, folks.
[57:07.200 --> 57:10.240]  And now the white races bomb the Boston bombing.
[57:10.240 --> 57:13.000]  See now they're saying the libertarians bomb the bombing.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.880]  I mean, this is cuckoo, folks.
[57:15.880 --> 57:17.320]  We need your support more than ever.

[59:53.760 --> 59:56.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:56.080 --> 01:00:05.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:10.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.280]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.440]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:27.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:40.600]  All right, if you just joined us, most of the time when we're in the press, we don't cover
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:47.600]  the attack pieces because it's a flak that's not even coming close to us.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.280]  But when the White House run, foreign foundation run, MSNBC comes out and says, I am, quote,
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.200]  a deeply racist person, and that the libertarians bomb the Boston bombing.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.680]  And it's all scripted.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:07.000]  They have the former head of the Republican Party, Steele in there, MSNBC.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.240]  The panel just goes around the line and says, you know, first Alex Jones basically made
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:18.600]  the Zarnab brothers bomb the marathon and Steele then agrees that I'm deeply racist,
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.120]  and then I'm paid to be deeply racist.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.600]  And then they segue into, yeah, it's these libertarians that are now bombing the marathon.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.400]  So see, it's about you folks, opposition to their takeover and governance, she's reading
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.280]  off a teleprompter, is terrorism.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.600]  What does the United Nations say in their Uniteer July 7th, 2001 treaty minutes?
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:51.920]  They said, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.920]  the state.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:01.440]  Now, I agree with that statement except for the word legitimate, you substitute illegitimate.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.960]  It's the illegitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.960]  And in America now they're saying, if you don't like collectivism, if you don't like
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.560]  your five-year-old being taught about sex, you're a homophobe, and I'm like, I don't
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.400]  want to be taught anything about that, keep your hands, and you're sickening this away
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.400]  from my kids.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.000]  And they're like, oh, you're a homophobe now, oh, oh, you don't want world government,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.200]  you're a racist, oh, you don't want healthcare written by foreign banks or rip everybody
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.080]  off by the snake Obama, you're a racist.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.960]  No, you people are worse than racists, you're race pimps that look at everybody out there
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.800]  and want to get us fighting with each other so you can sit up there like the good guy.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.040]  You make me want to throw up.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:48.360]  And I don't even look at this woman, this host, this Alex Wagner, and hate her.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.920]  You look at her eyes all bulging out on a power trip, you look at her all thinking she's slick
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.720]  and cool and working for the system that could care less about her.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:01.840]  I just look at her and think about, what a pathetic person, and I feel sad for how weak
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.360]  humanity is sometimes in po-talk, and they all know who they are.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.840]  I even know stuff about Inside Southern Parvy Law Center and what really goes on over there.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.640]  They're all just really a bunch of dope-smoking, party-animal hippies who then get handed down
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.840]  these talking points by the big foundations and the psych warfare CIA chiefs.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:30.840]  Oh, yeah, I've talked to your workers at Blabber, get a few drinks in them, I mean, you guys
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.080]  really are signed on to all this.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.880]  You think this is funny saying I'm deeply racist and behind terrorism?
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:45.240]  When we all know who ran Elohim City up above you guys, I mean, you really think all that
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.320]  stuff's cute.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.640]  You really want to be bad guys.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.200]  I mean, you know what comes with all this.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.440]  You know full well NSA, globalist, farm corporations, I'm for real.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.400]  You all know I really want a future for humanity.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.120]  You've got my psychological algorithm.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.080]  You know what I want.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.000]  I want what you want deep down, many of you.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.760]  You just want justice in the future.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.880]  You don't really want to be bad guys.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.480]  Only weak, stupid people who have to cheat want to be bad guys, or people that are tired
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.720]  of losing then become bad guys.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.200]  And as the system gets more and more corrupt, more people are going to become bad guys.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.480]  And pretty soon everybody sells out to the bad guys and everything collapses.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:37.160]  And the elites always said that's the problem, is that tyranny doesn't produce anything.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.840]  But now they go, oh, we have robots and automation, so we can finally have our tyranny and get
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.880]  rid of the excess labor population.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.600]  And so all of you idiots at the Southern Harvey Law Center, MSNBC, CIA, evil people
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:05:04.040]  in the Defense Department, are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040]  for us?
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.960]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.680]  of information.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:17.280]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280]  psyche.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.840]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.440]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.200]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.200]  it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.560]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.520]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.520]  but demand a war.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:06:06.400]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:14.840]  reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.200]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.680]  caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.760]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.800]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:25.440]  effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.080]  number of parasites.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.280]  It can even purify water.

[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:28.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a giant attack on the free press, the independent
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.200]  press in this country.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.300]  They're bringing in Soviet style political correctness where somebody wears a clown mask
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:38.880]  of Obama and then they say it's racist because bulls don't chase clowns, even though that's
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.040]  what they do at rodeos.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:46.600]  And now all the rodeo clowns have to go pay between $300,000 to $1,000 depending on which
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.120]  group they go to, federally certified sensitivity training groups, because someone did something
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.640]  you're all guilty.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.440]  That's the essence of authoritarianism.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.040]  But then the guy with the rodeo mask didn't even do anything to begin with, but it's about
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.640]  teaching you to shut down your speech.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.520]  And Missouri running TV announcements, don't criticize Obama, we will arrest you.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.320]  I played those clips yesterday in the truth squads article, type in Obama truth squads,
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.040]  you'll get videos on YouTube all over the country going, you talk bad about Obama, you
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:22.760]  say it in a Christian, we're going to arrest you guys in uniforms.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.760]  Why not?
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]  They arrest you for filming one in public.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.760]  It's legal.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.760]  Why not?
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.840]  I mean, they take people's bank accounts now without, I mean, look at the cover of New
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.280]  Yorker magazine, this current issue, August issue.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.200]  In most states, police have the right to confiscate possessions like your cash, car, home, even
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.080]  if you aren't charged with a crime.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.280]  Yeah, even if drugs aren't found, they don't really have the right to do that.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.320]  They just have corrupt courts that go along with it.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.200]  Folks, this is, I guess that's racist that I said it's, that we should have a Fourth
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.920]  Amendment or due process.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.880]  This is authoritarianism, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.640]  You don't want healthcare laws that rip you off, you're a racist.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.960]  And you watch this MSNBC piece and it shows a willful pattern by MSNBC to say I'm racist.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.760]  They've come out and set it out right before.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.680]  But now they say, oh, Alex is dangerous, there's aren't any brothers like Tim and this, implying
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680]  I caused them to bomb.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:23.120]  Then at the end, they say, yeah, Libertarians like this that bombed the Boston Marathon.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120]  See, it's now saying you're all terrorist.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.800]  And then they say, yes, Alex Jones is, you know, dangerous.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.800]  He has all these people.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.320]  Well, yes, it's these deeply racist groups.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.800]  They try to put a comment in there.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.840]  That's not going to hold up in court with a jury.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.840]  It's clear.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.680]  You're up there putting me in with a clan, putting me in with people you're saying are
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.880]  bombers that have pled not guilty.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:49.760]  It's all unprecedented and it shows the conscious, willful intent of malice and forethought to
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.000]  do harm.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.880]  I can't wait to subpoena them on what was in the teleprompter.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:00.480]  Oh, I can't wait to subpoena the before show briefing in the green room and all this.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.480]  I can't wait.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.560]  I'm 95% going to sue you.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.680]  It's just that do I have to dig up all the other clips, build the case, right?
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.360]  Because if I sue you, I'm going to win.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.640]  I'm going to sue you in the right place.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.880]  I'm going to get all the damages you've done to me lined up.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.440]  It's already happening.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.000]  Not see in a year.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  That's the problem.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.440]  If I sue you, I'm going to build a real case.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.160]  I'm not going to just do I've sued people twice for defamation folks and they've settled
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160]  both times.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.920]  So I, I hope Mr. Smarty pants.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.680]  You like being hauled into depositions, Alex Wagner.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:42.440]  I hope Mr. Steel likes being brought in former head of the RNC and your lawyer just, just
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.800]  you know, hope you like it because you're not going to set up there and try to damage
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.080]  me without me fighting back.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:55.160]  I fight back and the most important thing is it's in the news that you are liars trying
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.880]  to defame me because they can take me down.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.760]  They could take anybody down.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.080]  Why have I defended Rush Limbaugh and they wanted to shut him down with made up stuff,
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.360]  even though Limbaugh has actually attacked me over the years because if they can take
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.080]  him down, they can take us all down.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.360]  Limbaugh's come out and had obliquely defended me over this on the blaze.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360]  Good.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.120]  That's why I've told my crew no more attacking Limbaugh, even when he does weird stuff.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.600]  We got bigger fish to fry.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.240]  I mean, we got the new world order coming down on us, man.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.280]  I'm here bringing other people on like Ben Schwann, other reporters to try to get them
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.280]  launched.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.880]  I mean, we need more people going up against this.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.480]  I'm in a war, folks.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.520]  You're in a war, whether you know it or not.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.120]  This is a war.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120]  This is a war.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.160]  God bless DrudgeReport.com and Matt Drudge and his crew boldly getting the truth out
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.080]  there, exposing the lies, going up against it all.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.120]  And I'm hearing God bless Michael Savage.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.560]  He's getting more hardcore and telling it like it is and about how Obama killed the
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.800]  seals and the cover up and the fake bin Laden raid.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.120]  Only the truth is going to save us.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120]  This isn't about money.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.400]  It's not about fame.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.440]  It's about the fight for liberty, folks.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.760]  Anyone who'd been through what I've been through would know how real all this is, okay?
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.400]  I mean, I know how bad these people are.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.240]  I realize how much trouble we're in.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.120]  I realize, folks, we hang together.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.920]  We hang separate because even if neocon talk show hosts and people in the past have been
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.760]  establishment, when the globalists take over because you've been pro family, pro gun, you're
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.400]  gone.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.200]  The globalists have decided on a leftist, Fabian socialist ideology for their global
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.320]  governance and even fake libertarians and conservatives are going to be shut down, okay?
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:39.120]  So, you might as well because your deep inclination is to love liberty.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.600]  I hear the passion of these hosts.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.320]  You started out good, many of you.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.520]  Why don't you come on over and go all the way?
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:52.000]  Just like the Esquire top profiler in the country, he does big profiles, John Richards,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.800]  went and found out a lot of what I was saying was true.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:14:01.120]  He can verify it, bucked his editors and got it published and he sounds pretty freaked
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120]  out now.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:10.160]  I'm in a lot of trouble, but I don't want to talk about it.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.000]  Because John Richards knows that this country is in deep trouble and this world's in deep
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  trouble.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.680]  It's not a perfect article, but the left is freaked, the authoritarian left, the gatekeepers
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.040]  are freaking out.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.920]  Why is there a semi positive profile in Esquire?
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.720]  Because ladies and gentlemen, I am a good person.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.800]  I am a real person.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.800]  Does it mean I'm perfect?
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.800]  No.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.280]  And I believe what I'm saying and I'm trying to find the truth and I want a future for
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.280]  my children.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.360]  And if you want one, you better decide what side you're on to right now.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.800]  Let's go back to just a small clip of the full 14-minute clip from MSNBC and the scripting
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.800]  where she goes from Alex Jones to white supremacist to this deeply racist ideology, she's saying
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.800]  all of us there are.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.720]  And oh my gosh, how they're on the air, it's dangerous.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.320]  And then oh, how do we go from this ideology to the bombing?
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:07.480]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube, 600 million people that
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.040]  have watched him on YouTube.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:15.880]  And that sort of fringe, arch conservative, deeply, I think racist strain is being tapped
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.400]  into at crazy profit by people in the media.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  Well it is.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.880]  And I think the point you just made is the key.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.880]  A crazy profit.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:23.880]  A crazy profit.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.880]  These folks are getting paid to be racist.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.880]  They're being paid to be in the public.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.880]  Boom.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.880]  Steals the real one.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.000]  This is going to damage me.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.840]  That a vast majority of Americans don't subscribe to.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:33.840]  But it does.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.840]  Let's turn that off.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:40.560]  By the way, we called a computer company yesterday in the afternoon who, I guess, had this on
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:45.960]  and they said, we don't want to work with you because of your racism, basically.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.200]  Boom.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.440]  That's going to be in court.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.160]  The damages are coming in right now.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.560]  By the way, we know you got your crews lobbying to take down our YouTube channels on Facebook
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560]  and Twitter.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560]  It's happened before.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.120]  Over 600 million views of different Alex Jones videos, not just the 320 million on one channel
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:06.480]  that they've turned the clock back on before.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.080]  They're scared of us, ladies and gentlemen, because they know that we know the truth.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:16.680]  And then they go into how, yeah, these libertarians are bombin' stuff.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.800]  Malice of forethought with intent to do harm.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.240]  Up there just saying, racist, racist, racist, to create division so we don't come together.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.080]  Yesterday, before I even knew this had been on air yesterday, I was saying we should all
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.400]  come together against tyranny.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.040]  And that's what they're so scared of, folks.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.560]  They're involved in the racial division.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.560]  They're not even racist.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.680]  It's just cold-blooded manipulation, divide, and conquer.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.840]  Now I want to go to another clip and a report here of what they're upset about.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.320]  Marine Corps Colonel, Homeland Security Building Domestic Army, we're going to get him on the
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320]  show.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.120]  Fallujah veteran says government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:56.440]  Let's listen to this powerful information, and he knows what's going on.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.520]  And see, now he's decompartmentalized, just retired as a Marine Corps Colonel.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.520]  Here it is.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.520]  You don't need this.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520]  You really don't.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.520]  I was a retired Colonel in the Marine Corps.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.520]  I saw a sign back there that said, if you want more, maybe I'll give you less Fallujah.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.520]  And I spent a year in Fallujah.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.520]  You know what?
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.520]  Life was gone there.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]  I didn't have one.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.520]  I spent, I traveled over 10,000 miles over there.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.520]  And sometimes you got to deal with and go with what you have.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520]  And so that's part of the job.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:27.520]  For one, the second thing is, though, when I was in Iraq, I was in charge, I was a minister
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520]  to the Defense Coordinator.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.520]  My job was to man train and equip the Iraqi army in Al-Ambar, in the Jabh, Karbala, and
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.520]  within the Bill of Provinces.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.520]  And I can tell you right now, well, somebody had the great idea to get rid of the Iraqi
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520]  army.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:42.520]  So when we rebuilt it, we did everything we could to make it as strong as possible.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:50.520]  And I'll tell you right now, Homeland Security would kick their butts in a week.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.520]  What's happening here is we're building a domestic military because it's unlawful or
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.520]  unconstitutional to use American troops on American soil.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.520]  So what we're doing is we're building a military.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:08.520]  My best friend is a SWAT officer in Nashua who came to Iraq with me to train the Iraqi
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.520]  police, sent me an email with a picture of him in the media on the streets of Watertown
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.520]  Mass, wearing the exact same combat gear that we had.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.520]  The full clips up on infowars.com.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520]  It's a little bit better on computer speakers.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.520]  I know for some AM stations, it won't come across too good.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.520]  But he goes on to say, look, these are Homeland Security grants.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.520]  They're pre-deploying it to take over.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:34.520]  And he's saying it from the grant, because the grant says it is for libertarians, sovereign
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:40.520]  citizens, and that that's why they need this armored vehicle.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.520]  And they're sending SWAT teams to Iraq, folks, to take on the American people.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.520]  I mean, I've told you this for years, and they're really gearing up.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.520]  And now they're saying that the libertarians and veterans are the ones behind the Boston
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.520]  bombing.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.520]  They're sitting the game, folks, they're getting ready to stage false flags and blame it on
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.520]  us and try to round us up.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.520]  And it's going to be Marines like this colonel.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.520]  The full article on the info is up on infowars.com.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.520]  Just like Smedley Butler was lined up to be commandant of the Marine Corps, two congressional
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.520]  Medal of Honors, most highly decorated U.S. general in history.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.520]  They didn't have congressional Medal of Honors in George Washington's day, or he'd be the
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520]  only guy.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.520]  Two congressional Medal of Honors.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.520]  Two.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.520]  They hired him to bring in a coup d'etat.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.520]  He set up the coup, blew the whistle.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520]  It was such a big deal.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.520]  They just secretly arrested some of the top coup people.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.520]  But the robber barons were so rich they didn't arrest them.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.520]  By the way, that's even been in the New York Times, London Guardian.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:41.520]  So it was, it was the Marines who they tried to hire that stopped it before.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.520]  Folks, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.520]  And that's why they're upset is because the military, I bet money when we get that colonel
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.520]  won, I bet money he's a listener.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.520]  And he goes over the SWAT teams in the grants to pre-deploy, getting ready for a takeover
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.520]  of America.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:27.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:56.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:25.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:54.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:24.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:51.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:23:20.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:49.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:24:18.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:46.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:25:12.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:41.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:26:10.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:36.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:27:02.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:28.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:54.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:23.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:52.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:29:21.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:49.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:30:18.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:48.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:31:18.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:48.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:32:18.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:45.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:33:00.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:44.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:34:13.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:42.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:35:12.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:39.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:36:08.520]  That's why they want to shut down.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:38.520]  That's why they want to shut down.

[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:35.520]  I was just thinking of one of the programs, one of the nasty programs that the Internal Revenue Service
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:45.520]  you see, they were, the Internal Revenue Service, they were into this, this come by government
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:48.520]  long before some of the other agencies.
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:54.520]  And you see, I've been a part of what I call the freedom movement.
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:56.520]  Some people call it the patriot movement.
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:59.520]  They call it the tax protest movement and all that.
[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:01.520]  I've been part of it now for 40 years.
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:15.520]  And it finally dawned on me one time that the IRS and the government, they have hired sharp guys,
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:26.520]  well-educated guys and such to become infiltrators into the freedom movement and into the tax protest.
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:36.520]  And so these people would come and they would come out of the woodwork seemingly and join up with the tax protesters
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.520]  and they would be sharp, they would have some smarts.
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:47.520]  And the first thing that you know, they would weasel themselves into leadership positions.
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:55.520]  And they would put out false information and people would jump on it because they didn't know that,
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:03:00.520]  you know, they couldn't tell that these guys were infiltrators.
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:07.520]  And so we've had leadership in the freedom movement in this country.
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:12.520]  In this 40 years that I've been around, they've had leadership that worked their way,
[03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:18.520]  people worked their way up to the top leadership and they've written books and all this kind of thing.
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:21.520]  And they put out false information.
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:29.520]  And you see, the IRS and the government, they need tax protesters so that they can send them to jail.
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:31.520]  Absolutely.
[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:38.520]  Cass Sunstein talked about that, cognitive infiltration to put in groups to create infighting and false info.
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:43.520]  To say this guy's a fed, this person's a fed, or to shoot fake videos to get us fighting with each other.
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:46.520]  Red, we're out of time, but it's been over a year since you were on.
[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:52.520]  And I think it's been over 40 years you've been on the, it's almost 50, but you've been fighting the globals from the memory I've got.
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:53.520]  Yeah.
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:55.520]  And we just salute you briefly.
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:04:00.520]  Give out your address and how much it costs for folks that want to get some of your great books and booklets at cost.
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:12.520]  Well, my address is just Red Beckman at P.O. Box 61, Carol, C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S.
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:17.520]  Carol Washington, 98609.
[03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:25.520]  And there is just a limited supply of the law that never was, while they weren't available yet.
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:28.520]  And, and of course, they can buy those.
[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:33.520]  We get $35 plus $5 postage in handling.
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:36.520]  It's a big, huge encyclopedia book and you got a bunch of other booklets.
[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:37.520]  We're out of time.
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:39.520]  Folks can find out at redbeckman.com.
[03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:43.520]  Red, let's get you on the nightly news for a commercial-free interview next week or something.
[03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:44.520]  How's that sound?
[03:04:44.520 --> 03:04:45.520]  Sounds good to me.
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:46.520]  God bless you, brother.
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:48.520]  What an American heat road to talk to Red Beckman.
[03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:49.520]  I'm out of time, folks.
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:51.520]  I got a lot of stuff to do.
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.520]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I got miles to go before I sleep.
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:59.520]  I'm going to be working till 11 o'clock tonight on OD2, Obama Deception 2.
[03:04:59.520 --> 03:05:09.520]  It's racist.
