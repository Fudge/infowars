[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.800 --> 00:19.320]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.320 --> 00:22.880]  Alex Jones
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.720]  all right ladies and gentlemen powerful transmission lined up for you today it is
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.560]  the second day of December 2010 we're going to be live here for at least the
[00:35.560 --> 00:38.720]  next three hours we may even go into overdrive today because at the end of the
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.080]  show Max Kaiser is going to be popping in I got up this morning and noticed his
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.960]  hero hedge Tyler Durgan Max Kaiser's plan to destroy JP Morgan goes mainstream
[00:49.960 --> 00:56.640]  after the Guardians post his silver squeeze thoughts and it's now in the
[00:56.640 --> 01:02.640]  London Guardian today it talks about Max Kaiser and his operation in full wars
[01:02.640 --> 01:08.840]  calm want JP Morgan to crash by silver the campaign to buy silver and force JP
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.480]  Morgan into bankruptcy could work because the liabilities accrued by its
[01:14.480 --> 01:19.240]  short-selling and since Max launched this less than a month ago November hit
[01:19.240 --> 01:25.320]  all-time record high on the non availability of silver right now silver
[01:25.320 --> 01:29.640]  Eagle sales for the month of November at an all-time record high for the
[01:29.640 --> 01:34.240]  availability of silver and the wholesale level is drying up at record
[01:34.240 --> 01:40.240]  levels so Max is going to be popping in the last 20 minutes of this transmission
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.360]  today to get into that and what the ramifications of this arm and he just
[01:45.360 --> 01:49.240]  mentioned it on this show I don't know three weeks ago that we talked about it
[01:49.240 --> 01:56.640]  again last week and now it is on fire on the internet on fire and I said I would
[01:56.640 --> 02:04.000]  do this yesterday but I didn't I will play some YouTube videos that I've seen
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.840]  from some of the most active people out there who were talking about holding
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.880]  physical silver and bringing down the globalist not just JP Morgan who's been
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.160]  caught repeatedly manipulating and suppressing the price of silver so that
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.920]  doesn't show up their fiat paper currency scam but the bankers are
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.160]  certainly waging war on us so we need to stand up and fight back against them
[02:27.160 --> 02:33.440]  Joe see hueson will be joining us jaren did I get that name pronounced right I
[02:33.440 --> 02:42.960]  did I did it wow he'll be joining us he is the director underneath the founder of

[02:56.800 --> 03:02.240]  and they've filed the four-year request to find out about well two big things the

[03:57.280 --> 04:00.680]  opinion and Michael tends to agree that's just how the network decided to
[04:00.680 --> 04:03.760]  air them obviously the police state episode was groundbreaking with the
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.720]  FEMA camps the JFK episode a few weeks ago was groundbreaking they did a

[04:26.000 --> 04:31.360]  now that's in tomorrow's show coming up but I gave them a lot of intel but they
[04:31.360 --> 04:35.080]  dug up stuff I didn't even know or I didn't know when they were consulting
[04:35.080 --> 04:38.920]  with me a few months ago I simultaneously learned about the uranium a few
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.680]  weeks ago after they discovered it and I didn't know that was in the episode do
[04:42.680 --> 04:47.400]  I talk to Michael yesterday the uranium they're putting in the water so big

[08:30.040 --> 08:36.200]  day of December 2010 Max Keiser is coming up about the London Guardian
[08:36.200 --> 08:45.440]  report covering his plan to crash JP Morgan by holding physical silver we've
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.040]  got Michael Braverman coming on to get into the secrets of water not just the
[08:50.040 --> 08:53.880]  fluoride being added not just the globalist attempt to corner the water
[08:53.880 --> 08:58.040]  market and to take it all over not just here but worldwide but also to add
[08:58.040 --> 09:04.400]  uranium and other goodies to it so next they'll tell us uranium is good for our
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.120]  teeth probably and have TV ads and say you're a conspiracy theorist if you
[09:08.120 --> 09:14.480]  don't like drinking uranium so that is all coming up there's a new video that's
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.040]  embedded in an article up on info wars.com and prison planet.com that we're
[09:19.040 --> 09:22.640]  going to be playing later here in its entirety at the start of the next hour
[09:22.640 --> 09:28.120]  and I want to kick off with the article that goes along with it first it's the
[09:28.120 --> 09:33.120]  bankers or us that's the headline by an article by my shelf and Aaron Dykes the
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.080]  austerity hammer starts to fall in the United States as debt consumes Europe
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.360]  and on the heels of all of this being announced what do we learn well for our
[09:42.360 --> 09:49.120]  audience we didn't learn really much new except for the fact that private US
[09:49.120 --> 09:55.640]  corporations that weren't even connected to finance companies were given
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.760]  hundreds of millions in some cases and tens of billions in other cases of tax
[10:00.760 --> 10:08.440]  payer money during the banker bailout of 2008 that continued right through from
[10:08.440 --> 10:14.440]  Bush into Obama and one of the biggest recipients was MSNBC and NBC television
[10:14.440 --> 10:19.520]  both broadcast and cable no wonder they say you're a Nazi if you don't want
[10:19.520 --> 10:26.200]  government-run healthcare no wonder they're they're so cartoonish because 100%
[10:26.200 --> 10:32.800]  Chris Matthews Rachel Maddow all of them they are paid off by the federal
[10:32.800 --> 10:39.080]  government and by the way this payoff is taking place during Bush remember how
[10:39.080 --> 10:42.400]  it was real strange when Bush was in MSNBC was still somewhat positive and
[10:42.400 --> 10:47.400]  then Obama gets in they're even more positive it is literally state-run
[10:47.400 --> 10:52.480]  media more than even Russia today had some original government funding to be
[10:52.480 --> 10:58.680]  founded I mean it is literally covertly run at least with things like RT which
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.960]  you know covers some you know fair issues but also isn't too hardcore when
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.440]  it comes to reporting on the Russian government they're out in the open that
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.680]  they had some government funding to be founded here it's like oh there's no
[11:11.680 --> 11:19.880]  government involved in ABC NBC CBS and yes Fox Fox is mainly paid off though by
[11:19.880 --> 11:27.960]  their by their fiction departments by Fox TV itself that's where a lot of their
[11:27.960 --> 11:31.960]  money comes in we've analyzed this and then there's not really much bailout
[11:31.960 --> 11:37.600]  money going to news core they're getting paid through propaganda placement the
[11:37.600 --> 11:41.640]  term I coined over a decade ago the government now last year admitted okay
[11:41.640 --> 11:47.200]  it's not really propaganda placement it is behavior placement and it was even in
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.200]  what the New York Times a few months ago that NBC was getting a lot of that
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.520]  money to NBC of course General Electric the bomb makers they are some of the
[11:55.520 --> 12:02.680]  worst out there and so we're now just confirming what's in the Obama deception
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.320]  what's in follow the Republic that hundreds and hundreds of billions of
[12:07.320 --> 12:12.600]  dollars the estimates that Tarpley had in the Obama deception are now accurate
[12:12.600 --> 12:17.280]  proven to be completely accurate at least 200 bill that was in the first
[12:17.280 --> 12:23.680]  phase went to European banks now the European press blames the United States
[12:23.680 --> 12:29.520]  for dollar devaluation when a lot of that money's going overseas see this is a
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.840]  global corporate system sucking dry Europe sucking dry the US sucking dry
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.440]  Ireland sucking dry England sucking dry Eastern Europe sucking dry Asia sucking
[12:40.440 --> 12:45.760]  dry Africa sucking dry Latin America it's all the exact same players and then
[12:45.760 --> 12:49.800]  they know how we love to be divided and conquered so they'll say it's the
[12:49.800 --> 12:55.080]  Europeans fault it's the Americans fault we're all in the same boat together
[12:55.080 --> 13:03.120]  and that's what my video covers in detail it's the bankers or us it's a 15
[13:03.120 --> 13:09.240]  minute or 14 and a half minute video very important please send this article

[17:36.760 --> 17:41.120]  we're private no one can audit us but they know times running out so
[17:41.120 --> 17:45.360]  preemptively they come out and they say okay we gave hundreds of billions to
[17:45.360 --> 17:51.080]  Europe we gave money to MSNBC we gave money to almost every major Fortune 100
[17:51.080 --> 17:59.040]  gave them money your tax money to be part of this criminal operation I mean
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.960]  this is like Caesar is buying off the Senate and you notice it's bipartisan
[18:03.960 --> 18:08.640]  the neocons are going crazy with this on talk radio going look at Obama Obama is
[18:08.640 --> 18:14.040]  a teleprompter reader who works out twice a day and takes naps and watches
[18:14.040 --> 18:18.320]  Sports Center and then he goes out and gives four or five speeches a day
[18:18.320 --> 18:25.720]  Obama isn't running Jack Diddley squat sure he's a dangerous figurehead sure
[18:25.720 --> 18:30.520]  he was probably born in Africa gave up a citizenship in Indonesia he's unsavory
[18:30.520 --> 18:36.320]  I don't like him but so what they want you to get so caught up in hating him
[18:36.320 --> 18:42.480]  just like so caught up in hating George W. Bush George W. Bush was a virtual
[18:42.480 --> 18:49.520]  puppet an absolute puppet lesser so than I mean he was about 95% puppet
[18:49.520 --> 18:59.640]  Obama's about 99% puppet Bill Clinton was about 60% puppet I mean he was evil
[18:59.640 --> 19:05.320]  a globalist an absolute collectivist former CIA his same as his wife we even

[19:08.520 --> 19:14.320]  absolutely horrible but he was in there running things to a certain extent so
[19:14.320 --> 19:18.880]  was Nixon until he got too big for his britches and they flushed him down the
[19:18.880 --> 19:22.800]  toilet as you know and that's now come out remember ten years ago talking about
[19:22.800 --> 19:29.240]  how they set him up now that's mainstream news you know the issue here is that
[19:29.240 --> 19:35.120]  George Herbert Walker Bush was president from the time they shot Reagan when he
[19:35.120 --> 19:41.720]  was vice president and then that one term so he was basically president for two
[19:41.720 --> 19:45.360]  and a half terms or so or more we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen into the
[19:45.360 --> 19:53.000]  banking MSNBC is 110% discredited it is a complete absolute federal government

[34:53.040 --> 35:02.080]  the water that separately I'd already seen years ago but forgotten about and
[35:02.080 --> 35:09.920]  kind of rediscovered three weeks ago when I saw the news headline in Texas of
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.520]  Texas with the federal government suppressed for decades high levels of
[35:13.520 --> 35:21.560]  uranium and other radioactive isotopes like radium in the water but what they
[35:21.560 --> 35:25.600]  don't tell you is that's from the fluoride that they mine out of the
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.680]  phosphate limestone that's the same place they mine for uranium that's
[35:30.680 --> 35:36.080]  where uranium deposits are just search the term where do you find uranium
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.040]  deposits and you'll get all the university geology sites saying limestone
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.000]  deposits it'll tell you the same place they mine for phosphates is where you
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  find this it's in Florida and to Colorado are some of the areas where you
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.080]  find the most uranium then you find out about companies that mine uranium it's
[35:56.080 --> 36:03.720]  the same companies that mine for the fluoride but the public has like a
[36:03.720 --> 36:11.080]  defense mechanism where they can't hear this information it's too scary so it's
[36:11.080 --> 36:14.560]  just shut up there's no uranium in my water well we're gonna be talking about
[36:14.560 --> 36:17.160]  that coming up with some other big breaking news with Michael Braverman
[36:17.160 --> 36:24.800]  I'm gonna continue next hour getting into fed aid in financial crisis went
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.360]  beyond US banks to industry and foreign firms and they just kind of hide it in
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.000]  plain view oh most the big media's government funded uh-huh the media's
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.280]  already gotten its quote bailout or its payoff meanwhile the FCC and the rest
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.160]  of them are coming in saying they want to censor the internet and alternative
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.120]  media and talk radio when you read these articles talk radio didn't get any
[36:48.120 --> 36:54.760]  government money this is not a free country taking my tax money at a gun
[36:54.760 --> 36:59.240]  barrel to give it to Chris Matthews to go up there and try to claim I'm a racist
[36:59.240 --> 37:06.000]  because I don't want government health care think of how sick that is and how
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.080]  they've hidden all this classic corruption I've got another big
[37:12.080 --> 37:18.400]  announcement coming up at the 20 after next hour 24 after next hour that you're
[37:18.400 --> 37:24.560]  going to want to stay tuned for as well it's a big announcement so so stay
[37:24.560 --> 37:38.200]  with us on that front okay I want to play this video and it is the search term
[37:38.200 --> 37:44.840]  today it's the bankers or us put in that full short sentence it's the bankers or
[37:44.840 --> 37:48.880]  us or you can just put in bankers or us we can get both search terms up there at
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.360]  the top as a little 14-minute video we put together we're gonna go ahead and
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.840]  roll that now and then I'm gonna come back and continue to break it down stay
[37:57.840 --> 38:00.080]  with us
[38:06.920 --> 38:12.040]  my friends it doesn't matter if you're in the United States England Germany
[38:12.040 --> 38:18.680]  Japan areas of Africa South America it doesn't matter we are all in the same
[38:18.680 --> 38:26.480]  boat together the private banking cartel six major super banks have created
[38:26.480 --> 38:33.920]  Ponzi schemes they have sold over 1.5 quadrillion that's 1,500 trillion
[38:33.920 --> 38:41.040]  dollars of fraudulent derivatives counterfeit instruments financial
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.320]  instruments of fraud the IMF and World Bank are their international holding
[38:46.320 --> 38:49.720]  companies regionally we have the private central bank of the u.s. the
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.040]  Federal Reserve the Bank of England over in England we have the private
[38:54.040 --> 38:59.120]  central bank in Ireland it's the same everywhere except for a few quote rogue
[38:59.120 --> 39:03.240]  nations that aren't controlled by this cartel and those are countries being
[39:03.240 --> 39:10.120]  ministered by the globalist military they are engineering the total collapse of
[39:10.120 --> 39:14.040]  society I've been talking about this for 11 years since they got rid of the
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.240]  last legal act here in the u.s. and simultaneously in other nations got laws
[39:19.240 --> 39:24.920]  passed so they could do this and get away with it on the way up with the
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.360]  thousands of trillions that they manufactured out of nothing they bought
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.480]  up the entire infrastructure the media the defense contractors everything on
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.760]  the way down they hold populations hostage and say give us trillions more
[39:36.760 --> 39:41.240]  or we will implode the economy that's what happened over two years ago in
[39:41.240 --> 39:46.120]  October of 2008 when Henry Paulson the secretary of the Treasury went and told
[39:46.120 --> 39:49.480]  the House and Senate there'll be martial law blood in the streets total
[39:49.480 --> 39:54.640]  collapse if you don't do what we want here we are two years later Europe gave
[39:54.640 --> 40:01.800]  him Japan gave him the United States gave him and now you see Ireland you see
[40:01.800 --> 40:07.080]  Greece you see Portugal Spain Germany on the edge of collapse and what do the
[40:07.080 --> 40:12.360]  central bankers say give us trillions more raise your taxes in your countries
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.960]  cut benefits and pay almost everything that you raise in taxes to us but it's
[40:18.960 --> 40:23.800]  mathematically impossible listen to me I've interviewed literally hundreds of
[40:23.800 --> 40:30.720]  top economists on this this is a fact it is mathematically impossible to ever
[40:30.720 --> 40:37.200]  pay back the 1.5 quadrillion that's a conservative number they know that and
[40:37.200 --> 40:46.040]  so look at Ireland just a few months ago they entered the EU they were told oh
[40:46.040 --> 40:49.880]  you're a great economy it's so wonderful but under the EU agreement they're now
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.400]  under the control of those private banks and suddenly oh my gosh your
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.600]  economy's over you've got to pay 20% of your GDP on top of what you're already
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.160]  paying to offshore banks the head of their private central bank told the BBC
[41:04.160 --> 41:09.920]  that we want foreign banks to own Ireland this is a good thing Irish banks are up
[41:09.920 --> 41:14.000]  for sale we're going to cut your pension funds the government forced you to pay in
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.720]  for decades we're going to cut the veterans care we're going to again
[41:18.720 --> 41:25.280]  slash road repairs you name it but the taxes go up everything goes to the
[41:25.280 --> 41:31.880]  private bankers that's austerity they cut the budget for the population see
[41:31.880 --> 41:34.920]  first they get you dependent on government this is their system they
[41:34.920 --> 41:37.840]  grow government and this has happened all over the world over and over again
[41:37.840 --> 41:41.200]  the globalists are done gobbling up third world countries they're moving on to
[41:41.200 --> 41:45.360]  Europe the United States now no one is safe Australia Canada you name it the
[41:45.360 --> 41:49.640]  same system is taking place that's how we knew what they would do in the West
[41:49.640 --> 41:53.160]  because we'd seen them do it in the third world we saw the economic hitmen
[41:53.160 --> 41:57.360]  setting up the same system this is such important information and I hope you're
[41:57.360 --> 42:02.240]  listening to me there is no light at the end of the tunnel unless we do not pay
[42:02.240 --> 42:06.720]  these bankers all this fraudulent debt they've manufactured if we don't throw
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.040]  these private central banks out of our countries if we don't return sound
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.880]  monetary policy controlled by our Congress and parliaments this is designed
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.360]  to implode economies and transfer all wealth to them that's why whether it's
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.160]  Europe or the United States or any other country or region they control the
[42:26.160 --> 42:29.760]  central banks and the private banks are making record profits in the trillions
[42:29.760 --> 42:36.680]  billions and individual bonuses in many cases they know what they're doing this
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.960]  is a consolidation of power and control they're slashing police locally they're
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.720]  slashing basic services but the taxes go up because everything is going to them
[42:45.720 --> 42:52.800]  now remember the United States is about a year behind Europe and in Europe in
[42:52.800 --> 42:58.440]  the last year they have been slashing police cutting roads raising literally
[42:58.440 --> 43:03.160]  in some countries hundreds of new taxes per nation they have been squeezing the
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.640]  population they have been turning paramilitary tax collectors loose on
[43:07.640 --> 43:11.240]  people they've been getting rid of all the tax exemptions they are squeezing
[43:11.240 --> 43:18.160]  and squeezing and squeezing like the sheriff of Nottingham from the fables
[43:18.160 --> 43:23.760]  of England hundreds and hundreds of years ago with Robin Hood and his
[43:23.760 --> 43:30.280]  merry men this is actually happening to us and so the media is spinning this in
[43:30.280 --> 43:34.360]  Europe and here in the US saying oh look at good conservative politicians they
[43:34.360 --> 43:39.240]  are slashing infrastructure spending they're slashing pensions there they're
[43:39.240 --> 43:43.120]  slashing veterans benefits aren't they great they'll get us out of this problem
[43:43.120 --> 43:50.440]  that's a tiny piece the whole US debt is 14 trillion there's 1.5 quadrillion
[43:50.440 --> 43:56.840]  worldwide and even the Washington Post estimates the US's share of that is 600
[43:56.840 --> 44:02.040]  trillion it's impossible they could devalue the money like this was Zimbabwe or
[44:02.040 --> 44:08.680]  Weimar Republic Germany in the 1920s and 30s and it's impossible do you
[44:08.680 --> 44:13.440]  understand all the solutions they give you are only to consolidate power it's
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.640]  economic warfare so Europe on average is about a year ahead of us and you watch
[44:18.640 --> 44:21.940]  as we told you in my film Obama deception a year and a half ago it would
[44:21.940 --> 44:26.320]  start in Greece and then Ireland and then Portugal and in Spain that's what
[44:26.320 --> 44:30.240]  the economists we interviewed said would happen it would then move to England
[44:30.240 --> 44:35.840]  and Germany and France now it is it would then travel to the United States this
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.520]  is all engineered I cannot stress that enough to you and that they would cut
[44:40.520 --> 44:44.120]  veterans benefits that they'd signed on and were guaranteed basic health care
[44:44.120 --> 44:48.960]  that they would federalize your private pensions and tax them and reduce them in
[44:48.960 --> 44:52.320]  the name of saving them because the pensions are invested in the derivatives
[44:52.320 --> 44:59.320]  fraud that's the trap they hold you hostage they get you to invest in their
[44:59.320 --> 45:03.120]  derivatives your county your city your police pension your federal pension and
[45:03.120 --> 45:07.040]  then that money's not there oh if you want to get that pension you've got to
[45:07.040 --> 45:11.080]  bail out the banks but it's not a bailout they set this up and so now
[45:11.080 --> 45:15.360]  it's here just this week White House official Obama to freeze pay a federal
[45:15.360 --> 45:19.600]  workers notice all the news in the last week about how oh he doubled the amount
[45:19.600 --> 45:24.480]  of federal workers getting 150,000 oh about how great they're having it that's
[45:24.480 --> 45:29.080]  to sell them as the main scapegoat I'm not against cutting their pay I'm not
[45:29.080 --> 45:33.040]  against freezing their pay but you do it after you've arrested the central
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.880]  bank heads you do it after you've written off the 1.5 quadrillion that's
[45:36.880 --> 45:41.720]  impossible to pay off you do it after you brought a true monetary system into
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.760]  existence but you wouldn't have to do that with all these cuts if you got rid
[45:45.760 --> 45:49.240]  of this corrupt fractional reserve banking system I do want to cut government
[45:49.240 --> 45:52.880]  because it's used as an agent of tyranny it was put in place and grown to
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.640]  suppress us during this implosion phase during this shearing phase the
[45:57.640 --> 46:01.000]  shearing of the sheep so now they've announced that they're going to freeze
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.280]  the pay of federal workers for two years and then probably cut it
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.880]  Bloomberg of course has reported over a year ago that pension funds are being
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.240]  ordered private pension funds to quote invest in failed mega banks there's no
[46:13.240 --> 46:17.600]  law but federal regulators come like the mafia and say you better do it it's come
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.960]  out in the last few months also an AP and Bloomberg that 11 years ago a secret
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.080]  deal was signed by Prudential and other major insurance companies with the VA to
[46:26.080 --> 46:30.120]  allow them to steal all of the death benefits that the troops pay out of
[46:30.120 --> 46:35.040]  their check for if they die in battle or after they die so their widow or widower
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.160]  gets the money that was all just stolen this is the greatest swindle and the
[46:39.160 --> 46:44.560]  most brazen I've ever seen studying history it is so off the charts because
[46:44.560 --> 46:48.680]  the average American only cares about sports or rioting and looting you know
[46:48.680 --> 46:51.960]  during Black Friday that after Thanksgiving to get their little slave
[46:51.960 --> 46:57.960]  goods now this is key remember the article from March 21st 2009 in Stars
[46:57.960 --> 47:05.440]  and Stripes over a year ago and in it Obama proposed that they make all
[47:05.440 --> 47:12.080]  military people by their own insurance for combat related injuries they've
[47:12.080 --> 47:15.360]  signed a contract guarantee that they get their arms and legs blown off uncle
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.120]  Sam the taxpayer is going to pay for it veterans of foreign wars veterans
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.080]  organization went wild got angry said no to this plan and Obama backed off for a
[47:24.080 --> 47:28.520]  year now they're back and in the New York Times pitching it to you like it's a
[47:28.520 --> 47:32.120]  great thing and they're announcing hey there's two million people that are on
[47:32.120 --> 47:35.680]  government paid for insurance because they're veterans the government wants
[47:35.680 --> 47:41.000]  to take that away take the health care completely away from the veterans it
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.600]  continues here's the Wall Street Journal Union drops health coverage for
[47:44.600 --> 47:50.000]  workers it's a union in New York and they're dropping coverage for the
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.040]  children of the workers this is austerity you pay into these pensions you
[47:55.040 --> 47:59.480]  pay into these unions you go and join the military you do everything and
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.680]  they're even cutting it from those groups if they'll go after the veterans
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.560]  they'll go after anybody under austerity that's been done in hundreds of
[48:07.560 --> 48:12.200]  countries over and over again in just the last 20 years we know what the
[48:12.200 --> 48:16.480]  private central banks are going to do and once the country fully is bankrupt
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.200]  whether you're Ireland or the US it doesn't matter it's the same formula they
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.280]  are going to shut everything down and once the economy fully disintegrates
[48:24.280 --> 48:28.360]  they're going to triple water triple power prices they're gonna force the
[48:28.360 --> 48:31.840]  government to hand all these infrastructures over to them they are
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.440]  going to completely sell out the nation even further you think that's
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.680]  communist Chinese run the Panama Canal and most are former military ports on
[48:38.680 --> 48:43.920]  our east and west coast you think that's bad you think the Arabs you're owning
[48:43.920 --> 48:47.200]  so much of our infrastructure is bad you think foreign banks you're coming in
[48:47.200 --> 48:50.880]  here with a fire cell buying up our companies is bad and our highways you
[48:50.880 --> 48:56.320]  ain't seen nothing yet austerity is total enslavement economic bondage for you
[48:56.320 --> 49:02.480]  and your family and it's all a fraud the mega banks engineer it they get tens of
[49:02.480 --> 49:06.920]  trillions of dollars of tax money they implode the economy and demand even
[49:06.920 --> 49:12.360]  more because we're held hostage by them and it's not even a solution it's only
[49:12.360 --> 49:16.400]  going to get worse it is a distraction to cut the veterans health care it is a
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.280]  distraction to steal people's pension funds it is pure robbery we must kick
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.120]  this system out we must bring these bankers of justice and right off this
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.840]  fraudulent debt we do not owe it but the banks in the last hundred years in the
[49:29.840 --> 49:34.640]  West have openly fostered this system of getting us into debt so they could
[49:34.640 --> 49:39.920]  profit on the fiat loans they make up out of nothing but we're now entering the
[49:39.920 --> 49:44.600]  endgame where they're fully imploding us by design it's the bankers or us we
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.000]  don't have a choice you've got to tell everyone you know about this you've got
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.600]  to inform them so they understand you know I mentioned these earlier but again
[49:53.600 --> 49:58.920]  here it is BBC News Irish Republic Banks for sale and they've got the head of
[49:58.920 --> 50:02.280]  their private central bank that runs the country this fourth branch of government
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.840]  Patrick Hunahan openly saying that the International Monetary Fund will now
[50:07.840 --> 50:12.360]  save Ireland and how will they do that by slashing pensions by cutting police by
[50:12.360 --> 50:16.120]  cheating veterans in their health care it's it's the same laundry list it
[50:16.120 --> 50:21.080]  always is and he goes on to say I've been an advocate for many years of the
[50:21.080 --> 50:27.160]  value for small countries to have foreign owners for their banks did you
[50:27.160 --> 50:34.320]  just hear me this is treason and it's the same thing here this is a global
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.360]  government a private corporate global government taking over every major
[50:38.360 --> 50:43.560]  society with the same formula it is fraudulent and it must be resisted or
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.840]  we have no future we cannot allow this new dark age to begin all right there's
[50:47.840 --> 50:51.920]  a few minutes left of it you can watch the rest at info wars calm the article
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.600]  in the video was titled it's the bankers or us we'll come back and talk about how
[50:56.600 --> 51:03.240]  much money they've stolen stay with us men take control of your prostate health

[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:17.680]  pumped in to other fortune 100 companies 21,000 transactions are still
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:25.600]  secret they are keeping secret data for 885 billion in financial crisis loans
[1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:29.840]  those are zero percent interest
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:39.320]  fed with holes collateral data for 885 billion in financial crisis loans your
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:43.960]  tax money the federal reserve with held details and you notice all these banks
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:48.720]  and companies are out starting up credit divisions with 15 to 30 percent interest
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.640]  notice your credit card interest went up they get zero percent oh yeah the fed

[1:01:58.180 --> 1:02:02.960]  banks not you the federal reserve with held details on individual securities
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:08.040]  pledges collateral by receipts of 885 billion in central bank loans denying
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:13.280]  taxpayers a measure of the risk they face from its emergency aid this is only
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:18.280]  one type of loans they've got other just pure debt creation and the derivatives
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:21.120]  they're still pumping see they take a lot of this money and invest it in new
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:25.920]  derivatives which allows them to leverage it 100 plus to one and that's
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:30.160]  congressional hearings it's over 100 to one not the old fractional equation of
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:35.960]  10 to 1 the central bank yesterday released data on 21,000 transactions
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:42.240]  from the 3.3 trillion in emergency lending to stem the financial crisis but
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:47.280]  they did not release as many or even more transactions they won't even say
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:53.000]  that number July's Dodd-Frank law required the Fed to disclose the names of
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.840]  borrowers the size the interest rate and loans and information identifying the
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:01.360]  types of amounts of collateral pledged or assets transferred then again the
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:04.360]  federal reserve gets those assets through their puppets they control the
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:09.640]  Treasury for three of the fed six emergency facilities a central bank
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:13.920]  released information on groups of collateral and accepted by asset type
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:19.040]  and rating without specifically identifying securities so again half of
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:23.760]  them among those was the primary dealer credit facility created in March of 08

[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:40.880]  one or more they don't have the silver but they're in the market manipulating it
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:46.080]  driving the price down if you go out and physically buy silver if just a three
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:49.360]  or four million people depending on what estimate you look at go out and buy
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:56.280]  just a few ounces it will force JP Morgan and other powerful private
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:06.200]  fellow reserve owners to come out and try to basically pay off the bets they've
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:11.080]  made and they don't have the money and so this is a grassroots thing that
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:15.680]  started I remember hearing this over the decade ago people talking about how we
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:19.040]  could do this but now enough people are educated about it that it's happening
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:24.880]  again now the Hunt brothers tried this back in 1980 but even though they were
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:32.240]  billionaires they couldn't stand up against the hundreds of billionaires
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:39.200]  the entire globalists swarm coming in and basically destroying them financially
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:43.000]  now the Hunt brothers were able to corner the market drive up to $50 an ounce
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.960]  in 1980 but now here's the zero hedge report Max Kaiser's plan to destroy JP
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:56.080]  Morgan goes mainstream after the Guardian post his silver squeeze thoughts and
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:00.240]  here's that London Guardian report written by Max Kaiser he gives us a nice
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:05.320]  plug want JP Morgan to crash by silver and yes about a month ago and then
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:09.360]  again a week and a half ago he launched this here on the show it is turbo
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:15.520]  charged it since then and we're starting to see record prices for silver
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:25.360]  silver's up 9% since it started in the particular area of silver rounds and so
[1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:31.600]  that's very very exciting right now silver Eagles for the month of November
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:35.000]  had an all-time record high and the availability of silver on the wholesale
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.040]  level is drying up and we're seeing that at coin shops all over the country and
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.360]  right here in Austin so I wanted to play another little short video it's titled
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:48.200]  we are the modern-day Hunt brothers by the same great YouTube director who we
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:52.880]  played a few days ago who made that the madness of a lost society just search the
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:55.760]  term we are the modern-day Hunt brothers I'm gonna have Aaron Dykes when he gets
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:00.080]  in he was up here late last night post this at info wars calm and we're gonna
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:04.240]  post this video at GCN live calm but I wanted to go ahead and play this video
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:16.240]  and audio now for you to show the power of what's starting at the grassroots here it is
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:22.120]  in 1973 the wealthy hunt family of Texas decided to buy precious metals as a
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:25.960]  hedge against inflation the hunts recognized the dangers of Nixon's
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:29.920]  decision at Rothschild Asian Henry Kissinger's urging to close the gold
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.760]  window the hunts believed in hard money and since the hunts were billionaires
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:37.680]  and at the time owning gold was illegal for Americans the hunts turned their
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:41.920]  attention to the common man's metal silver which didn't sit well with the
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:45.640]  central bankers who own the printing press the hunts were targeted and made
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:50.120]  to pay for their folly and eventually lost most of their fortune flash forward
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:55.000]  today fiat papers still rules and the feds Qe2 promises to destroy what
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.680]  remains of confidence in our dollar and like the hunt brothers people around the
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:02.560]  world are waking up to the dangers of a fiat system like the hunt brothers we
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:06.960]  are advocates of hard money constitutional money but unlike the
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:12.160]  hunts we will not be defeated and we will not stand down we are united we
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:27.680]  stand together we have identified the criminal bankers Achilles heel and its
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:33.080]  physical silver we stand together we stand together we all stand together against
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:37.600]  the criminal banks every time you knock the price down we're gonna buy more we
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:42.360]  stand together as the world awakens to the criminality of this fiat debt-based
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:46.680]  system we stand at the ready helping to educate our brothers as they emerge from
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:50.360]  their long hypnotic slumber and though the criminal banks continue to win
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:55.600]  occasional battles they are losing the war 30 ounces of silver thousand ounces
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:00.160]  of silver in the big banks I'm gonna get half an ounce of it 215 ounces of
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:08.360]  physical silver 35 ounces 300 ounces of silver five ounces 500 ounces of physical
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:12.400]  silver these same banks who once had the power to bring down the hunt brothers
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:16.320]  cannot bring down thousands and thousands of us standing shoulder to
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:20.320]  shoulder backed by knowledge backed by physical is doing the people out there
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:25.640]  just like me against the criminal bankers we stand united against the
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:31.720]  criminal banks against the elitists we will not give in we will fight your
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:35.800]  corruption has been revealed and your criminality can no longer hide in the
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:40.320]  shadows the weak immoral men behind the curtain now have a very very big problem
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:46.240]  humanity hungers for liberty this is our time and we are backed by physical
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:52.400]  silver we are we are we are we are the modern-day hunt brothers the modern-day
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:59.200]  coverage the modern-day hunt brothers we are five physical silver and bring
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:06.120]  down the criminal banks take that mr. J. P. Morgan
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:19.560]  all right great job it's got a little bit more left of the video and the actual
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:23.600]  name of the video is modern-day hunt brothers crash J. P. Morgan by physical
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:29.840]  silver and it's from the YouTube channel SGT Bullo 7 really great videos on
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:34.600]  that channel they cannot stop us all and that's what this radio show is it's a
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:38.520]  platform to bring on other great activists other great minds to give
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:44.120]  attention to other great people fighting online putting out their passion
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:51.480]  having an effect it's beautiful what we can do together now the Fed has put out
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:57.240]  data on around a trillion of the money they've handed out but Bloomberg
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:02.800]  reports there's another 885 billion that they're keeping secret and it's also
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:09.880]  confirmed by the Washington Post that MSNBC and NBC TV illegally did not tell
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:14.320]  the public or even the IRS that they'd gotten money from the federal government
[1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:21.200]  but see they're all above the law I was just during the break I thought we've
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:26.120]  got Fox News and CNN on you know with with the sound off and they had text on
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:33.200]  the screen saying the IRS is going to demand double tax filings this year and
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:38.400]  they're trying to pass laws toward the CPAs basically work for the IRS I mean
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:41.960]  they're getting rid of all the tax exemptions they're totally squeezing
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:49.240]  everybody meanwhile Google pays 2.4 percent tax they've written it where
[1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:54.960]  billionaires pay almost nothing but if you're somebody making 200,000 a year
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:16:00.320]  and you got 10, 15 employees you've got to buy insurance for all of them which
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:06.600]  cuts their pay and then every week hundreds and hundreds of new companies
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:15.880]  are announced Walmart McDonald's Burger King you name it Jack in the box they
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:22.320]  don't have to get insurance for their employees just like these mega
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:26.680]  corporations get your tax money and bailouts secretly no one can compete
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:32.240]  against this this is corporate fascism and I've always explained this to
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:38.960]  political scientists the corporate fascist always fund socialism to
[1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:42.960]  consolidate the general public's wealth to get people dependent so they can hold
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:47.720]  them hostage through their pension funds so it's socialism sits on the bottom
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:52.680]  with fascism on top you don't have socialists in fascist countries they
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:56.600]  always go together you have a socialist system with a fascist system sitting on
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:17:00.400]  top and you try to talk to liberal intellectuals they can't get this you
[1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:06.680]  try to talk to conservative intellectuals they can't get it it's a
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:13.200]  false paradigm history is right out in front of all of you
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:20.520]  I was talking to a leading magazine reporter a few weeks ago when he did
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:23.440]  get he goes no I remember reading a book called small is beautiful I haven't
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:27.880]  read it yet you know dealing with that and that's something that socialist and
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:31.960]  people need to get through their brains okay if you have a socialist system big
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:41.040]  mega banks are going to come in and they are going to lobby and take over that
[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:44.640]  money trough that's been created you individuals are never going to get that
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:48.560]  trough even if you believe in socialism all right shifting back to the silver
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:54.040]  situation silver's going up gold is right up at 1400 today the silver is
[1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:58.120]  running out that's mainstream news it looks like this routing of the bank
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:02.400]  stars and calling their bluff on their manipulation of silver and gold can
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:07.240]  happen and they may drive it down later but we just keep buying they can't do it
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:10.720]  forever Ted Anderson what do you think of the video we just covered hey the
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:14.080]  video sounds like a great production that'll be I can't wait to get back to
[1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:18.880]  my computer to watch that thing I can tell you right now silver's a hot buy I
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:24.280]  mean we're sitting right now with silver seeing a peak today of $29.05 an
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:31.920]  ounce gold only 30 30 cents away from $1400 an ounce now I mean it is do you
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:37.040]  realize that China increase their imports on gold by five times just short of that
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:41.160]  five the majority of futures for the end of the month Bloomberg reported our
[1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:45.960]  1500 an ounce for gold I don't know if that's gonna happen but the issue here
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:49.200]  is Ted you bought this silver and gold when when the globalists ran it down
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:52.840]  knowing it would shoot right back up you can offer the silver and gold the
[1:18:52.840 --> 1:18:57.160]  lower price right now but not for long it's gonna run out well that's certainly
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:00.800]  for the same price as I could have earlier this week was silver $3 lower
[1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:03.880]  than where it is right now all right tell folks what you got silver for right
[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:08.400]  now right now the best thing that we have is the walking liberties at 1284 but
[1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:12.400]  we have you know we have bags of silver we have here's what's going on I mean
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:16.280]  the US Eagle silver Eagles right now we're getting those finally man it's
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:21.760]  just been like pulling teeth the the the price of us one ounce silver bars and
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:26.560]  hundred ounce bars US Eagles and all that stuff are breaking away the physical
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:30.560]  markets breaking away from the futures market because the futures market is all
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:34.600]  smoke and mirrors it's all leverage and they don't even have a break and come
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:42.920]  back with it I got a big announcement but 800 686 2237 800 686 237 Ted has the

[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:27.520]  now to be specific silver's up at $29 an ounce right now and rising gold is only
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:33.280]  30 cents away 1400 that's psychological barrier it's even come out in
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:37.160]  congressional reports that we've covered here that the mega banks are
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:44.520]  suppressing gold and silver they are in the market but I have never seen talking
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:47.520]  to different gold brokers talking to local businesses that sell silver and
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:51.840]  gold talking to listeners across the country I have never seen such a drying
[1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:58.440]  up of gold and silver and such a disparity between what the mercantiles
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:05.920]  of the world say gold and silver is worth and what it's selling for that said
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:13.620]  the real market it's trading way silver way above the 29 in gold way above the
[1:25:13.620 --> 1:25:20.880]  1400 there's huge premiums if you can get it almost everywhere Ted has been
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:26.600]  around 30 plus years in the Midas incarnation for what 13 14 years I guess
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:32.000]  yeah it's 14 years and he's got the connections and he's having trouble but
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:36.240]  he's not greedy he bought it in the last few weeks when I drove it down he's got
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:40.400]  it for you now that it's going up at the old price specifically and briefly Ted
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:44.640]  get into what you're facing what you're seeing I got a big announcement
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:50.720]  coming up here it may have to be in the next segment explain to people the type
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:54.600]  of drying up you're seeing from your perspective and briefly what you've got
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.160]  for them today well just people need to understand when the banks are in
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:02.120]  manipulating the price of silver by selling short contracts that's just it
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:06.840]  their contracts it's not physical we're looking at premiums driving up I mean
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:11.200]  that buffalo coin just went over a hundred and thirty dollars over spot just
[1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:15.760]  to buy a buffalo in the wholesale market I mean that's before I even get my hands
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:21.480]  on it I mean the the relationship between physical eagles and the spots over
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:25.600]  bars of 100 ounce bars of silver it doesn't matter what you're like in
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:30.760]  Venezuela when Hugo Chavez says rice cost this by the pound or a gallon of
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:35.040]  petrol cost this but in his socialist system it really cost a lot more on the
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:39.480]  ground and and so now we're living in the La La Land where you know they say
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:45.600]  that unemployment's 9.6 but every other economist as it's pushing 23% I mean
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:50.520]  we're now seeing the pure La La Land being illustrated it's exactly right too
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:54.240]  much manipulation and you can't do it in the physical market so the physical
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:58.040]  markets showing what's really going on and it's clearly across the board every
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:02.080]  single dealer in the United States is dealing with it Alex if people want to

[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:28.240]  I'll get into this bravely I'll announce it more in the days to come I want to
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:32.440]  build a first-class social network that also lets people organize and get
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:37.160]  together we spent a bunch of money in the last six months built one and it's
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:41.600]  still got some bugs and I don't particularly feel confident in it as it
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:47.440]  has too many functions I'm building another social network to decide which
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:50.560]  one I want to launch this is going to be big with our audience turn in the power
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:55.640]  of the people loose and I've decided that I just need developers here in my
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:59.360]  office and I don't like bringing new people in there is infiltration things
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:03.400]  like that and we never hire from the listeners because infiltrators can try
[1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:08.160]  to get in I don't want fans I want supporters I want to pay people too but
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:11.360]  if you want to volunteer the full spectrum is wide open but I want to do
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:15.600]  this in the next few months it's mainly a WordPress developer or developers to

[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:21.280]  the president and CEO of an amazing organization and that's Liberty Guard
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:25.000]  founded and headed up by former congressman Bob Barr and libertarian
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.800]  presidential candidate in 2008 and we really appreciate Mr. C. Hewson for
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:36.520]  coming on the broadcast with us the website's libertyguard.org and we've
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:43.240]  got these reports out on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com watchdog probes DHS
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:50.440]  spying on drudge and others FOIA requests investigates whether critics of
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:54.280]  TSA are being listed as domestic extremist and then continuing we have
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:58.640]  another headline Bob Barr investigates TSA stand-down on national opt-out day
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:03.280]  here's their own headline TSA manipulates national opt-out day Liberty Guard
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:09.800]  files the FOIA request to TSA regarding political manipulation so he's with us
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:15.440]  for the rest of the hour Joe thanks for coming on with us thanks for coming on
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:20.600]  Alex and thanks for your leadership on this issue and our chairman Bob Barr in
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:24.560]  our group libertyguard.org picked up on a lot of that and went ahead and filed
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:29.440]  this and we're hoping to get to the bottom of this so this we think a
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:33.360]  pretty serious issue which is you know the potential that the TSA has
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:42.400]  manipulated these the potential of protests from these opt-out folks like
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:48.080]  that would not choose willingly to go through this sort of degrading and
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:53.960]  questionably constitutional procedures so we appreciate that leadership well
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:58.640]  break down what your organization does and and and why you've started
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:03.120]  investigating the TSA stand-down a but you're going further than that you're
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:09.080]  also burrowing in to this reported TSA memo causing people calling people
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:11.920]  domestic extremist who don't like having the government put their hands down
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:17.120]  their pants yeah absolutely Liberty Guard and again our chairman Bob Barr and
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:21.720]  myself and others put together Liberty Guard at the group that's really
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:26.000]  committed to protecting individual liberties and freedoms and certainly
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.160]  using the Constitution as our our focal point and we just saw this and it was
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:34.760]  one of these gut reactions where everyone said this is what this this is
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:39.520]  wrong and I think we've all been wondering at what point does who everyday
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:42.840]  Americans decide to stand up for the Liberty and say enough is enough and I
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:45.760]  think it's probably right when the government bureaucrats begin to grab
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:50.720]  for our junk if you will I think people all over the country outraged they've
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:54.560]  looked at these incidences where children and and women that have had
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:37:00.680]  mastectomies and men that have various issues with bladder control and so on
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:05.680]  are really being humiliated and you know and and there's a serious question as
[1:37:05.680 --> 1:37:10.760]  to whether this is at all active and there's a serious constitutional
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:16.200]  question and so we we basically said you know let's let's create this off that
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:21.720]  alliance to Tom which we did and let folks what know what they could do to
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:27.960]  resist this and then low and hope there was all this all this grounds well and
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:34.440]  and grassroots excitement internet excitement and people were geared up in
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:39.480]  effect to question some of this and and the TSA looks as if they basically shut
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:45.560]  down many of these machines and we're asking the question why is that I mean
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:50.160]  was it that the that particular day Thanksgiving they during the game was a
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:53.560]  not they were they they were confident there wasn't going to be no terrorism on
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:57.080]  that day I mean if these machines are so effective they better have not all the
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:04.840]  time or was it that they really wanted to kind of quell the national protest from
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:08.760]  every day America thankfully is this protecting us is it appropriate and they
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:12.200]  wanted to go further they wanted to then falsely run the hoax we know they did
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:17.200]  do this saying no one protested everyone loves it this turned into national
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.240]  appreciation day I mean so they're involved in in in multi-deceptions but
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.880]  but looking at this I mean it's got to be illegal if they're saying sorry gotta
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:31.840]  remove that piercing sorry gotta put my hands down your baggy pants sorry got a
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:35.840]  naked body scan you they lied about not saving the images and then they claim
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:40.640]  Al Qaeda is such an imminent threat that they've got a you know remove people's
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:45.920]  colostomy bags you name it all of this is happening but then they totally stand
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:49.360]  down the day before Thanksgiving stand out on Thanksgiving the day after because
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:53.200]  the new protesters we flying back home our intel is this went on for about three
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:58.480]  days and then now it's back I mean this is asinine and then Ron Paul they grab
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:03.320]  his crotch Jesse Ventura they grab his crotch they don't want to fly but then
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:07.960]  we have congressman Boehner he gets to walk around the cabinet gets to walk
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:12.160]  around I mean this is serious discrimination as well this is this is
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:17.240]  selective enforcement on multi fronts well no question and and I mean this is
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:20.880]  gonna have to be for everybody made for all gonna have to have our crotch is
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:24.240]  grabbed I think that's gotta be a 100% across the board and should start
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.120]  certainly with our president and all of Congress and all that and everybody's
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:31.360]  gonna understand and experience that which I have done by the way I flew
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:37.320]  recently and had that that uniquely interesting experience and so absolutely
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:41.720]  has to be across the board if indeed the TSA did this for political reasons I
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:46.720]  think that's a real serious question and even more even as interesting as the
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:51.440]  mainstream media is in any way complicit in this I think there are to be some
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.680]  real questions asked about that because if you're right they're trying to make it
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:58.840]  out as TSA appreciation day geez everyday Americans don't care about this
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:04.000]  well they do and did they take action to really quell what was a legitimate
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:10.640]  public now let's talk about this card you've got it's good to show solidarity
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:14.360]  I pointed this out a month ago now even the New York Times admits this is like
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:20.760]  Tea Party 2.0 this is a focal point for outrage a coming together that is
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:26.080]  transpartisan that is across the political spectrum and almost every
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:32.200]  major national polls shows over 60% some in Reuters 96% against what's
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:37.560]  happening and the TSA just brazenly says no everyone loves it and you know you're
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:41.880]  and by the way we'll give you an $11,000 fine even if you want to leave the
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:46.720]  airport we've got to squeeze your junk then they go on and admit they told
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.000]  Atlantic Monthly and others we are squeezing you to intimidate you into
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:55.280]  the machines then we have the Demado and we have Chertoff and all these other
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:41:00.400]  people formerly in government now in the companies making money I mean this
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:05.920]  thing is dirty from A to Z it absolutely is and I think I think the
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:10.600]  American people have been you know I think that they the pretenses over I
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.960]  think they understand that the government now is in many ways self-serving
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.360]  self-serving meaning self-serving itself self-serving its bureaucrats and its
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:22.640]  special interest and the people that are getting the absolute raw frightening
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:27.880]  and well and stick our everyday Americans and and if you will and I
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:31.160]  believe you use this word I think it's time for the resistance and that means
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:35.720]  pretty much every damn American to kind of begin to stand up and say their lines
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:41.080]  that they're drawn and we're not going any further and you know we have
[1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:46.600]  constitutional rights and that works for us and we're tired of believing them
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:51.520]  all right Joe see who's in president CEO of Liberty Guard founded and headed up
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:56.720]  of course my former congressman Bob Barr again let's get into this card how do
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:59.560]  folks get involved with your organization how do they get the card
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:03.360]  because people are like well so what a card the point is it's like having an
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:10.240]  ACLU card or an NAACP card back in the 60s some clan member cop pulls over a
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:14.400]  black person and they give them that NAACP card that lets them know hey we're
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:17.680]  part of an organization that's going to stand up for us and I think it's a great
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:20.960]  idea to show the solidarity and be part of a group how do you get one of these
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:26.480]  cards easy as a best way just go to libertyguard.org libertyguard.org and
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.280]  right at the top of that is how to get the opt-out alliance card and the card
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:35.880]  you're right it basically says that you know we question this procedure we
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:40.280]  question the constitutionality here's some things that in our our best
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.440]  understanding is these are your right to options we've done some research on this
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:48.560]  and here's some things you could do if you choose to challenge it I think it's
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:53.040]  it's it's prudent for for all of us to understand that if we challenge it the
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:57.680]  TSA is kind of in the business of of making life challenging for the challenge
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:02.120]  it and so I think people would have to make an individual decision if you want
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:05.720]  to do that because it could be uncomfortable it could delay them an
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:10.120]  hour or two or more so I think people want to think through that but the
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:13.840]  folks who want to say hey I'm challenging it and here's here's some
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:18.880]  steps that that I'm willing to take and or show them a by the way I'm not sure
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:22.480]  this here's my opt-out alliance card from Liberty Guard and you know pay
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:25.760]  attention because everyday folks are now are really starting to draw the line
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:30.320]  what to put up with now Joe as you know government and and corrupt bullies of
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:34.800]  any type they will always push push push push push as Thomas Jefferson said the
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:38.520]  level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you put up with it's
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:43.680]  unlimited because if we put up with anything more and more corrupt people
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:48.440]  will gravitate into government to get that petty power to be able to abuse
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:52.640]  people like the private Federal Reserve has now come out giving over a trillion
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:57.760]  to private corporations not just banks including MSNBC they won't tell us
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:02.600]  where 885 billion more of it went that's Bloomberg today I mean we've got to
[1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:06.800]  really come to grips with the fact that we're not in Kansas anymore the
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:11.080]  corruption is it's like it's like blood poisoning we have got to get this
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:17.080]  infection under control or bye-bye America bye-bye Republican on this TSA
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:21.160]  front they admit they want to be on the streets of America with Viper teams they
[1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:25.720]  have said both pistol the head of the TSA and the Polatano the head of Homeland
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:30.720]  Security that they want to have TSA in every community literal minimum wage
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:36.880]  goons with unlimited above-the-law power running around doing this this is a
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:41.600]  tent amendment issue there they're harassing people with disabilities it's a
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:47.440]  major issue there and and and this is the big fight and bullies always push
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:51.640]  push push now we're pushing back they're kind of standing down pistol came out
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:55.760]  yesterday and said well we'll just have a no fly for everybody unless we say
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:59.440]  you're authorized and so they're expanding that the White House wants a
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:04.520]  no fly no gun by so we're really seeing this is an internal checkpoint federal
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.640]  brown shirt system your views on those statements I think you're you're hitting
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:13.400]  on some a fascinating critically important points I mean on it
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:17.720]  intentionally or unintentionally you know the government and the bureaucrats are
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:23.440]  basically saying by virtue of their actions American people what what will
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:27.520]  you put up with you know will you put up with being groped will you be forced to
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:32.680]  take out a pathetic advice broke for a woman has lost the breast or cancer what
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:37.320]  will you put up with power grab at the top well at the power grab out of your
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:41.800]  right and it's also you know part of the past yes you know and part of it may be
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:47.080]  again there may be you know kind of nefarious folks conspiring you know
[1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:51.200]  that's certainly a possibility the other possibility is they've just got way too
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:56.240]  much money way too much big big budgets and they sit around at high-pay jobs and
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:01.720]  dream up ways to expand their empire and for the TSA and Homeland Security at all
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:07.320]  so mission creep this is more like mission warp speed it's mission creep
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:13.120]  warp speed well well said and I think I think one of the things we'd like to do
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  at Liberty Guard and the op-ed alliance is to get this ball rolling with the
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:21.840]  with the TSA groping and get again every day Americans this is not just a
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:27.240]  handful of freedom fighters Americans have to become a nation of free fighters
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:32.640]  and through your excellent work Alex a lot of that is happening and basically
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:36.000]  have to say you know we're gonna push back on the groping thing our genitals
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:42.280]  are the line in the sand hopefully gonna begin to say now that we look at this
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:46.560]  are there other things that are being done by our government and again some of
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:51.080]  it Republican some of the Democrat we're a nonpartisan nonprofit group we're
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:55.040]  here to protect civil liberties in the Constitution our bill of rights and have
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:47:00.000]  every day Americans begin to question you know what are the programs are in
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:03.960]  place that are inappropriate that we need to question well I like what you're
[1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:09.320]  doing though because the ACLU model is that if it's kind of a liberal or
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:13.160]  socialistic thing they'll defend it if it's seen as conservative rights they
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:16.520]  won't and I'm not saying I'm totally against them they've done some good
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:21.320]  things on occasion but it's always about you go file a complaint with them and
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:27.760]  and and and there this Valhalla you know up on the hill or like in the Greek
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:35.160]  mythology you know the the Greek gods up on Mount Olympus I like the fact that
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:38.720]  you're saying look we don't want you behind Liberty Guard we want you right
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:43.080]  beside Liberty Guard this is a participation sport liberty is a
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:48.120]  participation sport and we're here to advise you on how to go out and say no
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:53.320]  and I like the slogan every day is an opt-out day every day is an opt-out day
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:57.440]  and you're absolutely right and we are certainly again nonpartisan we like and
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:01.920]  dislike Republicans just as much as we like and dislike Democrats but we want
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:06.680]  to work with all the the whole spectrum of Americans who love freedom that you
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:10.840]  and and other folks on radio and television other some real fine groups
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:14.440]  out there doing work and we say hey we want to be part of it we want to make
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:19.640]  our contribution but it has to be a national a national movement every day
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:26.280]  opt-out day and and this is really about finding the depths of what America what
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:29.760]  Americans will put up with in terms of the profligate kind of spending the
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:35.000]  government's doing the debt various questionable war activity overseas and
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:42.800]  now this just the despicable kind of touching a patting down in the name of
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:47.240]  civil liberties well what about federal grants for her DWI I'm sorry to
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:50.280]  interrupt but what about federal grants all here in Austin they have federal
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:55.760]  grants for warrantless checkpoints where cops in the dead of night take your
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:00.440]  blood and it's federal what is the federal government doing funding local
[1:49:00.440 --> 1:49:06.160]  police to be scurrying around like like Nosferatu right and all and and the
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:11.320]  amazing thing is with with with a lot of three plus trillion dollar budget and
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:15.800]  the innumerable line items on that Alex they go down to every state county
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:21.160]  municipality we've got to have you know a consortium of a freedom fighters
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:25.000]  yourself other good folks Liberty Guard the other good groups and everyday
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.200]  Americans I'm saying you know we'd rather not get involved none of us really
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:33.080]  want to kind of get involved because we've got other things maybe we'd like
[1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:38.280]  to do I can enjoy freedom but every generation or really now every century
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:42.280]  Americans have to stand up the units and lock arms and say we are here to
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:45.480]  defend this country and we're here to defend our constitutional civil
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:49.120]  liberties and we're here to tell the politicians there's a limit yeah now
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:52.840]  it's come to putting us in radiation chambers and sticking their hands down
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:56.720]  our pants and just a month ago when I was telling people about this that they
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:49:59.760]  didn't believe me and TSA came out and said yeah we stick our hands down your
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:04.800]  pants briefly Bob Barrier chairman what's his view on this Ron Paul said that
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:10.800]  he got groped Jesse Ventura said he got groped about on the genitals here you
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:14.640]  said it's happening similar things have happened to you I went through I went
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:19.000]  through the process and you know the meaning is not the word to describe it
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:23.840]  I believe our chairman Bob Bar has been through it and clear me clearly Bob Bar
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:28.440]  has been in so many ways a champion of civil liberties and privacy rights and I
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:32.800]  know this particular issue really fix in his call understandably that will stay

[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:20.920]  at the hands of big brother well I tell you humans just repeat history you know
[1:54:20.920 --> 1:54:26.000]  Joe see who's in is just a great guy I should add that he was the national
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.440]  deputy campaign director so the number three guy and Ron Paul's presidential
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:35.120]  run in 2008 I should also add that he was the former national director of the
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:39.760]  libertarian party and now he's the president CEO of Liberty Guard and the
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:43.360]  chairman of that is congressman Bob Barr and he's gonna twist Bob Barr's arm and
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:47.000]  try to get him on with us on the next few weeks you were trying we talked so
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.520]  much during the break Joe I think we may have forgotten what was it the story
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:55.240]  you were telling oh yeah it was Bob Barr's view and position and you said he
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:55:02.120]  was particularly outraged on the groping well absolutely and and congressman
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:06.680]  bar has been a champion of civil liberties and and the Constitution and
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.080]  has that background it's been fighting that fight for a long time and and and
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:15.440]  just watching this steady decline in our civil liberties I think when he saw
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:19.920]  this and and saw the demeaning component of it and the questionable
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:24.160]  constitutional nature of it and the questionable effort effort to see how
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:27.960]  but he just said hey we've got to do this here at libertyguard.org and we
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:32.280]  all said absolutely and and that's really the the end of the stop it is is
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:36.160]  his leader on that one and saying hey we got to understand everyday Americans
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:40.640]  are gonna draw a line and the line is you can't do this to us you can't do this
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:46.720]  to our kids you can't do this to our nuns and you've got to effectively protect
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:51.280]  America protect our skies and protect our transportation but you don't buy
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.000]  that in the American people you don't do that by being ineffective and you
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:03.120]  certainly can't not obey our constitutional mandates. Well I mean if
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:09.560]  the federal government can have really untrained people just running around
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:15.400]  doing whatever they want and and and and saying that they're above the law and
[1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:21.440]  shouting at people and screaming op-down the sky's the limit Joe. Well that's
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:24.600]  certainly a concern and again when people do join the op-ed alliance when
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:29.080]  they when they sign up and get that card of what we believe that our research is
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:32.800]  shown are legitimate options for the person to take we want to make sure they
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:36.600]  understand that that's an individual decision and it may be an uncomfortable
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:40.240]  one for them they may miss their flight they may go through more procedures and
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:46.720]  more questions faced if you will the kind of you know thoughtless really
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:53.040]  intimidation of the TSA agents that may not know their their boundaries but it's
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.320]  one of those things where where people who believe this is important state to
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:02.880]  make many have done it already are going to do it and question it and and we're
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:06.240]  doing it in a thoughtful way we're asking based on questions is this
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:11.000]  constitutional is this effective and Mike Josh can't protect our nation
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:15.960]  from terrorists without the meaning of everyday Americans I think those are
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:20.880]  some pretty fundamental questions. Well and even more than that Joe in closing I
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:27.480]  saw a NBC article two weeks ago where they admit that every week hundreds and
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:34.160]  overall thousands every year of boats land in San Diego with illegal aliens
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:38.120]  from all over the world that go to Mexico to then be brought into the US and
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:44.360]  there's no border patrol no police no TSA it came out in ABC News illegal aliens
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:49.040]  can literally go in and rent aircraft and TSA just gives them waivers Fox News
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:52.720]  reported and it was confirmed they hired illegal aliens to build part of the
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:57.280]  show fence I mean the government could care less about our so-called security
[1:57:57.280 --> 1:58:03.280]  28,000 dead in the last two years on the Mexico US border and that's more in the
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:08.720]  Vietnam War every year I mean this is insane your final comment on that well
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:12.400]  part of this is again this scope creep that you mentioned where these
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:15.860]  bureaucracies have big budgets they have people who are you know
[1:58:15.860 --> 1:58:19.240]  questionably not fully trained not fully conversed with the laws
[1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:25.120]  potentially and they basically kind of begin to you know make up the law kind
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:29.200]  of on the spot you know again intentionally or unintentionally and
[1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:32.880]  that's where a lot of the danger comes in and I think I think challenging them
[1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:38.040]  challenging what they're doing challenging their projects Joe great
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:42.160]  job we're out of time God bless you

[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:03.480]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:07.440]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:11.800]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:16.120]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.880]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:24.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:35.600]  right now in fact we're gonna search this and put it on screen for you
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:42.200]  radioactive isotopes covered up in Texas water member two weeks ago it came out
[2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:47.080]  in the Houston Chronicle CBS news that they were finding uranium in most Texas
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:50.720]  water supplies that isn't even in the groundwater and that the feds have been
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:56.400]  covering it up with the state now I pointed out that uranium is in the
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:04.240]  phosphate deposits where they're mining the sodium fluoride now jesse
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:11.120]  ventura an american conspiracies of author researcher with his TV show
[2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:15.320]  conspiracy theory went out and talked to the experts I'm in tonight's episode
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:19.760]  they talked to radiation experts you name it fertility in males is dropping
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:27.280]  worldwide especially in the west this episode is off the charts it is super
[2:09:27.280 --> 2:09:32.400]  hardcore and we have got to get not just the sodium fluoride out because they
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:35.560]  brainwash people that's good for them even though top scientist in the EPA
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:41.120]  admitted tonight now they're gonna try to say uranium is good for you now right
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:45.520]  where I live there's uranium in the water and the hippies will get mad if you
[2:09:45.520 --> 2:09:49.640]  cut a tree down to build a shed but they're like give me uranium I want it
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:53.480]  I mean this is eugenics this is population reduction and it's gonna
[2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:58.880]  air tomorrow night and it just makes me so angry folks that this is going on
[2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:02.320]  Michael Braverman executive producer he's produced many national television
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:08.000]  programs and of course he also helped a produce jesse ventura's TV show on MSNBC
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:13.160]  and he's produced a television program from CBS primetime television I'm not
[2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:17.760]  gonna go through it all but he's produced shows for A&E but but Michael
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:23.360]  Braverman joins us now to to give you a sneak peek into what they discovered
[2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:27.600]  this all started out just to look into a foreign corporation stealing water and
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:31.840]  gobbling it up to jack up prices IMF World Bank documents they came to
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:36.000]  interview me in Austin and that's the turning point in the show and they went
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:39.040]  and looked up the stuff I told them about and actually then the whole show
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:42.160]  turned out to be different and folks it's bombshell and it's hidden in plain
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:46.320]  view and it's gonna air for the first time tomorrow night on TV 9 p.m. central
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:50.800]  10 p.m. Eastern Michael Braverman great to have you here with us hey Alex thanks
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:55.960]  for having me on again you bet my friend look you drop such seriously
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:00.600]  folks I thought I was freaked out by the FEMA camp special now I am really
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:04.520]  freaked out because I know everything you just told me is confirmed and what's
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:08.560]  in the show but just to know they've been doing it and getting away with it
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:12.280]  they're putting uranium in on purpose that's only one part of the show Michael
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:16.160]  tell us as much as you can about the premiere tomorrow night well you know
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:19.240]  Alex it's one of those things it's pretty similar to what we talked about two
[2:11:19.240 --> 2:11:23.880]  weeks ago you know I come to this with sort of an open mind I'm kind of an
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:27.160]  agnostic about a lot of this stuff because you know I sort of got into this
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:32.480]  as you know you know as a TV producer and we started looking into this issue
[2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:38.520]  about water somebody said y'all ought to look into this because there's a lot of
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:44.480]  foreign companies sucking out water from places like the Great Lakes and I was
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.720]  like well okay you know let's look into that so I put the staff on it and I
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:53.960]  started to look into it and what we discovered is it's not only true it's
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:59.760]  massive and I'll start with one example and by the way if anybody who's
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:03.080]  listening to this can just get on the computer and Google it and you'll see
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:06.920]  that it's as you say right up there on plain sight there's a place called
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:10.240]  Stanwood, Michigan and I'm gonna get you the uranium in a second but I want to
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:13.560]  give you the backstory and I want to give you your listeners the background of
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:16.920]  this it's a place called Stanwood, Michigan it's way up in the north it's
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:20.280]  pretty rural actually it's the central part of the state it's pretty rural it's
[2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:25.920]  pretty depressed in terms of the economy so Nestle waters of America which is a
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:29.720]  subsidiary of a giant multinational corporation called Nestle which
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:36.320]  we've all heard of builds this big plant in Stanwood, Michigan and they make
[2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:42.240]  and they make a nest quick what they're doing is they're bottling water which
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:46.240]  they're sucking up from Lake Michigan and bottling it and selling it under the
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:50.840]  brand Ice Mountain which you probably all seen in the store okay the state of
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:56.000]  Michigan leased them all of this water and leased them the land for the plant
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:02.680]  for guess how much I'll tell you a hundred bucks a year under ex-governor
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:07.040]  Engels administration a hundred bucks a year so what Nestle did being a smart
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:11.000]  corporation they are is they didn't put their pumps on the shoreline of Lake
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.640]  Michigan where everyone could see them and they'd be an eyesore and they'd
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:17.800]  attract a lot of attention no what they did is they put their massive pumps
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:22.800]  12 miles inland on a private game preserve where no one can see them no
[2:13:22.800 --> 2:13:26.880]  one can hear them and if when you all watch the show tomorrow tomorrow night
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:30.240]  you'll see that we try to get in there just he tries to get in there and you
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:35.880]  can't get in it and these huge pumps are sucking up thousands millions millions
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:42.200]  and millions of gallons of our water America's water good water a year and
[2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:46.400]  there there they're piping them to this big plant in Stanwood, Michigan and the
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:51.600]  tankers go out every few minutes every few minutes those tankers are going out
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:57.800]  filled with bottles of water that Nestle Corporation pays $100 a year to
[2:13:57.800 --> 2:14:01.040]  exploit well that's the way it always is it's like the new fellow reserve bail
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:06.880]  out where MSNBC and everybody else gets secret federal money from taxpayers and
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:11.200]  then we're not allowed to be told I mean that's why it's like Obama giving
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:15.320]  waivers to hundreds of mega businesses and not have to buy government run
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:19.000]  insurance but then the local hamburger place they don't get the exemption
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:24.160]  nobody can compete against somebody like Nestle paying a hundred bucks a year for
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:27.800]  millions of gallons of water no you can't and I mean I pay hundreds of
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:31.960]  months for water sure and their story is well we provide employment in an area
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:35.200]  that needed employment all true yeah I can't dispute that they do they a lot of
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:38.840]  people a lot of locals got jobs you know there's jobs for truckers there's
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:42.800]  other but it shows how insiders play by a different set of rules without a doubt
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:46.680]  without that in this episode which airs tomorrow night and I'm gonna pitch it
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:52.880]  here to everybody 10 o'clock on true TV this episode will blow your mind as it
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:57.760]  blew my because as it develops you see this thing unravel and we unravel this
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:03.240]  conspiracy about water layer by layer by layer and what you're gonna hear is as
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:06.880]  we start with this plane in Stanwood, Michigan where you know all this stuff
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:12.280]  is being you know all this water is being taken and then what you discover is
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:16.840]  there are three big multinationals all over the world and what they're doing is
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:20.960]  they're privatizing water they go into municipalities to go to states they go
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:23.400]  hey you guys are government you guys are idiots you don't know what you're doing
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:27.200]  which is a pretty good argument to make what we're gonna do is we're gonna take
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:31.160]  over your water supply we're gonna take over your municipal water system and
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:34.160]  we're gonna run it better we're gonna pay your royalty a bunch of cities and
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:41.000]  states go cool let's go and then what you discover is just like insiders all
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:46.200]  over the world as you pointed out Alex suddenly the rules change the price
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:51.160]  gets jacked up water quality isn't as good all kinds of stuff starts to happen
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:54.920]  and you can't allow these deals you know these these you know smaller towns they
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:59.160]  can't get out of them you know because you know Nestle and a couple other
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:02.960]  French companies the Olia and Suez are the biggest ones none of them by the way
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:06.920]  are American companies yeah there's German there's Dutch there's three are
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:11.120]  French and Swiss there's you know Britain has Thames water if you look at it all
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:14.560]  over the world in third world countries like developing world countries these
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:18.280]  countries these companies go out there and they buy up huge amounts of water
[2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:24.640]  and decay came out now here's what you got to realize as we pull back the
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:29.960]  layers pull back the layers in this show what you're gonna find out is the big
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:36.640]  oil families the big oil players suddenly are getting into water water
[2:16:36.640 --> 2:16:41.960]  we've all seen his headline water is the new oil and the one of the primary
[2:16:41.960 --> 2:16:49.280]  families doing this are our friends the bushes the bushes have bought 98,000
[2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:55.840]  acres when everyone to just picture that for a minute 98,000 acres in South
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:59.480]  America it's it's in an area actually that borders different countries it's
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:04.320]  near Paraguay and you know where Paraguay hits Brazil you know right there on
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:07.720]  the southern border Brazil the northern border of Paraguay why did they buy
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:14.200]  98,000 acres I'll tell you because it sits over the world's largest aquifer
[2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:17.840]  excuse me the largest aquifer in the Western Hemisphere sorry there's a
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:22.640]  larger one in Russia and the one the biggest in the US is under Texas and
[2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:25.760]  that's where Boone Pickens has moved in
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:40.280]  smart me and he is figured out something out by the way we have this on the show you see him on the show looking into the camera going well water is free but not for long I mean it's right there and again
[2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:44.760]  everything I'm saying anybody can go on Google you know point and click and you
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:48.400]  can see what I'm talking about and then they lobby all over the US and Europe to
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:52.720]  ban you having your own well or collecting rainwater just like their food
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:56.280]  safety act shuts down you grow and food at your own farm because they're
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:01.000]  creating artificial scarcity yes I didn't realize there are laws to you mean I
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:05.760]  can't think my own well in a lot of places yes and they're the ones lobbying
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:10.080]  for it oh sure they want to control if you wanted to control a population let's
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:13.840]  say you were you were a particular group of elites and you wanted to control a
[2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:17.920]  population well there's two ways that are the most official way to do it control
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:21.360]  the water and you control the food that's pretty much that's why you can do it you
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:25.160]  cannot live more than two weeks without water you can't usually you will die
[2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:30.640]  within three or four days if you could fill the human body it's 15% dehydrated
[2:18:30.640 --> 2:18:37.240]  or has a 15% water deficiency to use a really accurate term a 15% water
[2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:42.680]  deficiency will kill you within 24 hours yes I mean till dead so if you want to
[2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:46.600]  control a population that's a pretty good way to do it and people figured out
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:51.760]  that in Texas if you own the land you also own the water rights so what T
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:55.720]  Boone did again being the billionaire that he is he bought up a whole bunch of
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:19:01.360]  land and on his ranch he created a town and a town gets to have its own water
[2:19:01.360 --> 2:19:06.760]  district and guess who the citizens of the town are T Boone's employees so what
[2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:10.840]  does he do thinks a lot of pumps in there starts to suck out the it's called
[2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:15.160]  the Ogallala aquifer which I'm sure a lot of people have heard of am I talking
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:20.840]  too fast no this is this you're right on target I'm so I'm so lit up about this
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:25.160]  that you know it just makes me crazy that this stuff is happening you know in
[2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:27.960]  fact I'm gonna be talking to the crew you guys have really been wound up about
[2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:31.720]  water and you should be because in your investigation it's not just they're
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:36.000]  creating an oligopoly not just creating artificial scarcity not just running
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:40.880]  these scams not just trying to keep us from getting our own water but they're
[2:19:40.880 --> 2:19:44.400]  adding stuff to the water Michael Braverman stay there let's continue
[2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:51.000]  this is riveting this affects everybody our bodies are 75% water water is life
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:55.960]  and this just shows how dastardly these robber barons are these new water
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:20:01.880]  barons will be right back info wars dot com prison planet dot TV calling all

[2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:17.400]  even mainstream you know people on YouTube they said boy Alex wasn't joking
[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:21.480]  when he said this is groundbreaking confirming the FEMA camps the secret
[2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:25.600]  police takeover plan the deathbed confession last week of eHoward Hunt
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:31.840]  on national TV all the other big revelations Lee Harvey Oswald's widow
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:37.080]  saying look you know they'll my kids aren't safe if I talk to you bomb shell
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:44.480]  stuff well tomorrow night tomorrow night 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. central tell
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:47.440]  everybody you know to tune in by the way Michael when are they gonna air the
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:51.040]  police state special again because I know they usually air a previous episode
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.240]  at 8 p.m. central right before the new one well that's what it should be on
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:24:58.760]  although sometimes the network you know sort of flips a schedule around although
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:05.000]  I believe that it will be on at it should be on at 9 but that's nine Eastern
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  that's nine Eastern right now we it is scheduled to air before the new episode
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.680]  yeah I urge everybody to take a look at that again on the rerun you know it's
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:18.440]  it's an amazing episode because as you know Alex you know we got a lot of
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:23.640]  trouble for that episode because we shine the light on stuff that they don't
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:27.600]  want the light shine on him and I gotta say I want to give a shout out to true
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:33.200]  TV true TV has more courage than any network I've ever dealt with in my
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:37.640]  career because they have put this show on as you know and you know we don't mess
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:42.960]  around we shine the light on very controversial subjects that we go right
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:47.800]  at it and tell me tomorrow night you're gonna expose that the government's
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:53.120]  putting uranium in the water to sterilize us I mean folks and and and what's
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:59.240]  incredible is you exposed the UN climate fraud shot it months before and then it
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:03.520]  aired right as climate get came out now it's breaking in Texas news that they're
[2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:07.360]  covering up the uranium in the water right as you come out with it but I mean
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:11.120]  just interrupt this is a short segment let's go over the bullet points that
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:14.720]  we're allowed to reveal here Ventura reveals that foreign companies are
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:19.560]  stealing water from the Great Lakes the Nestle Corporation stashes these 12
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:22.920]  pumps miles away from the shoreline of Lake Michigan and a private game
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:26.160]  preserved where no one can see them you'll finish up with Pickens here in a
[2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:30.200]  minute in Texas with his fake town up in the panhandle Great Lakes levels are
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:33.400]  dropping and some streams and groundwater sources have already dried up
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:36.160]  they're shipping into the bottom just gonna stop you when you guys watch the
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:39.480]  show when your listeners watch the show you will see us and we shoot a thing we
[2:26:39.480 --> 2:26:43.200]  got a local guy and he goes see that over there we have a new name for that
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:48.000]  that's called the dead stream the dead stream and that's because of this water
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.600]  pumping so this is happening or I don't mean to interrupt Alex but this is
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:55.560]  happening right now it's right under our noses it's right and it's being shipped
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:27:00.840]  to China I'm sorry the show also shows these giant tell them about the water
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:05.480]  bags oh yeah well here's here's another thing there's a technology out there
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:09.080]  and you can you can you all can Google this it's called the Sprague bag it's
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:13.280]  based on a guy named Larry Sprague who invented it basically what they're gonna
[2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:18.400]  do is they're gonna make these giant floating water bladders and because
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:22.800]  fresh water as I found out is lighter than seawater so basically you can put
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:28.760]  a huge water train of 50 of these things you know 100 football fields long towed
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:33.240]  across the ocean with our fresh water and as one of our guests says they're
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:37.000]  gonna take our champagne water water that's been in the ground for millions
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:40.720]  of years you know which is this fresh life-giving water they can take that
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:43.960]  anytime they want and we let them do it the government let them do it put it in
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:49.080]  these giant water trains a hundred football fields long and ship it to
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:52.880]  America's enemies if that's what they feel like doing for a hundred dollars a
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:57.320]  year and let me just finish these bullet points perfect no no no I mean you
[2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:00.560]  could tell we're both frothing here is this one and by the way this one makes
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:05.920]  art makes Jesse Ventura this one made him so angry and you'll see it on the
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:09.680]  screen and I was with him in person in Austin after he got back from the Great
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:13.400]  Lakes and I've never seen him turning red and grabbing my shoulder going Alex
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:20.400]  they're stealing it I mean he was frothing yeah oh so he gets mad on the
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:25.160]  show then oh yeah because it's right there and you know people think that
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:28.640]  you know we hype this stuff up as you said it's right there all you gotta do
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.640]  is Google Stanwood Michigan you can't hype up big enough them putting uranium
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:38.760]  in the water to literally destroy our sperm count now down by 87 percent you
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:44.320]  can't hype that enough well let's go to that a second again you can Google this
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:49.240]  anybody can Google this male birth rates all around the world are dropping
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:54.120]  precipitously in some cases this goes across all species this is not just human
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:59.520]  beings male birth rates male fertility is dropping this is a fact this is a
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:03.760]  drop dead fact now why is that happening well one of the reasons it's
[2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:08.960]  happening is uranium even in trace amounts in the water has a terrible
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:14.040]  effect on male fertility terrible effect on testosterone but what it does is it
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:20.200]  increases estrogen so you have all of a sudden you have fish showing up all over
[2:29:20.200 --> 2:29:23.280]  the world and especially in here in the United States do you have fish showing
[2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:28.960]  up with both organs with both male and female sex organs you have otters don't
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:31.600]  ask me why it's otters because I guess because they live in the water I can
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:35.480]  tell you why stay there they're hemaprodites now because the alluvial
[2:29:35.480 --> 2:29:39.800]  they're dumping all the water we've used into rivers it's got the estrogen the
[2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:43.560]  chemicals in it the otters then eat shellfish that where it precipitates it
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:48.320]  bio accumulates in the otters stay there this is key intel the radiation
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:55.760]  attacks straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:25.560]  important I might try to just get him back up tomorrow because I haven't even
[2:33:25.560 --> 2:33:29.440]  gotten into the other bullet points male birth rates are dropping all over the
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:34.520]  world radiation exposure expert Lauren Marey states that uranium in our water
[2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:39.240]  is leading to mass feminization of the population not to mention kidney and
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:44.840]  other failure pancreas is going out I was watching the news this weekend they
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:49.440]  estimate half the public by 2020 will have diabetes in fact guys put up some
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:53.360]  of those mainstream headlines about Texas covering up the uranium they're
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:58.000]  putting it in the water of course they're covering it up there it is a KHOU a
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:04.720]  CBS Houston I team says state low balls radiation score and drinking water and
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:11.600]  we've got the other headlines state and feds cover up uranium radium and other
[2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:16.240]  things in the water male birth rates are dropping a big brother wants you to be
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:19.760]  calm docile government experts are advocating lithium in the water
[2:34:19.760 --> 2:34:28.240]  municipal water districts see this is happening okay please continue Michael
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:33.560]  Braverman with this show coming up 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. Central you know the
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:38.480]  episodes called the Great Lakes but it's a lot more than that because what it was
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:41.960]  like for you once you started investigating lithium and uranium in
[2:34:41.960 --> 2:34:46.880]  the water and the show takes a big turn yes I just want to say one thing that the
[2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:52.240]  new title of the show is the World Wide Water Conspiracy I know that's a little
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:57.400]  unwieldy but that is the new title the World Wide Water Conspiracy why because
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:01.840]  it's bigger than the Great Lakes it's World Wide I'm glad they changed that
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:07.760]  okay yeah so and now Alex you gave us the turn one turn and then I'm gonna I'm
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:11.280]  gonna go through this really quickly you got plenty of time you got the floor
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:15.200]  break down what they're putting the water okay and I'm gonna do that and then
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.240]  I'm gonna give you and your listeners something I'll bet Alex you may not even
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:23.760]  know all this and this the thing I'm gonna say in a second is gonna blow
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:27.160]  people's minds and again I'm not saying that with a hype I'm not saying that is
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:31.800]  you know some conspiracy poop I'm saying this is a you know a normal guy who got
[2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:38.360]  into this being a TV producer okay lithium is being advocated by our
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:42.360]  government by Big Brother to be put in the water in all municipal water supplies
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:46.120]  and bottled water well now why did they want lithium two reasons one because
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:52.000]  lithium is used to treat bipolar mental disorders and what it does is it makes
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:57.720]  you calm it makes you docile so again more lithium in the water they their
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:01.640]  argument is suicide rates go down but the real argument as far as I'm
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:07.160]  concerned is Big Brother wants a docile population and you know if you're you
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:10.800]  know juice up on lithium the chances that you're gonna like actually take
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:15.160]  some action and actually think for yourself decrease because you're on
[2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:19.440]  lithium you don't care and you can read this where where government
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:23.320]  scientists and it's all over the internet are advocating are actually
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:26.800]  saying let's put lithium in the water because when you have trace amounts of
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:31.600]  naturally occurring lithium they make this argument which is completely bogus
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:35.200]  that in those areas one of which is in Texas where you have naturally occurring
[2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:40.680]  lithium crime rates and suicide rates go down which you know you don't have to
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.440]  be a rocket scientist to look at that argument and call it for the BS that it
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:49.240]  is now the second thing is what we learned on the show which is lithium
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:57.720]  works with uranium these two chemicals in in a hydraulic hydraulic a hydrology
[2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:02.880]  I'm so excited about that it makes me crazy they actually work and they
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.160]  actually increase each other's efficacy that's that's what happens oh it's all
[2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:12.200]  look look sir we have eco science they planned it all the White House science
[2:37:12.200 --> 2:37:16.880]  are these people are pure evil absolutely and I that's what Dr. Blalock
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:21.120]  brain surgeon said is that all these things work together and that fluoride
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:30.160]  then activates and supercharges but but but exactly but the the fluoride is an
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:33.960]  adjuvant just like they add things to vaccines to supercharge them the fluoride
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:39.840]  is the is the adjuvant that turbocharges it but but but Michael you've got the
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.720]  proof in here and then now it's even in the news in Texas but they say oh we
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:47.920]  don't know why uranium's there or why the state covers it up because they're
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:51.960]  adding it please continue okay now I'm gonna get to a part and I'm gonna
[2:37:51.960 --> 2:37:56.080]  preface this really quickly so your listeners understand this you know true
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:00.520]  TV has this immense amount of courage to put this show on Jesse Ventura has a
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:04.640]  huge amount of courage to put this show on and I told you two weeks ago there
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:09.000]  are people out there there are forces out there and I can't really say who
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:13.280]  they are because you know I have my own issues to protect they do not want this
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:17.000]  show on the air they want this show killed the only way to keep the show
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:21.120]  alive is by people who who want free information of people who are willing to
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:25.520]  expand their minds to watch the show now all that being said I'm going to tell
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:29.360]  you something that is not on the show and I can't tell you the reason it's not
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:33.760]  on the show because again I have to protect my insiders but this is gonna
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:36.920]  blow your people's minds and it's gonna blow your mind too Alex you may already
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:40.200]  know about this you're talking about the new world everyone talks about the new
[2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:45.080]  world order and the elites it's right here in black and white right on the
[2:38:45.080 --> 2:38:49.800]  internet there's a thing called the St. Lazar Foundation it's based in Europe
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:55.320]  it's run by the Duke de Alles you this is you know it's called a military order
[2:38:55.320 --> 2:39:00.240]  it started in the in the you know in the second crusades they do lots of
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:04.960]  humanitarian stuff you know they have meetings it's really the Royals of
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:08.600]  Europe of a lot of the countries of Europe it's it's a international royalty
[2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:13.440]  and it's you know a lot of sort of you know business royalty all over the world
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:16.520]  or at least in the Western world in Europe and the United States now I'm
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:21.040]  gonna read you from their website which anybody can go on the net if you just
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:28.160]  google order of St. Lazarus comma water you will see this I'm gonna read it
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:34.160]  St. Lazar investment arm will be the largest owner of aquatic property and
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:39.360]  that's what face the prerogative future international ecological policies from
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:44.320]  the point of view of an investor in the carbon finance marketplace but wait I'm
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:48.160]  not done now again I'm reading these are quotes anybody can go and find this
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:53.440]  water will soon become an instrument of power and influence and we're gonna go
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:40:00.520]  on the same was our foundation aims to become an essential global player
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:07.000]  specializing in water Wow now I'm not making this up anybody can go again I'm
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:11.800]  gonna say it again order of St. Lazarus comma water now that's like order of the
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:15.600]  garter that's the royal families and I I didn't know this specifically but I knew
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:20.800]  that they were involved in the carbon takeover sure and that they their name
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:24.960]  had come up in association with what Lord Blackheath came out with in
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:29.520]  Parliament that there's a secret or in the House of Lords a secret Foundation
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:34.800]  X setting up world government this is part of it this is all part of it the
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:39.040]  world society they say it right here is one of the world's most exclusive
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:44.000]  society again I'm reading from the website it comprises those men and
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:47.240]  women around the world who are part of the economic financial social or
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:52.680]  cultural elite it's right here and then they say they want to become the
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:58.160]  essential global global player specializing in water so this is not
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:01.760]  in the show I'm giving this to you interior listeners because you've been
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:06.080]  such a supporter of the show this is the one that freaked me out I mean I couldn't
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:09.880]  sleep at night after reading this because they're not even hiding the new
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:13.520]  world order the elites are not even hiding it's right there on the website
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:17.840]  I'm not making this up anybody can go see it now it's not in the show and I
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:22.040]  can't tell you the reasons it's not in the show because again I have to protect
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:27.000]  my insiders even though this is right out in public and they say it but I had a
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:31.920]  an inside source and I have to protect that source obviously and you know none
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:37.560]  of us want to get killed but I just urge everybody to open their minds go on the
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:42.920]  internet and read this stuff for themselves absolutely now shifting gears
[2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:48.120]  back into the uranium get into what the uranium is doing in the water and how
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:51.960]  they're getting it into the water to combine with the lithium and the fluoride
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:57.320]  well some of uranium is naturally occurring some of it is clearly pumped
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:02.840]  in there's a lot of ways where they do it they're actually in the city of LA
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:06.880]  when they lay new pipes new water pipes for the DWP Department of Water and
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:10.720]  Power some of these pipes have a little chemical dispensaries built right on
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:17.400]  the pipe remotely activated there could be nothing in the now it would take
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:21.080]  almost nothing for a bunch of crews to go out and and put trace amounts of
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:23.920]  uranium in those chemical dispensaries well our research shows and it's
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:27.680]  confirmed this is on hidden in plain view that the phosphate mining out of
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:32.600]  limestone is where they get the sodium fluoride byproduct and the EPA admits
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:37.200]  they're allowed to have certain amounts of other chemicals and where do you mine
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:41.280]  the uranium in the same limestone deposit and that there is uranium in it so
[2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:44.800]  when they add the so-called fluoride it's got the uranium well here's something
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:49.120]  even scarier a lot of depleted uranium weapons as your listeners know we're
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:54.760]  using both Middle East wars and both Iraq wars yes that depleted uranium gets
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:58.320]  picked up by the wind gets picked up you know you know it goes into the clouds
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:01.720]  goes into the air currents and gets dropped everywhere so the fact is that
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:05.640]  stuff is basically falling on us if you follow the air currents all around the
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:09.920]  world and again what this uranium does even trace tiny amounts what it does
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:15.160]  and our show has this has this woman Lorenne Marais who was a radiation who
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:19.960]  is a radiation researcher for public health and was kicked out of the Lawrence
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:24.280]  Livermore lab because she blow the whistle and what this stuff does is it
[2:43:24.280 --> 2:43:29.560]  this is this is feminizing our population male fertility male birth
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:37.720]  reads male characteristics are down all throughout the world and they're doing
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:41.120]  it and will people listening to this go research that it's in the Texas
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:45.240]  newspapers that there's all this uranium and other radioactive isotopes at
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:49.840]  levels that it shouldn't be they're adding it to the water I've covered it
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:55.440]  with Dr. Conant here on the air this is the reality and it is so important that
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:58.320]  when they try to say hey we're just putting fluoride in the water it's good
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:01.880]  for you even though they know it causes cancer and all the rest of it and
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:08.040]  accelerates the effect of other toxins and poisons as a adjuvant the key is
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:13.600]  they cannot sell people that mercury and lead and uranium is good and that is
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:18.720]  being added along with the fluoride it's it's all called fluoride but it's just
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:23.240]  the toxic waste derivatives and they allow it because it's overall to reduce
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:27.840]  fertility as the book written 25 years ago by the White House science are John
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:32.800]  P. Holdren wrote just amazing Michael Braverman God bless you we appreciate
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:36.840]  your time here with us today and we'll talk to you again in the very near
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:41.160]  future amazing information again tomorrow night true TV ladies and
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:43.680]  gentlemen if you don't have cable or don't have it get to your friends or
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:47.040]  family's house call everybody you know we're gonna have a big report out on
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:51.040]  this tomorrow at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com with the bullet points
[2:44:51.040 --> 2:44:55.560]  the videos are gonna be uploaded as well the prisonplanet.tv of what we
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:59.040]  covered here Michael we'll talk to you soon thanks again for having me on you
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:03.640]  better than coming up the week after this in next week is gonna be the oil
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:10.760]  spill so that's gonna be powerful as well do we have Max Kaiser okay
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:15.280]  fantastic I wanted to just get Max Kaiser on in the last 15 minutes Wow
[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:20.320]  knowingly putting uranium in the water to attack male fertility and he never
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:25.880]  got into the what was happening with the sea life off the coast I mean the
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:31.160]  otters being born in record numbers with both sexes it's it's girls going into
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:35.920]  puberty at age three I mean it's just bonkers we are underchemical warfare
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:43.480]  attack now it's in the London Guardian want JPMorgan to crash by silver the
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:46.840]  campaign to buy silver and force JPMorgan into bankruptcy could work
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:50.600]  because of the liabilities accrued by the short selling and Kaiser talks
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:54.680]  about you know what we did a month ago and then again two weeks ago here on
[2:45:54.680 --> 2:46:00.040]  the show sending you know silver $500 an ounce that becoming the number one
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:04.960]  search term crash JPMorgan being in the top search terms and now silver is
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:10.520]  reaching its all-time high today and the availability of silver eagles at an
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:16.480]  all-time low and and the price of those thing an all-time high in November the
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:20.320]  availability drying up everywhere Max Kaiser this is very exciting what's
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:26.040]  happening yeah sure you know over since I was on your show three weeks ago it's
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:32.320]  up 9% so do you understand that that means it's it's annualizing at a rate of
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:36.680]  return greater than 100% and the people around the world realize that if
[2:46:36.680 --> 2:46:41.240]  everybody cooperates and does this that everybody wins everybody will win if
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:46.800]  everyone gets together and joins forces yeah I'm sober you're you're gonna be
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:51.280]  destroying the biggest financial terrorist in the world imagine you know
[2:46:51.280 --> 2:46:54.880]  imagine getting rid of the biggest financial terrorist in the world and
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:58.760]  by the way we're not we're not tooting our horns here and who knows if they'll
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:03.040]  send a hit team after you for really pushing this out there but we created
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:07.240]  the TSA star the media is even admitting that now this is really other
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:11.880]  people's brainchild but you saw the idea and rammed it out here super charging
[2:47:11.880 --> 2:47:16.440]  it along with zero hedge and others and now the Guardian and others are
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:19.360]  recognizing it I don't want to say who calls you because I want to wait till it
[2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:23.480]  comes out but some of the biggest publications in the US have contacted you
[2:47:23.480 --> 2:47:28.000]  about this and what we're doing so it just shows the power of alternative
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:31.640]  media and we're not tooting our horn you're not tooting your horn when we
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:35.360]  point out that the power of the people out there there are now thousands of
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:41.000]  videos talking about crash JP Morgan by silver this thing is kind of scary I
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:46.080]  mean I mean it's scary to have this type of power max well it was always there
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:49.920]  you know that the power was always there but it didn't have a single point to
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:53.160]  focus on it when I've been on your show before I've talked about the one inch
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:57.080]  punch or I've talked about how to focus all the energy you know you've been
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:00.000]  saying well we should try to do a multiple things at once and I've always
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:04.220]  said no just try to do one thing and do it on scale get the whole world to
[2:48:04.220 --> 2:48:08.000]  focus on one thing in them and the economies of scale kick in and you
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:11.440]  have success and this thing is success within three weeks we're having success
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:15.440]  think about the various campaigns out there that have been gone for years that
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:19.160]  are still struggling to get acceptance here within three weeks we're totally
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:23.160]  transforming the global economy we're taking over the new all-time high we're
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:28.520]  totally disrupting all the banks balance sheet and we are now going to take
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:32.640]  back hundreds of billions of dollars that they stole by converting all the
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:37.240]  paper currency into sober if you own any of the slave currencies the dollar the
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:41.440]  pound the year of the end if you own the slave coupon the slave ticket the slave
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:46.280]  currencies you need to release yourself from bondage and cash it in for sober
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:52.880]  and be a free person be a free man own real money well well said max now now
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:56.720]  most of our listeners understand this more than even you or I but we got a
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:01.480]  few minutes before break in layman's terms explain why they can normally fix
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:05.360]  markets and they've been manipulating this one but if if the mass goes out and
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:09.960]  buy silver there's no way Humpty Dumpty can put himself back together again
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:15.520]  sure you know the precious metals are have always been a counterbalance to
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:21.040]  fiat money and paper money and for the past 20 years has been documented by
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:24.800]  groups like the gold anti-trust action committee and the folks over at zero
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:29.080]  heads the main banks that are tied to the government like JP Morgan they go
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:34.000]  into the market and they continuously sell silver contracts make it which
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:38.240]  means that they are selling contracts that do not exist their counterfeiting
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:42.400]  securities in order to create a lot of selling in order to create a lot of
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:47.240]  downward pressure in order to create an artificially low price and they keep
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:51.200]  they're able to do this because anytime they need to make good on a contract the
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:55.360]  US government just gives them an unlimited an unlimited checklist to keep
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:50:00.560]  writing bad checks now what's happened is that over the past couple years the
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:04.600]  big money out there like Eric Sprott up there and Sprott asset management
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:10.160]  Canada realized that hey JP Morgan has 3.3 billion in these bad bets on their
[2:50:10.160 --> 2:50:14.320]  books if we take physical delivery it'll force them to go into the market to buy
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:19.960]  silver and they go bankrupt and we get rid of a major financial tariffs now the
[2:50:19.960 --> 2:50:24.840]  only pushback to this is people say well you know they can always settle for cash
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:30.000]  and they won't have that liability but that's false because if they settle for
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:33.120]  cash where do they get that cash they have to get it from the government to
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:36.960]  issue more debt which only means that the purchasing power of everyone to be
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:40.520]  out currently goes down and the silver that they're holding the purchasing
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:45.000]  power goes up we've got them in a corner if we all cooperate and buy silver
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:50.400]  that's $500 price is an achievable goal imagine everyone around the world who
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:55.560]  could put in 27 and then they won't be able to manipulate it anymore we got a
[2:50:55.560 --> 2:51:03.080]  break we got a break max stay there is it really possible to get out of debt

[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:10.040]  hundred two five at nine nine two thirty one now JP Morgan hundreds of
[2:55:10.040 --> 2:55:14.200]  billions of dollars trillions leveraged in derivatives now explain to people in
[2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:17.840]  layman's terms if they're three point three three point six whatever it is
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:22.840]  short in the silver market naked you know naked shorts in there driving it
[2:55:22.840 --> 2:55:27.120]  down with money and silver they don't have silver in the real market selling
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:31.480]  for thirty five bucks an ounce a lot of shops showing that you know even the
[2:55:31.480 --> 2:55:35.400]  twenty nine dollar an ounce is a manipulation on paper so more and more
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:44.320]  this is rearing its head but specifically here explain to people as you said
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:47.560]  with cash if it's only three billion in something why don't they just go out and
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:51.440]  buy silver from somebody else to cover it and have a loss explain what you're
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:55.640]  saying yeah okay first of all look at JP Morgan you have to look at the big
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:01.360]  picture here they've got on their balance sheet ninety three trillion in
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:05.600]  derivatives now to put that in perspective the total GDP for the world
[2:56:05.600 --> 2:56:12.400]  is about 50 trillion so they have almost two times the entire outfit output of
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:17.520]  the entire planet Earth on their books as derivatives board debt and a lot of
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:23.920]  debt is tied to a massive short position in silver by some estimates one
[2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:29.240]  point five trillion is exposed in liabilities to their silver short and
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:34.960]  they saw their silver short is the pin in the hand grenade exactly and their
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:38.560]  market capitalization of the company is about a hundred and fifty billion so
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:43.000]  they've got ten times their entire market capitalization exposed just to
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:48.080]  their silver short position which is part of a much bigger ninety three
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:52.880]  trillion dollar derivatives derivatives bomb so again you know the pull the
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:56.040]  pain on the hand grenade it takes the whole kitten to bootle down
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:57:00.760]  JP Morgan stock goes to zero and they're out of business which we want because
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:07.520]  they are actively targeting the communities and these countries look at
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:13.560]  what's happening in Ireland for example the IMF is bankrupt the IMF has no money
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:18.080]  they go into Ireland to see the twenty billion dollars on the Ireland's books
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:22.880]  plus the pension assets of Ireland if Ireland's not bankrupt they have cash to
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:28.120]  go for several years without a bailout but the IMF is bankrupt yeah this is a
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:32.520]  financial takeover and and it's not gonna it's not gonna I mean if we did
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:37.000]  bring down JP Morgan it doesn't mean that exploding battleship might not throw
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:40.920]  some shrapnel back at us but it's better than just letting it line up and fire at
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:45.400]  us forever and not fight back exactly right they it's all connected they're
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:49.800]  all working with each other they're all colluding with each other if you take
[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:54.040]  down the biggest guy you take them all down and you decapitalize them you're
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:58.040]  removing that fear of currency which is the they're with their ammunition so
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:01.120]  you're saying blow up the death star and you're saying our X wings are in there
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:05.120]  right now we've got a good chance of blowing it yeah the death star is a
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:09.880]  good analogy I like it because if you remember Luke Skywalker he's flying into
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:14.360]  the death star and he has to hit the soft spot that one spot in the death star
[2:58:14.360 --> 2:58:17.280]  that blows the whole thing up in my analysis if you look at the global
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:21.800]  banking system the one soft spot in the entire banking system is JP Morgan's
[2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:26.800]  silver short so it's the missing scales on the dragon's belly yeah if you attack
[2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:32.080]  that one spot you blow up the whole death star and right now people understand
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:35.520]  this thing think do we understand it stay there we got it coming up but we're
[2:58:35.520 --> 2:58:39.040]  back in 70 seconds folks you may have to go to info wars.com if your station

[2:58:54.200 --> 2:58:58.560]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:58:58.560 --> 2:59:02.920]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:59:02.920 --> 2:59:07.200]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:11.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:15.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:24.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:59:24.320 --> 2:59:28.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:32.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:59:32.120 --> 2:59:34.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:40.840]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[2:59:51.440 --> 2:59:57.440]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:59:57.440 --> 3:00:01.520]  Broadcasting Network Network
[3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:16.680]  all right we're now into overdrive it is the second day of December 2010 on this
[3:00:16.680 --> 3:00:22.120]  December transmission it is Thursday Max Kaiser is our guest websites are max
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:28.360]  Kaiser.com info wars.com prisonplanet.tv the ongoing TSA route of the
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:33.120]  globalist is continuing they've backed off on pilots small children now they're
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:35.880]  talking about backing off groping the rest of us
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:39.520]  undoubtedly the feds will put a bomb on a plane and blow it up but we're
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:45.000]  countering that offensive by exposing who's behind the terror attacks Max
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:52.240]  Kaiser's picked up on a grassroots movement a month ago or so to short circuit
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:56.240]  the shorting of silver by JP Morgan their naked shorting that is now in the
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:01:01.800]  London Guardian silver's up 9% in the last month the supply is dwindling even
[3:01:01.800 --> 3:01:06.120]  mainline analysts are saying this is the Achilles heel the soft spot on the
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:15.520]  Dragon's belly the unshielded exhaust port on the Death Star whatever you
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:20.040]  want to call it it's the sweet spot and I was talking to Max during the break he
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:24.160]  was telling me this is a self-fulfilling prophecy they looked the
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:28.880]  Hunt brothers were billionaires but they had no power compared to millions of
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:33.520]  people going out and buying silver and taking physical possession please
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:37.560]  continue Kaiser right it's a self-fulfilling prophecy it's a virtuous
[3:01:37.560 --> 3:01:42.640]  circle if the more people participate in this the higher the price goes and the
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:46.880]  more people will therefore participate in this they can't take sacred stores of
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:50.440]  silver and dump it to try to knock it down well the answer is even if they did
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:54.480]  that it would be spalled back up correct well they can you daily the only thing
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:01:58.600]  they can use to knock it down is paper silver but yet at this point all the new
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:02.360]  paper being generated it's creating inflation you see that right now it's
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:08.240]  hitting in up surges which drives up the silver again exactly so the more they
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:12.160]  try to attacking with paper silver the higher the price of silver goes we've
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:16.120]  got them in a corner well for the first time in some foreseeable memory and I'm
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:19.000]  talking to coin shops I'm talking people on the ground I'm talking to Ted and
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:22.640]  other brokers I'm making phone calls about this the last month we see gold
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:27.840]  and silver versus what the public price is pulling away in the real world for
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:32.160]  what it sells and running out that looks like we could be entering a zone where
[3:02:32.160 --> 3:02:37.880]  it really explodes in price yeah there's scarcity there is over scarcity and
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:41.840]  anytime you introduce scarcity into a market these are price discovery
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:50.080]  mechanism takes in supply and demand that's a higher price so well yeah no
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:54.480]  I'm listening to you so where do you expect this to go in the near term well
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:03:01.440]  it's it just keeps going higher because if you've got massive buyers and very
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:05.400]  little supply and as we've said the only way to stop it is by throwing more paper
[3:03:05.400 --> 3:03:10.280]  at it but that only encourages people to buy more physical so they're they we've
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:13.080]  got them you know by their short hairs there's nothing they can do to defend
[3:03:13.080 --> 3:03:16.840]  themselves here they can keep throwing paper at it they can keep settling
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:20.800]  contracts with paper but that paper is inflating the system and increasing the
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:24.960]  purchasing power of the existing silver but now $500 silver is it
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:31.680]  is a doable target if this thing continues to go on a global scale and you've got
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:35.280]  and I'm getting videos from all over the world people are in participating this
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:42.440]  all over the world so that's $500 target is doable that means that the bankers
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:47.840]  pay out paper which is castle has collapsed and everyone is sitting there
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:54.520]  with real money to have a real economy and a real democracy with as the
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:57.720]  founding fathers stated in the Constitution there shall be no money
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:03.240]  recognized other than gold and silver it's a constitutional mandate the fact
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:07.000]  that there's be out paper today is unconstitutional the founding fathers
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:13.600]  figured this out 150 200 years ago they knew that if you let banks create be
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:18.200]  out money that they will use that be of money to monopolize and enslave and to
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:20.880]  create all kinds of murders and acquisitions that they're doing now
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:25.320]  exactly what is happening now is what they knew would happen what this is why
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:30.240]  they outlawed paper money only gold and silver was money now we've got a global

[3:08:10.560 --> 3:08:17.920]  does he it's Alex Jones on a GCN radio network
[3:08:20.280 --> 3:08:30.160]  I shot a video with Aaron last night titled it's the bankers or us and it's
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:33.640]  an article explaining that they will give us no quarter they will rape and
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:37.480]  rob everything the big six mega banks Lord Moncton agreed member of the House
[3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:42.040]  of Lords Ron Paul agrees I mean this is our enemy this is the global government
[3:08:42.040 --> 3:08:47.600]  well you did it you made it the number one Google search term bankers or us and
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:52.280]  I'd say about half the links when you click on it are two sites that mirrored
[3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:56.640]  our article in our video but I would suggest all other websites out there
[3:08:56.640 --> 3:09:01.040]  this will be the top search term for much of the day take our article or
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:04.880]  write your own article about it's the bankers or us so your site gets the
[3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:10.040]  massive traffic and exposing the globalist Google may have blocked me
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:15.680]  from Google news as punishment for the Google bombs and the TSA I don't care
[3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:20.360]  there's more than one way to skin a cat so when you hear us do a search term you
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:24.960]  better take our articles and put it on your own site or news site bankers or
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:30.480]  us number one volcanic search we have the number one number two and number three
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:35.000]  yesterday great job listeners so there you have it Max Kaiser they are
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:38.880]  certainly getting upset about what we're doing right well it's an information
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:43.760]  war and they have their algorithms and you have your listeners and it's a war
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:49.680]  well I salute our frontline soldiers out there you know I want to look at my
[3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:55.680]  site right now Max Kaiser Dom K E I S E R there's a great photo that somebody
[3:09:55.680 --> 3:10:01.120]  sent me it's a Photoshop version of a very famous Times Square photo if you
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:06.560]  back in the 60s John Lennon and Yoko Ono took out big billboards in Times Square
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:11.640]  that said war is over if you want it and somebody sent me a Photoshop version
[3:10:11.640 --> 3:10:17.400]  that says $500 silver if you want it and that that's really gets to the
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:22.480]  message here if people around the world want $500 silver that's exactly what
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:25.800]  they'll get because all they have to do is go out and buy a couple of ounces of
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:32.080]  silver and they'll get $500 silver this is a mass global movement to stop the
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:35.880]  terrorist just like back in the 60s you had a mass movement that stopped the
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:39.560]  Vietnam War this is a mass movement to stop these financial banking
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:44.320]  Max I agree I want to get to some calls before we've got to end this
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:10:49.680]  overdrive transmission but in your estimations the estimations that have
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:54.720]  been done by major economists that you mentioned last hour how much silver
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:11:00.240]  physical silver's got to be purchased to guaranteed annihilate the bankers well
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:06.160]  the app the supply is about a hundred million ounces a year so you know it's
[3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:09.640]  not really in the industrial use is something like 700 million ounces a
[3:11:09.640 --> 3:11:13.040]  year so there's already huge silver shortages right now plus the hedge funds
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:17.840]  are our partner in this and they're buying silver in billion dollar
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:21.120]  quantities so there's already the hedge funds are going to make this happen
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:25.640]  anyway so I'm telling you the person who can only buy one or two coins get in
[3:11:25.640 --> 3:11:30.680]  now because the hedge funds are buying a billion at a clip are making this happen
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:35.840]  right now so it's the shortages are right now you made the point you made
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:40.720]  the point three weeks ago here on the show that as we drive this up the greedy
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:43.760]  globalists they're all going to join in and destroy themselves they can't help
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:51.800]  it yeah they they're opportunist but that works in our favor because then we've
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:56.560]  got leverage against them they'll fill out their JP Morgan buddies at the top of
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:01.320]  a hat you know they're not gonna sit in a bunker and get destroyed with the
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:04.680]  balance sheet of JP Morgan and a hedge and they're banking buddies they're
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:08.600]  gonna they're gonna change they're gonna be joining our forces we're gonna
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:13.400]  convert them we're converting them every day it's it's it's by deploying the
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:17.640]  renaissance by leading like our guest said yesterday shooting our grappling
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:22.040]  hook over the parapet and hauling ourselves up above the globalist leading
[3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:27.040]  by example that's Max Kaiser it's like Pac-Man you know Pac-Man and when he
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:29.960]  gobble up one of the little things in the Pac-Man he becomes part of your
[3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:34.520]  forces every time it goes higher more of the globalist switch five because they
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:37.320]  don't want to get in front of this freight train and get killed they're like
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:41.240]  Silver's going to 500 I'm getting into silver all right let's converting and
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:44.000]  adjoining the forces all right let's take phone calls here we've got a hurry
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:48.080]  Chris and Nevada you're on the air with Max Kaiser go ahead all right how you
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:54.040]  doing Alex good go ahead good I got a question you guys are saying if you
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:12:58.560]  take 20 like 20% of JP Chase's Morgan or these six big banks take their money on
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:05.840]  bank locally or buy silver the big bank crashes right yes it's okay okay what
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:10.200]  happens to the other 80% of people and their money that are you know haven't
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:14.240]  taken it out or bought any silver well the bankers are already debasing the
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:18.520]  dollar they're already debasing they're already in a predatory takeover so if
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:25.120]  they're going to take us down we're going to take them down yeah and I got
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:29.320]  another point as far as like buying silver that I find that a great idea
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:32.960]  for everybody to start doing but for people like myself who generally live
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:37.400]  like day to day as far as like the money we receive you know through paycheck
[3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:41.480]  paycheck to paycheck like if I buy silver myself I can't necessarily like
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:47.720]  buy my nightly meals or pay my water bill with silver so like it is because I
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:51.080]  get this all the time and I appreciate your call let me briefly answer it get a
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:55.080]  30-second answer from Max because I gotta go you know to the other callers
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:59.560]  here give you okay okay max let me answer because this is important okay
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:06.360]  this is elementary 14 years ago when I was promoting silver it was like $5 an
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:11.620]  ounce now it's 29 so if you're a poor person but you bought it when it was
[3:14:11.620 --> 3:14:17.720]  5 now today you could sell that silver and pay your electric bill if you keep
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:23.200]  the dollars they're being devalued while the silver is going up so it is the
[3:14:23.200 --> 3:14:27.560]  poor man's gold and so it doesn't mean you've got to buy a bunch of silver I
[3:14:27.560 --> 3:14:31.840]  mean we're just here discussing look why did I believe in gold and silver when
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:37.080]  gold was 260 an ounce or 265 an ounce and silver was $5 an ounce because I'd
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:41.480]  studied history and I knew what debasing currencies did it makes other key
[3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:46.480]  commodities especially metals go up so it's elementary people say well how do I
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:51.120]  pay a bill in silver you go cash it in for the fiat money at the time you need
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:56.880]  it but your money isn't devalued max can you explain it to him anybody
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:03.560]  has 28 bucks to buy a coin even people almost people have 28 bucks to buy a
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:09.400]  coin and remember Gandhi in his march to the sea as he got closer to the sea the
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:13.160]  the people following him turned into the millions and what did you want to get to
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:17.680]  the sea he simply reached in and pulled a handful of salt that's all he did and
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:21.360]  that's all it would put to annihilate the British Empire because there was a
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:26.480]  tax the British had a monopoly on salt and his joke was it's everywhere
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:33.560]  yeah exactly now fiat currencies is the new imperial way to keep us locked up
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:38.480]  in prison and by buying one little silver coin or even a half a silver coin or
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:41.960]  a quarter of a silver coin or a little silver trinket you are now part of the
[3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:44.960]  movement you were part of the revolution you've got that silver
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:48.880]  bullet aimed at the heart of JP Morgan you are now a part of the global
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:52.720]  insurrection against banking occupation he could do it for 10 bucks
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:56.640]  every man nobody in your listening audience right now you know it can't
[3:15:56.640 --> 3:16:01.440]  hear you let's go to Ed let's go to Ed in Hawaii Ed you're on the air go ahead
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:09.000]  hi Alex Alex yeah Alex yes first-time caller I've been investing in silver
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:14.360]  for probably eight years reading on the subject for many years one of the things
[3:16:14.360 --> 3:16:18.760]  I'd say to the last caller is and I've had this idea before about the silver to
[3:16:18.760 --> 3:16:27.000]  take it down these power mongers goes start buying 190% silver dime or 190%
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:33.240]  silver quarter those are like $2 to $5 and it's nothing there's nothing like
[3:16:33.240 --> 3:16:39.720]  starting to buy a real silver it's a great thing to do on the Hunt brothers
[3:16:39.720 --> 3:16:45.840]  so one of the things I read about him is that he he was a true believer the
[3:16:45.840 --> 3:16:49.400]  dollar was gonna crash I think to a certain extent he saw himself as a
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:55.760]  battling the Federal Reserve and just like that that's what the hunts that's
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:58.760]  what the hunts said we're almost out of time you have a question for our guest
[3:16:58.760 --> 3:17:05.400]  well I just say actually just take JP Morgan down I totally agree thank you
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:11.600]  all right thank you so much sir who leo in Illinois go ahead gentlemen good
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:16.520]  afternoon max I appreciate what you're doing two quick questions first off how
[3:17:16.520 --> 3:17:20.640]  important do you feel you just mentioned earlier about you know it's a
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:24.600]  constitution-based currency golden silver like our founding father state how
[3:17:24.600 --> 3:17:30.680]  important is it to tell people who aren't awake about executive order 1 1 1 1 0
[3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:35.920]  from 63 acquittedly enough five months later Kennedy that's right Kennedy
[3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:39.280]  didn't just start getting us out of Vietnam or have the real civil rights
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:42.960]  movement he started the movement to abolish the Federal Reserve and have
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:46.360]  the US government issue its own currency not the private Federal Reserve they
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:51.360]  blew his head off comments on that Max Kaiser well yeah that's a good part of
[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:55.120]  the history of it they did that executive order was going to abolish the
[3:17:55.120 --> 3:17:59.920]  Fed and the rest of history so yeah that's that's that's how powerful this
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:04.400]  is but you see it's not about one man with one executive order it's about a
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:08.560]  hundred million people around the world he's buying one silver out yeah well
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:12.480]  I'll tell you this Max you got a lot of nerve because you know being at the head
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:16.840]  of pushing this let me tell you if you are successful that this mafia I'd
[3:18:16.840 --> 3:18:21.840]  imagine is going to send a hit team over to your house and I'm serious no
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:29.640]  well I can but as I said before I'm converting people on math and for every
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:35.040]  person that's upset at this there are 10 people that are kissing my cheek and
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:40.200]  thanking me so I am putting the proverbial flowers into the muzzle of
[3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:45.040]  the gun on the front line and I'm turning the the criminals into silver
[3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:50.280]  loving free market real constitutionalist that's the one that I
[3:18:50.280 --> 3:18:53.640]  understand Max you're a true revolutionary we're all here together
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:58.800]  hurtling into the future this is very exciting thank you so much Julio Tim
[3:18:58.800 --> 3:19:05.360]  in Michigan you're on the air worldwide Alex hey hey how you doing Alex good this
[3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:11.040]  is your search term Tim from Michigan if you remember the guy that called six
[3:19:11.040 --> 3:19:14.840]  eight months ago or however long ago it was with the idea for search terms yes
[3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:21.640]  that yes that's me listen Alex I'm on disability and I have 13 ounces of
[3:19:21.640 --> 3:19:28.000]  silver I have a $5 silver certificate that I purchased in remembrance of Mr.
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:32.880]  Kennedy and I also have three British sovereigns and I'm on disability getting
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:37.240]  roughly a thousand dollars a month so if these people try to say that they can't
[3:19:37.240 --> 3:19:41.400]  afford to do this it's because they have their priorities in the wrong place and
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:46.320]  this is very possible because I also have a dollar certificate silver
[3:19:46.320 --> 3:19:50.240]  certificate I understand they're not retainable anymore however these were
[3:19:50.240 --> 3:19:59.120]  done in more of a remembrance for JFK and my condolences for him and I do 1963
[3:19:59.120 --> 3:20:03.920]  five-dollar silver certificate which was purchased just for that reason yes
[3:20:03.920 --> 3:20:11.840]  also had a a long-star nickel which is a two ounce silver round and I have
[3:20:11.840 --> 3:20:16.560]  another 11 different rounds that I had purchased beautiful you have a question
[3:20:16.560 --> 3:20:23.280]  for Max Kaiser yes I do my question to Max is is it also I want to tell you
[3:20:23.280 --> 3:20:30.120]  that I'm very inspired by by his initiative to set this off and my
[3:20:30.120 --> 3:20:34.840]  question is this that Max that if somebody like me on such a limited
[3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:41.040]  income can afford to have three quarters of an ounce of gold and 13 ounces of
[3:20:41.040 --> 3:20:45.880]  silver what won't other people I understand your question we're almost out
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:50.320]  of time it's because they don't believe they can win or they don't understand
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:57.280]  that silver and gold isn't going up the the the currency is being devalued Max
[3:20:57.280 --> 3:21:03.840]  said your comment on that my comment is that I agree with you people are adult
[3:21:03.840 --> 3:21:06.960]  don't think that they can't win anymore they've been beaten down but the
[3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:10.400]  beautiful thing about this campaign is that once people put a silver coin in
[3:21:10.400 --> 3:21:13.800]  their hand a little bell goes off on their head they go and they realize my
[3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:17.240]  god this is money this is what the economy should have been based on this
[3:21:17.240 --> 3:21:21.160]  is what it says in the Constitution this isn't some dirty dirty dirty piece of
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:25.240]  paper this is real this is heavy boy they like silver in their hand they ought
[3:21:25.240 --> 3:21:31.200]  to try gold it's psychological alchemy you turn your defeatism into an attitude
[3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:35.360]  of winning because you realize my god I'm part of a movement that's going to
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:40.280]  transform this be at money let's jam in some more max economy that's
[3:21:40.280 --> 3:21:45.000]  democratic let's talk to mark in North Carolina marker on the air thank you
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:49.400]  Alex say max hey Alex in an effort to be brief I'll ask my question take my
[3:21:49.400 --> 3:21:53.800]  answer offline this may be of interest to the fellow that just called if someone
[3:21:53.800 --> 3:21:57.400]  is disabled say they've worked 27 years in the same job and they're disabled and
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:22:02.360]  they're collecting disability and they're on Medicare if they've got their 401k
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:05.960]  or their IRA and they wish to convert to silver is there a way that they could
[3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:10.260]  do so without being penalized not so much in the taxes we know how that goes
[3:22:10.260 --> 3:22:14.600]  but with regard to not losing your eligibility for Medicare if they wanted
[3:22:14.600 --> 3:22:18.000]  to convert yeah let me let me ask Ted Anderson is coming up in a few minutes
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:21.840]  briefly and he's an expert on that we'll leave that question for him
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:26.040]  specifically because that's a good point if you start making profits then they
[3:22:26.040 --> 3:22:29.920]  can take away your Medicare Medicaid your social security in some cases they
[3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:33.960]  claim you're working but I don't think if you don't publicly cash it in and
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:37.960]  quietly sell it they won't know that's why they're trying to clamp down they're
[3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:40.880]  already doing this in Europe and Australia ongoing down to the coin shop
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:44.560]  and selling a coin or two here and there that you bought at $5 now that it's 29
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:48.880]  and make it a nice profit for yourself let's talk to Nancy in California
[3:22:48.880 --> 3:22:52.680]  probably the last caller for Max Kaiser here Nancy you're on the air with Max
[3:22:52.680 --> 3:22:59.400]  Kaiser go ahead hi Alex and Max I have a question if JP Morgan goes down would
[3:22:59.400 --> 3:23:04.480]  that trigger a bailout another bailout and if so what would be the bottom line
[3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:07.480]  and ramifications well that would devalue currency more in Golden
[3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:11.840]  Silver to go up even more Max Kaiser that's right they're being bailed out
[3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:15.240]  anyway the bailouts are continuing yeah these aren't even bailouts these are
[3:23:15.240 --> 3:23:19.520]  them taking over countries and robbing everything that they're not going to
[3:23:19.520 --> 3:23:24.000]  stop they hate us yeah the value of paper money is continuing to collapse so
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:29.320]  another benefit is that there's you're gonna have actual money in your pocket
[3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:33.000]  and the purchasing power will continue to go up it's again it's a win win win
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:36.560]  but Nancy let me explain this I'm sure some bad things could happen too but of
[3:23:36.560 --> 3:23:40.520]  a big bully starts punching me I'm gonna attack back doesn't mean I might not get
[3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:44.560]  my teeth knocked out but I'm going to attack and so the the message to the
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:48.800]  globalist is we're done laying here and taking it you started a fight you want
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:54.160]  one now you're gonna get it Max you agree with that yeah they can't appease
[3:23:54.160 --> 3:23:59.280]  terrorists and simply by saying well if it collapses then they might come after
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:02.880]  me and abuse me some more that's not a good enough answer at some point we
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:06.440]  got to stand up and say we want real money we want a democracy we want to
[3:24:06.440 --> 3:24:10.400]  revert to financial terrorist JP Morgan is the worst of a lot let's take it down
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:15.240]  and see where we go from there okay Nancy does that answer your question well
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:20.760]  well I'm just wondering is if they bailed out JP Morgan they wouldn't be
[3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:25.480]  going down yeah but they would bail out with paper that's the only thing they
[3:24:25.480 --> 3:24:28.960]  have to bail them out with that means that the purchasing power of your
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:34.360]  silver goes Nancy Nancy if you expose the fiat currency with gold and silver
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:38.080]  there's a war going on between real money and fiat the globalists get their
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:44.120]  power from fiat you take away their power it's over for them we blew up
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:49.520]  their carbon tax stuff last year we're blowing listen listen listen remember
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:54.400]  last year on this show out due to our conversation we shut down the canter
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:58.120]  exchange never care if it's terrible gonna do box office feature they shut it
[3:24:58.120 --> 3:25:03.240]  down they say I'm gonna show Nancy I appreciate your call all I know is
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:08.840]  resistance is victory and a fights always messy and that's the end of it you
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:12.840]  gotta decide what side you're on are you for fiat currency that empowers the
[3:25:12.840 --> 3:25:16.280]  globalist or are you with George Washington and gold and silver Max
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:19.800]  Kaiser will obviously have you up very soon as this develops unfolds when's
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:23.600]  your regular monthly visit scheduled in the next week God bless you Max Kaiser
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.440]  we'll talk to you again soon right there he goes ladies and gentlemen history's
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:31.280]  being made right now again I promote what I believe in I know they're putting
[3:25:31.280 --> 3:25:39.240]  uranium and radium in the water I say get water filters I got sponsors they
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:44.360]  sell filters we make money I can pay for the office the operation and go eat
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:48.360]  enchiladas if I want I sleep good at night I promote as a free market
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:53.200]  person when I believe I've been promoting for 15 years actively 13
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:58.800]  gold and silver and all of them have quadrupled or more in price because I
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:02.920]  know history I know when they start devaluing currencies and why my
[3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:08.800]  republic or Zimbabwe or Argentina gold and silver go up not rocket science I'm
[3:26:08.800 --> 3:26:13.560]  not a genius and and it's that now will they drive it down later will they
[3:26:13.560 --> 3:26:19.600]  but probably but but over time we're only gonna win okay that they got a lot
[3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:24.680]  of tricks up their sleeves but I don't know how to explain it to people Ted
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:28.480]  Anderson can you explain it in 30 seconds to him can sure I can first of
[3:26:28.480 --> 3:26:33.320]  all three silver dollars three of Alex's best videos 97 dollars we take
[3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:37.960]  credit cards don't complain about not being it making it easy to buy gold and
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:42.000]  silver even if you're flat-out broke you can afford this one if you can smoke
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:46.400]  cigarettes you can certainly buy silver anyways yeah it's as simple as that
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:51.400]  Alex I mean you can you can take down the central banks of the world as soon
[3:26:51.400 --> 3:26:56.520]  as people refuse to take their printed money they're done you know they're
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:00.040]  printing money they lend it to us they collect interest on us they're siphoning
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:03.240]  away all of our labor there's no wonder why people feel like they're broke in
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:06.600]  this country you know that's what's going on and the globalists are just
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:11.400]  getting started but but but we had a caller calling and asking about putting
[3:27:11.400 --> 3:27:15.120]  their 401ks and silver and gold I know that you're involved in that others are
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:20.120]  but but but a lot of folks just take physical delivery do they get a hit with
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:23.640]  their Medicare Medicaid Social Security if they take physical delivery my
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:27.480]  research is only if they sell it right no that's right because silver and gold
[3:27:27.480 --> 3:27:31.600]  grows tax deferred you don't pay taxes on it until you sell it and that's if
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:35.040]  you report it that's why they want to pass this health care bill and make
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:40.040]  everybody file a 1099 form of $600 worth of transaction you know and that's
[3:27:40.040 --> 3:27:44.520]  being thrown out there's only a few items it's the 6045 revenue ruling that
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:48.840]  they passed wild we're taking the country back we're getting rid of the tax
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:52.880]  increases we're getting rid of their their scams we're probably gonna beat
[3:27:52.880 --> 3:27:58.240]  the the food takeover bill we're going nuts we're getting angry it's fun and
[3:27:58.240 --> 3:28:01.240]  we're not just running around with a bunch of commies in the streets waving
[3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:05.120]  signs so feds can shoot us with rubber bullets we're revolting in cyberspace
[3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:09.000]  we're revolting with money we're revolting on the radio we're we're
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:13.640]  just going wild and it feels good and I love it and I'm never gonna stop Ted
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:16.960]  Anderson tell folks real fast about some of the other gold and silver offers
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:20.600]  you've got today get involved in the revolution and support our operations
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:26.960]  give them the number Ted yeah well 1-800-686-2237 is the telephone number
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:34.040]  again 1-800-686-2237 I mean come on walking liberty has for $12.84
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:38.920]  you can't afford those I mean like they said dimes we carry those you know bars
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:42.440]  of silver you don't have to get in with a lot of money but I would suggest that
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:46.000]  you get moving you get moving now and I think what max is doing is such a great
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:50.320]  idea finally get the people together to get out of that thea paper well that's
[3:28:50.320 --> 3:28:54.640]  why I got behind it it's a lot better idea to expose the silver fraud than go
[3:28:54.640 --> 3:29:00.080]  after Coca-Cola it sure is yeah and all that I mean why not why not I mean the
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:04.480]  money machine is what is what's creating these bankers are not going away
