[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:13.000 --> 00:24.000]  You keep saying you got something for me. Something you call love, but confess. You've
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  been a messin'. Well you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  We've gotten to the point here on air with what Infowars does and the caliber of
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  listenership we have and the poll we have and not just this government but other
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  governments that any one of these broadcasts could easily be my last.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  And that goes for anybody. Anybody could go down a car wreck or have a heart attack
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  or stroke or be hit by a meteorite or get carjacked.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  But I can tell you that we're in waters with what's happening to Infowars where
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  it's a bellwether or a trigger point, a tripwire, that the deep state war against
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  the attempt to get our country back under our own government's control has gone into
[01:12.000 --> 01:20.000]  a whole nother phase and a whole nother strata of an atmosphere.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  And as I sit here and look at all this news and the intel I have and people need to
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  understand something. I don't say this to brag, the enemy knows this.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  90% of the time I don't get intel. I create the intel.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  And that's not bragging. The Democrats, the globalists know that.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  They know that I am highly respected by patriots in our government, in the military
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  and in intelligence agencies, because they know what I'm talking about is what they've
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  already researched and know to be true. And I'm the only person on air that will go that far.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  We got the FISM memo from Intel, though, from William Benning right after he met with the president.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  Now I was asked by Benning not to say where he got it, but I think people can figure it out.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  Certainly the enemy can. So we're not up here, you know, talking about how cool we are.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  This is a real war for the country.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  I did a special report last night, Will Johnson in studio and Robert Barnes in studio.
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  And we played a Fox News clip from Lori Ingram where she had these big Republican lawyers on
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  Governor Huckabee on and they were laying out the FISA memo that we broke in January of last year.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  And then it broke in a couple of major newspapers two months later.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  And that's why the hell keeps breaking loose. Now I'm not up here bragging about that.
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  The president knew all this and no one else would even cover it.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  A year and a half ago. We would.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  So the president sits down with William Benning and then a week later, William Benning is on my show
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  contacting me, former head of the NSA. You know, the guy that actually ran it.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Not the political head, the actual head of it, the technical head.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  And so I'm just saying, it's not like our sources are right in front of you.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Oh, here's the most highly decorated person in NSA history.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  Super Cub Breaker with a 200 IQ that can do mathematics into the eighth dimension.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  And he's meeting with Trump and then now we're getting this intel.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  And by the way, the FISA court put this out saying Obama came to us and criminally lied to us for three warrants.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  They covered their own ass when they found out about this.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  We told you about it. We broke it.
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then what was the response? All hell breaks loose.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Now it's on Fox News in 2019.
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  So here's the deal. You're going to get next year's news today until they shut us down or kill me.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  And I want you to understand something. The frustration is, Kennedy is willing to put this stuff on air.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  There are certain things Fox won't let him put on air.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  He's very frustrated. They threatened to fire him dozens of times.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  They've told him he's fired and backed off because he said he was going on there with stuff.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  Kennedy's good. So stuck a Carlson. I'm just saying they don't own news corps. I own him full wars.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  So one reason that we're so awesome is we're not awesome. We're just willing to do it.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  So I got a lot more. I told you I was in DC a few weeks ago.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  And I was meeting with people that are writing the direct reports to the president.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  And we're compiling reports to the president.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  We're compiling reports to the president through US intelligence agencies on Friday.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  What the hell do you think is going on here? It's now time for people to learn the truth.
[04:57.000 --> 05:20.000]  I'm going to tell you when we come back.
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  We've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  with the Alexa pure breeze in your house.
[05:52.000 --> 05:58.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air.
[05:58.000 --> 06:24.000]  The info or store dot com big brother mainstream media government coverups.
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silence. I want them muted.
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  Why are they doing this now?
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  But yes, exactly.
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time.
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  But now they banned him. They banned his like little underling Paul Joseph Watson.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  Now that they kick them off the platform, that's great for now.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  But it doesn't roll back the clock.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  You know, I don't think that the fore fathers said, well, you can say, you know,
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world,
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  literally spread it through the internet.
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  I have no issue with it at all. I want them shut down.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  I want them silence. I want them muted.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  But don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  Don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  Every major public university in the U.S.
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  does reeducation camp training, teaching everyone that America sucks.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  You know, the soundtrack running and the reeducation camp
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  and the fictitious Soviet invasion of the U.S. Red Dawn.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  The stuff they say on national news is worse than what you hear in a fictitious movie
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  of a Soviet takeover of the U.S.
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.000]  How much we suck, how bad our forefathers are, how bad men are, how bad families are.
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  We are experiencing classical demoralization, classical brainwashing,
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  and we've been so manipulated by the Neocon Heritage Foundation and others
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  that all private companies can do whatever they want.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  Boulder Dash.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  Boulder Dash. Total baloney.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  And Big Tech's pissed because they know that I'm working with others
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  and I get reports and briefings of the president.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  And the president goes and checks it and finds out it's true and says,
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  why the hell wasn't I told this?
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  And that's the main reason they want us off the ear.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  It's not even about the big audience. It's not even about no.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  That's the main thing because Trump researches info wars.
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  So Brian Stelter might have finally said something true this weekend,
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  even broken clocks are right.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  Twice a day, blind pigs can find acres.
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  When he said Trump is the info wars presidency.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  No, it's just the return of Americana.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  So let's get into the facts here.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  This is not a Gonzo journalism broadcast.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  This is not about me.
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  But we're the number one domino to be falling here.
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  And if other people don't stand up for us, it's designed that way.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  Then the entire first amendment goes down.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  That's why Lewis Farrakhan, who you would not call a right winger,
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  was slipped into Paul Joseph Watson because he's incredibly effective
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  and Laura Loomer and others that are very effective in the five people
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  that got banned off of Facebook and it wasn't being banned.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  I was already banned off Facebook.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  They banned a bunch of fan pages and said in a press release,
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  if you say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com,
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  you will be reprimanded.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  And if you do it again, we'll ban you.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  That is a corporate gag order to 2.2 billion users who were induced
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  to come in with false advertising until they had free speech.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  And now they've got artificial intelligence in place.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  They've got that.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  Telling you, telling you that you will not say someone's name
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  unless it's negative.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  And I'm going to show you the press release.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  But it's all over Twitter.
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.000]  Not on Facebook.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  They don't allow it.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  People are posting the message they get from Facebook.
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  Prominent journalists where they say, God bless Alex Jones.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  Or they say, Alex Jones has a right to free speech.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  I'm going to show you these screenshots.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  They're free for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  They're on info wars.com.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  And they get an instant message, meaning it's AI.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  I mean, they get it in one millisecond.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  You are not allowed to say, God bless Alex Jones and info wars.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  Stop the censorship of conservatives.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  Free Alex Jones.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  And they said, only you can see this post.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  If you request a review, we'll have someone take another look at your post.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  That is the press release they put out on Thursday.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  Where they said you were only allowed to explicitly condemn Alex Jones.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  So this is, this has never been done in the history of speech.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  Not by the chai comps, not in fictitious 1984.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Not in Stalin's Russian.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  Not in Hitler's Germany.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  They never said you cannot say someone's name or an organization's name or we will penalize you.
[11:26.000 --> 11:42.000]  This is next level, breaking ground, history book level, science fiction dystopia, tyranny on steroids to the next level.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  And of course, the president comes out and says this is wrong, but it gets even better.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  He can try to take stuff out of context and lie about me.
[11:49.000 --> 12:00.000]  Paul Watson is, I want to say milk toast, but it's very, very pastoral compared to the left on MSNBC.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  And he was in thousands of newspapers.
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  Alex Jones, Lewis Farrakhan and other white supremacists like Paul Watson banned from Facebook.
[12:11.000 --> 12:28.000]  So they defame you while silencing you and silencing 2.2 billion users and slapping them in the face.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  And saying you will not say someone's name.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  This isn't Harry Potter folks. I'm not Voldemort.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  Now when I explain some people ask how are you doing family calls? How are you doing? Well, we tried to say you're a good person.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  It said it banned us. I got your cousins calling me.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  I'm like, how are you doing? You think I'm worried about me?
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  You think I'm a shrieking violent that got into this because I'm all worried about me?
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  Your children are having their entire birthright stolen from you right now.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  Look at the history books. This is never before been done.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  So here's the big announcements.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  I've watched the congressional hearings last year. Anybody can look it up.
[13:14.000 --> 13:22.000]  Facebook and Twitter and Google told them that by the end of 2018, AI would be in full control and censoring.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  And that quote info or stories will never be at the top of any of our sites again.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  That was their answer to bury it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Well, guess what? They already had the AI partially in place.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  We were still the top everywhere because we say things that nobody else is saying that are really true and that resonate.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And they were bitching all over the news earlier this week.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  Oh my God, Jones claims Biden had brain surgery and is slurring his words.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  He almost died twice. He had two huge brain surgeries.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  They removed part of his brain to the Associated Press 1988 and then years later.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  He was slurring in his big announcement speech.
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  He just said that Margaret Thatcher called him last year. Margaret Thatcher's been dead for years.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  She was the Prime Minister of England in the 80s.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  It's fair game to talk about people's health. They talked about Reagan's, McCain's.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  They admit they shut us down because we had the number one post on Instagram and Facebook last week.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  A video just from a clip of the show with me showing him slur his words.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  A five minute video had something like 60 million views.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  They crap themselves everywhere and they said, that's it, banning. Well, what are we going to do?
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  They're going to say he's a conservative. Well, just put Lewis Farrakhan in there.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  And then we can call Jones and Annie Semi.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  When anybody that knows anything about my show or the Internet knows, for whatever mentally ill reason,
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  you go to the white supremacists. They hate me like the wicked witch of the East in Wizard of Oz hates buckets of water, man.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  Which I don't even because most of the white supremacists are left as funded. I know why it's come out in court.
[14:55.000 --> 15:04.000]  But man, saying that I'm an Annie Semi, that is really rich when I'm supposedly work for Israel, which is another load of crap.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  Don't work for Russia. Don't work for Israel. Don't work for the Vatican.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  I work for the red, white and blue and my children and your children's future and I don't compromise and I'm damn effective.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Everybody knows it. I'm bonafide. I'm real and everybody knows it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  And see, they don't like that in this world. It happens to somebody that's real and stands for what they believe in.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  Trump, neurotically, stands for what he believes in and is committed in really trying to get stuff done.
[15:30.000 --> 15:37.000]  That's why they hate him and say he's not real because they fear authenticity.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  So Trump stood up for me. Matt Dredge stood up for me.
[15:40.000 --> 15:48.000]  Carlson stood up. But so many other conservatives are like, about time you start getting rid of some of them, you know, people like Farrakhan.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  And they're just vying into the trap now of universal censorship.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  We're going to talk about the next phase of this and what's coming next and what this heralds straight ahead.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  You do not want to miss this broadcast.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  If you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it.
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.000]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  And I'm sorry. You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  I'm not a huge medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  I eat five camperels of krill oil before I go to bed.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  I just can't do it.
[16:58.000 --> 17:06.000]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.000]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  I appreciate that.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo-charge women.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  I'm glad you plugged it. Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.

[20:20.000 --> 20:47.000]  It's Sunday, May 5th, 2019.
[20:47.000 --> 20:56.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm going to issue a report to the President. I'm going to issue a report to you.
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  I'm going to issue a report to the whole planet on what's really going on from the inside and the out.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  And again, I want to explain something.
[21:09.000 --> 21:15.000]  I don't get briefings from the U.S. intelligence community. I give them the briefings.
[21:15.000 --> 21:23.000]  And I think it's important at this point for people to understand that I'm not following orders. I'm giving the orders.
[21:23.000 --> 21:34.000]  And I don't say that in a power trip. I just realize what you see. You need to go ahead and put the cards out there because the enemy knows that.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  That's why they want us off the air.
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  Now it doesn't mean there aren't a bunch of people that understand what I understand, that think just like I think, and that know more than I know in many respects.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  But you've had what we do with the spirit of it and how it's done.
[21:50.000 --> 22:04.000]  Popularizing the real fight that's happening gives incredible sucker and sustenance and support and aid and comfort to the patriots in the U.S. government fighting back against the deep state,
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  working with the Chai comms and others against our president and against the patriot movement that's taken over the Republican Party.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  We are winning.
[22:13.000 --> 22:20.000]  And I told you when I went to D.C. a few weeks ago that I had two meetings with people that had direct meetings with Trump.
[22:20.000 --> 22:27.000]  I had another meeting with someone who had been involved in the joint meetings and was writing briefings to the president.
[22:27.000 --> 22:37.000]  And I told you that the president is intending to move to have the deep state actors indicted.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  Judge Jeanine Pirro just came out and said that last night.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  So you keep noticing what I say years ago, what I say weeks ago, what I say days ago, word for word happens.
[22:46.000 --> 22:54.000]  It's not because I'm Oprah Winfrey in the secret and I'm going booga booga abracadabra and then it's happening like I'm a wizard or emperor Palpatine.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  I'm really a serious person, heavily immersed in all this.
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  And I'm sorry, most people, even career intelligence officers and others, it's all compartmentalized.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  They're all in fighting. They're all specialized.
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  None of them have a big audience. They don't have freedom.
[23:09.000 --> 23:17.000]  And I'm a private organic citizen, but the wild card in all of this and that's why they want us off the air.
[23:17.000 --> 23:28.000]  And that's why they want protegees like Watson off the air and others is because they understand we beat them in 2016.
[23:28.000 --> 23:38.000]  We are spreading 1776 worldwide, Operation 1776 worldwide a plan I devised and developed over a decade ago.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  And then it's been adopted.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  And I'm not going to get into all the specifics of it, but you know most of the plan.
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  I put forward a plan that has been adopted by the president and by the patriots in U.S. intelligence.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  So of course the enemy shakes in fear of me.
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  They're a bunch of social climbing, groveling minions. They're not leaders.
[23:57.000 --> 24:05.000]  And they shake in fear that we rebooted this audience, your support, your intel, your information, all of our guests.
[24:05.000 --> 24:16.000]  This college of ideas was the rekindling of the spirit of 1776 and that we have changed the world and have already devastated the globalist.
[24:16.000 --> 24:24.000]  We haven't completely won, but I would compare it to Hitler's Operation Barbarossa taking three years to turn back,
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  but we're at the point of the collapse of the front and the beginning of the collapse of the Nazis.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle. You want to compare a World War II allegory. The globalists are done.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  They can try a lot of stuff. They can censor. They can play games. They can try to finance race wars.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  Once people are awake to them, it's game over.
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  Once the population knows what they're doing, they keep trying the old game when we were asleep.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  That doesn't work anymore.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  And so they're using old propaganda you use on an unconscious public.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  That may work on their zombie minions. That's not working on awake people.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  When you sit there and point blank lie and try to demoralize awake people, it doesn't demoralize it. It motivates.
[25:14.000 --> 25:22.000]  You think my crews more motivated that we've been under such attack or less motivated?
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  You think the average person in U.S. military is less motivated or more motivated? You think the border patrol is more motivated or less motivated
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  that they're under total attack and the border is collapsing and they're begging for help? They're more motivated.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  And here's the thing about fighting and about information warfare. When you're on the offense and you're getting stronger,
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  the enemy's getting weaker. We're getting stronger. They're getting weaker.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  So don't ever let them trick you when it's in the news. Jones is being defeated. Jones is being destroyed.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  Jones is being shut down. Jones, that's all lies.
[25:53.000 --> 26:02.000]  A, most of what they say is happening to me, is it true? B, it doesn't matter what happens to me in the final equation.
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  You understand that? What matters is what happens to this country and this world.
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.000]  So don't ever let them kill me at a four-way stop claiming it's a carjacking or whatever they pull
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  and then say, oh, look, he's dead or he's defeated. You're never going to be defeated. You're never backing down.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  You're never stopping. And I salute you.
[26:23.000 --> 26:31.000]  Now, I said I was going to be calm today, but this is just so momentous that I'm going to try to go through this piece by piece
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  when we come back from break.
[26:35.000 --> 26:44.000]  That's something the crew keeps reminding me to do because, you know, it's not a game that if we don't bring in major funding
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  after all the stuff they've done to us will be shut down.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  Just the fact that we have to pay for all our audio and all of our video and we have millions of viewers a day
[26:53.000 --> 27:01.000]  and millions of listeners just on our own streams, that's millions of dollars a year just in the bandwidth, not to mention infrastructure.
[27:01.000 --> 27:10.000]  I'll tell you, when you build something this big that does this much even for a small amount of money,
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  I mean, a newspaper that serves Austin would cost something like $100 million a year to run.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  We could run this place for $25, $30 million a year. That's still a lot of money.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  Couldn't run it for that in New York. Take $100 million.
[27:24.000 --> 27:32.000]  So this isn't a game, folks. I need every listener that's never gone to M4store.com for whatever reason to get off the fence
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  and go get our coffee, go get our fish oil, go get our turmeric, get X2, get a book, get water filtration, get a video.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  These are all top of the line at great prices because that's my philosophy.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  And I'm not bitching at listeners, but I'm telling you, you couldn't spend money on insurance for you and your children
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  in the future at a better place and get great products back at the same time.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  Now, I'm not going to go into a whole breakdown of the iodine conspiracy and how it's depleted in the soil
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  and how our IQs and everything else are falling apart because we don't have it.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  It's rocket fuel when it's real iodine. You drink the iodine, you get it in a local health store,
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  it'll probably kill you or stuff for topical. No, don't do that. That's not really iodine.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  We have garbage with, we have the real pure iodine, X2, deep earth crystal.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  A small percentage of folks can absorb pure iodine. Most people can only absorb pure iodine.
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  But we have X3 that is mainly pure iodine, but then it has the two other subtypes of it
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  in a nontoxic way that the molecules help you upload it.
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  I'm not a microchemist's biologist, but that's who designed it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  You get a free bottle of X3 with X2 and it's 25% off.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  So, if you want self-preservation and you want great products and you want to defeat the globalist
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  and you want to wind this horse up and go all the way, infowarstore.com

[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  The Frontlines of the Infowar
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  Why are they doing this now?
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but...
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  Yes, exactly.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time,
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  but now they banned him. They banned his little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  Now that they kicked them off the platform, that's great for now,
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said,
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  well, you can say all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world,
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  literally spread it through the internet.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  I have no issue with it at all. I want them shut down.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  But don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  Don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  So, a lot of people are like, wait, you were already banned on Facebook.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  Oh, hundreds of fan sites that had popped up since I was banned last year.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  Some had 300, 400,000 followers, tens of millions of views of our videos every week on there.
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  And Mark Zuckerberg came out. I had the clip and he said,
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  we're not going to let dangerous people on Facebook anymore and you're not going to say their names.
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  And they put a press release out. They said, we have a new level of banning.
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.000]  And Alex Jones will be the first person ever with AI computers watching in live time
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  that if you say Alex Jones on Facebook, 2.2 billion people,
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  that's bigger than China. That's more people than China.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  That's 700 million more people than China has.
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  That's 2.2 billion people. You cannot say Alex Jones' name or info wars.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  And I'm going to play clips of that and go to news articles in a moment, but that's not enough.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  CNN that had 10 million viewers an hour back in Larry King's heyday,
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  they got rid of him when it dropped to like 9 million.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  They hired Piers Morgan and went to like 2 million.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  Now their top rated shows have a million viewers, their average show 50,000 an hour.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  Local radio shows have more listeners.
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  Our restricted cutback show reaches millions an hour, couple million.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  But don't worry, you've got a pumpkin head and you're Brian Stelter.
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  You look like a rat like possum and it says on his bio on Facebook that Oliver Darcy is a defender of free speech.
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  All he is is a little tattletale that runs around making stuff about people and getting him banned.
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.000]  He was breathlessly on the show for several segments, but at the end he says there's WhatsApp, though,
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  that Facebook owns and we're looking into banning it.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  Making sure Alex Jones doesn't have it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  See, last year he knew who all my sponsors were on YouTube,
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  even though you'd have to watch for hours to figure out who they were and geo locating.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  Ads only popped up in certain areas of the country.
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  So he couldn't find out unless he was in my account, him and Stelter.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  And then they were, it was in the news.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Media Matters, they knew how much I was being paid.
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.000]  They had a whole list of all these sponsors that would opt in to buy into my show.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Oh my gosh, the Pentagon was running Marine Corps and Army ads.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  He titled on that and boy, they did what, what General Stelter said.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  I'll say that again, Big Tech has access to everything you do and they give CNN and the Southern Poverty Law Center
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  and Media Matters access to your private banking information.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  It's totally criminal.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  But see Big Tech, oh, they're a private company.
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.000]  So you collude with other companies and lie to you and sell your data and do false advertising
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  and tell you come build up their platform and then pull the rug out from under you.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  Then they can call you a Nazi when they ban you.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  And then they could tell their users, you don't say their name or we'll kick you off.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  No folks, that's called organized crime.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  That's called cult level beyond Jim Jones, beyond the Branch Davidians,
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  beyond the Hellbop cult, beyond anything we've ever seen.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  Tell it and as well as a private company, they can tell you.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  And by the way, I've got all the articles right here where they admit it.
[37:39.000 --> 37:46.000]  People in a lifetime, prominent journalists just test it and go, God bless Alex Jones.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Boom. Post not allowed.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  You're not allowed to say this.
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  And then people tested it.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  It's all over Twitter.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  I was like number three on Twitter, Paul was like number one this weekend.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Laura Loomer and Milo were like right there.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  So it's all backfiring, but people are saying Alex Jones is a scumbag child molester.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  Oh, absolutely. Good job.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  They say you're only allowed to say bad things.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  And Congress in its adult mindset is asking if this is censorship.
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  Oh, but don't worry, since you put up with this MasterCard announced last week,
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  they're setting up human rights boards right out of the Soviet Union
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  that are going to watch MasterCard users' cards to see where you're shopping
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  and that they're going to take your card away if you go by from a hate monger.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  That means the NRA.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  They actually said the NRA.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  You try to go join the, remember, California?
[38:41.000 --> 38:47.000]  The governor and the city of LA both are trying to get the records of NRA members.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  So that you can't have city jobs or work in the city.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  That's right.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  If you're an NRA member, you're not going to be on the police department.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  You're like, well, that's criminal.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  That's discrimination.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  Oh, no.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  LA is a private company.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  No, it's not.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  It's all a criminal move and they're all linked up and it makes it racketeering
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  and they've lied to Congress about the censorship.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  They are slapping us in the face, crapping on us, rubbing it in.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  Nothing, 1984 didn't go this far.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  Oh, but Ben Shapiro went on Brian Stelter's show and said, the ban of me is good
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  and that it's a private company.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  Old Benny Boy knows how to stay on air, doesn't he?
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  Old Benny Boy still saying Russia Gates real.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  What a good conservative leader that they force feed to us.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  He's syndicated 600 radio stations like that.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Force fed by Google.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  Oh, all the white supremacists, they're all monetized, funded.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  People that say they love Hitler are attacking me every day.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Millions of views.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Oh, Google's like money machines.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  Because they're dividing the country.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  Trump tries to unify it with Kanye and everybody else.
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  He's a Nazi.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  Yeah, the guy that bought up all the white supremacist golf courses
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  and let everybody come on it.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  Jews, blacks, you name it.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  This is a load of crap.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Said I'd be calm about this.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  You're probably a new listener.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  And you're told don't believe anything Alex Jones says.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  Here is a stack of articles.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  Here's the Atlantic with the actual email from Facebook,
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  their press release.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  And it says right here, Info Wars is subject to the strictest ban.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing Info Wars videos,
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  radio segments or articles unless the post is explicitly condemning the content.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  And Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share Info Wars content
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  according to a company spokesperson.
[40:56.000 --> 41:04.000]  That's AI coming in to your browsing and what you're doing
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  and telling you what you can say in live time.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  A computer over your shoulder.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  And in case the computer can't catch satire or whatever,
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  they have 20,000 Southern Prairie Law Center trained people,
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  criminal organization, offshore, literal communist group,
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  that will go and look and see if it's sarcastic in the side
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.000]  because the big joke is, oh well, I condemn, explicitly condemn Alex Jones.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  So people put my articles and videos out and so far the AI doesn't get it.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  So there's a bunch of jokes online where it's like all my videos and everybody's watching
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  and they just go, this man is a piece of filth, this man is garbage.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  So everybody, feel free to do it.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  I am the devil.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  We had to go with my new gnome diploma, a new code name for me.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  Spartacus 76, who knows what we should do?
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  Mr. 1776, I don't know.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  And then they'll say, oh, they're getting around the ban with a code name.
[41:57.000 --> 42:05.000]  We won't let those Americans or the other 1,900,000,000 people
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  that aren't in the U.S. that are on Facebook, we're watching you too
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  and you too could get banned.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  You too could get, let's say, as an extremist.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Oh, but don't worry, it's already in place.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  I told you six months ago that starting now, it's in place.
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.000]  Microsoft and others are now officially putting it out with a thing called NewsGuard,
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  run by neocons who bragged, how did I know six months ago?
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  Did I have a crystal ball?
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  No, they were at a big NATO conference in Germany
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  and they had these big neocons that worked for George W. Bush
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  saying, oh, you've seen nothing yet.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  We're going to ban everybody, all the Trump supporters, everybody.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  We've got AI going in and we've got access to everybody's phones.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  We're going to watch what people are doing in live time on their phones.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.000]  That's what NewsGuard does.
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  They're on your phone and they tell you what you can look at.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  In your phone, watching you surf, putting up messages and warning you.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Oh, but this is a private company.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  They're on this phone.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  They got spies beyond the NSA jacked into it.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  that it lowers IQ.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  It literally dumps the population down.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  we've gone through two permutations.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  That's been incredible.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[43:46.000 --> 43:52.000]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  it's an incredible discovery.
[43:56.000 --> 44:17.000]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  So it's a total win-win.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com.

[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  m4slife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[45:10.000 --> 45:17.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.000]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  and that has stood with us.
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.000]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates, but I'll tell you like it is.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  You're our only sponsors.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  We aren't able to continue on.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  So remember, you are the Infowar.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  I'm not the leader. You are the leader.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  We've got giant specials running right now at infowarsstore.com that are unprecedented.
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board,
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  I want to encourage you again.
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  Thank you for making Infowars possible.
[46:56.000 --> 47:06.000]  Thank you very much.
[47:26.000 --> 47:37.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  We're live here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  and I come back Sunday live as well.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  4 to 6 p.m.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  We have David Knight.
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  It was a great job.
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  It was a David Knight show.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  8 a.m. weekday mornings.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  We have Owen Schreuer with the War Room that's on 3 to 6 p.m.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  Central and we're trying to add more shows soon and we'll be announcing hopefully but separately.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  Remember, we're on hundreds of radio stations.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  We're on hundreds of TV stations and cable stations.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  Some big cities, some small towns.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  But you look in the media, they go, Jones is off the air.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  He's defeated.
[48:07.000 --> 48:08.000]  What about websites?
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  What about infowars.com?
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  What about newswars.com?
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  And I get blown away from D.C. to Austin, Texas, everywhere.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  People go, man, we used to love your show on iTunes.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  I was subscribed for a decade or I used to watch you on YouTube.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  Man, I miss your show.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  I'm like, I know you're smarter than the average libtard but you know infowars.com, newswars.com.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  We've always had our own audio and videos.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  We just had trouble paying for the bandwidth.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  Hell, I was streaming my TV show 16, 17 years ago.
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  I was the first to simulcast radio with an actual TV format, not just a webcam.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  I'm not bragging about that but we've innovated.
[48:41.000 --> 48:48.000]  But it's you, human intelligence, overriding Zuckerberg and it's people on Facebook.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  How dare him tell 2.2 billion people you won't say Alex Jones' name.
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  That is cult level.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.000]  And then you add the university discrimination and you add all the anti-free speech there
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  and the discrimination against jobs and the anti-fut-attacking people and Democrat leaders
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  saying run conservatives out of gas stations and shopping malls and restaurants and all
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  of this.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  And it's all over the world.
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  It is arresting people to criticize radical Islam or talk about any basic stuff that's
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  going on.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  And then they sit back and they say oh no, no, it's a private company working with other
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  companies to target certain groups lying to Congress about the censorship and then internal
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  documents Facebook, Google saying we'll deliver the next election to the Democrats and that's
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  why they're doing this and they project Veritas videos and all of it.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  This is the fight for this whole country.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  The fight is against China and big tech together against us.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Hillary's even said that.
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.000]  Will Johnson, talk show host, patriot, United America First dot com, great guy, does some
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  reports for us as an auxiliary reporter, contract reporter.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  You're here in Austin business the next few days.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  You'll be sitting in some with us.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  We've got Millie Weaver and others popping in.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Caitlin Bennett and all the demonization attacks they've been under because they're effective
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  getting the word out.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  And the next hour with us as well, I want to get to a bunch of clips and Brian Stelter
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.000]  saying furious Trump says he's furious that Trump is now the inforce president and putting
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  out a bunch of dis info.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  This is a guy with 100,000 viewers.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  This is a guy that sets himself up as the policeman of the world saying he's for free
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  speech saying Trump's attacking their speech by criticizing them when they want us off the
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  air.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  It's insane.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  It isn't saying if anything he should be fighting to keep you on the air.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  This is free speech.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  We're talking about they are attacking Americans because they don't want Americans to say
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  what they are not programmed to say.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  And it's just like you said.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  Now if you go on the social media and you say Alex Jones that you're subject to be banned.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  What is that?
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  They're giving your name power.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  That's exactly what that is.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  And it's all going to backfire on them.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  I agree with you, but Zuckerberg has 76 billion.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  He's 34 years old.
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  He sounds insane in the speech we're going to play next hour where he announced all this.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  He believes he can override humanity in history.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  I believe that too.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  I believe he's trying.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  I believe that he believes he can.
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  I mean I saw the George Soros video where George Soros believed that Mark Zuckerberg believes
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  he's a guy with the rest of the social media.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  They believe that they're guys.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  They believe that they control thought.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  They control the reality.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  They could control the narrative.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  They believe this.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  They truly believe this.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  You're a smart guy.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  You've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  Obviously they put out in the news before they banned us why they're mad.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  CNN and others had sort of Brown and Stelter.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  They said turning point.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  The CIA produced the exorcist.
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  I went and saw the director of it who also produced it.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  He was CIA psychological warfare.
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  He admitted he used CIA training in it and that it was designed to quote be a turning point to bring in more deviant art and things.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  I'm not saying censor him.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  I went and saw him speak at Alamo draft house like 18 years ago.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  They said that was fake news.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  I also said Biden had two brain surgeries and looked like he's had another stroke slurring his words.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  He did have two brain surgeries.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  How is that not fair game?
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  You know what?
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  That's a very good question.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  How is it not fair game?
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  They don't care.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  I mean, ultimately they don't care.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  And this is something that they're pushing.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  This is the agenda that they have.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  They don't care.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  Everything else, nothing else matters to them.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  They have to control.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  It's about control is controlling all of us.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  And if they can't control of us, then what?
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  I mean, the 2016 election is primary example of them losing control.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  They could not control the narrative.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  They said all the polls, President Trump is going to win.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  You can't, you can't stop it.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  You can't stop it.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  President Trump's not going to win because Hillary's in the polls.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  She's going to be the winner.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  By the way, there's the Washingtonian with the director.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Think the exes was just a horror movie.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  The author says you're wrong.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  Control FCIA.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  I never read the article.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  I will say it.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  I saw him say it and I looked it up.
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  He was a high level operative and the CIA helped produce it.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  I saw him say it, but they say I'm lying.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  Of course.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  But that's their motive.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  They have to say you're lying.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  Even when you say the sky is blue, you're lying.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  Even when they come out and they show tangible proof that you are telling the truth,
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  they still have to come out and say the lie.
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.000]  They say that you're lying because if they can't control the way people think,
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  if they can't control the narrative, then they're losing and they see that constantly.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  So of course they have to change it.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  I mean, what else can you expect from them?
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  I mean, what should we expect anything else from them?
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  If they're going to constantly push out the lies and tell us that, hey, Alex Jones,
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  he's a monster.
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  He's going after people.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  He's done this and he's done that.
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.000]  And then people start believing because a lot of people don't go out and they don't research
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  the truth for themselves.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  And if they don't research it, that's what they're going to believe.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  And they have done it very well.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  The liberal media, they've all attacked so many people to get people to believe that,
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.000]  hey, this subject here, I mean, like I was saying on the 2016, when they were telling
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  everyone that Hillary Clinton was in the polls, she was 99 percent, no way that she could
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  lose.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  And then the American people stood up.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  The American people showed up.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  And then now they have to blame Russia because why?
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  Because American people are not dumb.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  They truly believe the American people are dumb.
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  So if you do something and you say something that they don't agree with, what's the best
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  thing they can do?
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  Lie.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  Constantly lie.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  And now they need to soft the air so they can lie with impunity.
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  The outrageousness.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  Look at these headlines.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Washington Post, you name it.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  Facebook, Bands, Annie Semites, NPR, same headline.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  And then it says Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  Paul is getting lawyers he is going to sue.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  We're trying to raise the money to make sure we can do it.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  But my God, people say, oh, we'll just take it.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  There are a lot of crazies that try to literally attack me on the street screaming, I'm Hitler,
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  I'm a Russian agent.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  This is dangerous when there's no proof of that.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  This is crazy.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  What is the same thing to go along with?
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  They always try to say that white people, white supremacists are on the upriser attacking
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  people.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  They're trying to take over.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  But they have no footage of it.
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.400]  Now, I can show you footage of Antifa, BLM and BAM attacking conservatives at their
[55:03.400 --> 55:04.400]  rally.
[55:04.400 --> 55:05.400]  All over the country.
[55:05.400 --> 55:06.400]  On Mayday.
[55:06.400 --> 55:07.400]  Someone's walking around with a Trump hat.
[55:07.400 --> 55:08.400]  They get attacked.
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.560]  But you can't show Trump supporters going out attacking people at these rallies.
[55:11.560 --> 55:14.000]  You can't show Trump supporters delivery, attacking someone because they.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Well, you're from Arkansas, one of the strongest places for the KKK.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  And I'm sure you ran into a little bit of racism or something.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  I mean, I saw some of these taxes growing up.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  Not a lot.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  It was always white trash or into it.
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  But I mean, did you have a bunch of racism problems?
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  Oh, no.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.600]  No, I didn't have racism problem until I became a conservative.
[55:28.600 --> 55:29.600]  When I made it known.
[55:29.600 --> 55:30.600]  That's what I was about to say.
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.000]  It's like, I told you, my dad and his dad, some of the KKK in Texas, my dad said, that
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  wasn't a big deal.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.680]  They were all losers by staring up to them.
[55:36.680 --> 55:37.680]  We just told him go to hell.
[55:37.680 --> 55:38.800]  It was just, it was no big deal.
[55:38.800 --> 55:40.800]  Like somebody yelling at you in a parking lot.
[55:40.800 --> 55:47.040]  It was like, he's like, you know, before, before Obama, we knew that there was racism.
[55:47.040 --> 55:49.200]  We knew that there was the right KKK out there.
[55:49.200 --> 55:50.200]  Okay, we all knew that.
[55:50.200 --> 55:51.200]  But you know what?
[55:51.200 --> 55:52.200]  We just acknowledged it.
[55:52.200 --> 55:56.640]  Everyone going around trying to kill people, not the way the media is portraying it today.
[55:56.640 --> 55:57.640]  Even right now.
[55:57.640 --> 55:58.640]  They don't have the footage.
[55:58.640 --> 56:02.640]  The KKK was powerful when, when David Rockefeller's father and, and the Department of Education
[56:02.640 --> 56:07.200]  and the federal government funded them for about 10 years in the 30s as a national movement
[56:07.200 --> 56:08.200]  for eugenics.
[56:08.200 --> 56:09.880]  And then Hitler embarrassed them and then they weren't big.
[56:09.880 --> 56:10.880]  Yeah.
[56:10.880 --> 56:11.880]  That's it.
[56:11.880 --> 56:12.880]  When the Democrats funded them, they were big.
[56:12.880 --> 56:13.880]  That's it.
[56:13.880 --> 56:14.880]  Exactly.
[56:14.880 --> 56:17.920]  And now the Democrats are trying to fund them again, trying to bring it back to light.
[56:17.920 --> 56:19.160]  And then saying we are.
[56:19.160 --> 56:20.160]  Yeah.
[56:20.160 --> 56:22.480]  You know, or I'm a Nazi, neo-Nazi sympathizer.
[56:22.480 --> 56:23.480]  I've seen that.
[56:23.480 --> 56:24.480]  I mean, it's, it's ridiculous.
[56:24.480 --> 56:26.840]  I mean, I would, that's dumb.
[56:26.840 --> 56:27.840]  Why would I do that?
[56:27.840 --> 56:29.160]  They said Candace Owens loves Hitler.
[56:29.160 --> 56:30.160]  Yes.
[56:30.160 --> 56:31.160]  Totally made up.
[56:31.160 --> 56:32.160]  Yes.
[56:32.160 --> 56:33.160]  Because she, she made a statement.
[56:33.160 --> 56:36.560]  She talked about his ideas, what he was trying to do, nationalize the country because
[56:36.560 --> 56:37.560]  he's a nationalist.
[56:37.560 --> 56:39.880]  There's nothing wrong with being a nationalist.
[56:39.880 --> 56:40.880]  But when you try to.
[56:40.880 --> 56:42.080]  But he said that he invaded other countries.
[56:42.080 --> 56:43.080]  He was global.
[56:43.080 --> 56:44.080]  Of course.
[56:44.080 --> 56:45.720]  She was talking about policy like a real person does.
[56:45.720 --> 56:46.720]  Of course.
[56:46.720 --> 56:50.680]  And Hitler built the major highways that we copied and the space program doesn't mean
[56:50.680 --> 56:51.680]  he's a good guy.
[56:51.680 --> 56:52.840]  No, of course not.
[56:52.840 --> 56:53.840]  But you know what?
[56:53.840 --> 56:56.200]  Just because you do something wrong doesn't mean you're a bad guy either.
[56:56.200 --> 57:01.160]  We all make mistakes, you know, but they take anything that we do as conservative Christians
[57:01.160 --> 57:02.920]  and you do it at one thing.
[57:02.920 --> 57:03.920]  You do that one thing.
[57:03.920 --> 57:04.920]  And that's it.
[57:04.920 --> 57:05.920]  They try to crush you.
[57:05.920 --> 57:06.920]  They lie about WMDs.
[57:06.920 --> 57:07.920]  Yes.
[57:07.920 --> 57:08.920]  I have the WikiLeak right here.
[57:08.920 --> 57:13.040]  One of the famous ones I'm going to show later where the top professors talking to Hillary
[57:13.040 --> 57:14.040]  and talking to Podesta.
[57:14.040 --> 57:15.680]  And he says it's time for race war.
[57:15.680 --> 57:17.680]  He says the public didn't listen to us anymore.
[57:17.680 --> 57:20.640]  We need to create cultural war and turn people against each other, which has already been
[57:20.640 --> 57:21.640]  going on.
[57:21.640 --> 57:23.560]  He says we've already been doing it, but not enough.
[57:23.560 --> 57:24.560]  Okay.
[57:24.560 --> 57:27.360]  We've got to get to Brian Stelter says he's furious.
[57:27.360 --> 57:29.440]  Trump is now the Info Wars president.
[57:29.440 --> 57:32.840]  Talk about a condescending, arrogant person who's not self aware.
[57:32.840 --> 57:34.240]  That's all coming up.
[57:34.240 --> 57:36.560]  And what this signifies, the deep states making their move.
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.200]  It's not just going to be Facebook.
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.400]  AI now is going to be in your phone controlling what you can visit and what you can do and
[57:42.400 --> 57:45.520]  reporting back on you, Microsoft and others have announced it.
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.400]  We must have congressional investigations.
[57:47.400 --> 57:59.160]  It must stop now.
[57:59.160 --> 58:05.560]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.320]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.800]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in
[58:15.800 --> 58:18.240]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[58:34.680 --> 58:37.320]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[58:37.320 --> 58:38.600]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[58:38.600 --> 58:40.120]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[58:40.120 --> 58:44.240]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce

[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.640]  So, I could see what Tyrants would do.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.160]  As Thomas Jefferson said, he was asked, what is the limit of Tyrants?
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.640]  He said, whatever you'll put up with, whatever you'll accept is the limit is the quote.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.080]  So, I remember being at the mall like 10 years ago and my ex-wife had her new iPhone when
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]  they first come out.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.080]  See what they've always been here, but 10 years ago or so.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.080]  And there's a song and she wants to know what it is, so she hits this app called Shazam.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.720]  She holds it up in like 30 seconds, she goes, she knows what it was.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.840]  And I was like, I remember thinking right then, and I remember looking over my six-year-old
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:57.440]  son and saying Rex, I guarantee in 10, 20 years, they'll be able to find somebody's voice,
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.960]  voice print it, and have a program that goes out and bans that voice across the Internet
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960]  at one time.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.920]  And I said, they'll do it through cloud computing.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920]  Cloud was just being pushed.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.480]  That's why they don't want you to have it natively with yourself, like your records
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.600]  or whatever.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.840]  They want it all up there on the cloud so they can get in it, abuse you, mine it, do whatever
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.800]  you want to you.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.400]  And now they've announced NewsGuard and Neocon groups and Leptis groups are going to be Southern
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.760]  Property Law Center in your phone reading and watching what you do.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:31.120]  It's been announced and they've got to introduce it now, though, so Oliver Darcy, who is literally
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.400]  the anti-free speech police officer, so on Facebook his profile says he's a free speech
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.400]  defender.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.360]  Everything I remember with him is about insulting you, gaslighting you, killing logic.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.240]  He says, we're looking to see.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.640]  It's my private phone, which I know isn't.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.880]  We're looking with the company to see if Jones has an app where you can make digital phone
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.320]  calls and text messages.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.720]  So the New York Post had the headline, should Alex Jones be allowed to use the telephone?
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.920]  Laura Loomer just had her Uber Eats taken away.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.880]  She's had all of her travel stuff taken away.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:10.640]  She's been banned by a bunch of different major groups, oh, I'm having one of those moments
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.560]  I'm telling the property free will, what's the name of the, there's a bunch of them where
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:20.040]  you book people's houses, like hotels, it's based here in Austin, Airbnb Bander.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.640]  So they're going through their database.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.640]  Well, let me see Laura Loomer, I saw her on the news, she's protesting to be banned on
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.640]  Facebook or Twitter.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.240]  Let me just go over there and ban her from getting an Uber.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.080]  She's banned on Uber, she's banned on Airbnb, and now she's banned from ordering food on
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.640]  her phone and she's starting to freak out and they go, oh, look at that girl bitching.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.600]  Oh, you just shut up, honey, can't go ahead.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.880]  How do you, how do you live?
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.640]  How do you live in all of this?
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640]  I mean, I mean-
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.640]  But they're private companies.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640]  But they're private companies, even on top of that-
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.600]  All working together to deny you the lunch counter.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.600]  Yes.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.800]  On top of that, they take your bank accounts away.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.960]  They don't want you to even buy milk.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.240]  You can't even keep lights on for your home.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.000]  What do they think is going to happen?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  This is where I see it.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  It's a social programming.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.520]  It's a programming to try to push people over the edge to get you to go out and be
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.240]  violent, yes, they want people to be violent and they're going to keep doing it until they
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.720]  get what they want.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.520]  Like I said earlier, they don't have footage of conservatives going out being crazy.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.800]  They need that because they have, they need that to convince liberals that conservatives
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.960]  are being violent.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.600]  If they don't have it, then they can't get more liberals to go out and be violent.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.360]  But that's the goal here, to manipulate people to the point to where they have to go out
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.680]  and fight for the, for the only existence.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.680]  That's the plan.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.760]  People, people are having to fight for it.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.520]  And if you can't live and you can't survive, what do you think people are going to do?
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.760]  Look at Venezuela.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.320]  People are out in the streets right now.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.400]  That's what the liberals want.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.400]  They want what's happening in Venezuela, that happened here in America.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.680]  They want people at each other's throats.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.080]  They want people to destroy people and even get to capitalism.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.680]  They want us killing each other.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.560]  And that's in the IMF World Bank documents that got released like 15, 16 years ago by
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.600]  an investigative journalist who's actually a liberal and Greg Palast.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.680]  And it was in their internal documents that got leaked by the economic hitman, Perkins,
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.840]  was part of that.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.240]  It was in those documents that they, they call it the IMF riot where they create the
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.880]  climate to have a year of riot, then they buy everything up for pennies and the dollar.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.240]  Since I mentioned Darcy saying it, here he is calling for me to have digital phone usage
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.240]  taken and he's in my damn phone.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]  Here it is.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240]  Yes.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.240]  Facebook obviously owns Instagram.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.720]  It's not like Alex Jones had been banned from Facebook a while back last year in the summer,
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.760]  but he was still having a presence on Instagram and that had drawn a lot of scrutiny from
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.280]  people who are saying, Hey, you know, you guys banned him from one of your platforms.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.720]  Why are you allowing him to have a presence on Instagram?
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:50.400]  And so yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and Info Wars from not only their
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.160]  main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.920]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.040]  by Facebook.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:05.200]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by Info Wars

[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:15.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.520]  the Info War.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:24.400]  Best to get a journalist talk show host, UnitedAmericaFirst.com head, Will Johnson, right
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.400]  shot done with us.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.400]  Will, we're going to play this clip again, we just played it.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:37.360]  Oliver Darcy, who's a little anti-free speech policeman on CNN with pumpkin head, Ryan Stelter
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:43.320]  has called for taking phone service away now that Facebook and other big groups are moving
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.720]  into telecom, they can already live time see what you're typing and doing and he admits
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:52.760]  that he says, don't let conservatives like Alex Jones have phone service.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.280]  And now MasterCard's announcing, not just talk show host, but conservatives, they're
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.280]  going to track your purchases.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.440]  If you're an NRA member, MasterCard is saying they're creating a human rights board that
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.040]  will now take your credit card away.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040]  I'm not kidding.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.080]  So we're being put into the digital ghetto and the next level is taking you to the death
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.400]  camp like Matt Rudge said, this is literally happening.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.720]  So let's play that clip.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720]  Here it is.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.080]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.080]  owned by Facebook.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.000]  And a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.160]  of these people have WhatsApp accounts according to the spokesperson.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.240]  Yeah, I played the clip on Thursday, I played it on Friday in the interest of time.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.680]  I'm not going to play the three minute clip.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.680]  It's on infowords.com.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.680]  They go all through it and say Jones has been taken off Facebook.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.120]  No one's allowed to say his name.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.520]  This is like out of Beyond Orwell and then he goes on to say, we're looking into it to
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.720]  see if these people, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, are using this app.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.160]  I don't have the app, but they're scared of it because the Brazilian president got elected.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.240]  They have no internet freedom there, Facebook sensors, everybody that's an excellence.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.480]  They all use text messages to communicate some, that's what the app is.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.720]  And they're trying to say, we can't have text messages.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:05.400]  I can't send you a text or send my son a text or send my wife a text or send my crew a text.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.000]  They're literally saying, take our communications away.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.720]  What happens if you need to call 911?
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.440]  They're going to try to make it to where you can only call certain people.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.600]  If you're saying certain things, you can say what they want you to say.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.080]  They always talk about Scientology saying if they get mad at you, they tell you to disassociate
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.320]  with your family or whatever it's called.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.840]  And that's what cults do.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.960]  This is 50 trillion light years worse saying you can't say Alex Jones's name and we're
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:41.320]  going to take conservatives phone apps away so they can't talk to their family or, and
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:47.600]  now they're not letting Laura Loomer use Uber or use all these other services Airbnb.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.440]  And now they banned her using Uber Eats where she can't order food.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.960]  You see how they create a digital system.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960]  It's all in the cloud.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.960]  They have your identity.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.440]  You have no privacy.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.960]  And now they come in and tell you where you can go and what you can do.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.240]  And they're watching you in live time with AI and actual miners and who you can talk
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.240]  to physically.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.280]  They're going to get to that point as well.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.280]  Why not?
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.960]  I mean, they're all they just said it.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960]  Yeah.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.480]  So if I want to call, you know, if I want to call and order a pizza, you mean to tell
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.520]  me that I can't call in order to piece of the feed my family.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.800]  I can't call him.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.600]  I can't call my doctor to get my prescription or you could are they going to like maybe
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.120]  they'll get down to okay, well, you can call your doctor between this time and this time
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.960]  because we need to regulate how much time you have on the phone or how much.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.840]  I mean, this is insane that we're actually living in the time like this and we're actually
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.040]  having a discussion because they got away with it all.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:47.120]  The New York Times illegally got bank account records and we know how they did it from five
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120]  years ago.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.920]  They was then used to target five of our merchant accounts and take them and then they took
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.400]  PayPal away and we got some backups.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.040]  But the point is they're trying to search those out.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.800]  They are literally using all these fake lawsuits against us and all that to try to get those.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.520]  This is mafia criminal will.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.720]  They're saying you're not going to use the phone if we don't say you're not going to
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]  get an Uber.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  You're not going to get food.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.320]  And then the Republicans are like, well, it's a private company.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.280]  It's all these big tech Silicon Valley that have moved to China are helping them oppress
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.600]  their own people, helping them round up their own damn dissidents.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.480]  And now they're here at the university's no free speech.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480]  They're everywhere else.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]  No free speech.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.320]  They're running people out of restaurants, they're physically attacking me.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320]  Everybody else.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.040]  This guy's been attacked and they just say, oh, well, it's a private company.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040]  No, it's organized crime.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.520]  If Jimmy the bull or whatever his name was or John Gotti was doing this, they'd execute
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.520]  them.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.320]  But the Italian mafia never thought of stuff like this.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  It's extortion.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.320]  It's fraud.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  It's criminal.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.720]  It's because of the technology today because they can control people because they know
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.320]  everyone has that device in their hand.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.120]  And the device will tell you how much FaceTime you had on there for the week.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  That's right.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.920]  And it's monitoring your heart rate and what you do without asking.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.440]  It knows how fast you're driving and it's reporting it all back to AI Big Brother.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.320]  And the truth is Congress is scared of them.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]  A bunch of old scared people.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320]  Well, you know what?
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  I'm not scared.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.240]  I'm not turning my kids over to Zuckerberg telling me who I can talk to or people can't
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.440]  say my name or they'll be banned.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.680]  That is a damn cult.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.280]  Imagine if you were watching a cult about the Maharishi, you know, out in Oregon and
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280]  how you got shut down.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.640]  He sounded like probably a bad guy.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.640]  He didn't say whose name you could say.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.080]  He didn't know how many times you jerked off.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.960]  He didn't tell you couldn't buy groceries.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.520]  I mean, my God, I've never heard of a cult like that.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520]  You know what?
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520]  They even...
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.360]  Zuckerberg's running a 2.2 billion person cult and telling you what you can and can't
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.360]  say.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360]  Absolutely.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.200]  You can't even say in the name of Jesus on Facebook without getting subject to being
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.200]  banned.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.200]  Oh, everybody gets screenshots.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.200]  Yeah.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.840]  And people send me messages saying, I got banned for saying it in the name of Jesus on Facebook
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.040]  because they said they call it hate.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]  They call it hate.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]  Really?
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]  That's what we're coming to.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]  They're attacking you.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.760]  Like, I truly believe that they feel that they can attack you and President Trump's not
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760]  going to do anything about it.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.280]  Can you believe a gag ordered 2.2 billion people?
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  I see it coming.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  They told them.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.840]  They said 2.2 billion users cannot say M4s or Alex Jones and once they accept that, it'll
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.960]  be more and more names and more and more things.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.240]  Like you said, Facebook's already been doing this.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.240]  Facebook's already been doing this.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.240]  You've talked about Benghazi.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240]  They banned you.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.600]  It's just so criminal and then they deny it to Congress.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.600]  We've got Millie Weaver.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600]  We've got Caitlin Bennett.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.600]  You're riding shotgun.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.840]  You won't believe what's happening to these two young ladies, how they're being demonized
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.960]  and targeted for unpersoning as well.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.640]  If you give in to the intimidation and say, well, then I better grovel, they're going
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.920]  to move the gold post on you.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.640]  That's how cults work.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.360]  This is a synthetic digital AI cult running you with Zuckerberg, who looks like a gray
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.880]  alien from Mars or something up there literally telling you he's going to do this to you.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.160]  We must stand against it.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.280]  And we must pull out of Facebook, but also have Congress break them up.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  They're arrogant.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.160]  If the NSA will, did one, one millionth of this, imagine the NSA is going to tell you
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]  who you can call.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.480]  The NSA is going to cancel you getting food.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.360]  The NSA is not going to let you use an Uber.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.320]  The NSA is not going to let you say the name Alex Jones.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.240]  We'd say, arrest the entire NSA and I would.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.320]  But instead it's NSA technology given to private companies.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.320]  They get you to opt in.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.360]  Then they get you totally dependent on it.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.640]  And then they slam the door like Ted Bundy and you're chained up and they say, now you
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.640]  going to do it.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.560]  I tell you, you know, to go right along with what you're talking about when you brought
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.640]  up how they want to test your heart rate.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.240]  They want to, the healthcare, the whole thing about the healthcare, this bring this all
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240]  ties in together.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240]  He's controlling your.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240]  Yes.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]  Bloomberg said, I'm a technocrat.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.000]  He said, how much you eat, how much salt, we're going to track everything you do and
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  tell you what to do.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Even the healthcare.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  So if you make a phone call, stop eating me.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.720]  If you make a phone call and you want to order pizza and they say, well, your cholesterol
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.400]  level was too high this month.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.920]  How would they know that information?
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.280]  The government healthcare is going to track all of that information and they're going
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.600]  to tell you what you can and when you can not eat.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.120]  And by the way, they're already saying that.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.120]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.120]  It's coming.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.120]  It's here.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.600]  People don't even realize how bad it is.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.520]  Like you said, he's saying this stuff is like, oh, you're just talking.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520]  You're just talking.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.360]  But what you're saying is absolutely true and it's happening today.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.320]  You believe they don't believe it.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.840]  Can you believe they've gotten enough deranged from the universities is where they breed
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.760]  all the anti-free speech to see, oh, it's a private company.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  No, it's not.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]  It's illegal.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.560]  They use them to take over the big tech and these people will do anything.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.560]  Anything.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.480]  And you know, a lot of people say, well, I have nothing to hide.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480]  I have nothing to hide.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480]  Yeah.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]  Your freedom is about to be gone.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480]  You have nothing to hide.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.800]  By the way, I just showed that Nike and Garmin and all of it, you know, when your fitness
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.400]  trainer tells you to wear that little bracelet, they're selling all of it.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:43.080]  We broke in 1996 when a Army nurse told us about the secret UN base at Fort San Houston
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.920]  that had everybody's blood in the U.S. and that's why they take baby's blood at birth.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920]  It's not for blood testing.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920]  They just do it there.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.240]  They send it off and then it was given to big tech companies, biotech.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.600]  So now people are going to get genetic treatments and they go, sorry, that's $200,000.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.280]  We own every person's different.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.800]  Your original DNA protein code.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800]  And they go, no, you don't.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.320]  They go, yeah, the U.S. government gave it to us.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.440]  It started the year I was born, 1974, I guess we started in Europe the same year.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.240]  There's a whole global system and see, they've been lining this sucker up, man.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.760]  They've been lining this sucker up.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.160]  And they pushed the whole healthcare as if it's something that we all need.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.560]  This is something that you have to get.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.800]  And we're going to make it free to you, see, because people, when they think they're getting
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.000]  something free, they're subject to give up their freedoms for that freedom.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  God Almighty.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.640]  It's such a brainwashed, so manipulating.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640]  Exactly.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.280]  That's why Trump's getting bucked on fighting this is, it's the whole system.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.780]  They built it to surveil.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.160]  They built it to dehumanize.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.720]  They built it to steal your DNA, steal your voice, steal you are.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.040]  And if you don't submit, you're deleted off the entire global cloud like that.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.600]  You don't exist and everyone will turn against you.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.560]  That's why the left of the world, it's homeless everywhere, because they're getting you raided
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.520]  by everybody just starved to death.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.520]  Mark of the beast.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.560]  You mark my words within five to ten years, there'll be millions everywhere starving to
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560]  death.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560]  Gee.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.200]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.200]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.200]  It is.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.680]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.000]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.880]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.440]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.680]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.280]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.680]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680]  burps.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]  And I'm sorry.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.040]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.240]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.240]  It's so good.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240]  In my view.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.240]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.120]  I eat five keplots of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.640]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:49.120]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.560]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:58.680]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.680]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.760]  over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.800]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates, but I'll tell you like
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.600]  it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.040]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.920]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.480]  able to continue on.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.840]  So remember, you are the info war.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.000]  I'm not the leader.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  You are the leader.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.800]  When you take action, nothing stops you.

[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:19.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:35.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:50.400]  This is about the demonization they're under, not because we're victims, but to show the
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.480]  deception where they get thrown out of events and then the media says you didn't get thrown
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.600]  out when their videos get 20, 30, 40 million views and everybody can see the video they're
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.960]  being thrown out.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.920]  So she got thrown out of Rutgers for no reason, the people are on tape, the cops say people
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.920]  don't want you here, you're thrown off and then now the Daily Mail and others are saying
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.920]  we made it up.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.320]  We're going to get to that in a moment with these great ladies, but I started getting into
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.200]  this a little later, some of it now, the whole five minutes is incredible.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:22.560]  To Jamie White's story up on infowars.com, CNN Skelter says furious that Trump is now
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.800]  the infowars president and then he constantly works to get us off air, lies about us with
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.720]  Oliver Darcy and then gets up there and says, Trump's trying to destroy the media and take
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.960]  us off air, even though he's never really said or done any of that, we're the ones trying
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.960]  to shut everybody else down and compete with us.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.080]  You know, infowars has more viewers than us, we really do.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.760]  So it's just insane, Will, that he does this.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.280]  We're going to play a few minutes of this, get to more of it once we get to some other
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:53.000]  topics with these ladies, but they sit there and attack logic in front of us.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  It's crazy.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  It's because of reality.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.240]  They don't like reality.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.980]  They don't like the fact that one plus one still equals two and you don't believe it
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:01.980]  equals five.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:02.980]  Well, that's what he says.
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:06.560]  Actually, he projects and inverses reality.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:14.800]  He says that I'm creating an alternate reality and that Trump is picking it up.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:20.880]  Oh, is that why I had brain surgeons on 20 years ago and scientists saying diet, aspartame
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:24.920]  causes cancer and increased stroke and makes you obese.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:30.040]  Now new studies confirming again, AARP, look at this.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.880]  Great soda link to strokes and heart attacks, massive increases in women, particularly obesity,
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.040]  strokes, brain tumors.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.800]  It was in the studies of racist monkeys in the 70s.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.800]  But you can pull it up.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.200]  Glenn Beck making fun of me.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.640]  I said, Glenn, you're going blind from aspartame.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.640]  Stop chewing the gum.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640]  Stop drinking the Diet Coke.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.760]  He's like, oh, shut up.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.600]  Tomorrow's news today, folks.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.800]  We're not lying to you.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.240]  Let's go to Stelter as part of that.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:02.000]  Even Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.920]  say, the Info Wars president.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  I'm sorry to say.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.720]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as Info Wars and sharing videos from repugnant
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]  characters.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.880]  Now, Info Wars, of course, is that web show and website led by Raja Hollick, Alex Jones.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.880]  It pause again.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.080]  Oh, it's a web show on hundreds of radio stations.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.840]  The little web show that kicks your ass, the little web show that till you censors have
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.560]  like 80-something million views on YouTube a week.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.560]  You're a damn joke.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.960]  Dude, you got 100,000 viewers.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.800]  It'll take forever to get to this whole air at the end, and I want to get Millie's
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800]  take.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.960]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.960]  I want to get Caitlin's take.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.320]  But just the arrogance of these people.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.960]  You know, because they can't attack you or take you out by doing real journalism.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.800]  They attack you by getting, removing you from platforms.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800]  Think about that.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:58.320]  They can't, they can't remove Alex Jones, maybe traditional press, you know, doing this
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:04.080]  being a press person or going out interviewing people, reporting the news, they can't beat
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.080]  you on those grounds.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.080]  They can't beat you either.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.520]  And so now they're telling Facebook users, you will not say his name.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520]  My God, are we in the cult?
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520]  Let's play a little bit more.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.320]  We'll go to Millie and Caitlin.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.320]  Here it is.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.760]  Full of fear, mongering and conspiracy, conspiracy theorizing.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:23.560]  People were tells viewers that the world total fear, mongering and conspiracy theorizing.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.760]  I just showed you mainstream news saying everything that was in the studies 30 something
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.760]  years ago.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:34.040]  I've had top brain surgeons, top chemical experts, top toxicologist, Harvard experts,
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.520]  Yale experts, University of Texas experts.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.000]  I've made films on it.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.320]  It's in another big study.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320]  Okay.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  It makes you fat.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320]  It's addictive.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320]  It kills your ass.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.320]  That's AARP.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.320]  Big ass report.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]  But I'm fear mongering.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:53.040]  Well, yeah, so people don't do it, you can't find gum that doesn't have it in it.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:57.800]  I'm willing to believe that your voice is actually on the Mark Dice videos and not Mark
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:58.800]  Dice.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]  Mark does better than me.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.880]  No, you actually do it really, really good.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.640]  You know, but there again, why would he attack you for reporting on the news, reporting on
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.880]  information because they are losing.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.320]  They are losing this information battle.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.920]  They're losing, I love the fact that he thinks that the Trump is the info war president.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.920]  That's beautiful.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920]  I love it.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.880]  That sounds like a T shirt to me.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.480]  Trump is the info wars president.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.480]  Are you serious?
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.640]  I would wear that shirt everywhere.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:33.520]  Well, how do we maybe we'll take your bank account away if you're seen wearing it.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.240]  You know, my partner, we have played earlier.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.240]  He's coming on.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.320]  I've seen a moment on the same show.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.400]  He said take people's phones away.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.920]  We didn't take conservatives' telephones away.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.520]  We're not fascist or dangerous.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520]  Yeah.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.520]  Yeah.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.520]  You know what?
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.520]  They want us to believe that they're here for the people.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.800]  They want us to believe that they're actually doing right thing for the American people
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.080]  by reporting the actual news when they do just the opposite.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.440]  They come out with all the lies.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.840]  They come out with all the attacks.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.080]  And then you're supposed to believe them because if you don't believe them, then you're
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.640]  like not paying attention to what's actually happening here.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.160]  Spoken like a true white supremacist.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160]  Let's bring a man here.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  And I really appreciate him joining us.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.200]  Here we are, Caitlin Bennett, follow on Twitter for now, both of them, and we'll put those
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.200]  up on screen.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.400]  Ladies, this is the three minutes we have to break.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.240]  We'll come back and get it and all the stuff you've been through this week.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.320]  But just you're getting tweeted out, Millie, by the president, a bunch of great black folks.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.280]  That was all just in one group you talked to off a live video.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.440]  Somebody found it, stepped it out.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.360]  How much they love Trump and then how hateful the left is.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.280]  And then the left just freaks out and calls it a hateful disinformation video that you
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.280]  put out.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.360]  And then they put out fake news showing his black supporters, Millie.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.800]  Oh, you know, they're terrified of the truth.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.560]  They're terrified that the president has more support than the mainstream media likes to
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  put on.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:54.800]  I also find it distasteful that Brian Stelter essentially called me a reprehensible character
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:01.000]  on his little CNN news show, which has failing ratings, all because he's probably mad and
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  resentful that me and Caitlin totally destroyed him in a debate at Kent State.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.600]  We'll talk about that when we come back, but you're right, I forgot.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:15.520]  What you got about 3 million views on Twitter and about 600,000 on YouTube.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:20.120]  So that's like 20 times the viewer's his show as you shouldn't be allowed to be on
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120]  air.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.120]  Young lady.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.120]  Okay.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.680]  Women's places in the kitchen.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.680]  So says Brian Stelter.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.640]  What do you say to that?
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.040]  You know, they just want to ban us because they have no arguments.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.040]  They have no facts.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:38.600]  They can't hold a logical debate and so ban them, I say their tyrannical tyrants.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.480]  They're on power trips.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:46.440]  They want to essentially figure out a way to silence our voices because we're revealing
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.200]  that they are fake news.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:53.320]  And that's by the way, Oliver Darcy recently banned me or blocked me on Twitter and they
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.480]  should just block us if they don't want to see us, not call for us to be banned entirely
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480]  from social media.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.240]  And you understand the pleasure that these people with no audiences have working with
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.240]  the big tech to do it.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.560]  These are the scum of the earth.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560]  We come back.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.120]  We're going to play the little two minute clip that Trump put out yesterday that he calls
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.160]  we're going to put the reprehensible video that Trump tweeted.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.000]  We're going to show the reprehensible and then we're going to show them trying to set
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.320]  up Caitlin Bennett.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.360]  They're calling her this evil white supremacist and all this crazy crap and says he's making
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.360]  it up.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.120]  Nobody throws her out of anywhere.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]  But you're going to see the video.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.160]  If you're a radio listener, it's on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.160]  Will Johnson's here.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.160]  You're not America first.com.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.960]  And you know, Millie, we were more and more and Caitlin Bennett, I've told you guys plug
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.680]  your websites instead of promoting Twitter and Facebook.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.600]  I know you can, you know, for now you're still there.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.000]  But when we come back, everybody take note of your member.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  We have web pages.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.960]  We're not part of a big corporate cult like Facebook where they tell us we can't say the
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.960]  name Alex Jones.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.800]  Sure, use their systems while we can, but go back to our own websites like Matt Drudge
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:58.120]  said, get out of these internet ghettos now.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:04.320]  Stacy in the great state of Texas in FEMA region six, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.840]  It's a talk to you.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.200]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.360]  take vitamins at all.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.320]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.640]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.320]  trust, you know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.440]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.000]  that are natural.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  I appreciate that.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Tell us about it.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Well, it's really great.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  I take it.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  It tastes good.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and, you know, it just gives me energy and
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  fuels me throughout the day.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  So I really like it.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.360]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.520]  charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.720]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:58.200]  I'm glad you plugged it in for store.com or triple A to 53139.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.640]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.720]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:11.800]  get their EPA and DHA to honor role is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child built
