[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.740]  At the end of the day, any amount is too little, and every amount is never enough.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.200]  The Biden administration is officially asking the UN to come in and sanction the United
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.320]  States for reparations, saying that America was founded on slavery and is inherently evil,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.240]  and that the UN should come in and help administer $5 million of U.S. taxpayer money to every
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.240]  black person.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.200]  The stolen men and women and children were brought to our shores and changed, subjected
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.840]  to unimaginable cruelty.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.520]  My nation's original sin was that period.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.700]  On December 16, 2005, the UN General Assembly reaffirmed the importance of providing reparations
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.460]  for gross violations of international human rights law by adopting a five-point legal
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.620]  framework for reparations.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.100]  And that has become our norm.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.240]  Now, obviously, it's about a UN takeover.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.320]  Are they going to go to China and get reparations for the 3 million Muslim Uighur slaves in
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320]  Western China?
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.320]  No.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.660]  If you bring it up on a basketball court, they'll kick you off, like you've seen in
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.660]  the NBA.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.020]  Yeah, nobody cares about what's happening to the Uighurs, OK?
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.620]  You bring it up because you really care.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.180]  And I think that's nice that you care.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.980]  Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.380]  No, no, no, no.
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.300]  It's all about America being mad and this carrot being dangled of, go along with the
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.780]  UN, go along with the world government, and it's going to give you reparations.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.860]  It's the UN building the refugee centers after they ran the lockdowns worldwide that starved
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.420]  over 50 million people in the last three and a half years to death.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.100]  They're murdering people en masse, paramilitary UN troops are slaughtering people all over
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.100]  the world.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.900]  The hardest moment is thinking about leaving your country as you hear the sounds of explosions
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.900]  and gunfire.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.580]  How can you go to a country for 20 years to stabilize and you don't stabilize and you
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.980]  think that you have succeeded in doing something?
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.140]  I was on an airplane flying back and I said, let me just watch this show.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.900]  Tell them the men in black sent you.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.460]  I want to see the propaganda in it.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.860]  And it was all about evil British white mercenaries enslaving a mythical African country that
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.980]  has this magical element in it similar to Black Panther and Wakanda.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.940]  And I'm sitting there watching the mercenaries, you know who the mercenaries work for.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.060]  They work for really one of four or five groups, but it's the UN's the main group that has
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.500]  mercenaries slaughtering and enslaving just like the movie, literally.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.900]  And then there's China.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.100]  China's recently been accused of trying to take over Uganda's sole international airport
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.100]  if the East African country fails to pay a 200 million dollar loan for the expansion
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100]  of the side.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.780]  Over the last several decades, China has been pumping resources into Africa.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.580]  The country has invested hundreds of billions of dollars across the continent, ranging in
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.980]  everything from transportation and infrastructure to real estate and technology.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.020]  It's been found that if an African country recognizes Taiwan as a country, they receive
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.300]  on average 2.7 fewer Chinese infrastructure projects within their borders each year.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.980]  Conversely, if an African country votes overwhelmingly along with China in the United Nations General
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.140]  Assembly, they receive 1.8 more infrastructure projects each year.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.500]  Analysts have accused them of debt colonialism.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.380]  There are fears China is making loans it knows the states cannot repay.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.740]  Beijing may engage in what critics characterize as debt trap diplomacy, lending designed to
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.540]  force countries into handing over land, minerals and strategic assets when they default on a
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.060]  China is among the world's top 10 largest contributors of troops to the UN.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.580]  The country currently has about 80 percent of its blue beret wearing peacekeepers deployed
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.580]  in Africa.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.820]  Chinese military observers, engineers, medics, police and other UN personnel help maintain
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.340]  peace and security, protect vulnerable groups and support development.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.780]  You see these movies and the UN is the savior and there's this UN group of superheroes that
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.740]  come to create stability and battle Black Adam because he's too violent and they're
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.960]  the UN and they're going to save the world when it's the UN that is the biggest group
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.540]  running those lithium mines and those slave camps.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.720]  They run it, they control it, they get a big cut of the money from the multinational
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.700]  corporations and who gets 98 percent of rare earth minerals out of the ground in the world?
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.180]  The Chachachachai comms.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.860]  So in most cases, the Chai comms don't run the enslavement.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.460]  They run the civilian side of it, extracting and controlling the slaves.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.460]  But the paramilitary camps are run by the UN on record.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.060]  But when you watch a movie from Hollywood, it's the UN saving everyone from the mercenaries.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.260]  A lie, a lie, a lie.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.740]  All of it, a big giant damn lie.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.380]  We don't hear about the UN paying reparations for all the African slaves they got right
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.740]  now or for cutting the damn food off.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.460]  We're live folks, stay with us.

[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.420]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.920]  You'll find you're musket, but I'll run you through.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.240]  While you're waiting for the next attack, better stand, there's no turning back.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.980]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.760]  You'll find you're musket, but I'll run you through.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.440]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.200]  The fewest sounds, the charge begins.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.200]  But on this battlefield no one wins.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.200]  The smell of my free-spoken horse's breath.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.200]  And the virgin is a certain death.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200]  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.200]  It is Tuesday, June 13th, 2023.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.200]  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:19.200]  And all eyes around the world are on our republic right now as it sinks into the frothing, stinking swamp.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.200]  Of the new world order.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.200]  It's the swampification of our once great republic.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.200]  Our republic's been stolen and been dead for a long time.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.200]  But unlike a person, it can rise like the phoenix from the ashes.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200]  All right, I had some guests lined up today.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.200]  But I told the producers to cancel them or move them.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.200]  Because I was sitting there thinking, what am I doing wrong this morning?
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.200]  And I thought, you're not taking calls during this historic situation.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:55.200]  In fact, you've been hogging the airwaves since Friday with your own pontifications.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200]  And so we need to cover news and take calls.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]  And that's what we're going to do today.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.200]  And boy, is there a lot of it.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:11.200]  You know, it's very frustrating to see Senator Grassley, who's been one of the better watchdogs in his long tenure at the Senate.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.200]  He's the guy that exposed Delta Force at Waco that burned down the building and killed everybody.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200]  I mean, he brings the stuff out.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]  I'll hand it to him.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.200]  But it's always a day late and a dollar short.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.200]  He exposed the NSA spying long before Snowden did.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.200]  But he always just does it like an old turtle.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200]  He's got to be like 150 years old.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.200]  He was old when I first got on air 29 years ago.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.200]  He doesn't even look any different.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.200]  I don't know what's going on with him.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]  Maybe he's a robot.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.200]  I watched his 11-minute speech yesterday on the Senate floor yesterday.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.200]  I watched it when it wasn't live later in the afternoon.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:09:02.200]  And he was reading stuff out of a classified FBI report that shouldn't be classified.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]  He pointed that out.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.200]  And I was watching it, and I was like, wait a minute.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.200]  I've heard these tapes.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.200]  I've heard these tapes.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200]  I mean, here's the deal.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:23.200]  If you watch child porn even as a journalist, they can put you in prison, selectively enforce it.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200]  You know, used to journalists expose crimes.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.200]  You got awards for it.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.200]  Now if you do it, they can get a grand jury to indict you.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.200]  So when I got into his laptop when it was public three years ago,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.200]  when it first got out on the Internet a few months before the election,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.200]  I spent about five hours on it or longer, and I made the decision.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]  I've talked about it a lot.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.200]  I called the crew, and I said, I'm ordering you not to look at the laptop.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200]  And I rarely tell the crew what to do.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200]  I hire people I trust and just turn them loose.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.200]  But I said, I'm not going to have my crew look at a child porn,
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.200]  because there was child porn on there.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]  And I looked at one percent of it.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]  I mean, you could spend months on there.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.200]  I mean, this guy was videoing and taking photos and recording everybody and recording himself.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.200]  But just what I found was, I work for Chinese intelligence.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.200]  He's worth $37 million, and he disappeared two months ago.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.200]  Dad, what do I do?
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.200]  I'm a Chinese agent, and my handler's gone.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.200]  I mean, I played that tape like 20 times here.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]  There's hours of it.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.200]  It's not that I'm a coward when it comes to fighting tyranny or doing all the things I've done,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.200]  but I am kind of a coward when it comes to looking at child porn.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.200]  So it's not just that they can spin it and put me in jail for looking at it.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.200]  I don't want to look at it.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200]  I'm not going to look at it.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.200]  And I just punted on this.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200]  I just said, I can't look at it.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.200]  Well, now it's all been looked at, and Trump's talked about it.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.200]  Reportedly, it's hunters screwing kids as young as 10 years old.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.200]  I mean, these are pedophile thoroughbreds, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.200]  So Grassley has seen the unredacted reports.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.200]  Other than FBI agents and names they've blacked out, I don't know why,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.200]  to a chief senator, head of a major committee.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]  And he points that out.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.200]  He goes, you're not supposed to black this out to the public,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.200]  much less to a senator who's on all these committees, a chairman of them.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.200]  He said, that's the disrespect to the FBI, of the people that run it at the top.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200]  I don't want to say everybody.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.200]  And when I say everybody in the FBI is not a criminal, it's because I'm going to be accurate.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.200]  It's not about kissing their ass or being in good with the FBI.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.200]  There's a lot of good people at the FBI.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.200]  So I'm not going to sit there and say they're all criminals.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.200]  But I also don't want to say it to kiss their ass.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200]  It's a disgusting agency.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.200]  It needs to be abolished.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.200]  It's totally criminal at the top.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200]  There's no fixing it.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.200]  It's got to be a new agency, new people, new mission.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.200]  And anybody at a senior level who, I'm sorry to say,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.200]  who's worked for any of this regime cannot ever be in the new agency.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.200]  I mean, it's out of control.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.200]  But to just say, oh, they're all criminals, it's just not true.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.200]  But at the top, yeah, they are all criminals.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200]  And that's on the good side running to worse.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.200]  I mean, a bunch of them are pedos and multinational globalist U.N. agents.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.200]  I mean, most of the FBI and Justice Department leadership
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.200]  has been in these U.N. Interpol brainwashing groups
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.200]  and think the U.N. runs the world.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200]  I mean, it is disgusting.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.200]  But let me just get back to what I was saying
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.200]  because I kind of want to tell you what's coming up today.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.200]  We have the grassy information, and it's been coming out for a while.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.200]  And Roger Stone has talked to senior members of the House
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200]  that have seen all the documents.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.200]  And he says that it is just insanely damning
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.200]  because it's not just what's in the laptop.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.200]  I mean, they were taking money from the Chinese and the Russians
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.200]  and from the Ukrainians and from the Mexican drug cartels.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200]  It just came out the other day.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.200]  They've had state attorney generals that are investigating what's going on
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.200]  come out and say, man, the Democrats are like working with the drug cartels.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.200]  And the media is like, you crazy conspiracy theorists.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.200]  Of course they're working with the drug cartels.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.200]  The drug cartels are making $50 billion a year or more.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.200]  Damn right they are.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200]  Humans are smuggling all of it.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.200]  You don't think Nancy Pelosi called MS-13 God's children,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.200]  all God's children, because she just said that for no reason.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200]  And that's the thing.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200]  Republicans aren't perfect.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.200]  Far from it.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.200]  But I've seen interviews with former top mobsters.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]  You name it.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200]  They're like, we could never get Republicans to take money or work for us.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.200]  They tell us just go to hell.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200]  They try to shake Trump down.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.200]  He said, get out of my office and I'll kick your ass.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]  Oh, you're going to kill me?
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]  Go ahead.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.200]  Get the hell out of here or I'll beat your ass.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.200]  I mean, that's just how I am.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.200]  Somebody shows up, tries to shake me down, I'll be like, just pull the gun out.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200]  Really?
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200]  Go piss up a rope.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.200]  But the point is, is that the Democratic Party is a criminal enterprise.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.200]  And people need to get that through their heads.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200]  Okay?
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]  They're judges.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200]  They're lawyers.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.200]  They're people are a converted group of pure criminals.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.200]  They always had problems, even back in JFK's day.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:27.200]  But they are fully, fully converted to evil.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]  All right?
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]  And you need to understand that.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]  They have no bottom.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.200]  They'll do anything.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200]  And so that's where we are.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.200]  And the good news is people finally get it.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.200]  I've been saying this a thousand plus times.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.200]  The day we realize that we have absolute psychotics in control that are out to destroy us is the day we start winning.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.200]  The day we realize they already killed the country, but the country can rise again, we start winning.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:55.200]  And now you see Republican senators and Trump and mainline Republicans saying there's a multinational corporate,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.200]  new world order, globalist hijacking of the country, and the Federal Reserve is private, and they're wrecking everything,
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.200]  and they're coming after our kids, and they're shipping the drugs in, and they're pedophiles.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.200]  Yeah, okay, good, great.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:15.200]  Now we can admit the situation we're in and roll up our sleeves, and we're a lot tougher than we think we are,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.200]  and realize we're locked up in a room with these people.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.200]  And they're not going to go away by denying or sticking our head in the sand or putting our head under the covers.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.200]  We're going to have to roll up our sleeves and just get to dismantling these people.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.200]  And that means politically, culturally, spiritually, and if they attack us physically.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.200]  And it's what happens when you roll up your sleeves and decide to open a can of whoop-ass.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.200]  And I'm using that as an analogy.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.200]  I'm not saying be violent, but I'm saying politically be very aggressive and brutal.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.200]  Don't kick somebody's ass by thinking about it.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.200]  You just do it.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.200]  You say, you know what, this person's hurting me.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200]  I'm going to roll my sleeves up.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200]  I'm going to jump on top.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200]  I'm going to bash their brains out.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200]  And you do it.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200]  That's how it works.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.200]  Tell your body.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.200]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.200]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.200]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.200]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.200]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.200]  What's better, down and out?
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]  What's better?
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.200]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.200]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.200]  So one person might like this coffee.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]  Another person likes that coffee.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.200]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]  They're all very diverse.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.200]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love

[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]  It boosts men.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200]  It boosts women.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.200]  It works great.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200]  But women like pink labels.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.200]  Men like different color labels.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.200]  So it works for men as well.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]  It's the same formula.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200]  It's an incredible formula.

[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200]  That is a hellish future.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.200]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:19.200]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.

[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.760]  I took my troubles down to Madam Ruth
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.760]  You know that gypsy with the gold cap too
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.760]  She's got a pad on 34th and Vine
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.760]  Selling little bottles of love potion number nine
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.760]  I told her that I was a flop with chicks
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.760]  I've been this way since 1956
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.760]  She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.760]  She said what you need is love potion number nine
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.760]  And when I don't take it or the nitric boost
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.760]  I say why didn't I do that?
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.760]  Makes you 18 again
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.760]  Infowarsstore.com
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.760]  And it keeps us on air to battle the new world order
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.760]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.760]  We should rename it love potion number nine
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.760]  That's pretty funny
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.760]  How about some Chuck Berry
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.760]  We need some Chuck Berry coming in the next segment
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.760]  Since we're playing some chubby checker here
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.760]  Oh you guys are dipping into my 1950s music in the computer
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.760]  Hell let's do 1950s music the whole show today
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.760]  Let's have a little fun while the earth sinks into hell
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.760]  And we'll play Johnny B. Goode when the hydrogen bombs are going off
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.760]  Hey they'll kill us but they'll kill some of the new world order too
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.760]  But I do love my children
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.760]  So I'm not going to be cynical and evil
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.760]  Forgive me Lord
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.760]  You know I get mad and cuss occasionally
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.760]  Maybe once every three or four months on air
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.760]  And I become kind of possessed
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.760]  Not by the devil but by rage
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]  And it's wrong
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.760]  And I've said prayers the last few days
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.760]  That I will not get mad on air
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.760]  I know it's entertaining for people
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760]  But it takes years off my life
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.760]  And it's not an act when I blow up on air
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.760]  It's not an act when I blow up at Congressman Schiff on air
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.760]  People said man that was the best acting ever
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.760]  He was so mad
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.760]  My dog had just died that night
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.760]  And of an embolism
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.760]  And I held the French Bulldog in my arms
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.760]  Blood all over me and the bed
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.760]  And then I said I was going to do a late night show with Roger Stone
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.760]  Like 8 o'clock at night
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.760]  And so actually the dog was not dead yet
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.760]  It was having convulsions and bleeding
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.760]  And I felt bad to not take it to the vet
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.760]  But I knew it was already gone
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.760]  I figured the dog captain would be dead when I got home
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]  And he was not dead actually
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760]  When I got home at 11 o'clock at night
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.760]  And then subsequently died
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.760]  So people were like gosh
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.760]  That thing where I'm not a communist agent
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760]  Where I really blew up and everything
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.760]  But that's incredible
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.760]  That's like Jack Nicholson level anger
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]  How does he do that?
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.760]  Well there's always a little something behind things right?
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760]  That dog was the coolest
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.760]  He could catch frisbees
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.760]  He could jump like 4 feet in the air
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]  That dog was the coolest
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760]  But that was the problem
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.760]  Is he broke his neck jumping
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.760]  He was like 10
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]  Best dog ever
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.760]  Oh that was the coolest dog
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]  Because he was a mutant
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.760]  We went and looked at this litter of French Bulldogs
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760]  And he was the biggest one in the litter
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.760]  Had this big giant head
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.760]  He was so athletic
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.760]  And then he broke his neck
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]  When he was like 10
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760]  We had surgery on it
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.760]  And then he lived a couple more years
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.760]  And then he had that embolism
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.760]  One day he just walks up to me in the kitchen
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760]  With blood pouring out of his nose
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.760]  And I couldn't believe how much blood
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760]  Was coming out of the dog's nose
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760]  It just kept bleeding
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760]  And bleeding and bleeding
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.760]  I knew he was having convulsions
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]  I thought well
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.760]  I was like well I guess I'm going to put him down
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.760]  And then I just never got around to it
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.760]  Until he died
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.760]  But I don't know why I'm telling that story right now
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.760]  How do I go from Johnny B. Goode
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.760]  To my French Bulldog bleeding to death
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760]  Oh yeah
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760]  I'm really pissed off
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760]  I mean
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760]  There's a very good chance
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]  We're going to have a nuclear war
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.760]  I know people think it can't happen
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]  You have a normalcy bias
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]  So do I
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]  But it's
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.760]  About a 60% chance
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760]  We're going to have World War 3
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760]  Nuclear war
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760]  I would guess
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.760]  And I mean that's what I really think
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.760]  It's what I really believe
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.760]  It's what a lot of the top analysts believe as well
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760]  In fact the majority
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.760]  And it's getting worse every day
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.760]  I got reminded
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.760]  Last night doing some research
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]  I ended up staying up very late last night
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]  I have a chocolate hangover
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760]  I'm not a big sugar person
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.760]  But there was
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.760]  Easter candy left
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.760]  So I ate one candy bar
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.760]  And then I got into the Hershey's Kisses
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.760]  And stayed up until like 3 in the morning researching
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.760]  I have a huge headache
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.760]  And a chocolate hangover
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.760]  I ate more chocolate last night
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760]  I usually eat in a year
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.760]  I might eat like a chocolate bar once a month
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.760]  I had quite a bit last night
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.760]  And
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.760]  About 3 in the morning I'm like
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.760]  Why did I just eat a whole bag of Hershey's Kisses
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.760]  But
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.760]  Anyways that's where we're at
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760]  It's like why not?
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.760]  We're about to end the world
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.760]  Maybe I'll pull into the grocery store
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760]  And get a whole other bag today
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.760]  But
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.760]  I saw a comment on a tweet
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.760]  With a viral video I did yesterday
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.760]  About another CDC report
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.760]  Confirming myocarditis
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.760]  And how they knew it was causing heart attacks
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.760]  And all the rest of it
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.760]  And then people reminded me in the comments
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760]  I've got it right here
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.760]  And I actually followed it through to the studies
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.760]  That the Pentagon
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.760]  In 2020 along with the British Ministry of Defense
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.760]  Went to our respective governments
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.760]  And said this is causing
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.760]  Massive seizures
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.760]  Heart attacks, myocarditis
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.760]  And the CDC ignored it
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.760]  Well of course they ignored it
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760]  Because they're murdering us
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.760]  And I guess at the end of the day
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.760]  I can sit here
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.760]  And I can cover all this news
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.760]  To tell you the latest stuff they're doing to us
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.760]  But what group of people
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.760]  Whether you're in private life or government life
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.760]  Who goes along
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.760]  With a system that knowingly gives you a shot
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.760]  That doesn't protect you
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.760]  Erases your immune system
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.760]  And causes massive cancer increases
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.760]  And heart problems
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.760]  And blood clots
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.760]  And I know we all know this
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.760]  But that's
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.760]  Who runs the country
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.760]  And the world
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.760]  Is absolute crazy jerks
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.760]  So we know that
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.760]  But what about the public
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.760]  Well the public is so selfish
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.760]  On average
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.760]  That even though they're being slowly murdered
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.760]  They don't want to admit
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.760]  To themselves it's happening
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.760]  Because they might have to do something about it
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.760]  Because they're in a trance
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.760]  They're in a fog
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.760]  They're in a cuckoo world
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.760]  And then I'm just sitting here
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.760]  Where you know
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760]  If I read and I study
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.760]  And there's a global criminal group
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.760]  That wants my resources and wants me dead
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.760]  And says they want me dead
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.760]  And I go read their books
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.760]  And they say they want me dead
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.760]  I mean I kind of take that personal
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.760]  I kind of have a little respect for myself
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.760]  I think well I'm not going to put up with this
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.760]  I'm not rolling over and dying
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.760]  And I figure the rest of the public
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.760]  Wants to join me right
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.760]  We want to beat these people right
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760]  And when you look at George Soros
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760]  Or Alex Soros
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.760]  I read a bunch of his writings last night
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.760]  And he's even dumber than I thought he was
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.760]  And it's like they say at the end of Revelation
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.760]  When Satan's in that cage for a thousand years
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.760]  And people come to the cage and they say
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.760]  This is the one that conquered us
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.760]  This is the one we let
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760]  And I was watching him
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.760]  And it didn't make me hate him
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.760]  It made me feel bad about myself
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.760]  That I let this gibbering openly demonic demon
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.760]  Not even a human
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.760]  Literally sit there
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.760]  And dominate me and dominate innocent people
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.760]  It's my fault
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.760]  It's my fault
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.760]  I'm the problem
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.760]  Not George Soros, not Alexander Soros
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.760]  I'm bad, it's me, it's me
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.760]  Because I know all about it
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.760]  I know how to stop them
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.760]  And I didn't do enough to stop them
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.760]  You know what I'm going to
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.760]  Because these people
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.760]  Are the biggest losers on the planet
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.760]  And if we sit there
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.760]  And let them run our lives
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.760]  And let them kill our children
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.760]  And let them murder us
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.760]  Then God is going to damn us to hell
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.760]  And I don't want to spend eternity with George Soros and his son
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.760]  I want to be separate from them
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.760]  I want to be separate from them
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.760]  And I pray that God
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.760]  Dams them to hell
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.760]  And I know God will
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.760]  Burn in hell George Soros
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.760]  I haven't offered these for 50% off

[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.760]  That's because I use Brain Force
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.760]  Every day
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.760]  What I always need is
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.760]  Some sort of boost in the morning
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.760]  So I try to exercise, eat well
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.760]  Take good vitamins
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.760]  But the one thing that I have really found
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.760]  That makes a difference
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.760]  Is Brain Force
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.760]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.760]  Right before I go to my computer
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.760]  It takes 4 or 5 hours
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.760]  Writing a whole lot of stuff
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.760]  So it really is true that Brain Force
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.760]  Is something I use every day

[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.760]  And are more inductive to pain

[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.760]  It's not just
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.760]  Wide spectrum natural herbs
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.760]  That time release over 10 hours
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.760]  Should be called 10 hour energy
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.760]  It has a bunch of vitamins
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.760]  And minerals
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.760]  And amino acids
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.760]  That turbo charge everything
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.760]  And are good for your heart
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.760]  Your brain, your liver, you name it
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.760]  It is
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.760]  The super fuel
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.760]  RainForce Plus is great
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.760]  RainForce Ultra is great
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.760]  But this is the king Kong
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.760]  This is the boss
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.760]  TurboForce back in stock
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.760]  Discounted

[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.760]  More strength, more energy
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:05.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.760]  I think we should play this song while the hydrogen bombs are going off.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760]  Let's play a little bit of this right now.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.760]  The energy together puts a new order in
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.760]  We're back up in the woods among the emeralds
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.760]  There's still an old cabin made of earth and wood
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.760]  I lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.760]  I'd never have a love to read or write so well
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.760]  But even blue gets hot just like a rainbow
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.760]  Go, go, go!
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.760]  Go, Johnny, go!
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.760]  Go, go!
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.760]  Go, Johnny, go!
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.760]  Alright, we are back live. Let's get serious here.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.760]  So I ended up staying up late last night until probably 3 a.m. doing research.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.760]  And I see that all the time. I do that rarely now.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.760]  And I was thinking, you know, Alexander Soros just got
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.760]  The public money of the money laundering crime cartel
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.760]  Of the Bilderberg group that his dad's the front man for
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:59.760]  The $25 billion from his 92-year-old crib-keeper demon dad
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.760]  I said, I've never seen him give a speech
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.760]  So I thought, let me go do some research, more research on him
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.760]  And let me see if I can watch some speeches
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.760]  So I found three or four of them and I watched him
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.760]  Never have I seen a more revolting person
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.760]  Who, you know, if you believe those theories that reptiles are real
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.760]  And, you know, David Icke stuff, or they're like robots
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.760]  I mean, you watch him give a speech
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.760]  I mean, it's like an animatronic, you think you're at Chuck E. Cheese or something
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.760]  It's like, he doesn't come off like a person
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.760]  And, but that's a side issue
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.760]  Let's talk about
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.760]  Because last night at about 1 a.m.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.760]  I'm doing a deep dive on Alexander Soros
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.760]  And I started thinking about, man, how the media says they're angels
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.760]  And they're philanthropists and they care about us
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.760]  So I started sitting there with a notepad
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.760]  I thought, let me write down the bad things they've done
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.760]  And about an hour and a half later, I'd written about 30 things
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.760]  And I was like, oh my God
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.760]  These people are so villainous, so bad
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.760]  It just boggles the mind that I'd never listed the crimes of the Soroses
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.760]  The ones I know of
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.760]  It was staggering
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.760]  It was staggering
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.760]  And then I woke up this morning and I was looking at the notepad
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.760]  Which had been about three, woke up about seven
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.760]  And I got a computer in the bedrooms
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.760]  I got up, got a coffee, sat back down
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.760]  And I looked at the notes I wrote and I thought
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.760]  Oh, I missed the biggest one
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.760]  I missed the biggest crime
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.760]  That the Soroses have committed
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.760]  And I was like, how did I miss that one?
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.760]  And I could do this little game where I open the phones up
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.760]  And ask you what's the biggest crime they've committed
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.760]  And then people actually care if we build it up
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.760]  It actually has an effect
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.760]  But you know what, I'm not even going to do that
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.760]  I'm just going to tell you their biggest crime
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.760]  And it's on screen right now
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.760]  George Soros, six years ago
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.760]  Went on Fareed Zarkaria on CNN
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760]  There it is on screen
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.760]  And said, I got five billion dollars from the State Department
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.760]  He never spends his own money
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.760]  Oh, he gives it away
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.760]  No, he gets it like Bill Gates and then uses it for war
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.760]  The government gives it to him
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760]  To then sell it to private groups
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.760]  They have plausible liability
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.760]  So he goes on Fareed Zarkaria's show
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.760]  On CNN he says
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.760]  Do you want me to make you listen to his voice?
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]  I can actually play it
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.760]  I've played it probably 50 times
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.760]  And he goes on there and he says
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.760]  Well I overthrew with the five billion dollars
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.760]  I overthrew the Ukrainian government
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.760]  And now we're going to push the Russians out
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.760]  And of course we already all know that
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.760]  But their biggest crime
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.760]  Is putting us on the edge of World War III
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.760]  Now you know Soros brags
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.760]  That he overthrew more than 20 government's pension funds
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.760]  And tried to crash the British pound
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]  And destroy their pension funds
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.760]  He steals old people's retirement
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.760]  I mean, when I was a kid growing up
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.760]  And my mom had a little color TV
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760]  She cooked dinner almost every night
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.760]  We would go to dinner on Sunday nights sometimes
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.760]  But she cooked dinner six nights a week
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.760]  Breakfast, I'm salivating
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.760]  I'm such a good cook
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.760]  I got a good old fashioned upbringing
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.760]  But she'd have that little color TV on
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.760]  That finally broke about five years ago
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.760]  And she'd have the news on
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.760]  And I remember hearing George Soros crashing this
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.760]  George Soros robbing that
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.760]  But that's before he bought the media
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.760]  So this guy is stealing old people's pension funds
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.760]  You think Gordon Gekko in the fictional Wall Street
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.760]  Is a bad guy trying to overthrow a union owned airline
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.760]  And screwing the employees
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:07.760]  But George Soros steals the pension funds of old people
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.760]  And remember what he said when he worked for Hitler
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760]  He said it was the best time of my life
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.760]  Happy making, exhilarating
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.760]  He feels no remorse
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.760]  And what did he say?
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.760]  He said, I'll do it again
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:28.760]  And he said, if somebody else would do it if I didn't do it
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.760]  That is such a satanic statement
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.760]  That if I don't rob people, somebody else will fill that spot
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.760]  See he sees it as, oh, you know
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.760]  Somebody's got to steal old people's pension funds
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.760]  Somebody's got to help ship in fentanyl
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.760]  Somebody's got to help run child trafficking
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.760]  Somebody's got to cut the power off in South Africa
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.760]  And cause a 5,000% increase plus in crime
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.760]  Somebody's got to be Satan
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.760]  And so he's just archetypal to this whole group
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.760]  He just steps in
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.760]  With his son
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:07.760]  I went to the doctor
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.760]  To get my blood test results
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]  You know I'm almost 50
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.760]  Which I had blood tests done a few weeks ago
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]  And I go into the doctor
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.760]  To get my blood test results
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760]  And you have to go over them
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.760]  And they got a nurse practitioner and a doctor
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.760]  And then I'm talking to the nurse in there
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.760]  Cause they want to do some other blood tests
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.760]  You know, overall I'm doing great
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.760]  They had one test they wanted to do again
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.760]  Like 18 tests
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.760]  And she goes
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.760]  You know, I have another job
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.760]  I actually work part time at the Travis County Jail
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.760]  And she said, I'm sure you've heard about the George Soros
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.760]  DA we have
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.760]  And I said, well of course I have
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760]  She goes, well
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.760]  Did you hear about the story about
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.760]  The man that raped five women
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.760]  And in the last three years
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.760]  And he raped another woman in front of people on the bike trail
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.760]  Just tackled her at like high noon
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.760]  In the busy bike trail
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.760]  Broke her leg
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.760]  Punched her in the face
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.760]  Bloodied her nose
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760]  Blacked her eyes
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.760]  And then raped her on the hike and bike trail
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.760]  And the George Soros
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.760]  Prosecutor
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.760]  Gave him probation for the fifth rape
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760]  And I went, no
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760]  Let me look that up
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.760]  There it was
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.760]  Folks, this is just where I live
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.760]  They have 800 of these people in plus
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.760]  Around the country
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.760]  They let people off that shot up 6th street last year
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760]  And shot a bunch of people
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.760]  They let them go in two days
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760]  Oh, you're black
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.760]  So you just shot a bunch of people
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760]  You go free
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760]  And you think like
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:45.760]  Can you imagine
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.760]  Can you imagine
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.760]  That you're a drunk driver
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.760]  And you run over and kill a family in their car
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.760]  And you get a 10 day jail sentence
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760]  Time served
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.760]  Now, here's the difference
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.760]  If I have a crooked toenail
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.760]  20 years in prison
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.760]  They're just opening the jails up for us
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]  But just imagine
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]  So I can sit here and list off
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.760]  Robbing pension funds
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.760]  Taking over governments
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.760]  Promoting pedophile stuff
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.760]  Alexander Soros says he's going to promote gender transition
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.760]  That's cutting little boys' testicles off
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.760]  I mean, you're like, God, that's evil
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.760]  Folks, they know they're evil
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.760]  He's a crazed, psychotic, luciferian maniac
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760]  Go watch an interview with him
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.760]  He's shaking with hatred
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.760]  With the interviewers that are worshipping him
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760]  There is evil in the world
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.760]  And they manifest themselves
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.760]  And here it is
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.760]  I mean, you want to know who it is
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.760]  And now they're busy causing World War III
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.760]  Their biggest crime
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.760]  Soros will sit back when the bombs rain on him
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.760]  And love it
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.760]  He wants to kill everybody
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.760]  These are demon-possessed people, folks
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.760]  George Soros is demon-possessed
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.760]  A lot of people have asked me
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.760]  Why is M4 a store at M4's Life
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.760]  Not at a probiotic for more than three years
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]  And the answer is simple

[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.760]  To lowest prices

[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.760]  Of probiotics for more than seven years
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.760]  They got bought by a lip-tard company
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.760]  And said, we're not doing business
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.760]  With you, Mr. Jones, anymore
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.760]  Finally, we got a probiotic
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.760]  Just as good or better

[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.760]  Not put him in handcuffs
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.760]  Not do a mugshot
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.760]  Because they knew that that would help Trump
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.760]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.760]  We were waiting for the mugshot
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760]  We learned today they wouldn't have it
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]  So we've made our own
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.760]  And it says Political Prisoner
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.760]  With an image of President Trump
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.760]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.760]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.760]  Political Prisoner
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.760]  With Trump on the front
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.760]  There in a mugshot jail background
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.760]  It's a fundraiser shirt
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]  It says InfoWars.com
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.760]  On the back of the shirt
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.760]  We also have Alex Yost for President
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.760]  No, I'm not running for President
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.760]  It's a really nice navy blue high-quality shirt
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]  Red, white, and blue
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.760]  Alex Yost for President

[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.760]  And the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.760]  During their major takeover
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760]  Is because of you

[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]  Back in stock
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:08.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:28.440]  Alright, I want to get to all the big news and cover everything that's unfolding,
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:47.400]  but I want to just finish something up before I give you all the big stuff that's breaking
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.400]  right now.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.920]  We have reporters on the ground in Miami where Trump is set to be arraigned with the kangaroo
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.240]  court charges by Jack Smith, the Deep State, any time starting in like 15 minutes from
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.120]  now through the next two hours.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.440]  The word is he can show up in the next 15-20 minutes, any time in the next two hours, we've
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.340]  got reporters on the ground with live feeds of that, we'll be talking to them coming
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.640]  up starting the next hour.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.600]  So look for that.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.880]  But getting back to Soros, this is an important exercise.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:23.080]  Look at the crimes he committed rounding up Jews and turning them over to Hitler and saying
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:28.320]  it was the best time of his life, that's a quote, happy-making, exhilarating, these
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.440]  are quotes.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.760]  And then the media responding saying that's good, that's the rest of the story.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:42.720]  And then running around overthrowing governments, destabilizing countries, running slave mines
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]  around the planet.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:50.760]  What they do is they collapse the government and then come in and set up slave factories.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:56.600]  I mean, it's just like they're so bad, they're like, man, villains in movies and stuff aren't
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:03.480]  this evil, this is like real evil.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:08.280]  And then you wonder why they're in charge, well, they'll do anything the globalists want.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.000]  And they love it.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.120]  And then overthrowing the Ukrainian government and starting World War III and helping around
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.880]  the censorship and control here domestically, and funding the movement to take children
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:23.880]  away.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.720]  They're trying to, Alex Soros gave a speech last week where his new focus will be taking
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.800]  children from parents and having their genitals cut off.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.080]  That's his new main focus.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]  Look it up.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.440]  I mean, it's like, and they want to kidnap our kids and cut their testicles off.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:44.880]  And they overthrow governments, they start World War III and you're just like, wow, wow,
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.880]  wow.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:53.600]  And you look at Bill Gates, even worse.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:07.560]  And it's just like, whoa, I mean, we are literally looking at people that Hitler would blush
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.560]  at.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.600]  But their little turtleneck pink sweater, Bill Gates, oh, I'm a computer guy.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.960]  Oh, George Soros, I'm a philanthropist.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.600]  Or he hides behind being Jewish.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.640]  I was watching his son, you see, he'll get asked a few questions by the press, hey, what
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.080]  about these governments not wanting you to, oh, they're just anti-Semitic.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.160]  George Soros is an atheist.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.240]  But again, who said they were Jewish?
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.280]  Who made it about Jews?
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.280]  Not us.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:49.320]  And again, George Soros sides with the Palestinians most of the time because he wants conflict.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:55.200]  So you have to actually look at what people do versus what they say.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:03.720]  And all I'm saying is, with the transference of the crown of evil from George Soros to
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.960]  his son, I went back and looked at him for three, four hours last night.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.920]  And I couldn't bring myself to send the clips to the crew because I'm not going to subject
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.040]  you to listening to him.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:24.440]  But man, I have never heard someone that I wanted to turn the video off more.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:30.240]  If I was casting somebody to be a bad robot that didn't have charisma and didn't have
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.680]  humanity, it would be him.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.320]  I mean, it's hard to find, but just go type in, go watch his interview in Macedonia five
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.320]  years ago.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.320]  It's about 10 minutes long.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.640]  You'll slit your wrists watching it.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:46.640]  But it's all there.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.280]  If you don't open your borders up to Muslims, you're anti-Semitic.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:52:04.640]  I mean, these guys want to wreck Western civilization because they're worried Western civilization
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.200]  will get in the way of their looting the third world.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.480]  In fact, that's all this is.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.480]  These are hyper-predators.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.280]  And you go, how can they be so evil?
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.440]  There's always bad people like that.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.440]  There are psychotic Europeans, there are psychotic Asians, there are psychotic, every group has
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.440]  them.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.640]  There are black ones, there's white ones, there's Christian ones, there's Jewish ones, there's
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]  Muslims ones.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.960]  You know, they're in every flavor.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:36.600]  But at the end of the day, they're all spiked with cyanide.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.600]  They have a will to hurt you, just like in oil.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.440]  There will be blood, which is fiction, but it's damn right.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.440]  The old man is sitting there looking to who he thinks is his brother, who he later kills.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.560]  He says, I have a competition in me.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.440]  I don't like to see people do well.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:58.000]  In fact, pull that up from there.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]  There will be blood.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]  I have a competition in me.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.440]  I promise if you go to YouTube and type in, there will be blood, I have a competition
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.440]  in me.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.440]  It'll come right up.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.000]  Lewis, one of the best actors ever, lays it out.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.440]  You see that darkness in Lewis, he can show you when he wants to.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.000]  And then in Last Mohegans, he does a great job showing the angel that's in him.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.480]  In fact, he probably is the best actor ever.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.720]  But regardless, you need to understand that statement.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.880]  There's a competition in me where I don't like to see other people do good.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:33.240]  Why would they give us a shot that gives us HIV-like symptoms and gives us heart attacks?
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:39.600]  Because they don't like you doing well.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.440]  And if you don't figure that out, because you're like, well, I don't want to crash pension
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.440]  funds for our people.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.440]  Well, welcome to humanity.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.440]  You're normal.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:53.040]  95% of us are like that.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:59.560]  But 5.999, you know, 4.999% of people will do anything they're told for money, and there's
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.040]  that tiny little 10 to 1% that are psychotics.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.400]  And when we don't oppose them, we let them be in charge.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.320]  And it's time to stop being naive and stop letting those people be in charge, or we're
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.320]  all dead.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.600]  And I'm serious about that.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.120]  Because we can't make the mistakes we've made in the past and then tyranny collapses and
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.920]  civilization collapses and we rebuild.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.440]  If society collapses, there's 400 and something nuclear reactors that are all going to melt
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.280]  down and it'll make all of us glow in the dark.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.200]  All right, I'm done talking about it.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.520]  We'll go to reporters on the ground, there's several of them we're going to be talking
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.400]  to in Miami, where Trump's about to turn himself in next hour.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.120]  I'll also be giving the number out.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:46.160]  We'll just kind of have the reporters there with a watch whenever Trump gets there.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.640]  And there's a bunch of news on the war, a bunch of news on the economy, a bunch of news
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:55.800]  on pedo pride crap.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.960]  But you did find the Daniel Day Lewis clip.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.080]  So when you hear this, listen to this, because this is the globalist plan.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]  Here it is.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.040]  I have a competition in me.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:16.480]  I want no one else to succeed.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.040]  I hate most people.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.760]  That part of me is gone.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.400]  Working and not succeeding.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:30.720]  All my failures has left me.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.880]  I just don't care.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.720]  Well, if it's in me, it's in you.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:51.400]  There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:57.320]  I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:10.760]  What will you do about your boy?
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.760]  I don't know.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.760]  Maybe it'll change.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.760]  Does your sound come back to you?
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760]  I don't know.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.760]  Maybe no one knows that.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.760]  Doctor might not know that.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.760]  Where's his mother?
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:37.560]  I don't want to talk about those things.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.680]  I see the worst in people, Henry.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.120]  I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:55.760]  I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:06.080]  Having you here gives me a second breath and I can't keep doing this on my own.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.080]  These people.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:17.920]  All right, well, the decision has been made to kill all of us.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.920]  I actually love you.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920]  I believe in you.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.720]  I get disgusted by our weakness, by my own weakness.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.720]  But I see my weakness.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]  I see yours.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.040]  I also see our high points.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]  I believe in you.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.240]  I want to make it through this together.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.240]  I want us to make it.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.120]  But listen, you've got to admit what's happening or we don't have any hope.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.480]  We're in the process of being slowly poisoned and killed right now.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.360]  And we have to recognize evil people and we have to stop them.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]  Okay.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.360]  It's very simple.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.360]  God's real.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.840]  And if we sit on the sidelines, God's going to damn us to hell.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.840]  Stay with us.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.360]  Our number two straight ahead.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:56.800]  Two of our best selling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at info or
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.800]  store.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.800]  I come for a limited time.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.880]  They're 50% off when you get them together or 40% off when you get them individually.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:07.080]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.080]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:15.680]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.240]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula that's Brain Force Ultra that hits
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]  really, really quick.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.240]  And I love it.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.240]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.880]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.280]  say nine o'clock at night, got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.480]  or something and boom, writing an article or writing a book, and then I get two, three
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.560]  hours of energy and then you go right to bed after it.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.840]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.240]  A lot of people love these products.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240]  They've got five star reviews.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.200]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]  50% off.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.200]  Info or store.com.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:54.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.800]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.320]  us.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.320]  But when we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:08.320]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.600]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.640]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.640]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:26.080]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]  us.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.080]  I know you spread the word.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.080]  I know you pray for us.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.080]  That's wonderful.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.080]  Keep doing it.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.040]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Info Wars store.com, and you never buy great
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.520]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:42.720]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Info Wars store.com.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:47.440]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Info Wars store.com, our funding problems
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.440]  will be over.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.440]  Please take action now.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:56.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.440]  Chuck Berry, a human, made that sound.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.440]  The early 1950s and launched rock and roll.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.440]  Look at what Beethoven did.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440]  No, I'm a fan of humanity.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440]  We got some lows.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.440]  We got some highs.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.440]  And I love every damn square inch of this planet and you.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.440]  And I love God even more.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.440]  I don't have a competition in me against good people.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.440]  But I got a competition against evil.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440]  Oh, I'm going to get them.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.440]  We're going to get them together.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.440]  We're made to sink our teeth into these devils.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.440]  Just show them that God's real.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.440]  We're going to never back down.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.440]  And never give up.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.440]  Some of us will give out in the fight, but we'll just be an example to others of never giving up.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440]  Alright, we got reporters on the ground.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.440]  We'll go to the next segment.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.440]  Trump can turn himself in at any time to this court.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.440]  We don't know the court's kangaroo court yet.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440]  We know the charges are a fraud.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.440]  And again, if I ever saw real charges against Trump, I would support it.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440]  There are no real charges.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440]  It is a complete fabrication as usual.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440]  And we've already seen this, what?
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.440]  Eight, nine different fabrications, all of them fabrications.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.440]  And see, that's the thing about the law.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:36.440]  If they catch a judge or a prosecutor framing a defendant, even if the defendant's guilty, they go free.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.440]  Because the greater danger is the corrupt court.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.440]  They've been caught trying to frame Trump and framing Trump over and over again.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.440]  They told me that it's noon in Texas right now.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.440]  And it is noon, by the way.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.440]  We're doing the show live. We put the clock on screen.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.440]  It's 12.01.49 seconds right now.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.440]  It's 12.01.54 seconds right now.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.440]  But if Chuckie Schumer told me it was 12 noon right now, or 12.02 right now,
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440]  I wouldn't believe it.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.440]  Because these people cannot ever tell the truth.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.440]  And after we talk to some of the reporters on the ground,
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.440]  Laura Loomer and others here in a moment,
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  we will open the phones up for the balance of the transmission.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.440]  And boy, do I have a lot of news here.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.440]  I mean, we have a big Wired Magazine article about, oh, guess what?
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.440]  The government's got everything private about you in a database
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:46.440]  and has been watching you for 40 years and is going to put in a social credit score.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.440]  Totally illegal, but they just announced they're doing it.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.440]  They're bum-rushing us. They're launching everything at once.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.440]  They're firing all their guns at once and exploding into space.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.440]  And, of course, there's a lot of worry about violence at the Trump courthouse.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.440]  And there's classic ray-ups type people running up and down the street spouting garbage.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:16.440]  But even if the feds stage violence today, no one's going to buy it.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.440]  I mean, are there some idiot Trump supporters that could do something?
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.440]  Yeah, I mean, I once heard the Eat Your Money is real.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.440]  But we know 99 times out of 100, it is a staged event.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.440]  But I'm not saying leprechauns aren't real or Santa Claus isn't real.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.440]  I've never seen it. I don't think it's real.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.440]  But it could be real. It could be real.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440]  Let's play a short clip. I mentioned this earlier.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.440]  Here's Senator Grassley talking about these recordings the FBI has.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:53.440]  He's seen the actual documents of Biden being on the Ukrainian and CHICOM payroll.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:01.440]  The 10-23 produced to the House committee's redacted reference
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.440]  that the foreign national who allegedly bribed Joe and Hunter Biden
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:13.440]  allegedly has audio recordings of his conversation with them.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.440]  17 such recordings.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:25.440]  According to the 10-23, the foreign national possesses 15 audio recordings
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.440]  of phone calls between him and Hunter Biden.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:36.440]  According to the 10-23, the foreign national possesses two audio recordings
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.440]  of phone calls between him and then-Vice President Joe Biden.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.440]  These recordings were allegedly kept as a sort of insurance policy
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.440]  for the foreign national in case that he got into a tight spot.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.440]  And, uh, one of the whistleblowers is now dead.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.440]  I forgot to get to that point. I probably...
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.440]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters,
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.440]  are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.440]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.440]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.440]  Two separate formulas. They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.440]  One is a four-to-six-hour good base of clean energy,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.440]  again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.440]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula,
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.440]  that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440]  And I love it. It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.440]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.440]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.440]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something,
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.440]  And then I get two, three hours of energy, and then you're right to bed after it.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.440]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.440]  A lot of people love these products. They've got five-star reviews.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.440]  50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.440]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.440]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.440]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:32.440]  Alright, Laura Loomer is in Florida, where Trump is set to be arraigned today.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.440]  He could be arriving any time.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.440]  On the ground there, the left has been trying to provocate her violence, we know that.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.440]  Laura Loomer is there. Laura, thank you for joining us. Tell us what's happening.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.440]  Hey Alex, yeah, so I'm here in front of the courthouse in Miami, Florida,
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.440]  where President Trump is supposed to be arraigned today.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.440]  I know we're doing this interview over the phone, but people can go to my Twitter,
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.440]  at Laura Loomer, and get the live feed.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440]  We're going to be streaming all day long.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.440]  And, you know, I organized a rally in support of President Trump,
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.440]  and we have a lot of people out here who came out to rally against this weaponized government
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.440]  in our country, the weaponization of government against Trump supporters,
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440]  and this two-tier justice system.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.440]  And obviously, you know, people are very passionate because our country is being destroyed,
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:23.440]  and we're watching the Justice Department target the leading GOP contender
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.440]  on the ballot for 2024 in an unprecedented act of election interference.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.440]  And so you can see behind me, people are here in their Trump shirts.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.440]  Donald Trump did nothing wrong. They have the Trump love shot shirts.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.440]  We're out here. President Trump is set to arrive any moment now.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.440]  We have DHS and Miami PD barricades, and obviously, we're just peaceful rally goers.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.440]  This is not basic 2.0. We have no intention of breaking barriers or going inside.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:54.440]  We are just here to rally in support of President Trump and show people that,
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.440]  look, it's time to take a stand. Don't tower in fear of the DOJ and the FBI.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.440]  Come out and make your voices heard.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.440]  Well, Laura, do we know—I mean, I know they were saying in the news he could be arriving now.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.440]  Do we have any idea when he's going to be arriving there of this arraignment?
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.440]  He was supposed to be arriving around 1 o'clock,
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.440]  and there's a lot of movement towards the front of the courthouse right now by the media.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.440]  So I think that President Trump should be here any moment now.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.440]  I was told—his campaign called me this morning.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.440]  I got a phone call from President Trump's secretary this morning,
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.440]  and she said that President Trump wanted to thank me for the rally that I organized
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.440]  and that he loves the fact that—sorry, it's so hot out here.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.440]  So many people are coming out in support of him today,
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:45.440]  and he's very grateful that Patriots came together to rally peacefully to support him.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.440]  It's his 77th birthday tomorrow, and we'll know any moment when he arrives
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:55.440]  because the press is going to be, you know, filming and rushing to the front to take photos.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440]  So any moment now, Alex.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  And that's why you guys can come in and out of our live feed on my Twitter account all day long
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.440]  and get exclusive on-the-ground coverage here.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.440]  A lot of Isabel Wuerth fans.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.440]  How many of you guys like Alex Jones?
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.440]  Woo! Alex Jones!
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.440]  So we've got a lot of supporters here as well, Alex.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.440]  Well, Laura, let's expand on this.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:23.440]  Are you seeing any of the leftists or antifa—I mean, we know there's not many of them,
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.440]  but it looks like a lot of people—maybe your camera person can pan around—
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.440]  but it looks like a lot of folks there to cover this, a lot of folks in support.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:36.440]  What would you say, as a guesstimation, the percentage of Trump supporters are versus libtards?
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.440]  We have a lot.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.440]  So, look, I'm going to have him pan.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.440]  I'm going to have him take the camera off me and just film the audience and film the crowd here
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.440]  so you can see how many people are here.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.440]  And, look, there were some leftists here today, but it's been peaceful.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  You know, it's not violent acts.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.440]  There were some leftists, anti-Trump people here, but we've been able to keep it very peaceful.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.440]  And we told everybody, if you want to come here today, you keep it peaceful.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440]  We're not violent people.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.440]  The media wants to say we're insurrectionists.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440]  You know, DHS is trying to flag this rally as an act of right-wing extremism.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.440]  But we're just here, people from all walks of life, to support President Trump.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.440]  And we'll walk around a bit.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.440]  You can see over here there's all types of people.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.440]  Let's take a look at some of the different signs.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.440]  You have people calling out Joe Biden.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.440]  Well, Laura, expanding on that, the Democrat talking point when they indicted him last Thursday
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:38.440]  was that this time it's different than Alvin Bragg in New York that made him go up in the polls.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.440]  Now all the polls show Trump got an even bigger boost.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.440]  Now he's 50 points ahead of DeSantis, and now he's 25 points ahead of Biden.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.440]  So I guess they want to do more indictments, and they admit he could be in jail,
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440]  elected president, and pardon himself.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440]  He's not giving up.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.440]  This is blown up in their face yet again.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.440]  All the evidence is coming out about Jack Smith being a U.N. prosecutor,
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.440]  making movies with Big Mike, with Obama's husband.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.440]  I mean, this is all coming out.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440]  What's your take on that, Laura Loomer?
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.440]  Look, I think it's a little short of breath out here, very hot.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.440]  I think it's going to blow up tremendously.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440]  You know, Vivek Ramaswamy was here today.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.440]  I just posted an interview with him on my feed if you guys want to play that.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.440]  And he had a press conference, and he was slamming around DeSantis for not coming out here.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.440]  And I don't think Vivek's going to win, but he did the right thing.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.440]  He came out here today to show support.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440]  And DeSantis is going to plummet in the polls.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440]  Donald Trump is going to skyrocket.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440]  This only activates the base even more.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.440]  The more you attack Donald Trump, the more support he has.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440]  And Vivek said it perfectly.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.440]  Every single candidate should take the Vivek Ramaswamy pledge to pardon Donald Trump.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.440]  Let's just say God forbid he's not the nominee.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.440]  Pardon Donald Trump the day of inauguration.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.440]  And it was a wonderful press conference.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.440]  You should play the clip for your viewers.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.440]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.440]  Should meatball drop out of the race?
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440]  Absolutely.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  And that's what I was saying on the bullhorn here today.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.440]  And look, every single GOP candidate should drop out of the race and unite.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.440]  It would have been a beautiful moment for our country if everybody came here.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440]  It would have been so symbolic.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440]  The country and the party would have been energized.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440]  We could appeal together.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.440]  I know there's been a lot of hot rhetoric lately with people going back and forth about DeSantis and Trump.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:30.440]  But we could appeal the party today if they would have just dropped out and supported Trump.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.440]  But a lot of their egos are so big.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.440]  And that's what Ron DeSantis is all about.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.440]  He's all about himself.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.440]  He doesn't care about weaponization of government.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.440]  This is happening in the so-called free state of Florida.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.440]  So, you know, I know that we talk about this a lot, Alex.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:50.440]  But we have to make sure that the Infowars audience knows Ron DeSantis is in favor of a weaponized government.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440]  Ron DeSantis is against free speech.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440]  Yeah, but you're all over DeSantis.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.440]  I mean, he's like in the rearview mirror.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.440]  Trump's 35, 40 points ahead of him.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.440]  So it's almost like even attacking him is like even pointless.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.440]  The indictments of Trump have only turbocharged him.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.440]  Can you walk over to the front of the courthouse?
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.440]  I know you're very close to where Trump will be, quote, turning himself in.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.440]  It's not pointless, Alex.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.440]  And I'll walk over, but it's not pointless because Ron DeSantis is stoking up hundreds of millions of dollars of donor money
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.440]  that could otherwise be used for ballot harvesting efforts.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.440]  It's not pointless to go after him.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440]  He knows he can't win.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.440]  His whole strategy is to drain the party of hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:38.440]  so that we don't have effective anti-voter fraud and ballot harvesting efforts ahead of 2024.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.440]  So I'm going to challenge you on that.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.440]  I think it's absolutely necessary that we hammer him because he's being selfish.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.440]  He's trying to hurt the party.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.440]  He's trying to ensure four more years of Joe Biden.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.440]  So this is the frontier.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.440]  We're going to walk up right to the barricade.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.440]  Well, I mean, if they held the election today, Trump would win the Republican nomination
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.440]  and he would win the national election.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.440]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.440]  I agree. Good to see you.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.440]  So we're here. We have the police officers on bikes.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.440]  And we have federal protection, homeland security.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.440]  You can pan this down and see this.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.440]  I don't know which door President Trump is going to go in, but we'll come over here.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.440]  Everybody can see tremendous police presence towards the front over there.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:26.440]  You can zoom in and see a ton of cars, homeland security blocking all the doors.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.440]  Look, no one's going to be piercing these barricades because we're people,
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.440]  but they even have cars physically blocking the entrance so nobody can get in,
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.440]  which is good because, look, we're not here to go inside.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:45.440]  The judge last night who oversees this court here in the Southern District
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.440]  banned cameras and electronic devices and cell phones from the courtroom
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.440]  so reporters will not be able to take phones or electronic devices inside the courtroom.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  You know why? Because Trump wants those images and he wants the mugshot.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  That's why they didn't do it in New York, because he wants the archetypal image of this persecution.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.440]  So I think they should not be banning cameras.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:15.440]  Yeah, look, I think that it's so unprecedented and it's so shocking that they should.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.440]  I think that they should, but, you know, a lot of federal courthouses don't allow for cameras.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440]  So I think this is pretty common.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.440]  Obviously, people are going to wonder if it's partisan simply because it's President Trump,
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.440]  but oftentimes cameras are banned.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:35.440]  Well, let me ask you this. If Peto Joe is so popular, where are his Peto supporters?
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440]  I mean, are you seeing... We're going to skip this break, guys. I told you that.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.440]  Are we seeing any of Peto Joe's Peto supporters?
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.440]  No. We have Joe Biden supporters here today.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.440]  I don't see any. Everybody here is for Trump.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.440]  Even, you know, the anti-Trump movement here was very small.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.440]  It was a few, I would say, taped away because they realized they were quickly outnumbered.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:08.440]  So mostly just Trump supporters here, patriots, nonviolent, peaceful demonstrations.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.440]  And Donald Trump is going to be arriving any moment now.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.440]  So you can see some people. You're live on InfoWars. What do you have to say?
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.440]  Hello, Alex. I wish you were here with me, but that's OK. Thank you, Laura, for being here.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.440]  Yeah. You're a fan of InfoWars and Alex Jones?
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.440]  Tell me about it. And dad, I talk to fans. He's my buddy with InfoWars.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.440]  That's great. That's wonderful. We've got a lot of fans here.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.440]  What do you have to say to InfoWars? Alex Jones?
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.440]  Love Alex Jones. Kick ass.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.440]  Yes. InfoWars. You guys Alex Jones fans?
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.440]  We are!
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440]  You're live on InfoWars right now.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440]  We are Alex. Keep up the good fight.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.440]  We love you. Keep it going.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.440]  Exactly. Because it is a war for your mind. That is a fact.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.440]  Alex wants to know if you've seen any Biden people here today or if it's mostly pro-Trump.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.440]  Tell him what you're seeing here. Where are you from and why you're out here today?
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.440]  Locally here in Southern Florida.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:05.440]  I have not seen a single Biden bumper sticker except for when it was peeled off an old Buick.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  But aside from that, everyone here is Trump.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.440]  Oh, but he won the election.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.440]  It's like watching Japanese movies.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  The audio is off, but it's still interesting.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440]  I told you I'm a samurai.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  All right. Let's do it.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440]  Did you find a libtard?
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.440]  No, we found Francis Suarez. Here, we gotta run, you guys. Hold on.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.440]  We're gonna do a live loomerang. Hold on.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.440]  Who did you find? What type of creature?
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.440]  We found Francis Suarez. He's the mayor of Miami.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.440]  We may not be able to get past this.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440]  No, get in there, Laura.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.440]  The mayor. Come on. Let's go over here. We gotta get through.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440]  We gotta go through. Here.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.440]  Even with the media? I'm with the media.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.440]  So, to get across the street? Okay.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.440]  The police told us that we have to go across.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.440]  Oh, it's all right. Who cares about the mayor? Boring.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.440]  All right. Well, Laura.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.440]  There's other people. Stay tuned to the live feed and feel free to cut in and out because there's gonna be a lot going on.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.440]  Yeah, Laura. What we're gonna do is we're gonna keep watching your live feed.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.440]  It'll be up on Infowars.com.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.440]  And we'll, as soon as Trump gets there, we will talk to you.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.440]  But what a circus. So, Trump can arrive any time, correct?
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.440]  Any minute now. Any minute, President Trump is going to arrive because there has to be, from my understanding,
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:56.440]  paperwork, possibly fingerprinting, ahead of 3 p.m., which is the actual arraignment.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.440]  So, I was told President Trump would be arriving between 1 and 2 p.m.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.440]  And the arraignment's at 3.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.440]  So, I appreciate you covering this, Alex, and allowing me to come out and share the news.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.440]  Oh, you bet. We appreciate you, Laura.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.440]  All right. In Miami, Florida, we're gonna keep watching your feed.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.440]  And we'll contact you back, hopefully, or contact us as soon as we get movement.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.440]  Thank you, Laura Limmer.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.440]  All right. Thank you.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:28.440]  All right. I kind of pontificated just about the nature of the world and Soros and the globalist first hour.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.440]  We've had Laura on the last 19 minutes or so.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440]  We have particularly interesting news today.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.440]  I just, I don't want to say I get exhausted sometimes, but it's weird.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.440]  I watch these clips, and then I don't want to look at it again.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.440]  It's a weird, the show becomes like a one-man show.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:56.440]  It's like a, well, I don't want to look at Gilvano Arrari again, but we need to play this clip.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.440]  So I've got a bunch of these.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:08.440]  We got stuff on the sexualization of children that is just even more insane than I thought it would be.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:18.440]  We have them cutting down Union Jack British flags in the UK and hoisting up thousands all over the city,
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.440]  pedoflex.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440]  It's not just the rainbow flag.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:33.440]  It's the trans thingy, and they're just cutting down the Union Jacks, and they just throw them in the trash can.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:39.440]  It's like they're gone, and the new flag is people don't want to have sex with children.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.440]  And then you got AI could rewrite the Bible and correct religion.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.440]  Oh, AI will correct our religion.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.440]  Oh, a little weird skinny dude that says he's going to live forever, and he's going to be God.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.440]  I mean, I'm not saying Gilvano Arrari is a pedophile.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.440]  I don't think he is.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440]  There's no evidence of that.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:05.440]  But if I was going to cast somebody for a movie where two guys drive around in an ice cream truck,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:12.440]  kidnapping kids, and eating them, I would cast Gilvano Arrari and Brian Stelter.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.440]  I mean, I would not.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.440]  If I was walking down a dark alleyway at night, I would go to the other side of the street if I saw Arrari.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.440]  Let's just say this.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.440]  If I'm hiring a nanny, he ain't going to be it.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.440]  You know what I mean?
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:30.440]  A really nice feller that says the future isn't human, and we're all dead, but he's a god,
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.440]  and he'll step on us like bugs, and that we're useless eaters.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.440]  He even has Hitler quotes like, but he's Jewish.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.440]  So it's like, oh, Hitler quotes from a Jew.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440]  I need to roll over and die.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.440]  Well, yes, sir, supreme god man.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440]  Yes, uber mention.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  Let me roll over into a ditch and just gaze at you while you tell me about the AI gods
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.440]  that are going to fix all the sacred texts and teach me how to bow to you.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.440]  Also, the U.S. is openly stockpiling dirt on all Americans.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.440]  Big Wired article of the NSA, and they want you to know we got everything on you,
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.440]  so sit down and shut up.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.440]  These are the good guys.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440]  The future is not human.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.440]  We're going to cut your son's Johnson off, and we're spying on you,
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.440]  and we're going to make you take a shot that makes you really sick or kills you.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.440]  But, hey, we're the good guys, so don't be a Nazi.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:32.440]  Let us take over your body and get rid of your border and ship some fentanyl in.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440]  Please don't be a Nazi.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440]  Good.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440]  Thank you.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440]  Now, give me your children.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440]  Thank you.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440]  Look, the future is not human.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440]  Have you heard?
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.440]  I'm your god, so give me your children.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440]  Okay.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.440]  Hey, your children are ours.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]  Yeah.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440]  Joe Biden's a pedophile.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.440]  Yeah.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.440]  Yeah.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.440]  No, we're making a run at you.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.440]  Did you figure that out yet?
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.440]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.440]  You have a normalcy bias.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440]  You think there's a bunch of white hats in the government.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.440]  Everything's fine.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440]  Oh, you believe that.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440]  Well, you just keep thinking everything's fine.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440]  Oh, there's sealed indictments against Hillary.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.440]  Yes.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440]  Oh, ignore those indictments against Trump.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.440]  It's all part of the plan.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.440]  Trust the plan.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.440]  Trust it.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.440]  Yes.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.440]  Greatest grift in U.S. history.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:26.440]  New report estimates how bad the COVID fraud was to select organizations and groups.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.440]  We have that.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.440]  We have that.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:37.440]  Also, Putin says Russia will respond accordingly if Ukraine gets depleted uranium shells in the UK,
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.440]  claiming they have a nuclear component.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.440]  So we've got that.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.440]  We've got quite a bit here, but let me just do this right now.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.440]  Let's fire up the phone system.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.440]  It's a computerized phone system, so we actually have to turn it on.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:02.440]  It's not like an old-fashioned thing that was over copper.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:10.440]  It's a digital, as they say, and so we're going to open the phones up for your calls.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.440]  And we're going to take first-time callers.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.440]  That means first-time callers.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.440]  You've never called before.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440]  I want to talk to you.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.440]  I would love to talk to you.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:30.440]  Not the same way Kanye loves Hitler, but that love's a little too deep for me.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.440]  But I would love to talk to you, and I do love you.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.440]  Not a Hitler-level love, but, you know, it's...
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.440]  I'm living in the twilight zone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.440]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.440]  877-789-Alex.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.440]  877-789-2539.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:59.440]  And I am going to be a very good boy today and take your calls.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.440]  The first thing I want to do, though, is get into the pedo stack today,
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.440]  and how that ties into feminism and where that's all going.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.440]  And I never played this two days ago.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.440]  Will you guys get this lady pissed up?
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.440]  Okay, I want to show her, because she's hilarious.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.440]  It's a little, I mean, like, you talk about a dumbass.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.440]  This is it right here.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.440]  I don't mean that meanly.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.440]  I just, damn, I wish she wasn't so stupid and so un-self-aware.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.440]  She's like, I want a real man, but one that also does whatever I tell him.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  Well, get a robot, sweetheart.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.440]  Get a robot, cupcake.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.440]  You're biologically designed to want to be with a real man,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  but you've been taught by the deep state that real men are bad.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.440]  So you're what we call a idiot.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440]  So that's all coming up.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.440]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440]  All right, I didn't plug last hour.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.440]  People said, man, Jones, you're taking a lot of time off and stuff.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  You know, there's nothing like the prospect of nuclear war
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.440]  when you've been doing this 29 years to make you kind of feel guilty
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440]  that you haven't spent time with your family.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.440]  So I've had some sick family, and I've got children, and I've just been,
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.440]  I'm not resigning, meaning I'm quitting.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440]  I'm resigned.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440]  I'm working as hard as ever, really, but I'm resigned.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.440]  I'm not resigning.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440]  I'm resigned.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.440]  If all of you really want to die,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440]  I'm just kind of getting my mind wrapped around it,
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.440]  because there's a real danger of it,
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.440]  and I'm just getting my soul ready right now.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.440]  And I think after 29 years, if I want to quit for a year,
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.440]  I don't think I'm lazy.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.440]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440]  But I might.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  I might pull an Obi-Wan Kenobi and move to the desert.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.440]  In fact, I'm very close.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.440]  I might move to the desert and live in a trailer.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440]  In fact, I'm strongly considering it.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.440]  So I'm not complaining at anybody,
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440]  but anybody bitches about it, you might make me actually do it.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440]  I have to wrap my mind around it,
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.440]  my whole family dying and all of us dying.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:09.440]  I mean, there's a really good chance it's going to happen.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.440]  So I've been getting ready for that,
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440]  because I know the future, just like you do.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440]  And there's a very possible future
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.440]  that we're all dead in six months, a year.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.440]  And hell, you know,
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.440]  they're going to release a new bio-weapon anyways,
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440]  much worse than the last one.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440]  And so, you know, how do you respond to that?
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440]  How do you respond to that?
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.440]  How do you respond to that?
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.440]  How do you respond to that?
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440]  You know, how do you respond to that?
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.440]  Do I go out and hunt down the globalists to try to stop them?
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]  Well, you don't want that.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.440]  You want them to kill you.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.440]  I mean, I understand.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.440]  And so I kind of just want to get out of the way for everybody.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.440]  And then you can all bury your families and die
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  and just enjoy yourselves.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.440]  I get it.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.440]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.440]  I want you to enjoy yourselves.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.440]  And so I want Alex Soros to enjoy himself.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.440]  So, I mean, that's basically what it comes down to.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.440]  I mean, like, you understand, right?
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.440]  Like, it's all over.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.440]  I mean, you kind of figure that out now.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.440]  I think you probably figured that out.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440]  Yeah, they're going to release a new bio-weapon very soon.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.440]  And they're going to turn the power off.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.440]  And so I have a real guilt for not running and hiding.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:19.440]  Because I love my family.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.440]  I have a selfishness.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.440]  And, you know,
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:25.440]  I'm not going to run and hide.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.440]  I'm not going to run and hide.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.440]  I'm not going to run and hide.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440]  I'm not going to run and hide.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.440]  I'm staying at my post.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.440]  But I'm going to be very honest with you that
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440]  that I'm not very happy about it.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.440]  And I wish everybody would do a little bit more to stop this.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.440]  But don't worry, government and poison people.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  Your bosses will kill you soon.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.440]  Don't you worry your little sweeties, okay?
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.440]  All right.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.440]  You're in charge.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.440]  You're going to find out real fast.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.440]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.440]  Two amazing nootropics.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.440]  That means brain power.

[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.440]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.440]  A lot of people have asked me,
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.440]  why is InfoWarsTore at InfoWarsLife
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.440]  not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.440]  And the answer is simple.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.440]  We only bring you the highest quality
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.440]  at the lowest prices.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.440]  We had a top maker, top certified
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.440]  of probiotics for more than seven years.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440]  They got bought by a libtard company
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440]  and said, we're not doing business
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.440]  with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.440]  Finally, we got a probiotic
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.440]  just as good or better
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.440]  with a top lab that loves our show.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.440]  We're able to private label it
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.440]  under InfoWarsMD as our probiotic formula.

[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440]  and a bunch of other key things
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.440]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]  and are good for your heart, your brain,
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440]  your liver, you name it.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.440]  It is the super fuel.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.440]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.440]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.440]  They go good with this.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.440]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.440]  This is the boss.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.440]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.440]  There's a fancy best water filter system out there
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.440]  that sells for twice the price
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.440]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.440]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.440]  thousands of chemicals.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:35.440]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.440]  There's four or five other filters out there
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.440]  that are just as good.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.440]  We sell the very best, highest grade
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.440]  water filtration system for half the price
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.440]  of the leading competitor.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.440]  And the media says we're bad
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:49.440]  and a cult for telling you
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440]  you should filter your water.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440]  I'm not going to absorb this crap,
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.440]  but I'm done talking about that.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.440]  The point is you get the filters
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.440]  at Infowarstore.com.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.440]  They're discounted right now,
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440]  finally back in stock.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.440]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.440]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.440]  From the Infowars.com studios,
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.440]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.440]  Til they got a hold of me
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:20.440]  I opened doors for little old ladies
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.440]  And the world was so great
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440]  I helped the blind to see
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.440]  I got no friends cause they read the papers
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.440]  They can't be seen with me
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.440]  And I'm feeling real shot down
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.440]  And I'm feeling mean
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.440]  No more Mr. Night Sky
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440]  No more Mr. Clean
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.440]  No more
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.440]  No more
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.440]  30 minute drive to the courthouse in Miami
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440]  We got reporters on the ground
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.440]  We'll be covering it all live as it goes
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.440]  Look, I wear my heart on the sleeve
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.440]  I make my decisions very cold-bloodedly
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.440]  Analyze things, but
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.440]  Our world's going to hell by design
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.440]  The globalists think they're exempt from all the crises they're creating
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:27.440]  They're delusional with their yes-men and their ivory towers
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.440]  And
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440]  I am fundamentally beyond angry
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.440]  I'm just disgusted with the power structure
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440]  Because it's going to destroy itself right along with us
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.440]  And again, they're scum
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]  I don't want to fight with them
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.440]  They're disgusting
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  I don't want to look at them
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440]  Much less fight them
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.440]  I want to just be in another universe for these people
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.440]  But they want to be in a different universe than us
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440]  They want us dead
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.440]  So we're going to watch the motorcade
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  As the president goes and turns himself in
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.440]  To the most kangaroo charges ever seen
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.440]  And you know they're going to file more of them
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440]  They can't help it
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.440]  There's an intelligence agency coup
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]  With foreign corporations and the Chinese
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.440]  And
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.440]  They're not going to give up
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.440]  Because they're all going to go to prison if they know
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.440]  And so they're starting nuclear war
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.440]  They're destroying the currency
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.440]  They've got armies of pedophiles running around trying to get our kids
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.440]  I mean, you can't make this up
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.440]  By the way, my infrastructure is in Austin
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.440]  People ask why I live here
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.440]  My mother's from Austin
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440]  My family lived here
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.440]  When it was called Waterloo
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.440]  I'm not bragging, I don't live off the exploits of my ancestors
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440]  But I mean, both sides of my family
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.440]  I mean
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  Colonel Travis
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440]  You know, the president of Texas
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.440]  The founders of the state
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440]  Washington on the Brazos
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  My family
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.440]  With President Jackson
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  Launched the whole operation
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440]  It was all premeditated
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  Infiltrated and taken over from Mexico
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:05.440]  I mean, I'm as Texan as it gets
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.440]  And this is Los Angeles where I live
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.440]  People say, well why do you live there?
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.440]  Well, it's where I'm from
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440]  It's where my roots are
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.440]  But because of the jurisdiction, the courts, the rest of it
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  I can't have this infrastructure here in a few years
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  They'll keep filing fake lawsuits
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.440]  I've got to leave
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.440]  And it's the same thing with Trump
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  They've just weaponized everything
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.440]  And they're going after anybody
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.440]  That is in between them
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.440]  And the raping of the public
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.440]  The absolute raping of the public
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.440]  And people ask, well how do you take it?
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.440]  I mean, these are criminals
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.440]  They're the bad guys
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.440]  I personally don't have any guilt
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  I don't feel bad about what I've done
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.440]  I've actually slept very well at night
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:48.440]  I'm proud of what I've done
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  Overall, not in a prideful way
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  But I mean, I've seen what I've done
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  And overall, it was the best job I could do
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440]  And I think I can stand before God
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.440]  I don't want to call it pride
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.440]  But it's a feeling of satisfaction
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.440]  Of, you know, I did a pretty good job
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.440]  Swinging for the fences
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.440]  And knocked some home runs
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.440]  And got some grand slams
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.440]  And also, you know, got some fouls
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.440]  And failed sometimes
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.440]  But that's okay
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.440]  Because I did my best, alright
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  And I've learned a hell of a lot
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  But I mean, folks
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.440]  I'm a terrible researcher
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.440]  I mean, I really study history
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.440]  And I'm having to
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.440]  Really as a father
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  Get ready for total collapse
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  And just road warrior conditions
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440]  And nuclear war
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.440]  And so
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440]  I'm extremely angry at myself
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.440]  Every day
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  And I can't help it
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.440]  I've prayed about it, I can't stop it
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.440]  My cells
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.440]  My guts
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.440]  Are like
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.440]  You need to be in the most rural area now
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.440]  You need to get out
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.440]  Last year
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440]  You need to go to the southern hemisphere
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.440]  You need to do whatever
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.440]  Get out, get out, get out
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440]  I mean, my cells are evacuate, evacuate, evacuate
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.440]  But you know what, the fighter in me says
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440]  No, I'm going to stay here
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.440]  And I'm going to, I'm never going to run
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:15.440]  I can't do it
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.440]  But I'm being honest with you
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.440]  That things are so bad
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440]  I want you to know that
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.440]  Because at the end of the day
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  I care about my family and my children
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440]  More than myself and more than you
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  But that's where the spirit comes in
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  To say no, if you don't save everybody
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.440]  You don't save them
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.440]  So I get why you don't want to go to the city council
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  Confront the laughter, the school board
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.440]  I get why you want to stay anonymous
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.440]  And protect yourself
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.440]  You're not going to protect yourself running
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440]  And I'm not preaching at you, brother
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.440]  I'm the same way, man
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.440]  I don't want to be a public figure
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  You think I like all this crap
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.440]  I get hired in a kite
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.440]  Driving a tractor
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440]  And cutting trees down
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.440]  And growing crops
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.440]  I mean, I just, I zone out
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.440]  The day goes by like it's a thousand years
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440]  Or five minutes
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.440]  And I'm just high as a kite
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:09.440]  Doing work, carpentry work
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.440]  Cleaning the house
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440]  I love doing manual work
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.440]  It's like a drug, it's like heroin
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440]  I don't want to be on air
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.440]  I don't want to be reading all this crap
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  About Barack Obama
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440]  And King Charles
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440]  And all these damn pedophiles
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440]  But I do it because we got to beat these people
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.440]  But all I'm telling you is
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.440]  I want it to burn into your brains
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.440]  You've seen me predict almost everything
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.440]  That's happened now
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.440]  And I'm here to tell you
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.440]  There's a very good chance
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  We're going to have total collapse
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.440]  And it runs from bad to worse
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.440]  Nuclear war after that
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440]  So it's really hard for me
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440]  To kiss my family goodbye
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  It's a real
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440]  I'm a winner
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.440]  I know you're winners too
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.440]  I really want to turn things around
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.440]  I really care about civilization
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.440]  I really care about you and your family
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.440]  Because we're in this together
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.440]  And I am fundamentally
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440]  Just totally perturbed
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.440]  I don't even know the word to describe it
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.440]  Why are people so evil?
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.440]  Why are they so stupid?
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.440]  And why is this all going to happen?
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440]  And it's because
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:19.440]  We decided
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.440]  We decided to kill 65 million babies
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440]  In this country
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  And so
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  Men can have a baby next
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.440]  I mean if you say murdering a child isn't murder
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.440]  Well then why not have government sponsored
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  Enforced euthanasia?
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440]  I mean
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  Why not have convicted pedophiles
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  Come to the school
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  And have your child sit on their lap?
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  I mean look look look
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  You don't just kill babies
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  And then it just stops there
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  There is no bottom
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.440]  And so I just want to tell you
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.440]  From the bottom of my mind
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440]  The bottom of my soul
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440]  Bottom of my heart
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.440]  That
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440]  You better get right with God
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.440]  And you better kiss your family goodbye
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440]  Because we are very close to something
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.440]  That will make World War II
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.440]  Look like a
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.440]  Vacation
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.440]  Vacation
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.440]  And
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:29.440]  I'm just nauseated by it
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:31.440]  I mean I really want to stop it
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:33.440]  But God laid it on my heart about a year ago
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  Because I really thought I could stop this stuff
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.440]  Before it made me age
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.440]  When I get so stressed out
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.440]  And I was grinding my teeth
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.440]  And I was working 18 hours a day
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.440]  And God just said look son
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.440]  Sonny boy
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  You're not going to change any of this
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.440]  This is all about seeing what you'll do
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  In the face of adversity
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.440]  Don't you think ever
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  That you could change this stuff
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.440]  I'll change it
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.440]  And I took a big weight off my shoulders
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:03.440]  That's why
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.440]  You ever seen Alan Sheldon take off two weeks
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.440]  Never do it now
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.440]  Hell I may walk out of here today
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.440]  And never come back
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.440]  Let me tell you
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:15.440]  All you left is
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.440]  Just understand ladies and gentlemen
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.440]  That we're not
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.440]  Two minutes to midnight
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.440]  We're two seconds from midnight
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.440]  And once that genie's out of the bottle
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.440]  Sweetheart
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:30.440]  There's no putting it back
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.440]  Alright I'm going to go to your phone calls
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.440]  Brad, Louie, Brian, Steve, Tony, Archer
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.440]  Jack, Solomon, Luke
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  Travis and John
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440]  And I'll get to every one of you
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.440]  Before the next hour ends
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  But since I mentioned it
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.440]  Let's look at the Russophile
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.440]  But first let's look at the Russophile
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.440]  Because I mentioned this earlier
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.440]  And I didn't get to the rest of the news
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.440]  So Vladimir Putin
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:55.440]  Whether you love him, hate him
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.440]  Or neutral like I am
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.440]  Has said
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.440]  If the United States and NATO
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.440]  Give depleted uranium munitions
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.440]  Sabo rounds
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.440]  50 cal rounds
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.440]  Abrams tank rounds
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.440]  Artillery rounds
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:13.440]  That the radiation lasts
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.440]  A couple billion years
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.440]  It's extremely toxic
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  It gets into the ground water
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.440]  And they consider that nuclear war
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.440]  If DU
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440]  And I had the former head of the USDU program on
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  Dr. Doug Rockey
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  To expose how deadly it was
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.440]  If they use it
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440]  The Russians are saying
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  They'll use nuclear weapons
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.440]  They will consider DU a nuclear war
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:43.440]  That's Vladimir Putin right here
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440]  I'll show you the article in the statement
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.440]  Putin says Russia will respond accordingly
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.440]  If Ukraine gets depleted uranium shells
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.440]  From the UK
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440]  Claiming they have a nuclear component
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.440]  And saying that puts it into
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.440]  A nuclear theater
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  And then
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.440]  How does the
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440]  Loving liberal pedo government respond
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.440]  Like a freight train
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.440]  By the administration
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.440]  To send depleted uranium rounds to Ukraine
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.440]  Daily caller
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.440]  Here's another one
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.440]  Along the same lines
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.440]  By the administration
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.440]  Set to supply depleted uranium rounds to Ukraine
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.440]  That just broke last
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.440]  Two days
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.440]  There's CBS News
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:43.440]  So
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:47.440]  That's where we are
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  And this is how wars escalate
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:53.440]  But hey, it's okay
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:55.440]  Because we chop little boys' penises off
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:57.440]  We're the good guys, right?
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.440]  Oh, you got nuclear weapons?
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.440]  We're going to use DU all over your country
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.440]  And we're the moral people
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.440]  We put kids on Prozac and Ritalin
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:07.440]  And we cut little girls' breasts off
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:09.440]  What do you say to that?
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:10.440]  You're psychotic
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.440]  They go, yeah, we cut their penises off, too
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.440]  They go, well, hold my beer
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.440]  We also cut their thighs up
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440]  And their forearm muscle off
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440]  And make big, giant, rotting things
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.440]  That fall off for girls
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  And the Russians are like, well, that makes sense, actually
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.440]  Okay, well, you create rotting penises
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.440]  Well, you're very normal
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  We think you may be the good guys
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.440]  See, I mean, folks, we're already so far gone
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.440]  That nuclear war
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.440]  Is just the cleansing, you see
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.440]  I'd rather just stop the infection
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.440]  And not cleanse us all
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.440]  But here's the fun part
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.440]  Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Clinton
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.440]  And Bill Gates
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.440]  And the rest of them
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.440]  Think that they're going to be safe in a bunker
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.440]  You know, half the people in the bunker with them
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.440]  Are going to immediately
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.440]  Take them out as soon as this all goes down
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.440]  I mean, that's the default
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:09.440]  And they know that
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.440]  So they kind of got robots
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:13.440]  And key-swipe pads and stuff
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  Oh, you're going to be in your bunker
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.440]  Behind a key-swipe pad
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.440]  And a big armored door
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:21.440]  Oh, the guys that are in there with you
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.440]  They're not going to pump
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.440]  They're not going to pump
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.440]  They're not going to pump
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.440]  The guys that are in there with you
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:30.440]  They're not going to pump
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.440]  Carbon monoxide in there on you
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440]  I mean, you're all dead
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.440]  And just like the Bible teaches
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.440]  That the rich men of the earth in the end times
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  Will be under the mountains
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:49.440]  Wishing they could die
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.440]  So really what's just going to happen
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440]  Is they're just going to set a bunch of C4 up
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:55.440]  And blow the mouth
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440]  Of the entrance
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.440]  Where you're inside the cave
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:00.440]  They're just going to bury you in there
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  And that'll be where you stay
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.440]  Just back in your little nest
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.440]  Back in there
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  Just a nice place for you
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.440]  What type of morons are you?
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.440]  I mean, just take Zuckerberg in Hawaii
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.440]  I couldn't swing a stick in the dark
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.440]  And not hit a contractor
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.440]  That's been working on his big underground base
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  And his submarine base
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  And all the rest of it
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.440]  And they all hate his guts
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.440]  They all ignore the NDAs
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.440]  They all talk about it all day long
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  And they give me photos and videos
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  I haven't even gotten to on air yet
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.440]  Of just these giant sports stadium sized bubbles
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.440]  They've got built
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.440]  And just every five minutes
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  Dump trucks pulling out
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  With Zuckerberg building underground bases
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.440]  All over Kauai
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.440]  And reportedly hooking it up
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  And these other billionaires have signed on
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.440]  With him and put in money
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.440]  So there's like 22 of them
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  And they've all got little underground bases
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.440]  They're building with this underground railway
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  And you don't think like the thousand plus Hawaiians
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.440]  Who hate your guts
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  That are down there building it
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  Don't know all about it
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  And when everything goes haywire
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.440]  They're going to live in your base
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.440]  Not you
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  You see
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.440]  The globalists have taken
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:22.440]  Our acquiescence
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  When we're all just sitting around
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  Going man I really don't want to
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:29.440]  Kill all these people
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:31.440]  These globalists
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:33.440]  Man they really are putting me
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.440]  In a corner here
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.440]  It'd be so easy to do
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.440]  It's like killing a raccoon
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.440]  You find in your attic
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:43.440]  If you just throw it out
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.440]  It's going to come back
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.440]  It's kind of sad when you kill it
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440]  I don't want to scare the neighbors
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440]  I'm not going to use a .22
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.440]  To kill a raccoon
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:54.440]  Alright
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.440]  Let me get a trash bag
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:01.440]  And
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:03.440]  You got to haul the bodies around
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.440]  But see
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  I know you're all impressive libtards
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.440]  Oh you're so powerful
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]  You kill us with your shots
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:13.440]  You're so scary
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.440]  Oh we're so scared of you
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.440]  And we just really don't want
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440]  To have to
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]  Deal with you
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  But you can't stop
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.440]  And I know deep down
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.440]  You really want us to punish you
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:31.440]  Don't you
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.440]  That's really what this is all about
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.440]  You want daddy to come punish you
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:37.440]  Right
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.440]  I'd rather not
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.440]  I'd rather you just stop
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.440]  You just kind of figure out
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.440]  Your own psychology
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.440]  And just stop it
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.440]  Just stop it
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.440]  You're BS
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  And you need to stop
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  Alright I apologize
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:56.440]  I said I'd go to your calls
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  And I'm going to go to your phone calls
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  It's just
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.440]  I'm at the end of my rope
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.440]  With you globalists
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:06.440]  I mean
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:08.440]  It's one thing to go kill a bunch of Russians
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  And launch this war
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  Because the Russians have got beef with the Ukrainians
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  You can see it both ways
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  But do we really need to have Lindsey Graham
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  Giggling and laughing about dead Russians
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:20.440]  And how bad luck it is
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  To launch a dangerous war with nuclear power
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.440]  And then make snickering jokes about it
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  That's bad luck
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:28.440]  You're not supposed to do that
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.440]  It's called bad etiquette
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.440]  Nobody does it
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.440]  Except the biggest losers in the world
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.440]  Like metaphysically
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:38.440]  When you're in a big war
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  And hundreds of thousands are dying
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  And you make little jokes about how tough you are
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.440]  When you can't wipe your ass yourself
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.440]  It's not good luck
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.440]  But again it's the disconnect
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  I talked to folks
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.440]  Actually in these meetings
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  It was a true story
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.440]  Which is a rare thing for the New York Times
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  And the prince of darkness
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440]  Whatever that neocon's name was
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:04.440]  Richard Perle
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.440]  He
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.440]  Yeah Trump's going into the courthouse here
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  About to drive down into it
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.440]  In Miami
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.440]  Richard Perle would go to like
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.440]  Big cocktail dinners
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.440]  And he'd walk over to hot reporters
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440]  And he'd say
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.440]  You know I'm the architect of the war
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.440]  I've killed a lot of people
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.440]  And he'd think some 35 year old
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  Good looking reporter
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440]  Wants a big fat white skin
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.440]  Dead eyed guy with a toupee on his head
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.440]  Who says to her
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.440]  I kill a lot of people
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.440]  Hey listen monkey boy
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.440]  Women don't think
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.440]  People that kill people are cool
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.440]  Much less people that brag about it
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440]  I mean they might think deep down
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  If they need you to kill somebody
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440]  They know that Grimace
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.440]  The hamburger salesman
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.440]  Is not the guy that's actually killing people
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.440]  Women instinctively know
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440]  Who can kill people and who can't
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.440]  They don't need you to tell them
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.440]  How you have other people
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440]  Killing a bunch of women and children
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.440]  I mean that's who you are
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.440]  Madeleine Albright got really excited
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.440]  Was it a good price to pay
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  Killing 500,000 Iraqi children
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:14.440]  When you tripled the sanctions
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.440]  And she got really excited
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:18.440]  And wiggled around her little seat
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.440]  Couldn't pick up a 5 pound barbell
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:22.440]  And she goes
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:24.440]  Well actually it's a good price
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.440]  And we're glad we did it
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.440]  Just like George Soros
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.440]  Yeah I helped Hitler
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.440]  It was the best part of my life
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.440]  It's like whoa
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:36.440]  Leslie Stahl was like
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.440]  It's terrible you killed
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.440]  Half a million kids
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:42.440]  She was so toe deaf
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.440]  Well we'd do it again sweetheart
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.440]  We're powerful
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.440]  We starved little kids to death
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.440]  Oh wow you're really amazing
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.440]  That's incredible
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.440]  That's really powerful
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:56.440]  You're so powerful
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.440]  And that's who you globalists are
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.440]  You starve a bunch of children to death
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440]  Like with your three years of lockdowns
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.440]  And you flood us with all the refugees
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.440]  And tell us to pay for it all
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.440]  And have our standard of living driven down
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.440]  And then you have the nerve to tell us we're bad
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440]  When we're the ones that did it
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.440]  You sick freaks
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440]  And the only satisfaction I got
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.440]  Is knowing you're going to be cut off from God
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.440]  You will
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.440]  You will be locked up in the phantom zone
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.440]  With people just like you
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:33.440]  Because we're interstellar intergalactic
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.440]  Interdimensional entities
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.440]  We don't ever go away
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:39.440]  And at the end of the day
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:41.440]  I don't take any pleasure
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:43.440]  Knowing
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440]  Because you don't matter
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.440]  But I do want you to know
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.440]  George Soros getting ready to die
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.440]  Got dementia
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.440]  Still got more brains than his
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.440]  His gibbering demon son
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:01.440]  I want you to know
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440]  That God is going to cut you down
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.440]  But God's going to do something far worse than that
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:09.440]  God's going to give you what you want
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.440]  And cut you off from God's source
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.440]  So you can spend eternity with yourself
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:15.440]  Alright we're going to go to break
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.440]  I'll get to all these feminist clips
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:19.440]  And pedo clips
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.440]  But I got to go to calls first
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.440]  So I'm going to take your calls
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.440]  If I don't do this we won't be here
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.440]  We got great products you need
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.440]  And I don't have all this extra money
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.440]  The media says when they lie
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.440]  And so I'm in your hands
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.440]  Plus these are products that are really great
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:37.440]  And will enrich your life
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440]  And they're like hey we're going to sell out
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.440]  In a couple weeks of X3
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  But when you don't discount it
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.440]  You don't have the money right now
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:46.440]  So I said okay I said I was going to end the sale
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.440]  But no X3
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.440]  We'll just sell it out at 25% off
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.440]  And we got BrainForce Plus
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.440]  And BrainForce Ultra back in stock
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  Great nootropics
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  They're 50% off together
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:00.440]  Record level sale
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.440]  40% off individually
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  The ultimate krill oil is great
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  The fish oil it's all amazing
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  We have the highest quality CBD
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.440]  Full spectrum for neurological systems
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  This is the highest quality
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.440]  Third party groups are testing it
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  CBD oil it's all at infowarsstore.com
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  Or 888-253-3139
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  And look I'm not feeling sorry for myself
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  If God wants us to just tread water
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.440]  Until whatever happens
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  I'm sure it's in God's plan
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  So I'm not worried about it
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.440]  But I'd really like
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.440]  I got five or six reporters I want to hire
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  I got a bunch of stuff I want to do
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.440]  I got a bunch of things I want to cover
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.440]  But hey maybe God doesn't want us
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.440]  It's all in God's plan
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  The vast majority of you
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  And I'm not complaining
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440]  Free will
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.440]  The vast majority of you
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.440]  Never go to infowarsstore.com
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.440]  And never get a product
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  Never get a book, never get a film
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  Never get a water filter
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:58.440]  Never get any of the great products
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  They're incredible
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  If you looked into iodine deficiency
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  If you looked into how most of it's bound
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  If you looked into how great our product is
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  It's something you need
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  You're a fool not to get it
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  It's a dollar to you
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  At the end of the day
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:16.440]  I'm way past it all at this point
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:18.440]  But you really do need it
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.440]  And super male vitality is basically sold out
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.440]  So you'll sell it the next day
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:24.440]  Super female vitality is the same formula
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.440]  Just one has a blue label
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.440]  You know for men that don't exist
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  And the other's pink label for women that don't exist
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  Because everybody knows there's only one gender
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  Pedophile
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:36.440]  But in the real world there's male and female
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.440]  That's 50% off at infowarsstore.com
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  Because it really is not the LGBTP Satan
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.440]  Now they endorse Satan publicly all over the place
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  It really is just the P movement
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.440]  The pedophile movement
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.440]  The destruction of the innocence movement
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  And I got to tell God this
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.440]  I kind of get it
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:58.440]  If we can't save our children
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.440]  And if we can't turn this around
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.440]  I do ask God to just blow the planet up
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.440]  I'm not asking God to bring judgment now
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.440]  Or destroy us right now
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.440]  But if God blew the planet up tomorrow
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  Like Krypton fictionally
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.440]  I would say thank you Lord
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:19.440]  I mean I just
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  I don't
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.440]  I'm surprised God hasn't blown the planet up yet
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  I mean we're really bad creatures
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.440]  It's that simple
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.440]  And that's just really where I'm at
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:32.440]  I'm not going to turn and run and go hide
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  I'm going to turn and run and go hide
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.440]  I'm going to keep fighting
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.440]  But it's really hard to see
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.440]  Why we're not stopping the new war
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.440]  And God's not going to put up with this much longer
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:45.440]  We'll come right back
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:46.440]  Stay with us
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.440]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.440]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:13.440]  Again with no hangover or let down
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.440]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.440]  That's Brain Force Ultra
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.440]  That hits really, really quick
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.440]  And I love it, it wears off in two to three hours
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.440]  So if I've got to work at night
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.440]  But don't want to stay up all night
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.440]  Got to stay up until midnight working
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.440]  Doing a radio interview or something
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.440]  And boom
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.440]  Writing an article or writing a book
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:33.440]  And then I get two, three hours of energy
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:34.440]  And then go right to bed after it
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:36.440]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:37.440]  Both, 50% off by themselves
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.440]  Or 40% off individually
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.440]  A lot of people love these products
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.440]  They've got five star reviews
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:43.440]  But if you haven't tried them
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:44.440]  You really should
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:45.440]  50% off, InfoWarscore.com
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.440]  You wanted to plug Brain Force
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.440]  Do you like Brain Force?
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.440]  Yeah, so
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.440]  My name is Ken Heckin-Ladley
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.440]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.440]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mikevitz
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.440]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:58:59.440]  And now two books with Alex Jones
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:01.440]  That's because I use Brain Force Ultra
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.440]  That's because I use Brain Force every day
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.440]  What I always need is
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.440]  I always need some sort of boost in the morning
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.440]  And so, you know
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:10.440]  I try to exercise, eat well
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.440]  Take good vitamins
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:13.440]  But the one thing that I have really found
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440]  That makes a difference
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.440]  Is Brain Force
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:19.440]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.440]  Right before I go to my computer
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:23.440]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.440]  Writing a whole lot of stuff
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.440]  So it really is true
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.440]  That Brain Force is something I use every day
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.440]  And it helps me with my writing
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:32.440]  Alright, we love you
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:33.440]  We'll be right back
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:34.440]  Get your Brain Force Plus
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.440]  Brain Force Ultra
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.440]  And Turbo Force
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:37.440]  At Infowarsstore.com
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.440]  We'll be right back with hour number two
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.440]  If you are receiving this transmission
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.440]  You are the resistance
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.440]  Ultimate Brain Force
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.440]  Alright folks
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.440]  You've been very patient holding on
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.440]  While I went into rants
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.440]  The last 30 minutes
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:09.440]  Now we're gonna take your phone calls
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:11.440]  One after the other
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:13.440]  Where you put it up on screen
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.440]  Trump has driven into the federal courthouse
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.440]  And
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:19.440]  He's under a judge that he appointed
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:21.440]  They're like oh this is criminal
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:22.440]  This is illegal
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:23.440]  Oh but the Clinton and Obama
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:25.440]  And Bush judges
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.440]  They're all fined
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:28.440]  So
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:29.440]  It's just ridiculous
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:30.440]  Absolutely ridiculous
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  Let's go to your phone calls
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:33.440]  Brian in New York
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440]  China, Fentanyl
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:36.440]  Everything made in China
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.440]  You wanna talk about that?
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:38.440]  Go ahead
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.440]  Hey Alex
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:40.440]  Yeah two points
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:41.440]  I think
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.440]  We all missed the bigger picture here
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:45.440]  When we mentioned China
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  Because China's like this
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:47.440]  Foreign
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.440]  Outside
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.440]  Influence
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  Everything's made in China
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  I believe
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:53.440]  And the evidence is
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:55.440]  Based on how
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:56.440]  Soros's of the
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.440]  Country are
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.440]  Funding the DA's
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.440]  To allow
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.440]  Fentanyl to be sold in broad daylight on our streets
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.440]  I think they're the ones
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.440]  Having it made in China
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  And bringing it in
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.440]  Cause why else would they be spending their money
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.440]  Oh 100%
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  I mean they're about
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:11.440]  They wanna kill us
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  I mean they're literally here to kill us
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:13.440]  George Soros's mission
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:14.440]  Is to kill the American people
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:15.440]  Period
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  That's a no brainer
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:18.440]  Second point
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:19.440]  And this is a little far out
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.440]  But a few years ago
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.440]  You're the only one I ever heard mention this
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.440]  You mentioned that
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:23.440]  People who own cats
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.440]  Get a parasite
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:25.440]  And it makes them want to
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:26.440]  Almost serve their cat
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:28.440]  And get more cats
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.440]  Yeah something like
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:31.440]  Two million people
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  Have a brain worm
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:34.440]  That makes you wanna get more cats
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.440]  Smell the urine of cats
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.440]  And serve the cats
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  And there's also another brain worm
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.440]  That makes slugs
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.440]  Climb to the top of a tree
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:44.440]  So birds will eat it
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.440]  And then defecate it out
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:47.440]  And make more
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.440]  More of the slugs
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:49.440]  More of the amoebas
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.440]  That control the slug's brain
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:52.440]  I mean that's where you get
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.440]  Crazy cat lady from
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.440]  Yeah and if you look at
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.440]  The world leaders
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  Like the health ministers
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:01:59.440]  The prime minister of Ireland
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.440]  They all have these
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  Sunken eyes
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.440]  Alec
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.440]  And you know
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.440]  I think
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440]  I think
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440]  It sounds crazy
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440]  I think it could be
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.440]  A sodomy parasite
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.440]  That is bringing
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440]  World War 3 upon us
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440]  I think it's that
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.440]  Out there
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  But I think it's a real possibility
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.440]  Well no I mean
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.440]  We'll put it on screen
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:18.440]  It's actually a huge issue
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:20.440]  How common cat parasites
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:21.440]  In the human brain
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.440]  Influences human behavior
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.440]  Science daily
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.440]  I think something like
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.440]  A third of the people
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:27.440]  In India have it
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:29.440]  And it's a really
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440]  Bad situation
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440]  And all these world leaders
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440]  They have the same
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.440]  Lifestyles
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:35.440]  They're doing the same stuff
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:36.440]  And guess what
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:37.440]  They're all
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.440]  Speaking in unison
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.440]  And they're all
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  Bringing this to hell
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.440]  Yeah I mean
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.440]  Without getting too graphic
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.440]  You're talking about
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:46.440]  The mainstay of the
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.440]  Globalists is eating feces
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  Yeah they do that
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.440]  You know
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440]  And a lot of them
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440]  Don't eat the parasites
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  But they do that
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:53.440]  To get the parasites
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.440]  You know it's funny
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.440]  To talk about this
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.440]  Because I know about
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.440]  What you're talking about
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.440]  It's just so horrible
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.440]  That's why the Pope
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.440]  Reportedly eats
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:01.440]  Large platters of feces
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  Every week
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:03.440]  And that's why he says
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  Those that ingest
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:05.440]  Conspiracy theories
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.440]  Conspiracy theorists
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.440]  Are like eating poop
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  He's telling you
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.440]  What he does
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:10.440]  I appreciate your call
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.440]  By the way
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:13.440]  I wasn't joking
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.440]  When I just said that
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:16.440]  They want to get
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:17.440]  Closer to Satan
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:18.440]  So they don't just
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:19.440]  Sacrifice children
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.440]  I know this is horrible folks
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.440]  We have to talk about it
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  It's not
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:23.440]  Adrenochrome is a metaphor
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.440]  Yes in black magic
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.440]  Yes in the
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.440]  Graham grimoires
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.440]  Yes in the
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  Black Sabbath
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.440]  Children are tortured
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:33.440]  And then they
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:34.440]  Put a lot of
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:35.440]  Chemicals and endorphins
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  Into their blood
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.440]  And yes they
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.440]  Lance the children
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:39.440]  You know normally
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.440]  Two year old babies
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.440]  Is their favorite
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:42.440]  Over a 24 hour ritual
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:43.440]  And then
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:44.440]  You have
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.440]  You torture the child
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.440]  For 12 hours
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  Then you kill the child
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:48.440]  That has sex
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:49.440]  In the blood of the child
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.440]  And then you devour
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:51.440]  The flesh of the child
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:52.440]  That's
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.440]  I tell you what
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.440]  A satanic ritual is like
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.440]  That's what they
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.440]  Officially do
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.440]  Over 24 hours
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.440]  In fact I'm not
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.440]  Going to get to the end of it
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  But the point is
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:03.440]  Is that you can look
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:04.440]  This up for yourself
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.440]  If you'd like to
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.440]  That's how they
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.440]  Try to get closer
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:10.440]  To Satan
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.440]  And yeah the lower
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:12.440]  Level people
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:13.440]  That aren't given access
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.440]  Kind of the Renfields
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:15.440]  Is the archetype
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.440]  Again Graham
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:18.440]  Stoker
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:19.440]  Stoker wrote
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.440]  Dracula
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.440]  And in that
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  Renfield
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:23.440]  Only gets bugs
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:24.440]  And rats
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.440]  But he really wants
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.440]  Children
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:27.440]  But he delivers
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.440]  Children
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:29.440]  Babies to the
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:30.440]  Women of Dracula
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:31.440]  Dracula wants
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  The women
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:33.440]  That's the archetype
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.440]  Dracula wants
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:35.440]  To destroy the women
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:36.440]  Who then destroy
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.440]  The children
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:38.440]  It's all archetypal
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:39.440]  And that's why
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:40.440]  They caught these
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:41.440]  Witches on tape
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.440]  You know it's
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:43.440]  Happening all over
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.440]  The country
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:45.440]  Eating rotten meat
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:46.440]  And you wonder
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.440]  I can't believe
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  They're getting
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.440]  Power from this
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.440]  So
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:51.440]  I'm sorry to
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.440]  Have to tell you
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:53.440]  All this folks
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.440]  But that's who
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:55.440]  Runs the country
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:56.440]  And Joe Biden
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:57.440]  Rapes children
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:58.440]  We'll be right back
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.440]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:00.440]  Is like a
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:01.440]  Grocery store
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:02.440]  Or like a
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.440]  Vitamin shop
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:04.440]  We want to have
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:05.440]  All the best brands
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:06.440]  We want to have
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.440]  A bunch of
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:08.440]  Different choices

[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:10.440]  So I get
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.440]  Constant questions

[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.440]  Uh I was just wondering
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.440]  Do you think if
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:03.440]  If Donald Trump is
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.440]  To get elected
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.440]  Can he
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.440]  Can he bring us
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.440]  Back from the edge
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.440]  Of where we're headed
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.440]  As a
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.440]  As a world
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.440]  You know
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:12.440]  Things are not
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:13.440]  I mean I don't know that
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.440]  You know repenting
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:15.440]  And seeking
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:16.440]  God's face
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440]  And bringing the
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440]  Holy spirit
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.440]  Into our lives
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.440]  Will do that
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:21.440]  But certainly
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.440]  The deep state
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:23.440]  Does not want
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.440]  Trump in
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:25.440]  Certainly they're
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.440]  Fighting with everything
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:27.440]  They've got to keep
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:28.440]  Him out
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.440]  So I made the
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.440]  Decision last Friday
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:31.440]  I've been really
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.440]  Mad at Trump
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:33.440]  He's not perfect
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:34.440]  Imperfect vessel
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.440]  We all are
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.440]  To support Trump
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.440]  Because he was elected
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:38.440]  They did steal it
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.440]  And they're doing it again
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440]  So I'm honoring
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440]  The will of the
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440]  American people
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440]  And so I will
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440]  Criticize Trump
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.440]  By the way
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:46.440]  All day long
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:47.440]  I call him a
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.440]  Dumbass
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.440]  With Roger Stone
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.440]  When he was on
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.440]  Sunday
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.440]  Roger loves him
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:53.440]  They talk constantly
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:54.440]  I know Trump
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:55.440]  Hears that
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.440]  I'm not here
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.440]  To sycophantically
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:58.440]  Kiss Trump's
[02:07:58.440 --> 02:07:59.440]  Derriere
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:00.440]  But the
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.440]  Enemies after him
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.440]  And I'll be
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:03.440]  Punished for
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.440]  Supporting him
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.440]  So I'm
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.440]  Supporting him
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:07.440]  Because I'm
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:08.440]  Not a coward
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:09.440]  Does that
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.440]  Make sense
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.440]  I don't know
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:12.440]  Metaphysical reasons
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.440]  Whatever's going on
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.440]  They are
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.440]  Fundamentally
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.440]  Do not want
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:17.440]  Trump in
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:18.440]  And he's who
[02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:19.440]  The American people
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.440]  Voted for
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:21.440]  So I'm not
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:22.440]  Going to be a coward
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.440]  And say I don't
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:24.440]  Support him
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:25.440]  Because I will
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:26.440]  Be persecuted
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:27.440]  I mean I've
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:28.440]  Basically been told
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:29.440]  They're going to
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.440]  Indict me and
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:31.440]  Set me up
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:32.440]  And put me in
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:33.440]  Jail if I
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:34.440]  Support Trump
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.440]  So I mean
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.440]  I just
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:37.440]  It's not a
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.440]  Reverse psychology
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:39.440]  Either
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:40.440]  It's just that
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.440]  He's way
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.440]  Better than he is
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.440]  Bad
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:44.440]  And I'm
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.440]  Not a lesser
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.440]  Of two evils
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.440]  People
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:48.440]  But I will
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:49.440]  Not then openly
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440]  Support globalist
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.440]  Candidates over him
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.440]  Does that
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.440]  Make sense
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:54.440]  Yeah do you
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.440]  Think RFK is
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.440]  A globalist
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.440]  Candidate
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:58.440]  I like a lot
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:08:59.440]  Of the things
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:00.440]  He says too
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440]  No RFK is
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.440]  100% real
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:03.440]  But he's
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:04.440]  Also like
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:05.440]  Trump
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:06.440]  Wrong about
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.440]  A bunch of
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.440]  Stuff
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.440]  But he's
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440]  Often
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.440]  Which we
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.440]  Value
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440]  We stand
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:14.440]  For
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  Sometimes
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.440]  We're wrong
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:17.440]  Sometimes
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:18.440]  We're right
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.440]  But with
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:20.440]  Trump and
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  RFK
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.440]  These are
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:23.440]  Real people
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.440]  And they
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:25.440]  Call the shots
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.440]  In their
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.440]  Lives
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:28.440]  And I call
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:29.440]  The shots
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:30.440]  In my
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.440]  Life
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:32.440]  And all
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:33.440]  These
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  Government
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:35.440]  Funded lawsuits
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.440]  Are always
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.440]  Like who
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:38.440]  Gives you
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:10.440]  The
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:11.440]  Money
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:12.440]  To

[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:14.640]  We know that.
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:15.640]  At least you know that.
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:16.640]  100%.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:17.640]  Welcome to the lighthouse.
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:18.640]  Thank you.
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:19.640]  Can we take a picture?
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:20.640]  Can we take a little video?
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:21.640]  Hi, Mr. President.
[02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:22.640]  It is an honor.
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:23.640]  Trans rights are human rights.
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:24.640]  Are we top this at the lighthouse?
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:34.360]  Are we top this at the lighthouse?
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.400]  You
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:44.300]  The bravest the most inspiring people I've ever known
[02:20:46.330 --> 02:21:04.570]  okay so now at the White House it's people getting naked and then Biden's
[02:21:04.570 --> 02:21:09.650]  saying they're the greatest people ever the clip didn't play whatever reason our
[02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:16.170]  computers we're gonna play it again clip six Natalie Jean Besner on Twitter this
[02:21:16.170 --> 02:21:18.570]  is a very important man and have clip when people listen this is ladies
[02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:22.450]  absolutely on target let's see will work this time here it is I'm gonna say this
[02:21:22.450 --> 02:21:26.090]  again for some of you feminism paved the way for the trans agenda none of this
[02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:29.410]  would have been possible without feminism and I know that ticks off the
[02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:32.890]  old-school feminists who say we're fighting against this I know you are but
[02:21:32.890 --> 02:21:35.730]  that doesn't mean you didn't unknowingly or otherwise support the movement that
[02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:38.970]  led us to this which is where womanhood is all but meaningless and anyone who
[02:21:38.970 --> 02:21:42.690]  feels like a woman can be one feminists you have repeated
[02:21:42.690 --> 02:21:47.010]  is between men and women you have destroyed the differences between us you
[02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:50.530]  have eviscerated traditional gender roles on the basis that they were formed
[02:21:50.530 --> 02:21:55.610]  in socialization rather than in biology you have made women into second-rate men
[02:21:55.610 --> 02:21:59.930]  you have encouraged women to see our most powerful asset our ability to give
[02:21:59.930 --> 02:22:04.370]  life as an avenue through which we are oppressed rather than the avenue through
[02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:08.370]  which we find liberation and fulfillment and the worst way in which you have done
[02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:13.650]  this feminist is via abortion feminism lies feminism tells women that ripping
[02:22:13.650 --> 02:22:17.770]  apart limb from limb our own offspring inside ourselves is a right and that
[02:22:17.770 --> 02:22:21.550]  it's health care and now you're mad feminists that a man can slap on some
[02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:24.890]  makeup maybe shoot up some estrogen call himself a woman and demand the right to
[02:22:24.890 --> 02:22:29.490]  be treated as such and we all call that gender affirming care feminists you
[02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:33.890]  invented hiding behind euphemisms you invented demanding a right that isn't
[02:22:33.890 --> 02:22:36.570]  there you invented slapping the label health care on something that is
[02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:40.450]  anything but you dove us headlong into the sexual revolution and you thought
[02:22:40.450 --> 02:22:44.370]  you could draw the line of where it ends turns out you can't you force open the
[02:22:44.370 --> 02:22:47.770]  door for womanhood and women to be meaningless and for men to be better
[02:22:47.770 --> 02:22:53.410]  than you at both all right I got loaded phone lines I want to go to Steve and
[02:22:53.410 --> 02:22:58.050]  Tony and Archer and Jack and Solomon and Travis and John and Brad and Louie I'll
[02:22:58.050 --> 02:23:03.930]  get to everybody before this hour ends but I've got more clubs here I have in
[02:23:03.970 --> 02:23:09.530]  Germany another person in a clown outfit with a bunch of elementary students saying
[02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:15.650]  God is queer and preaching this to the children this is just a cult so you
[02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:19.130]  don't have children so you're all alone folks all corporately funded this is the
[02:23:19.130 --> 02:23:22.050]  establishment force fed everyone let's play the clip we'll go to your phone
[02:23:22.050 --> 02:23:31.330]  calls now's the time to say we are the last generation oh yeah no more humans
[02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:37.690]  now's the time to say black lives always black lives always matter you
[02:23:37.690 --> 02:23:47.690]  know the UN run slave camps now's the time to say God is queer now's the time
[02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:52.690]  to say we leave no we leave no one to die
[02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:59.650]  now's the time to say again we send a ship and much more welcome people at
[02:23:59.690 --> 02:24:11.490]  safe harbors safe places for all we all have privileges and can use them for moral
[02:24:11.490 --> 02:24:23.410]  justice we are here we are all so many of us and we are never quiet
[02:24:23.410 --> 02:24:32.810]  again this is the new religion this is the takedown of society this is the
[02:24:32.810 --> 02:24:38.330]  takeover of our captured children all right Steven in Alaska on ammonium
[02:24:38.330 --> 02:24:45.410]  nitrate that's missing go ahead there you are can you hear me I sure can go
[02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:51.170]  ahead okay buddy so the whole nitrogen or ammonium nitrate fertilizer theft I
[02:24:51.289 --> 02:24:55.690]  won't call it anything else it's a theft that right there so so that stuff is
[02:24:55.690 --> 02:25:01.330]  fertilizer people don't get it but part of the way that they can get rid of us
[02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:04.650]  is to get rid of our food if you can't fertilize your oh they're shutting the
[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:08.650]  farms down everywhere they're not letting Russia export fertilizer the third
[02:25:08.650 --> 02:25:13.370]  biggest exporter world food production is collapsing Roger that now I would
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:17.490]  recommend the people in the New York area who are enterprising enough to go
[02:25:17.490 --> 02:25:21.410]  out and take swab samples and get ahold of somebody like Mike Adams from you
[02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:25.770]  know from natural news or find out an accredited lab and that will tell them
[02:25:25.770 --> 02:25:29.450]  if that stuff was actually in there that way nobody's really guessing if
[02:25:29.450 --> 02:25:32.930]  that's where they dispose of all the smoke of the fires all over Canada yeah
[02:25:32.930 --> 02:25:37.010]  yes sir because they got to dispose of that ammonium nitrate somewhere they're
[02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:39.810]  not gonna be able to make a bomb everybody thinks then we're in there
[02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:43.970]  waiting for them to make an Oklahoma City style bomb with it and attack our
[02:25:43.970 --> 02:25:47.850]  electrical grid right so they have to dispose of it somewhere they can't just
[02:25:47.850 --> 02:25:52.810]  hold it so it's likely that it did get put that fire it's a very good
[02:25:52.810 --> 02:25:57.610]  possibility but people need to also look at like I'm saying the fact that that's
[02:25:57.610 --> 02:26:04.050]  not necessarily bomb material that's food making material you know if you
[02:26:04.050 --> 02:26:08.250]  don't know there's a tax on our infrastructure happening everywhere
[02:26:08.250 --> 02:26:12.690]  Steve thank you for the call Jack in FEMA region 5 you're on the air go ahead
[02:26:12.690 --> 02:26:17.610]  hey Alex can you hear me I hear you on speakerphone yeah I can hear him yep
[02:26:17.610 --> 02:26:23.250]  all right so do me a favor take it off speakerphone I'm not on speakerphone
[02:26:23.250 --> 02:26:28.610]  actually I'm on a headset can you hear me okay no I can't really hear you well
[02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:34.410]  but go ahead no okay so basically you know I feel the same way you do your
[02:26:34.410 --> 02:26:38.330]  opening monologue was perfect I feel like selling everything and getting a
[02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:45.730]  you know Winnebago and going to North Dakota or some spot but my problem is you
[02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:53.450]  know I got kids I can't afford to just leave the area of FEMA region 5 and
[02:26:53.450 --> 02:26:58.930]  quite frankly I don't think if the voting is is not fixed I don't see a way
[02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:04.050]  out of this so I'm thinking the Convention of States or something you
[02:27:04.050 --> 02:27:11.570]  know I mean I see everything as a psyop like flags race gender you know you know
[02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:15.770]  all of it is to let you know give up roll over and die so we shouldn't give up
[02:27:15.770 --> 02:27:19.850]  and roll over but we have to also understand you have the globalists that
[02:27:19.850 --> 02:27:23.050]  are programming this you have their followers you should give no respect to
[02:27:23.050 --> 02:27:27.370]  their followers listen to nothing they say they are idiot followers that they're
[02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:32.490]  getting ahead pushing this agenda and so we just have to stop complying with
[02:27:32.490 --> 02:27:35.610]  anything and everything these people say because this is not our government this
[02:27:35.610 --> 02:27:41.490]  is a group of idiots well and I do think I mean like I'm trying to stay sober you
[02:27:41.490 --> 02:27:47.170]  know drinking to escape and everything else but I it's gotten to to the point
[02:27:47.170 --> 02:27:53.170]  where you know it when do we see enough is enough and you know I hate to say it
[02:27:53.170 --> 02:27:59.010]  but you know the first insurrection was not even an insurrection but if this
[02:27:59.010 --> 02:28:03.210]  happens again I don't know what the hell I mean well see but see that's the
[02:28:03.210 --> 02:28:09.010]  problem it's a cultural brainwashing so you could wipe out the top globalists
[02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:12.170]  there's only like a thousand of them they have minions ten people deep that
[02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:16.970]  will replace them even worse you have to oppose their operations you have to
[02:28:16.970 --> 02:28:21.450]  culturally take control of the land you have to produce food and and and and and
[02:28:21.450 --> 02:28:27.289]  and systems so production is the means of power you have to culturally have the
[02:28:27.289 --> 02:28:32.130]  ideas and then put those culture ideas into function and build a civilization
[02:28:32.130 --> 02:28:35.930]  that's why their new digital takeover system is all about shutting down
[02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:42.850]  independent production shutting down the farms food production is king you want
[02:28:42.850 --> 02:28:47.210]  to rebel move the country grow crops buy from each other and never comply with
[02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:50.570]  the enemy then they will come with weapons in the future to shut it down
[02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:55.050]  and that's when the war starts but the people will be on our side by then we're
[02:28:55.170 --> 02:29:02.490]  very close a lot of people have asked me why is m4 store at m4 is life not at a

[02:32:06.690 --> 02:32:09.930]  got quadrillions of stolen money they only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[02:32:09.930 --> 02:32:12.530]  because they believe they control him but as soon as they figured out they
[02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:16.770]  couldn't he was taken off the air it's the same thing with info wars but info

[02:32:58.570 --> 02:33:06.890]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:23.860]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:26.860]  Alright, let's race back to your phone calls.
[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:29.860]  Trump is inside the courthouse. We'll be following that as it unfolds.
[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:31.860]  I'm sure we'll make a statement after.
[02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:35.860]  Solomon in Toronto, Canada. You're on the air. Thanks for calling. Thanks for holding.
[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:41.860]  Hello, Alex.
[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:43.860]  Hey, Solomon, welcome.
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:47.860]  Alex, how are you doing, sir? I've been trying for the last two years to talk to you.
[02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:53.860]  Well, it's great to speak to you. Alex, I'm going to make, Alex, please don't say anything because you're like me.
[02:33:53.860 --> 02:33:57.860]  You talk forever. So please, I have some questions for you.
[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:01.860]  And then I want to hear you so that we can get to other callers. I appreciate it.
[02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:04.860]  Alex, don't get depressed. Keep the fight, man.
[02:34:04.860 --> 02:34:07.860]  No, I'm not depressed. I just have to...
[02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:11.860]  No, no, I mean frustrated because you're like me because I try to tell people what's going on.
[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:16.860]  And I'm like, these people just cannot listen. And it's so frustrating.
[02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:21.860]  So when I hear your frustration and the fight that you have, I am the same way here in Toronto.
[02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:24.860]  No, brother, I appreciate you.
[02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:27.860]  We'll talk about the next steps. Go ahead.
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:32.860]  Yes, sir. So in regards to William Cooper, you know that gentleman.
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:38.860]  He's been on your show. You've talked to him. And you also talked to Dr. John Coleman.
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:43.860]  They both wrote books and all this stuff. And when I'm done with this question, don't answer it now.
[02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:46.860]  But when I get off the call, I hope you can answer.
[02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:52.860]  Can you tell me why you're voting when these two gentlemen have told you in the book of the 300,
[02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:58.860]  where they take it, elected officials are already elected and they're puppets.
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:02.860]  And there's nothing that we can do because they've already chosen who they've chosen.
[02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:05.860]  So I'd like to understand how you make that selection with Trump.
[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:08.860]  And you feel comfortable that they're going to be able to go on.
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:10.860]  Sure, that's a really good question.
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:13.860]  I'll put you on hold, Solomon. I'll answer your question.
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:15.860]  I'll come back to you and respond to it.
[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:23.860]  In the main, I think John Coleman was dead on and was in MI6.
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:29.860]  And his book written 20 years ago, I think 1993 or something.
[02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:33.860]  So yeah, that's like 30 years ago. Good Lord. It's all come true.
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:40.860]  And nothing against Cooper. Cooper was an incredible talk show host, super entertaining.
[02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:43.860]  I never doubted his UFO stuff. He just couldn't prove it.
[02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:50.860]  I've got a drinking problem sometimes. He had a bigger drinking problem than I do.
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:57.860]  I mean, I know the real story of what happened to him in Arizona with kids in the farm next to him having parties.
[02:35:57.860 --> 02:35:59.860]  And he'd go over there and point guns at them.
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:02.860]  And then the sheriffs came and he shot a sheriff's deputy in the face.
[02:36:02.860 --> 02:36:04.860]  And then they shot him.
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:08.860]  So that whole thing like William Cooper got killed by the government, that's not true, folks.
[02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:13.860]  William Cooper was a really talented, amazing person.
[02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:18.860]  And the deep state did not kill William Cooper.
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:22.860]  Because I've got to be honest about stuff.
[02:36:22.860 --> 02:36:27.860]  The deep state killed the Davidians. The deep state killed Randy Weber's wife and child.
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:31.860]  The deep state killed Kennedy. The deep state killed RFK.
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:33.860]  The deep state gave us poison shots.
[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:35.860]  The deep state did not kill William Cooper.
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:37.860]  And I've read the police report.
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:41.860]  And I knew how Cooper was and I knew his producer and people around him.
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:44.860]  He was a Vietnam vet officer.
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:47.860]  Super wild.
[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:49.860]  Serious PTSD.
[02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:55.860]  And these kids kept having parties on a small acre track next to his house.
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:57.860]  And he wasn't putting up with it.
[02:36:57.860 --> 02:37:00.860]  They were out there playing rap music and rock and roll.
[02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:03.860]  And he'd go shoot at them and stuff.
[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:05.860]  Point guns at them.
[02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:08.860]  And the cops came and he shot a deputy right in the head.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:09.860]  And they killed him.
[02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:11.860]  That's what happened.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:15.860]  So when people say, well, William Cooper says no one's good.
[02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:18.860]  Well, William Cooper was a talk show host.
[02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:21.860]  I don't think he was controlled by the enemy.
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:22.860]  I know Tucker Carlson.
[02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:23.860]  He's for real.
[02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:24.860]  I know Joe Rogan.
[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:27.860]  He's not right about everything, but he's a real person.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:29.860]  Nobody tells Joe Rogan what to say.
[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:31.860]  And nobody tells me what to say.
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:35.860]  And I make mistakes and I'm not perfect.
[02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:42.860]  But the idea that everybody's controlled, they're not.
[02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:45.860]  95% are controlled.
[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:50.860]  But when you get an RFK or an RFK Jr.
[02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:53.860]  Or you get a Trump, nobody controls Trump.
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:57.860]  Trump doesn't control Trump.
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:01.860]  So, I mean, I've been in a position, being on air for so long,
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:04.860]  where people claim I'm getting told what to say and I'm controlled by this.
[02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:06.860]  Well, I know that's not true.
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:09.860]  I'm not told what my agenda is.
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.860]  There's nobody giving me directives.
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:12.860]  I'm in charge.
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:14.860]  And the truth is you're in charge of your life, too.
[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:19.860]  The globalists can convince you to dial into their BS, but it's not real.
[02:38:19.860 --> 02:38:24.860]  So you say, well, they have indicted Trump.
[02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:28.860]  There's your Q indictments, the sealed indictments of the Democrats.
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:29.860]  No, it's Republicans.
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:32.860]  So this is a real process taking place.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:39.860]  So you ask me this question, Solomon, about who's real and who isn't.
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:44.860]  And Trump's for real the real president.
[02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:46.860]  Trump's for real pig-headed.
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:52.860]  Trump's for real good and bad, but he really wants to be the president.
[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:54.860]  And he is the president.
[02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:57.860]  And that's what scares him.
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:02.860]  So this paradoxical statement of, oh, William Cooper said nobody's real.
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:04.860]  Well, I don't think he really said that.
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:06.860]  He said most of it's controlled.
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:08.860]  And I agree with that.
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:09.860]  But not everything's controlled.
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:10.860]  And here's a key.
[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:13.860]  Listen to me carefully, Solomon.
[02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:20.860]  As the new world order loses control, they're going to have less and less control.
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:22.860]  Goes to say, doesn't it?
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:26.860]  And why is Elon Musk coming out against him?
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:29.860]  Why are all these Hollywood people turning against him?
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:32.860]  Because they realize that old structure is going down.
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:34.860]  It doesn't have the power it had before.
[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:42.860]  So you're going to have opportunists that are Johnny-come-latelys to the liberty movement because we're winning.
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:48.860]  And we can't be territorial or like Pharisees and say, well, we're holier than thou.
[02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:50.860]  We did this before you.
[02:39:50.860 --> 02:39:51.860]  We're OGs.
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:59.860]  We don't accept you because you weren't with us 30 years ago.
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:04.860]  We have to get ready for victory.
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:08.860]  We have to have a self-fulfilling prophecy of success.
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:13.860]  And we've got so much incredible opportunity really within our grasp.
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:17.860]  I mean, it's very close to our, it's within reach.
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:23.860]  And so we need to stop spending so much time on the enemy, and I'm the worst person about this.
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:26.860]  So when I say this, I'm talking to myself.
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:32.860]  On how bad the enemy is and spend more time on really how amazing humanity is
[02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:37.860]  and our contributions to reality and what we build and what we do.
[02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:40.860]  But I couldn't think of a more important question today, Solomon.
[02:40:40.860 --> 02:40:50.860]  What a wise question about how do we know what's good and what's bad.
[02:40:50.860 --> 02:40:55.860]  That's what God and God's Spirit's about in our heart.
[02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:57.860]  I know you're a good person, Solomon.
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:41:00.860]  I can tell by your voice the question you asked.
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:06.860]  And I've got to trust you, Solomon, and I've got to believe in you because I believe in myself.
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:13.860]  And Solomon, you know you're not perfect, but you love God, and you love truth,
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:18.860]  and you love freedom, and you love justice, and you just called in.
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:25.860]  And you know you're an honest person, honest in what you're saying, honest in what you believe in.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:33.860]  So my question to you, Solomon, is if you don't believe there's other good people in the world,
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:35.860]  how can you believe you're good, Solomon?
[02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:42.860]  Give me your take on that, Solomon.
[02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:57.860]  My take is that I was making more reference to John Coleman in regards to his book of The Council of 300.
[02:41:57.860 --> 02:42:02.860]  But I hear what you said, and I do agree there are good people, 100 percent.
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:04.860]  But I'm saying that this system is rigged.
[02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:13.860]  And to wake those people up that have been under the system, and now they can no longer understand what's happening,
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:15.860]  it really frustrates me.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:18.860]  And I'm not saying that there isn't any good in this world.
[02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:21.860]  Yeah, I mean, 100 percent I know there's good and evil.
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:28.860]  But at the same time, my question to you is that as we get all the good people, and this goes to you,
[02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:36.860]  I think that, yeah, I mean, like Royce White has stated many times that you are in the position,
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:40.860]  you're the start of all this to wake people up, Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:42:40.860 --> 02:42:42.860]  That's how I found out, through Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:42:42.860 --> 02:42:48.860]  In 92, I started following him, and then he opened up my eyes to the whole financial system and all the other things.
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:49.860]  And then I fell apart.
[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:52.860]  I rolled upon you, and I got involved in hearing what you were saying.
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:55.860]  And I've always been curious on how the whole system world works.
[02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:57.860]  So for me, I hear you.
[02:42:57.860 --> 02:43:01.860]  But now my next question that I want to say to you is there are good people, and I agree,
[02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:07.860]  but I think the reason why we are not succeeding is because our message is all over the map.
[02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:12.860]  When you go on to BandVideo.com, you've got 10 million issues that everybody's talking about.
[02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:14.860]  And I think—
[02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:15.860]  Listen, here's the deal, Solomon.
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:16.860]  I just spent 10 minutes with you.
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:17.860]  I've got to go.
[02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:19.860]  I've got to get to other people.
[02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:21.860]  What am I supposed to do with Band on Video?
[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:23.860]  I can't run my own life.
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:28.860]  We've given hundreds and hundreds of contributors that have been banned their own channels.
[02:43:28.860 --> 02:43:33.860]  And it's just a place for people that have been banned to have a site.
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:36.860]  And then I'm supposed to curate that and control it.
[02:43:36.860 --> 02:43:38.860]  I'll shut the damn thing down.
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:39.860]  Will that make you happy?
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:41.860]  I mean, seriously.
[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:45.860]  That's the nature of the universe.
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:49.860]  Tim Cook over at Apple said, we curated Alex Jones like a museum.
[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:50.860]  We're shutting him down.
[02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:52.860]  You don't need to see that in the museum.
[02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:54.860]  So, yeah, you go on Band.Video.
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:58.860]  It is a wild, wild west crazy town.
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:00.860]  What am I supposed to do?
[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:01.860]  Oh, you're banned?
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:02.860]  Here, you've got a channel.
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:03.860]  You're banned?
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:04.860]  You've got a channel.
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:08.860]  I don't agree with some of the stuff that's on there.
[02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:10.860]  Would you rather it not be there?
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:12.860]  Because I can give you what you want.
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:15.860]  In fact, I may do it.
[02:44:15.860 --> 02:44:16.860]  I think I've done my 29 years.
[02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:18.860]  I think I've done my mission.
[02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:20.860]  I think I've done my mission.
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:25.860]  Maybe if you don't have me to kick around anymore, that'll make you happier.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:37.860]  And we'll just give the left the nuclear war they want.
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:42.860]  I don't want to die in that big a nuclear explosion.
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:45.860]  But, man, it'll be so good to know the left won't host.
[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:48.860]  And they won't be able to hurt children anymore.
[02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:50.860]  They'll be all gone.
[02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:55.860]  Maybe nuclear war is the answer.
[02:44:55.860 --> 02:44:58.860]  Maybe John McCain and Lindsey Graham are right.
[02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:04.860]  Maybe we should just burn the whole surface of the planet up.
[02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:09.860]  You know, the globals will die in their bunkers too.
[02:45:09.860 --> 02:45:11.860]  So they'll just die later.
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:15.860]  But, man, maybe I'm a liberal now.
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:21.860]  In fact, I've thought about this for years, but starting tomorrow,
[02:45:21.860 --> 02:45:25.860]  I'm going to host the show from the perspective of Alexander Soros.
[02:45:25.860 --> 02:45:28.860]  I will become Alexander Soros tomorrow.
[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:33.860]  And I will promote the views of the open society.
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:39.860]  I will support forced euthanasia, castration of all boys.
[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:44.860]  Mass death and destruction of nuclear war.
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:47.860]  Because I want to be accepted by CNN.
[02:45:48.860 --> 02:45:51.860]  I want to be loved by The New York Times.
[02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:56.860]  Henceforth, I will support Satanism.
[02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:02.860]  I want to encourage the entire audience to commit suicide.
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:05.860]  And to be pedophiles.
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:08.860]  And to take fentanyl.
[02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:11.860]  And to pour gasoline all over your body and mind.
[02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:13.860]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:46:13.860 --> 02:46:16.860]  You know, it's really hard. I can't do it.
[02:46:16.860 --> 02:46:20.860]  I could do a show, kind of like Sears is doing,
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:22.860]  where he plays the part each day of a leftist.
[02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:24.860]  But, I mean, I just can't do it.
[02:46:24.860 --> 02:46:27.860]  I just can't be them. I can't say the stuff they say.
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:39.860]  Let's go to Tony in California. Tony, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:45.860]  Mr. Jones, if I could just have one and a half minutes, I can say my piece.
[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:47.860]  Okay, you got one and a half minutes. You're on the air.
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:49.860]  We're not screening your call right now. You're on the air live right now.
[02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:50.860]  Okay.
[02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:55.860]  If somebody's stabbing you in the back with a half-inch knife for nine months,
[02:46:55.860 --> 02:46:57.860]  and then they realize they can't kill you,
[02:46:57.860 --> 02:47:01.860]  and they start wanting money to buy a bigger knife,
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:03.860]  I'm not going to give it to them.
[02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:07.860]  Secondly, if the conservatives had just one voice,
[02:47:07.860 --> 02:47:10.860]  one person that's on our side,
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:14.860]  that would boycott Amazon for one month,
[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:18.860]  and then go to Walmart and boycott them for one month,
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:22.860]  and then go down to Home Depot one month,
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:27.860]  and just go through the list and every year rotate them,
[02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:32.860]  I think if this went on for five years, we wouldn't need 30 years.
[02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:37.860]  All it would take is five years to have this whole thing turned around,
[02:47:37.860 --> 02:47:40.860]  we wouldn't even be in this predicament.
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:45.860]  So I don't think anybody has done anything for us except talk.
[02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:48.860]  They sell books on Amazon, and that's it.
[02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:50.860]  That's my piece. What do you think?
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:57.860]  Well, I mean, it takes talk to figure out what you're going to do,
[02:47:57.860 --> 02:48:02.860]  but I agree with you that the boycott and the boycott is the real power.
[02:48:02.860 --> 02:48:06.860]  They've lost $24 billion at Anheuser-Pedo-Busch.
[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:10.860]  They've lost millions and millions at all these other companies,
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:16.860]  like Northpedo, Face, and all of them.
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:23.860]  And so the boycott, the boycott is really where the power is,
[02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:27.860]  and if people would just get wise and not support establishment systems,
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:31.860]  we would beat them very quickly. I totally agree with you.
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:36.860]  We have no place to buy now any longer because those are the only ones that have power.
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:41.860]  We need somebody to go with the very edge of what they've got
[02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:45.860]  and start a program where they organize.
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:48.860]  I can sit around and complain with my friends.
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:50.860]  I don't have millions of listeners.
[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:52.860]  You guys have millions of listeners.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:54.860]  Okay, well, I'm listening to you.
[02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:56.860]  Will you please tell me what I'm supposed to do?
[02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:58.860]  I'm kind of following what you're saying.
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:01.860]  I'm willing to step up and get up off my ass.
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:04.860]  Reprove me. I'm serious.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:07.860]  What do I need to do, Tony, right now?
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:12.860]  Okay, just say we're going to start a boycott this month against Amazon.
[02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:15.860]  I'd like my listeners for one month not to buy,
[02:49:15.860 --> 02:49:21.860]  and then next month go to Walmart and say we're going to boycott Walmart just for one month
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:26.860]  and get that ball rolling and every month spend five minutes every show
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:29.860]  and tell people we're boycotting this.
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:34.860]  And I guarantee you, people like me will come out of the woodworks to support.
[02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:37.860]  No, no, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:40.860]  What I'm saying, Tony, is boycotts are great.
[02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:43.860]  What about boycotts?
[02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:44.860]  What are you talking about?
[02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:46.860]  Don't buy from these for one month.
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:47.860]  That's all.
[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:51.860]  I can sacrifice not going to Walmart for one month.
[02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:54.860]  I can sacrifice not going on the computer for one month.
[02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:58.860]  I can show it.
[02:49:58.860 --> 02:50:04.860]  Sir, you know, I really hear what you're saying, and I appreciate your call.
[02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:06.860]  How about I just walk?
[02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:08.860]  How about this is the last show I ever do?
[02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:09.860]  That'll make you happy.
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:10.860]  I'll do a little better for you.
[02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:12.860]  In fact, you got a pledge for me?
[02:50:12.860 --> 02:50:14.860]  I'm gone today.
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:15.860]  Let's finish the show up.
[02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:16.860]  I'm out of here.
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:17.860]  That'll please all of you.
[02:50:17.860 --> 02:50:18.860]  You can have your nuclear war.
[02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:20.860]  There'll be no money for the plaintiffs.
[02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:23.860]  Actually, that's why I want to do this, and I'm just done.
[02:50:23.860 --> 02:50:25.860]  How about that?
[02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:31.860]  Seriously, everybody's all pissed at people in the arena all day long,
[02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.860]  and just you need to do this, you need to do that, you need to do this.
[02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:38.860]  See, when I'm polite and I listen to you, it's just you get more and more mad.
[02:50:38.860 --> 02:50:39.860]  Don't worry.
[02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:41.860]  They're going to release a new bioweapon.
[02:50:41.860 --> 02:50:43.860]  You're all going to be dead.
[02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:45.860]  Seriously, you're dead.
[02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:46.860]  It's liberal.
[02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:50.860]  And all the trendies watching laughing right now, oh, we're winning.
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:51.860]  We're penos.
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:52.860]  You're all dead, too.
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:53.860]  They're going to release a bioweapon.
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:55.860]  You're all dead.
[02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:56.860]  I'm serious.
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:57.860]  I may just never come back.
[02:50:57.860 --> 02:50:58.860]  I just don't.
[02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:00.860]  I've done this too long.
[02:51:00.860 --> 02:51:02.860]  I've been here too long.
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:06.860]  I've sat here, and I've just watched it all go down.
[02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:16.860]  I'm just hanging up right now.
[02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:19.860]  In fact, I can't take any more calls at this point.
[02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:20.860]  I'm going to rebroadcast.
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:22.860]  We'll see what happens.
[02:51:22.860 --> 02:51:24.860]  That means I'm going to rebroadcast, so find something to play.
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:26.860]  Thanks.
[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:40.860]  At the end of the day, any amount is too little, and every amount is never enough.
[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:48.860]  The Biden administration is officially asking the U.N. to come in and sanction the United States.
[02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:52.860]  And saying that America was founded on slavery and is inherently evil,
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:58.860]  that the U.N. should come in and help administer $5 million of U.S. taxpayer money to every black person.
[02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:06.860]  The stolen men and women and children were brought to our shores and changed, subjected to unimaginable cruelty.
[02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:10.860]  My nation's original sin was that period.
[02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:18.860]  On December 16, 2005, the U.N. General Assembly reaffirmed the importance of providing reparations
[02:52:18.860 --> 02:52:26.860]  for gross violations of international human rights law by adopting a five-point legal framework for reparations.
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:28.860]  And that has become our norm.
[02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:30.860]  Now, obviously, it's about a U.N. takeover.
[02:52:30.860 --> 02:52:36.860]  Are they going to go to China and get reparations for the three million Muslim Uyghur slaves in Western China?
[02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:41.860]  No. If you bring it up on a basketball court, they'll kick you off, like you see in the NBA.
[02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.860]  Nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs, okay?
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:46.860]  You bring it up because you really care, and I think it's nice that you care.
[02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:49.860]  Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
[02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:53.860]  No, no, no, no. It's all about America being bad and this carrot being dangled of,
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:56.860]  go along with the U.N., go along with the world government, and it's going to give you reparations.
[02:52:56.860 --> 02:53:00.860]  It's the U.N. building the refugee centers after they ran the lockdowns worldwide
[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:04.860]  that starved over 50 million people in the last three and a half years to death.
[02:53:06.860 --> 02:53:08.860]  They're murdering people en masse.
[02:53:08.860 --> 02:53:11.860]  Paramilitary U.N. troops are slaughtering people all over the world.
[02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:17.860]  The hardest moment is thinking about leaving your country as you hear the sounds of explosions and gunfire.
[02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:22.860]  How can you go to a country for 20 years to stabilize, and you don't stabilize,
[02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:26.860]  and you think that you have succeeded in doing something?
[02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:30.860]  I was on an airplane flying back, and I said, let me just watch this show.
[02:53:31.860 --> 02:53:33.860]  Tell them the men in black sent you.
[02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:35.860]  I want to see the propaganda in it.
[02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:40.860]  And it was all about evil British white mercenaries enslaving a mythical African country.
[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:46.860]  That has this magical element in it similar to Black Panther and Wakanda.
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:48.860]  And I'm sitting there watching the mercenaries.
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:50.860]  You know who the mercenaries work for.
[02:53:50.860 --> 02:53:53.860]  They work for really one of four or five groups,
[02:53:53.860 --> 02:53:59.860]  but it's the U.N.'s the main group that has mercenaries slaughtering and enslaving just like the movie, literally.
[02:53:59.860 --> 02:54:00.860]  And then there's China.
[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:05.860]  China's recently been accused of trying to take over Uganda's sole international airport
[02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:11.860]  if the East African country fails to pay a $200 million loan for the expansion of the site.
[02:54:11.860 --> 02:54:16.860]  Over the last several decades, China has been pumping resources into Africa.
[02:54:16.860 --> 02:54:21.860]  The country has invested hundreds of billions of dollars across the continent,
[02:54:21.860 --> 02:54:27.860]  ranging in everything from transportation and infrastructure to real estate and technology.
[02:54:27.860 --> 02:54:30.860]  It's been found that if an African country recognizes Taiwan as a country,
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:36.860]  they receive on average 2.7 fewer Chinese infrastructure projects within their borders each year.
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:41.860]  Conversely, if an African country votes overwhelmingly along with China in the United Nations General Assembly,
[02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:45.860]  they receive 1.8 more infrastructure projects each year.
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:48.860]  Analysts have accused them of debt colonialism.
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:52.860]  There are fears China is making loans it knows the states cannot repay.
[02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:57.860]  Beijing may engage in what critics characterize as debt trap diplomacy,
[02:54:58.860 --> 02:55:06.860]  lending designed to force countries into handing over land, minerals and strategic assets when they default on a loan.
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:10.860]  China is among the world's top 10 largest contributors of troops to the UN.
[02:55:10.860 --> 02:55:16.860]  The country currently has about 80% of its blue beret-wearing peacekeepers deployed in Africa.
[02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:22.860]  Chinese military observers, engineers, medics, police and other UN personnel help maintain peace and security,
[02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:25.860]  protect vulnerable groups and support development.
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:30.860]  You see these movies and the UN is the savior and there's this UN group of superheroes that come to create stability
[02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:35.860]  and battle Black Adam because he's too violent and they're the UN and they're going to save the world
[02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:42.860]  when it's the UN that is the biggest group running those lithium mines and those slave camps.
[02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:47.860]  They run it, they control it, they get a big cut of the money from the multinational corporations.
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:51.860]  And who gets 98% of rare earth minerals out of the ground in the world?
[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:59.860]  So in most cases the CHICOMs don't run the enslavement, they run the civilian side of it, extracting it and controlling the slaves.
[02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:03.860]  But the paramilitary camps are run by the UN on record.
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:09.860]  But when you watch a movie from Hollywood, it's the UN saving everyone from the mercenaries.
[02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:15.860]  A lie, a lie, a lie. All of it, a big giant damn lie.
[02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:20.860]  We don't hear about the UN reparations for all the African slaves they got right now or for cutting the damn food off.
[02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:32.860]  Well the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:38.860]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:46.860]  The left have wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:48.860]  The social media giants, and they are.
[02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:54.860]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:59.860]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:07.860]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:13.860]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:20.860]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:25.860]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging,
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:30.860]  calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:33.860]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:38.860]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:45.860]  In a free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[02:58:08.860 --> 02:58:12.860]  No hangover. It is a game changer. Nobody's got something close to this.
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:16.860]  Then our BrainForce Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:21.860]  It gives you four to six hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.

[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:44.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, and the answer for energy is BrainForce.

[02:59:18.860 --> 02:59:23.860]  It works great, but women like pink labels. Men like different color labels.

[02:59:48.860 --> 02:59:55.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.860 --> 03:00:04.860]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Maria Z,
[03:00:04.860 --> 03:00:10.860]  and can I just say thank you to Alex Jones, who has given us so much over the years.
[03:00:10.860 --> 03:00:16.860]  Everything he has done is so appreciated by millions and millions of people all over the world,
[03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:20.860]  and it's because of Alex for many, many people, including people that I know,
[03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:24.860]  that they are awake today and avoided these poison shots.
[03:00:24.860 --> 03:00:30.860]  Speaking of the poison shots, former BlackRock manager and Wall Street buff Ed Dowd joins us today
[03:00:30.860 --> 03:00:37.860]  to discuss his bombshell excess death disability data vaccine injuries report.
[03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:40.860]  Ed Dowd, thank you so much for being here with us today.
[03:00:41.860 --> 03:00:43.860]  Maria, great to be here. Thanks for having me on.
[03:00:44.860 --> 03:00:46.860]  It's great to have you. Thank you so much for your time.
[03:00:46.860 --> 03:00:51.860]  We, Ed and I, attended an event in Perth, Australia this weekend.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:54.860]  It was fantastic. We had thousands of people in attendance,
[03:00:54.860 --> 03:01:00.860]  and it really was a testament of the growing population that is becoming awake
[03:01:00.860 --> 03:01:04.860]  because of broadcasts like this, because of people like you, Ed.
[03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:08.860]  And so we really want to focus on some of this data that you and your team
[03:01:08.860 --> 03:01:10.860]  at Finance Technologies have presented.
[03:01:10.860 --> 03:01:16.860]  I mean, walk us through this and why this is the most credible data in the world right now,
[03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:18.860]  and it's waking millions of people up.
[03:01:19.860 --> 03:01:27.860]  Yeah, look, I started this journey in 2021, and on one of the first programs I went on,
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:29.860]  I asked to be a lightning rod.
[03:01:29.860 --> 03:01:35.860]  And what I meant was not for the authorities to come after me, but for other people to help me.
[03:01:35.860 --> 03:01:40.860]  And I've assembled a team, started a firm with two Ph.D. physicists from Portugal,
[03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:44.860]  Carlos Alegre and Yuri Nunes.
[03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:51.860]  Carlos has an extensive Wall Street background in Europe, worked for a number of hedge funds,
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:56.860]  wrote a book, Economic Cycles, Debt, and Demographics.
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:02:00.860]  And he came to me in June of 2022.
[03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:06.860]  Myself and Josh Sterling had already looked at some of the insurance data, some of the CDC data.
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:12.860]  He volunteered his help to come up with what we would call a methodology
[03:02:12.860 --> 03:02:17.860]  on how to calculate excess deaths that is far and above probably the best way to do it.
[03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:19.860]  It's a population trend adjusted.
[03:02:19.860 --> 03:02:25.860]  And so we started looking at all of Europe, the U.K., Germany, Australia, obviously the U.S.,
[03:02:25.860 --> 03:02:29.860]  Canada we can't look at because they're hiding their death data at the moment.
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:32.860]  But the numbers are in, and the numbers are devastating.
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:39.860]  The numbers basically show across most Western countries a mixture from old to young in 2021.
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:43.860]  We also looked at U.S. disability data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[03:02:43.860 --> 03:02:45.860]  We've done a deep dive there.
[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:48.860]  We then looked at the Pfizer clinical trials.
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:52.860]  There was a paper done by a couple of gentlemen, and we looked at their paper.
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:58.860]  And from there, we're able to glean the injuries and the damage and come up with an economic estimate
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:01.860]  of the damages and the numbers in the U.S.
[03:03:01.860 --> 03:03:06.860]  And at this point, you know, we had a theory that it was the vaccine.
[03:03:06.860 --> 03:03:10.860]  As we move through time, it's becoming undeniable in our minds,
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:16.860]  and we're 150% to 200% convinced it's the vaccine's causing untold amounts of deaths,
[03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:22.860]  excess deaths, disabilities, and injuries in the form of missed work time.
[03:03:22.860 --> 03:03:28.860]  Well, if the team have got the links to Financetechnologies.com, that's with a P-H,
[03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:32.860]  some of those graphs are represented on the webpage.
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:36.860]  And, of course, Ed's written a book, Cause Unknown, which is really making waves,
[03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:40.860]  and I want to talk about how that's actually waking some people up.
[03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:41.860]  But there we go.
[03:03:41.860 --> 03:03:45.860]  We've got some of that on the screen right now, excess deaths for age group 25 to 44.
[03:03:45.860 --> 03:03:48.860]  That's U.S. yearly excess death analysis.
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:51.860]  You've also got that broken up into quarters.
[03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:55.860]  Ed, just talk us through that in the minute before the break.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:04:04.860]  Yeah, so millennials started dying excessively really in 2021 into 2022 and continues in 2023.
[03:04:04.860 --> 03:04:11.860]  Granted, and thankfully at a lower rate, but it's still running around 23%, which is still way too high.
[03:04:11.860 --> 03:04:15.860]  You know, we looked also at the Society of Actuaries data,
[03:04:15.860 --> 03:04:22.860]  which confirms what we gleaned from the CDC data and the UN data.
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:27.860]  And the bottom line is it's been detrimental to your health to be employed in 21 and 22.
[03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:32.860]  Millennials are, you know, that age group's not supposed to die.
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:35.860]  And the insurance companies are paying out claims.
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:37.860]  They're slowly waking up to this.
[03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:42.860]  Josh Sterling has got an effort called the Insurance Collaboration to Save Lives,
[03:04:42.860 --> 03:04:44.860]  where the vaccine is on the table as a cause.
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:46.860]  Pause right there for me, Ed.
[03:04:46.860 --> 03:04:48.860]  We've got to go to break.
[03:04:48.860 --> 03:04:50.860]  Let's continue this conversation on the other side.
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:53.860]  Don't go anywhere because people are waking up because of this data.
[03:04:53.860 --> 03:04:55.860]  It's undeniable.
[03:04:55.860 --> 03:04:57.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.860 --> 03:05:02.860]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce+.
[03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:04.860]  We made it even stronger.
[03:05:04.860 --> 03:05:08.860]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere,
[03:05:08.860 --> 03:05:15.860]  TurboForce is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:05:15.860 --> 03:05:21.860]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[03:05:21.860 --> 03:05:23.860]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:05:23.860 --> 03:05:27.860]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[03:05:27.860 --> 03:05:32.860]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[03:05:32.860 --> 03:05:35.860]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:05:35.860 --> 03:05:38.860]  It is the super fuel.
[03:05:38.860 --> 03:05:41.860]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:05:41.860 --> 03:05:43.860]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[03:05:43.860 --> 03:05:45.860]  This is the King Kong.
[03:05:45.860 --> 03:05:47.860]  This is the boss.
[03:05:47.860 --> 03:05:51.860]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:54.860]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:04.860]  And we are back with Ed Dowd, who is making waves across the world.
[03:06:04.860 --> 03:06:07.860]  Let me tell you, his book, his team's data,
[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:11.860]  all the work that he is doing is getting the attention of some important people.
[03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:14.860]  Ed, please go on with what you were saying before the break.
[03:06:14.860 --> 03:06:19.860]  Yeah, so millennials, typically speaking, shouldn't die,
[03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:21.860]  especially the employed millennials.
[03:06:21.860 --> 03:06:27.860]  So we have our data across the globe, but I like to use other people's data
[03:06:27.860 --> 03:06:31.860]  because not only does it confirm us, it's not our data, so it's undeniable.
[03:06:31.860 --> 03:06:37.860]  Society of actuaries, they count the number of claims they're paying out,
[03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:42.860]  and in 2021, they paid 40% excess deaths out.
[03:06:42.860 --> 03:06:44.860]  Ten percent is a once-in-a-century year flood.
[03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:46.860]  Forty percent is unheard of.
[03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:50.860]  Millennials had an event in the third quarter of 2021.
[03:06:50.860 --> 03:06:55.860]  Their excess deaths went up to 84% very quickly in a three-month timeframe.
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:07:00.860]  That event was mandates and vaccination programs in the U.S.,
[03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:04.860]  and it's undeniable because in a three-month timeframe,
[03:07:04.860 --> 03:07:06.860]  it rose at such a fast rate.
[03:07:06.860 --> 03:07:09.860]  On Wall Street, that's what we call an event.
[03:07:09.860 --> 03:07:11.860]  It was standard deviations above norms.
[03:07:11.860 --> 03:07:15.860]  And the naysayers have said many things like,
[03:07:15.860 --> 03:07:21.860]  Ed, it's suicides, it's drug overdoses, and it's missed cancer screening appointments.
[03:07:21.860 --> 03:07:26.860]  And for this elite group of Fortune 500 midsize-level company employees,
[03:07:26.860 --> 03:07:29.860]  that doesn't make any sense.
[03:07:29.860 --> 03:07:32.860]  People tend not to have a suicide pact working at these companies in the third quarter.
[03:07:32.860 --> 03:07:34.860]  That makes no sense.
[03:07:34.860 --> 03:07:36.860]  These people need to be employed to get the claim,
[03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:40.860]  and they don't usually overdose on drugs like fentanyl and heroin,
[03:07:40.860 --> 03:07:42.860]  and you don't keep your job very long,
[03:07:42.860 --> 03:07:45.860]  and missed cancer screening appointments is nonsense in 56.
[03:07:45.860 --> 03:07:46.860]  I've never had one.
[03:07:46.860 --> 03:07:51.860]  Usually you get a cancer screening when you present yourself with some sort of illness,
[03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:52.860]  and then they start testing.
[03:07:52.860 --> 03:07:56.860]  So no one goes in for yearly annual cancer screening appointments.
[03:07:56.860 --> 03:07:58.860]  It's nonsense.
[03:07:58.860 --> 03:08:01.860]  So you mentioned something really crucial there,
[03:08:01.860 --> 03:08:03.860]  and I recall this from your presentation.
[03:08:03.860 --> 03:08:10.860]  This data represents people who are working who can afford health insurance.
[03:08:10.860 --> 03:08:12.860]  This is what we're talking about here.
[03:08:12.860 --> 03:08:13.860]  So as you said,
[03:08:13.860 --> 03:08:18.860]  we're not talking about this working population represented in the Fortune 500
[03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:21.860]  companies, as you said, going and overdosing on drugs.
[03:08:21.860 --> 03:08:23.860]  This doesn't happen.
[03:08:23.860 --> 03:08:25.860]  No, it does not happen.
[03:08:25.860 --> 03:08:27.860]  And there was a clear event,
[03:08:27.860 --> 03:08:34.860]  the Society of Actuaries report that came out last August that showed 2021 was
[03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:36.860]  devastating, and it showed an event.
[03:08:36.860 --> 03:08:37.860]  It looks like a heat map,
[03:08:37.860 --> 03:08:41.860]  and the red centered on the millennials 25 through 44 in the third quarter of
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:43.860]  2021.
[03:08:43.860 --> 03:08:45.860]  They broke it down into two different age groups.
[03:08:45.860 --> 03:08:47.860]  One experienced 100% excess mortality,
[03:08:47.860 --> 03:08:49.860]  the other 78.
[03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:50.860]  It's around 84%,
[03:08:50.860 --> 03:08:54.860]  which is the number that Josh Sterling and I came up with in February and March
[03:08:54.860 --> 03:08:55.860]  of 2022.
[03:08:55.860 --> 03:08:58.860]  The Society of Actuaries basically confirmed our numbers,
[03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:02.860]  which at the time people were poo-pooing and saying it's just two dudes on the
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:03.860]  internet.
[03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:05.860]  Well, the Society of Actuaries isn't two dudes on the internet.
[03:09:05.860 --> 03:09:09.860]  So we're getting verification all over the place.
[03:09:09.860 --> 03:09:12.860]  We then discovered some new data this year.
[03:09:12.860 --> 03:09:14.860]  It's called absence and work time loss data.
[03:09:14.860 --> 03:09:16.860]  It's annual data.
[03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:17.860]  It's not monthly,
[03:09:17.860 --> 03:09:21.860]  but it showed an increase of missed work time,
[03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:26.860]  work time loss and absences of 13 standard deviations in the U.S.
[03:09:26.860 --> 03:09:28.860]  above a 20-year trend line.
[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:31.860]  Black Swan event.
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:35.860]  So basically from there we were able to,
[03:09:35.860 --> 03:09:38.860]  from the mRNA clinical trials,
[03:09:38.860 --> 03:09:40.860]  come up with an injury number,
[03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:44.860]  and we think there's about 26.6 million people in the U.S.
[03:09:44.860 --> 03:09:47.860]  whose immune systems have been compromised,
[03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:51.860]  which is presenting as chronic absences and illnesses.
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:53.860]  So their immune system is blown up.
[03:09:53.860 --> 03:09:56.860]  And if you take that number that we saw in the U.S.
[03:09:56.860 --> 03:09:58.860]  and impute it globally,
[03:09:58.860 --> 03:10:00.860]  assuming 5 billion people got vaccinated,
[03:10:00.860 --> 03:10:04.860]  it's about 900 million people injured that are chronically presenting as
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:05.860]  sick.
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:06.860]  And unfortunately,
[03:10:06.860 --> 03:10:09.860]  unless the globe knows what's going on,
[03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:11.860]  they're going to treat the symptoms rather than the root cause,
[03:10:11.860 --> 03:10:13.860]  which is an immune system problem,
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:14.860]  which can be fixed.
[03:10:14.860 --> 03:10:15.860]  I'm hopeful for that.
[03:10:16.860 --> 03:10:17.860]  But if we don't take care of this,
[03:10:17.860 --> 03:10:21.860]  the injured can turn into disabled and the disabled can turn into dead.
[03:10:21.860 --> 03:10:23.860]  So these buckets are not static.
[03:10:25.860 --> 03:10:29.860]  And some people may argue that this was deaths from COVID or even
[03:10:29.860 --> 03:10:30.860]  absences due to COVID.
[03:10:30.860 --> 03:10:32.860]  Why does this data prove otherwise?
[03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:35.860]  Well, first of all,
[03:10:35.860 --> 03:10:38.860]  the variants became less lethal as time rolled on,
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:42.860]  and the young folks weren't really dying in 2020 to the extent they
[03:10:42.860 --> 03:10:44.860]  weren't 21 and 22.
[03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:45.860]  And at this point,
[03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:47.860]  COVID is a cold.
[03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:48.860]  It's Omicron.
[03:10:48.860 --> 03:10:50.860]  And we're seeing,
[03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:51.860]  for instance,
[03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:53.860]  in the country of Australia,
[03:10:53.860 --> 03:10:57.860]  your excess deaths reached a new high in 2022 of 16%,
[03:10:57.860 --> 03:11:00.860]  and they were minus 2% in 2020,
[03:11:00.860 --> 03:11:02.860]  plus 4% excess deaths in 21.
[03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:04.860]  And now with a cold,
[03:11:04.860 --> 03:11:07.860]  Australia is experiencing horrendous excess deaths.
[03:11:07.860 --> 03:11:09.860]  So there's something going on.
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:10.860]  At the very least,
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:12.860]  if it's not the vaccines,
[03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:13.860]  which I believe it is,
[03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:18.860]  there seems to be a lack of interest in this subject by the global health
[03:11:18.860 --> 03:11:21.860]  authorities and the global governments and the media.
[03:11:21.860 --> 03:11:26.860]  So we have worse numbers now than we did during the pandemic in terms of
[03:11:26.860 --> 03:11:27.860]  overall excess deaths.
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:31.860]  Disabilities have spiked greatly in the U.S.
[03:11:31.860 --> 03:11:34.860]  I suspect also other places as well.
[03:11:34.860 --> 03:11:37.860]  And the injury numbers we're gleaning from the U.S.
[03:11:37.860 --> 03:11:39.860]  are probably all over the place as well.
[03:11:39.860 --> 03:11:41.860]  So why would this be going on?
[03:11:41.860 --> 03:11:45.860]  We have pandemic numbers in 2022 with the pandemic supposedly over,
[03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:48.860]  but there's crickets and silence on what's going on.
[03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:51.860]  And what's the trajectory, Ed?
[03:11:51.860 --> 03:11:53.860]  I mean, is it going to get worse?
[03:11:53.860 --> 03:11:57.860]  We had people very early on predicting that these injections were going to
[03:11:57.860 --> 03:11:59.860]  kill off a large portion of the population.
[03:11:59.860 --> 03:12:00.860]  They already have.
[03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:03.860]  Does it look like it's going to continue going at this rate?
[03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:05.860]  Well,
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:10.860]  the good news is the disability rate of the second derivative,
[03:12:10.860 --> 03:12:12.860]  the rate of change has slowed,
[03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:15.860]  but the disabilities in the U.S. hasn't broken trend.
[03:12:15.860 --> 03:12:21.860]  So the sharp rise we saw from Feb 21 to September 22 has slowed,
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:25.860]  but I would like to see us see the trend line broken.
[03:12:25.860 --> 03:12:26.860]  We haven't yet.
[03:12:26.860 --> 03:12:29.860]  The excess deaths in the U.S.,
[03:12:29.860 --> 03:12:31.860]  especially amongst the society of actuaries,
[03:12:31.860 --> 03:12:33.860]  millennial age groups running around 23%.
[03:12:33.860 --> 03:12:38.860]  So well off the 84%, but 23%, if that continues,
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:42.860]  that's a devastating population problem.
[03:12:42.860 --> 03:12:46.860]  So the numbers, while better,
[03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:50.860]  aren't getting better as quickly as I would like to see.
[03:12:50.860 --> 03:12:52.860]  And if they stay at these levels, we have a problem.
[03:12:54.500 --> 03:13:00.620]  Talk to us about the data across other countries because you haven't just
[03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:04.300]  looked at the United States, you haven't just looked at Australia, you've also got
[03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:09.580]  Europe, the UK, other countries. Is it consistent across the board? What are the
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:15.580]  differences? There are slight differences but the theme of a
[03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:19.660]  mixture from old to young pretty much occurred in almost every country. The
[03:13:19.660 --> 03:13:22.780]  country that was the most devastated because they had one of the highest
[03:13:22.780 --> 03:13:29.660]  vaccination rates was Denmark. They saw excess deaths in every age group, almost
[03:13:29.660 --> 03:13:32.620]  every age group. There was one that wasn't but it was almost every age group,
[03:13:32.620 --> 03:13:40.060]  each cohort saw 2021 above 2020, 2022 above 21. And Denmark at the end of last
[03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:48.140]  year effectively through wordsmithing banned the vaccine for 150. They
[03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:53.820]  recommended not to get it and they said we'd rather you get COVID than the COVID
[03:13:53.820 --> 03:14:00.380]  vaccine. Interesting. We have other countries backing off in
[03:14:00.380 --> 03:14:06.380]  certain age groups. The US, which usually is a healthcare leader, is still
[03:14:06.380 --> 03:14:11.500]  pushing forward, acting as if nothing's going on. When I came to Australia this
[03:14:11.500 --> 03:14:15.980]  weekend, my challenge to Australia was shame the Yanks and ban it before we do.
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:21.020]  Honestly, I think there's a shot there because I think as quickly as you all went over the cliff,
[03:14:21.020 --> 03:14:25.580]  you can pull a 180 and as word spreads in Australia, I think people are going to be a
[03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:30.060]  little irate and I think change can happen faster there than it can in the US. There's too many
[03:14:30.780 --> 03:14:34.460]  vested interests in the US that don't want to see this come to light.
[03:14:35.980 --> 03:14:41.980]  We certainly have less people to convince in this country and we have a growing movement that is
[03:14:41.980 --> 03:14:47.260]  certain. More and more people are telling me, I speak to a lot of strangers on the street as I'm
[03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:52.940]  sure that most people who are awake do, because our future literally depends on all of us realising
[03:14:52.940 --> 03:15:01.340]  what on earth is going on here. When I talk to them about CBDCs, for example, they are terrified.
[03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:06.060]  They don't want this kind of control. It's all linked with the scam of the past three years
[03:15:06.780 --> 03:15:10.300]  and the scam that's been really running much longer than that, but a lot of people have
[03:15:10.300 --> 03:15:16.540]  just realised it now. I do want to get into CBDCs with you, but when we come back from the break,
[03:15:16.540 --> 03:15:21.580]  I will ask the team to play the clip from Sky News. Ed actually interviewed with a mainstream
[03:15:21.580 --> 03:15:29.340]  media outlet here in Australia while he was here from Perth and they surprisingly aired him saying
[03:15:29.340 --> 03:15:35.340]  exactly what he's telling us today. It looks like it is the injections. There is no other
[03:15:35.340 --> 03:15:42.620]  way that this could be attributed to anything else and basically proved me wrong and people
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:47.900]  have not been able to. So stay with us, Ed. Viewers, please stay with us. Share this broadcast
[03:15:47.900 --> 03:15:51.660]  everywhere. This is really, really important information because it's waking important people
[03:15:51.660 --> 03:15:59.740]  up. Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back. In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[03:15:59.820 --> 03:16:06.220]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:16:06.220 --> 03:16:12.620]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:16:12.620 --> 03:16:19.180]  into fluorosilicic acid. Still highly toxic, but containable. Now these companies had a stockpile
[03:16:19.180 --> 03:16:24.540]  of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major
[03:16:24.540 --> 03:16:29.580]  stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public
[03:16:29.580 --> 03:16:36.220]  health service at the time. And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated
[03:16:36.220 --> 03:16:41.980]  industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's
[03:16:41.980 --> 03:16:48.620]  causing various cancers and other disease. With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:54.620]  water and a remedy to this madness. Available now at Infowarestore.com.

[03:17:20.140 --> 03:17:24.940]  again, with no hangover or letdown. And the other is a very special proprietary formula,
[03:17:24.940 --> 03:17:29.020]  that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick. And I love it. It wears off in two to three
[03:17:29.020 --> 03:17:32.700]  hours. So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay
[03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:35.900]  nine o'clock at night. Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or
[03:17:35.900 --> 03:17:41.500]  something, and boom, writing an article or writing a book. And then I get two, three hours of energy
[03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:46.460]  and then go right to bed after it. Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves
[03:17:46.460 --> 03:17:50.700]  or 40% off individually. A lot of people love these products. They've got five-star reviews,

[03:18:24.860 --> 03:18:29.820]  strong. Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride. Ours don't. And it doesn't have fillers
[03:18:29.820 --> 03:18:36.140]  in it. It is just chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:53.660]  running out as well. So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, Infowarestore.com.

[03:19:05.660 --> 03:19:10.780]  online and in person. Hey, what's better, knockout? What's better, down-and-out? What's
[03:19:10.780 --> 03:19:15.420]  better? Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids? And the answer is different herbal

[03:19:55.400 --> 03:20:05.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:18.220]  You know, Australia really was home to some of the most draconian measures and it was
[03:20:18.220 --> 03:20:23.500]  such a big deal for so many Australians this weekend to have an honourable person like
[03:20:23.500 --> 03:20:29.020]  Ed Dowd in our presence, Dr Racine Malhotra was there, Dr Naomi Wolf, John Shipton, Julian
[03:20:29.020 --> 03:20:35.080]  Assange's father at the conference, some really, really, you know, seasoned campaigners when
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:41.160]  it comes to telling the truth. I interviewed doctors over this period who were put in solitary
[03:20:41.160 --> 03:20:47.020]  confinement, raided in their homes, raided in their offices for speaking out. It was
[03:20:47.020 --> 03:20:52.480]  absolutely brutal what they did to us in this country and I will never forget, you know,
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:21:00.040]  sometimes we get tired of talking about the insane measures that these maniacs went to
[03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:06.640]  when it came to COVID and rest assured, if they did it once, they will do it again and
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:12.400]  they're planning it right now. But right now we have Ed Dowd with us and he attended a,
[03:21:12.400 --> 03:21:16.640]  he actually featured on the mainstream media in Australia while he was here. I've got a
[03:21:16.640 --> 03:21:22.240]  quick clip to play here from his appearance on Sky News and then we'll go back to Ed.
[03:21:22.240 --> 03:21:23.240]  Here's that clip now.
[03:21:23.240 --> 03:21:28.280]  My thesis is that it's the vaccine. At the very least, if it's not the vaccine, what
[03:21:28.280 --> 03:21:32.840]  is it and why is no one talking about it? Because the numbers we see now are actually
[03:21:32.840 --> 03:21:38.520]  worse than 2020 in terms of continued excess deaths into 23, disabilities that took off
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:46.320]  in 2021 into 2022. We added 3.2 million to our disability rolls in the U.S. We had about
[03:21:46.320 --> 03:21:52.480]  29, 30 million for the prior four years. It went up to 33.2 million in 18 months and
[03:21:52.480 --> 03:22:01.040]  half of those newly disabled people were employed.
[03:22:01.040 --> 03:22:05.040]  Very interesting. Ed, you blew up the internet in Australia.
[03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:12.600]  Well, there's a back story here that I'd like to tell. When I was, first of all, Adrian
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:18.600]  McRae put on this event with Topher. He deserves a lot of credit. He got me the interview on
[03:22:18.600 --> 03:22:24.080]  Sky News and he told me, look, they don't want to talk about the vaccines. You're going
[03:22:24.080 --> 03:22:29.320]  to do a financial talk about the economy and what you see. So I went in prepared just to
[03:22:29.320 --> 03:22:34.760]  talk about finance. And I was told if I start bringing up vaccines, they'd pull me. That's
[03:22:34.760 --> 03:22:39.400]  what I was told. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. So I was prepared just to talk
[03:22:39.400 --> 03:22:43.520]  about finance. And then they brought up my book and asked me to talk about it, which
[03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:48.640]  I was shocked. So I think Rowan and Rita and I forget the other gentleman's name deserve
[03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:54.840]  a shout out because I think a decision was made to at least let me speak about my book.
[03:22:54.840 --> 03:23:01.100]  They plugged my book. And of course, they use the TGA disclaimer. But I suspect and
[03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:07.360]  Topher suspects as well that maybe they saw the live streaming event and they decided
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:12.480]  this information needed to get out somehow. So I got to give them a hat tip because I
[03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:18.640]  went in not thinking I would be able to talk about it. So that was great news for Australia.
[03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:26.760]  I absolutely agree with you, Ed. I call the fact that we are not able to air this information
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:32.660]  without the TGA disclaimer, specifically, you know, given some of Dr. Malhotra's revelations
[03:23:32.660 --> 03:23:37.760]  during that conference that the TGA is actually 96 percent funded by Big Pharma, you know,
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:43.960]  without that TGA, I hate that they do this. And I understand the reasons why, albeit I
[03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:49.360]  don't agree with that. But, you know, I was disappointed that it didn't air on YouTube.
[03:23:49.360 --> 03:23:54.680]  But YouTube would probably pull that down. That that portion of your interview wasn't
[03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:59.040]  actually aired by Sky on YouTube. But much to their credit, whoever was watching live
[03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:03.960]  and all of the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of reshares that this clip has
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:09.600]  had of you talking about this on Sky, the full clip has gone all over the Internet.
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:14.920]  So I do credit them for that. Absolutely. And all of Australia is talking about this.
[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:19.360]  And here's the thing, Ed, you know, we all know it's happening. The mainstream media
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:24.840]  is alluding to it now. And yet we've got Senator Babbitt in Australia and we're unique
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:30.040]  in the way that in the sense that we do have some really great senators here. Senator Alex
[03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:35.160]  Antic being one of them, you know, regular, regular guest of mine. And Senator Babbitt
[03:24:35.160 --> 03:24:40.600]  went to Parliament and wanted to investigate the excess deaths. He didn't say this is due
[03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:46.240]  to the injections, nothing. He wanted to investigate the excess deaths and the Parliament voted
[03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:54.800]  against it. Imagine being allegedly elected by your people and refusing to investigate
[03:24:54.800 --> 03:25:01.920]  why they're dying in droves. Similarly, Senator Antic, and I won't take up the whole of your
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:08.040]  time, Ed, but Senator Antic went into Parliament and said, OK, let's know who's associated
[03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:11.400]  with the World Economic Forum. I want you to disclose your ties because it could be
[03:25:11.400 --> 03:25:15.960]  a conflict of interest. And let's all just be honest. If we have associations with the
[03:25:15.960 --> 03:25:21.120]  World Economic Forum, we can say so. If not, we will say we don't. And most of Parliament
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:26.800]  voted against that. Majority of them voted against it. So you really see this huge cover
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:32.080]  up happening. And, you know, you say it yourself, it's a cover up of the biggest crime in history,
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:38.760]  the biggest cover up. But simultaneously, we have so many people waking up. Talk to
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:43.360]  us about that process. Yeah, so, you know, I believe in the marginal
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:48.080]  mind. This has always been a battle for the marginal mind. And I believe if we reach a
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:53.680]  tipping point, things change. And so my goal in what I've been doing is knowing that the
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:59.440]  mainstream media won't air my data, knowing that governments and global health authorities
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:05.640]  don't want to talk about this. It's been a guerrilla warfare, information warfare. Get
[03:26:05.640 --> 03:26:09.680]  the message out. And it's spreading word of mouth. And what happened in Australia, I think
[03:26:09.680 --> 03:26:13.760]  we can't we can't underscore how important that was. You guys took the brunt of it. But
[03:26:13.760 --> 03:26:19.040]  2,500 people showed up in Perth. That's the biggest crowd I think anybody in the freedom
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:25.920]  movement has ever spoken to. 2,500 people in Perth. So Perth is waking up. And I challenge
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:31.520]  the audience, take the information and become, you know, your own Paul Revere, like we did
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:36.000]  in the U.S. and say it's the vaccines, it's the vaccines and spread the message. And I
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:43.360]  think word of mouth is happening. Rita and Rowan aired my book. I think things are changing.
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:48.800]  And I think you're a nation of 25 million people. And even though the people in the
[03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:53.520]  government are trying to suppress this, you guys can change this quickly. I think what
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:57.120]  happened in Australia was so egregious. And I think a million and a half people protested
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:27:02.960]  the mandates and lockdowns. There was Battleground, Melbourne. And I think Australia has the ability
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:08.400]  to change and change fast and pull the 180. In the U.S., you know, we have too many vested
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:13.280]  powerful interests and the nation's too divided. I think you guys can probably pull together
[03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:16.240]  and stop this madness. I really have hope for Australia.
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:21.280]  I have hope for the whole world. And at the end of the day, the power's always been with
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:26.480]  the people. It's just that the people have to realise it. And so we'll talk about, we'll
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:30.480]  talk a little bit more about that towards the end. Really quickly for me, talk about
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:34.720]  the vaccine damage project. And then we want to get into the economy after this break.
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:42.400]  Sure. So basically, we did an analysis with all our excess death data, disability data,
[03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:47.920]  and then the missing piece, the injuries. And we came up with, here's the human cost.
[03:27:47.920 --> 03:27:54.080]  We estimated 300,000 excess deaths in the U.S., probably on the low side. Disability
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:28:01.200]  is 1.36 million. Again, we're very conservative. And then injury is 26.6 million. So in total,
[03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:06.880]  it's about 28 plus million people in the U.S. That's about 10 per cent of the population.
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:11.680]  It's probably more of the employed part of our country. So that's why I've been saying
[03:28:11.680 --> 03:28:17.200]  it's a national security issue because of the mandates. And the economic cost, we estimate,
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:21.760]  and we just took lost wages. That's what we can measure. What we can't measure is lost
[03:28:21.760 --> 03:28:26.640]  productivity, which is much higher. But here's the numbers, as according to lost wages,
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:31.920]  5.2 billion from the dead, 52 billion from the disabled, and 89 billion from
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:38.640]  the injured in 2022, for a grand total of about 150 billion that we can measure.
[03:28:38.640 --> 03:28:42.800]  Again, productivity is a multiplier effect. It's lost productivity here. So it could be
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:47.840]  anywhere from 500 billion to a trillion. We've got to go to break, Ed. These are
[03:28:47.840 --> 03:28:53.280]  astronomical numbers. Finance technologies with a PH. Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:29:00.080]  without doubt. You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next

[03:32:58.240 --> 03:33:05.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:18.040]  You know, people really underestimate the impact that they can have on the world. Ed
[03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:24.000]  Dowd is a perfect example of that. He's seen that there's a huge problem. He's used his
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:31.040]  skills, his gifts to present something to the population that is helping them wake up.
[03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:35.240]  I want to share a really quick story and this is in no way, shape or form, you know, me
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:43.320]  pumping Z-Media's tires up, although I think we do great work. Last year, early last year,
[03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:47.280]  we were contacted by some doctors and they really didn't know what to do. And when I tell
[03:33:47.280 --> 03:33:53.280]  you Australia was terrified, these doctors were being raided. One of them spent time
[03:33:53.280 --> 03:33:59.560]  in solitary confinement. I said that before, but just imagine in your brain a doctor being
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:05.920]  put into solitary confinement for speaking out against the shots. It's a serious Nazi
[03:34:05.920 --> 03:34:12.320]  Germany stuff. And so we gathered these doctors, 17 of them, into a conference. We called it
[03:34:12.320 --> 03:34:17.080]  Conference of Conscience. It was the first time in our country that something of this
[03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:21.560]  nature had been held. And it was, you know, it really blew up. It went viral all over
[03:34:21.560 --> 03:34:26.800]  the country because of the fact that doctors were finally speaking up. And these brave doctors,
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:30.880]  one of them approached me over the weekend and just said, you know, I want to thank you.
[03:34:30.880 --> 03:34:36.240]  And I'm so happy that you did what we all did, what we did, and you encouraged us to
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:43.360]  speak out. And I don't have what I had before, but I'm happier now than I was. And I guess
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:49.960]  this is what I want to talk to you about, Ed. People are, you know, they may not have their
[03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:55.720]  prestigious careers. They may not have the same career that they had before, but it is
[03:34:55.720 --> 03:35:01.840]  so much more prestigious to be truthful and doing the right thing for humanity. Would
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:02.840]  you agree?
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:10.120]  Absolutely. I mean, people ask me, you know, why am I doing this? It's because it needed
[03:35:10.120 --> 03:35:15.760]  to be done and I had no fear about doing it. And as a result of doing this, I've met the
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:20.640]  most wonderful people that share the same values as me. And, you know, we've been doing
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:28.480]  this for free. There's no, you know, we eventually need to get day jobs. But it's been the most
[03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:33.160]  fulfilling work I've ever done in my life. And I'm honored to be able to go on shows
[03:35:33.160 --> 03:35:38.920]  like this and present the truth. And Steve Kirsch, I saw Steve Kirsch in Maui before
[03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:46.400]  I took off in October of 2021. And someone asked him, he had lost his company. He was
[03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:53.040]  kicked off the board of directors. He was vilified by all his friends. And he said, you know,
[03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:57.280]  would you, knowing what happened to you, would you do this again? He said, I would do it
[03:35:57.280 --> 03:36:03.040]  just to save one life. And that's exactly it. It's about saving just one life. And if
[03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:09.440]  you can save many lives, that's a good enough thing. And you can go to the next world happy
[03:36:09.440 --> 03:36:15.200]  that you're in this fight. So my charge to everyone is, if you're starting to wake up,
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:19.840]  share this life-saving information with other people. Because, you know, I said in Australia
[03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:25.600]  on Saturday night, you know, if you've been vaccinated, fine. But don't take boosters.
[03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:30.320]  Because it's like a trade. You're on the wrong side of the trade. And the more you get boosted,
[03:36:30.320 --> 03:36:36.480]  the more you risk an adverse event or a problem. So stop getting a booster for
[03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:44.000]  a treatment we know that doesn't work at all. Well, I'm certain that the audience,
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:50.720]  regular viewers of this broadcast, are not getting boosters. But at the same time, you know,
[03:36:50.720 --> 03:36:55.280]  you never know. Maybe their work's asking for it. We still have employers in Australia that are
[03:36:55.280 --> 03:37:01.040]  asking people to go and get more injections. It is madness. And so, you know, if you're one of
[03:37:01.040 --> 03:37:06.400]  those people, obviously stop immediately. These are poison shots. You said it just before, Ed,
[03:37:06.400 --> 03:37:09.600]  this is a national security issue. Our military have been poisoned.
[03:37:10.080 --> 03:37:15.200]  Yeah, the U.S. military and I suspect other militaries across the globe have been poisoned.
[03:37:15.200 --> 03:37:24.000]  Colonel Theresa Long, who is a whistleblower in the U.S. Air Force, has said to me after I put
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:28.800]  out the vaccine damage report, she called me immediately and said, given what I'm seeing
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:33.040]  through recruitment efforts, which are low due to the woke nature of the military,
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:36.880]  those who quit because they didn't want to get vaccinated, and those who are getting
[03:37:36.960 --> 03:37:41.600]  and those who are getting disabilities, injuries and death and dying,
[03:37:42.240 --> 03:37:46.240]  she says in five years, we won't have a standing military unless we stop this.
[03:37:46.100 --> 03:37:54.580]  It is heartbreaking to see how many people went along with this, but I'm glad that people
[03:37:54.580 --> 03:37:55.580]  are waking up.
[03:37:55.580 --> 03:38:00.420]  By the way, Ed, do you know that the link for finance technologies does not work on
[03:38:00.420 --> 03:38:02.000]  Safari in Australia?
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:03.660]  You have to use DuckDuckGo.
[03:38:03.660 --> 03:38:04.660]  Would you believe that?
[03:38:04.660 --> 03:38:08.180]  They are actively blocking your link.
[03:38:08.180 --> 03:38:10.420]  Wow, I did not know that.
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:12.980]  Someone in Australia pointed it out and said it worked for me.
[03:38:12.980 --> 03:38:18.100]  Apparently, your intelligence agencies are doing something, I guess.
[03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:21.300]  I have tried from a couple of browsers.
[03:38:21.300 --> 03:38:23.180]  You really have to use DuckDuckGo.
[03:38:23.180 --> 03:38:30.220]  For anyone watching this, obviously, the data is making a huge impact on the world.
[03:38:30.220 --> 03:38:37.100]  Go to phfinancetechnologies.com.
[03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:42.820]  If you go to the projects, Humanity projects, they have also got resources on there.
[03:38:42.820 --> 03:38:46.020]  This data is really making a difference.
[03:38:46.020 --> 03:38:48.500]  It's waking a lot of important people up.
[03:38:48.500 --> 03:38:53.340]  We can't say too much about who, but let me tell you, it's waking up some important people.
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:57.580]  They're getting copies of Ed's book and they're saying, hang on a minute, I've been duped.
[03:38:57.580 --> 03:39:02.900]  Maybe you can spend a moment talking about that, Ed, about the fact that people who we
[03:39:02.900 --> 03:39:09.500]  may think were in the know actually weren't, and they're pissed.
[03:39:09.500 --> 03:39:15.180]  I'm not going to say names, but I know some very important people in the US who run big
[03:39:15.180 --> 03:39:18.140]  companies have received copies of my book.
[03:39:18.140 --> 03:39:23.180]  They took the jab and now they're not happy.
[03:39:23.180 --> 03:39:28.140]  A lot of people in the conspiracy world think that everybody at the top was in on it.
[03:39:28.140 --> 03:39:29.140]  That's not true.
[03:39:29.140 --> 03:39:32.340]  Many, many people believed and took the jab.
[03:39:32.340 --> 03:39:35.580]  The executives of these insurance companies took the jab.
[03:39:35.580 --> 03:39:42.780]  Large Fortune 500 CEOs took the jab and they got the real deal, not some salient solution.
[03:39:42.780 --> 03:39:48.220]  This book has been instrumental in waking people up because I come at it not from a medical
[03:39:48.220 --> 03:39:53.500]  science point of view, but from a numbers trend analysis point of view, Wall Street.
[03:39:53.500 --> 03:39:58.300]  A lot of people in corporate America understand finance and Wall Street speak and they see
[03:39:58.300 --> 03:40:02.460]  these numbers and their jaws drop.
[03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:09.780]  Dr Malhotra actually dropped a bombshell on the Aussie audience over the weekend talking
[03:40:09.780 --> 03:40:13.840]  about the fact that he believes that there's enough evidence to declare that Shane Warne,
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:17.320]  a famous cricketer, actually died due to the jab.
[03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:22.520]  We know about Jamie Foxx's reaction as well recently in the media.
[03:40:22.520 --> 03:40:26.960]  So there's, I think you're right, a lot of people who we would think are in the know
[03:40:26.960 --> 03:40:28.960]  actually weren't.
[03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:35.360]  I think that the question now, Ed, is what are these people going to do with this information
[03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:36.360]  that they are getting?
[03:40:36.360 --> 03:40:41.720]  You know, these people that are now injured, these people that may not personally be injured
[03:40:41.720 --> 03:40:45.360]  but now all of a sudden their conscience is pricked once they realise, hang on a second,
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:50.840]  I took part in maybe even promoted something publicly because of farmer backing or because
[03:40:50.840 --> 03:40:55.360]  I thought, you know, I was part of the deluded people that thought that this was good for
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:41:00.960]  humanity and now it's proving to not be good.
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:07.000]  So I think that, you know, it really is a call to the conscience of those people.
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:15.600]  Yeah, this is, I look at things in terms of capital markets and stock prices and asset
[03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:21.400]  classes and when you have kind of a bubble and a euphoria, it kind of exhausts itself
[03:41:21.400 --> 03:41:24.080]  and then there's a tipping point and then it goes the other way.
[03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:30.040]  I think we're getting closer and closer to the tipping point of people who are coming
[03:41:30.040 --> 03:41:34.720]  to a round of the conclusion that supporting this vaccine is not going to be good for your
[03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:39.400]  career, you're going to be on the wrong side of history.
[03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:42.560]  So once this starts spreading, it'll happen quick.
[03:41:42.560 --> 03:41:44.480]  I think we're approaching that moment.
[03:41:44.480 --> 03:41:49.480]  We've gone from denial, we're somewhere between denial and anger and hopefully that anger
[03:41:49.480 --> 03:41:55.520]  can be put to good use and people can be activated and we start having serious investigations,
[03:41:55.520 --> 03:42:00.680]  congressional investigations in the U.S., I hope something happens in Australia and people
[03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:06.680]  pull a 180 because this isn't about, you know, unless you're directly tied to some sort of
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:11.440]  criminal activity, pulling a 180 is not a big deal, it's just admitting you're wrong
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:15.800]  and in Wall Street, the most successful amongst us admit we're wrong and pull a 180 quickly,
[03:42:15.800 --> 03:42:18.440]  that's how you survive on Wall Street.
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:19.520]  So not admit you're wrong.
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:25.080]  I think you're absolutely right and here's the thing, we're about to go to break Ed, but
[03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:30.040]  here's the thing, you're absolutely right, even though people are so, so mad, they will
[03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:36.120]  still show forgiveness if you have people that start coming out now with the truth
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:37.620]  en masse.
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:42.560]  You have a window now, here's a call to all of those people that we're addressing specifically,
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:46.760]  you have a window right now before the people get mad beyond belief because I tell you what,
[03:42:46.760 --> 03:42:49.400]  we are not letting go of this particular crime.
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:53.760]  On the other side of the break, on the economy with Ed Dowd, we can't talk to him without
[03:42:53.760 --> 03:42:56.960]  talking about the economy, we'll be right back.
[03:42:56.960 --> 03:43:02.160]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars store at Infowars Life not at a probiotic
[03:43:02.160 --> 03:43:03.160]  for more than three years?
[03:43:03.160 --> 03:43:07.480]  And the answer is simple, we only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[03:43:07.480 --> 03:43:12.440]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years, they got bought
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:17.320]  by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.

[03:47:14.460 --> 03:47:19.500]  All right, Ed, we've spoken about the fact that people are waking up to the disaster
[03:47:19.500 --> 03:47:24.660]  that were the injections and we're talking about people really high up the chain because
[03:47:24.660 --> 03:47:30.019]  of your book Cause Unknown and the work of your team making waves truly.
[03:47:30.019 --> 03:47:36.900]  Now we need to talk about what's happening in the finance world, the economy and what
[03:47:36.900 --> 03:47:41.900]  people can actually expect over the next six to 12 months.
[03:47:41.900 --> 03:47:42.900]  Sure.
[03:47:42.900 --> 03:47:48.900]  So the Fed is going to do an interest rate decision tomorrow.
[03:47:48.900 --> 03:47:53.460]  Several months ago when we had some bank failures, I said that the Fed will be doing an emergency
[03:47:53.460 --> 03:47:55.779]  rate cut by June.
[03:47:55.779 --> 03:47:59.779]  Looks like I'm going to be wrong on that, but eventually even more right than I fear
[03:47:59.779 --> 03:48:05.259]  because if they do raise interest rates, 25 basis points, it's going to be a disaster
[03:48:05.259 --> 03:48:10.580]  because there's a lag on monetary changes, interest rate changes and monetary changes.
[03:48:10.580 --> 03:48:15.859]  So just like there was a lag on inflation when they did what they did in 2020, we saw
[03:48:15.859 --> 03:48:19.660]  inflation in the end of 21, it's 22.
[03:48:19.660 --> 03:48:26.300]  And raising of interest rates, 525 basis points over a 13, 14 month period is going
[03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:31.099]  to cause a liquidity event in the globe.
[03:48:31.099 --> 03:48:37.380]  Monetary calculations are showing that M2 is going negative for the first time since
[03:48:37.380 --> 03:48:39.820]  1930 year over year growth rate.
[03:48:39.820 --> 03:48:44.019]  So there's a lag effect, that lag effect if they raise again today is going to be even
[03:48:44.019 --> 03:48:49.580]  worse for Q3, Q4 in the US and probably Q1.
[03:48:50.500 --> 03:48:54.220]  So we're looking at a deep recession in the US, we put out a report, we're now calling
[03:48:54.220 --> 03:49:01.580]  for deflation a couple weeks ago, saying that deflation will be the buzzword in Q1 of 2024
[03:49:01.580 --> 03:49:09.259]  and we'll see unprecedented actions by the Fed probably and the government in the US
[03:49:09.259 --> 03:49:14.380]  will probably spend tremendous amounts of deficit spending to take us out of what we
[03:49:14.380 --> 03:49:19.900]  see as a deep recession along the lines of the S&L crisis in the 1990s.
[03:49:19.900 --> 03:49:25.420]  So it's looking grim, but you know, these are cycles, you can't avoid cycles and it
[03:49:25.420 --> 03:49:30.300]  seems like the monetary and government authorities know that because of the leverage that any
[03:49:30.300 --> 03:49:32.500]  kind of recession will be bad.
[03:49:32.500 --> 03:49:39.060]  So you can't deny cycles, you have to pay the cycle, it's due at some point and I think
[03:49:39.060 --> 03:49:43.099]  unfortunately they've made some egregious mistakes that are going to exacerbate the
[03:49:43.179 --> 03:49:46.179]  cycle on the downside.
[03:49:46.179 --> 03:49:51.300]  Well let me ask you, their goal is to switch everything to a central bank digital currency
[03:49:51.300 --> 03:49:56.939]  and really, you know, make it impossible for people to operate outside of that.
[03:49:56.939 --> 03:50:01.460]  How do you think they're going to use this to orchestrate the switch to CBDC?
[03:50:01.460 --> 03:50:02.820]  Is it going to be instant?
[03:50:02.820 --> 03:50:04.539]  Is it going to be gradual?
[03:50:04.539 --> 03:50:08.660]  Is it going to be offering people a UBI to switch to CBDCs?
[03:50:08.660 --> 03:50:13.539]  How are they going to really pull this off because people don't want this?
[03:50:13.539 --> 03:50:18.660]  So you know, they say don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:50:18.660 --> 03:50:21.259]  So there's a crisis coming.
[03:50:21.259 --> 03:50:29.740]  Many people were baffled by Speaker McCarthy giving in to the Democrats and having a debt
[03:50:29.740 --> 03:50:32.939]  ceiling deal without a cap.
[03:50:32.939 --> 03:50:37.359]  It's basically a cap in time, not amount or price.
[03:50:37.359 --> 03:50:43.640]  So basically, I think, and I wasn't in the room, it's speculation on my part that they
[03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:45.920]  were told there's a crisis coming.
[03:50:45.920 --> 03:50:50.519]  We need the flexibility to spend as much as we can to save the economy.
[03:50:50.519 --> 03:50:52.119]  And I think that's why the deal went through.
[03:50:52.119 --> 03:50:59.080]  So in the midst of this crisis, there'll be, by very serious people we suspect, the floating
[03:50:59.080 --> 03:51:02.320]  of central bank digital currency, which many people don't know about yet.
[03:51:02.320 --> 03:51:05.439]  So they'll float the idea to the general public.
[03:51:05.439 --> 03:51:12.080]  And they'll probably, in the midst of a growing unemployment rate, they'll offer a UBI, universal
[03:51:12.080 --> 03:51:15.840]  basic income, but you'll have to take the CBDC in order to get it.
[03:51:15.840 --> 03:51:18.080]  So it's going to be the carrot and the stick.
[03:51:18.080 --> 03:51:21.779]  Carlos, Yuri and I are of the belief that this will definitely be introduced or floated
[03:51:21.779 --> 03:51:26.119]  sometime in Q4, Q1, maybe Q2 of next year.
[03:51:26.119 --> 03:51:30.279]  But in the depths of the crisis, it'll be offered as a solution, we think.
[03:51:30.400 --> 03:51:38.680]  We've heard about the cyber shutdowns.
[03:51:38.680 --> 03:51:44.640]  We had the World Economic Forum warn us that over the next few years, cyber shutdowns were
[03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:46.420]  going to be the main thing.
[03:51:46.420 --> 03:51:52.119]  Do you think it's feasible that they'll do something like that and then launch CBDCs
[03:51:52.119 --> 03:51:56.480]  as the only solution moving forward?
[03:51:57.480 --> 03:52:01.920]  Look, these folks from the World Economic Forum, you and I talked about this when we
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:08.359]  first met, the first interview we did over a year ago, you're one of my first interviewers
[03:52:08.359 --> 03:52:12.359]  that started to focus on my data, so I applaud you.
[03:52:12.359 --> 03:52:15.480]  You and I laughed about the clownish evil Bond villains.
[03:52:15.480 --> 03:52:17.760]  These people are jokes.
[03:52:17.760 --> 03:52:22.039]  They literally, they're selling things that just no one wants.
[03:52:22.039 --> 03:52:24.119]  You'll own nothing and be happy, you'll eat the bugs.
[03:52:24.119 --> 03:52:25.320]  I mean, it's comical.
[03:52:25.320 --> 03:52:29.240]  So they now warn us about cyber shutdowns.
[03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:34.720]  If they were to occur, it would be hard to do, and if it happens, we all know why.
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:41.199]  So it won't be because of some attack from Iran or Russia, it'll be our own government
[03:52:41.199 --> 03:52:44.400]  shutting the switch off itself to create fear.
[03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:49.119]  So the good news is there's enough of us that are aware of this scam that if it does happen,
[03:52:49.119 --> 03:52:53.760]  we're not going to be in fear, we're not going to be like, oh, save us, give me a CBDC.
[03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:57.760]  I think there's enough people awake now, especially because of the vaccine disaster,
[03:52:57.760 --> 03:52:58.760]  that this isn't going to work.
[03:52:58.760 --> 03:53:01.240]  I don't think it's going to work.
[03:53:01.240 --> 03:53:05.600]  I don't think it will either, and I think too many people will be in an uproar.
[03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:12.680]  What I'm trying to establish is whether they already have the platform set up to essentially
[03:53:12.680 --> 03:53:16.119]  give people no option other than CBDC.
[03:53:16.119 --> 03:53:19.440]  Is the technology ready?
[03:53:19.440 --> 03:53:24.080]  I don't think so, and we haven't seen the bank consolidation in the U.S.
[03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:32.039]  That needs to happen first, and what's going on with the yield curve and the 14 years of
[03:53:32.039 --> 03:53:36.760]  zero interest rates, a lot of regional banks, because of what the Fed did, are upside down.
[03:53:36.760 --> 03:53:41.720]  So they have tremendous losses on their books, they can't raise deposit rates, and people
[03:53:41.720 --> 03:53:45.920]  are going and taking deposits out and putting them in money market funds, which give them
[03:53:45.920 --> 03:53:46.920]  a higher rate.
[03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:49.600]  So it's a disintermediation of a lot of regional banks.
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:54.600]  There'll be consolidation, whether by design or incompetence.
[03:53:54.600 --> 03:53:55.600]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:53:55.600 --> 03:54:01.039]  Again, I wasn't in the room, but the end result will be fewer banks in the U.S., and it would
[03:54:01.039 --> 03:54:04.760]  be easier to introduce a CBDC with fewer banks.
[03:54:04.760 --> 03:54:10.039]  If they try to do it too soon, it won't work as effectively in the U.S.
[03:54:10.039 --> 03:54:11.279]  We're different than a lot of countries.
[03:54:11.279 --> 03:54:16.840]  We still have a very robust banking system that's not just six banks.
[03:54:16.840 --> 03:54:21.880]  I know in Australia, you guys have like four big banks, and that's about it.
[03:54:21.880 --> 03:54:24.039]  We do have other community banks.
[03:54:24.039 --> 03:54:29.680]  After I was debanked, I went to a community bank, not that I was with one of the big four
[03:54:29.680 --> 03:54:30.680]  before.
[03:54:30.680 --> 03:54:38.840]  I haven't been for many, many years, but as far as the big four go, listen to this, everyone.
[03:54:38.840 --> 03:54:44.600]  One of the big four is asking people to, in order to be able to continue using their online
[03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:50.880]  banking services, they have to agree to new privacy amendments, if you will.
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:57.880]  That includes the bank collecting your religious data, your political views, your gender ideology.
[03:54:57.880 --> 03:54:59.460]  This is just insane.
[03:54:59.460 --> 03:55:04.400]  On top of that, another one of the big four has said, well, we're going to start shutting
[03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:05.400]  down our branches.
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:07.520]  I mean, they've been doing this everywhere.
[03:55:07.520 --> 03:55:10.160]  Regional branches have been shutting down for some time.
[03:55:10.160 --> 03:55:15.400]  You can't go to a bank, or it's open, if you're in a regional area, it's open between the
[03:55:15.400 --> 03:55:19.080]  hours of two to four on a Tuesday, and that's it.
[03:55:19.080 --> 03:55:20.080]  It's insane.
[03:55:20.080 --> 03:55:24.420]  But on top of that, they've said you can't get money over the counter.
[03:55:24.420 --> 03:55:29.160]  You have to go to an ATM, and you're capped at $1,000 a day.
[03:55:29.160 --> 03:55:34.199]  This is happening now in Australia, and another big bank has joined suit.
[03:55:34.199 --> 03:55:40.480]  So where I said, look, it's starting, and people said to me, oh, Maria, it's just a
[03:55:40.480 --> 03:55:41.480]  few branches.
[03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:42.480]  You're fear-mongering.
[03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:49.480]  Well, guys, this is how it starts, and it's a systematic conditioning so that, okay, it's
[03:55:49.480 --> 03:55:52.400]  just a few branches, you know, don't be dramatic.
[03:55:52.400 --> 03:55:54.520]  It will be every branch.
[03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:59.600]  Why on earth have we got banks telling you you can't have your own money?
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:01.600]  It's your money over the counter.
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:02.600]  You're not allowed.
[03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:07.240]  I mean, they're already setting up the building blocks for this, especially in our country,
[03:56:07.240 --> 03:56:08.240]  Ed.
[03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:09.240]  We've got about a minute left.
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:14.960]  Just let people know where they can find you and follow your work, Ed, please.
[03:56:14.960 --> 03:56:18.520]  Before I do that, let's back up to what you said about banks requiring your religious
[03:56:18.520 --> 03:56:20.320]  beliefs and political views.
[03:56:20.320 --> 03:56:25.880]  That's the beginning of a social credit score that you must fight at all costs, and if these
[03:56:25.880 --> 03:56:29.400]  people want that information, go to a community bank if you can find one.
[03:56:29.400 --> 03:56:30.720]  That's my call there.
[03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:35.840]  You can find me on Twitter at Doud Edward, D-O-W-D Edward, getter at Edward Doud.
[03:56:35.840 --> 03:56:40.160]  We have a website, Finance Technology, spelled with a P-H instead of an F. It's got all the
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:46.320]  receipts, and also my book, Cause Unknown, The Epidemic of Sudden Death in 21 and 22,
[03:56:46.320 --> 03:56:54.240]  is a good way to convince your loved ones that something horrible went on during COVID.
[03:56:54.240 --> 03:56:56.440]  It's a really great book.
[03:56:56.440 --> 03:56:57.440]  I've seen it.
[03:56:57.440 --> 03:57:02.199]  I'm yet to read it in its entirety, but it's really, really, I'm encouraging people to
[03:57:02.199 --> 03:57:05.039]  check it out on Amazon, Cause Unknown, Ed Doud.
[03:57:05.039 --> 03:57:07.039]  Thank you so much for your time today.
[03:57:07.039 --> 03:57:08.039]  God bless you.
[03:57:08.039 --> 03:57:13.199]  Tonight, Z Media's got a report coming out on our weekly broadcast, Zero Time, where
[03:57:13.199 --> 03:57:17.320]  we actually discuss the breaking news this week.
[03:57:17.320 --> 03:57:22.240]  The WHO has announced the global vax pass.
[03:57:22.240 --> 03:57:28.440]  They want to essentially tie this to your social credit score, your central bank digital
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:30.880]  currency and everything else that they're planning.
[03:57:30.880 --> 03:57:35.080]  But as Ed said, I really don't think that they're going to succeed, and it's because
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:37.080]  we're getting stronger every single day.
[03:57:37.080 --> 03:57:40.199]  I appreciate your time and Ed's time today, everyone.
[03:57:40.199 --> 03:57:41.920]  We'll see you all very, very soon.
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:42.920]  Here's Owen Troyer.
[03:57:42.920 --> 03:57:43.420]  God bless.
[03:57:44.500 --> 03:57:50.540]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Superfemale
[03:57:50.540 --> 03:57:51.540]  Vitality.

[03:58:15.700 --> 03:58:16.860]  the same formula.

[03:58:17.860 --> 03:58:18.860]  It boosts women.
[03:58:18.860 --> 03:58:19.860]  It works great.
[03:58:19.860 --> 03:58:21.380]  But women like pink labels.
[03:58:21.380 --> 03:58:23.300]  Men like different color labels.
[03:58:23.300 --> 03:58:25.340]  So it works for men as well.
[03:58:25.340 --> 03:58:26.380]  It's the same formula.
[03:58:26.380 --> 03:58:28.540]  It's an incredible formula, and it funds our operation.
[03:58:28.540 --> 03:58:31.980]  And here's another important part of the overall information.

[03:58:47.380 --> 03:58:53.660]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:58:53.660 --> 03:58:54.660]  the atmosphere.
[03:58:54.660 --> 03:58:57.500]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:58:57.500 --> 03:59:03.940]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:59:03.940 --> 03:59:06.100]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:59:06.100 --> 03:59:08.380]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
