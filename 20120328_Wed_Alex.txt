[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:30.800]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome we're at the midway
[00:30.800 --> 00:34.700]  point in this week's global transmission against tyranny it is
[00:34.700 --> 00:41.160]  Wednesday the 28th day of March 2012 we're gonna be live here for the next
[00:41.160 --> 00:47.040]  three hours Lord willing wow what a big broadcast lined up today I've got
[00:47.040 --> 00:50.360]  Hutari militia acquitted doesn't mean they're gonna be getting out of jail
[00:50.360 --> 00:58.160]  dovetailing with Italian newspaper the supposed Jewish school shooting Patsy
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.760]  worked for French intelligence as if I needed to have a newspaper tell me that
[01:02.760 --> 01:08.640]  all the airmarks through there and now the even the French news is saying
[01:08.640 --> 01:13.040]  government knew and may have been involved and that he didn't shoot the
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.560]  video of the shooting that was magically given to Al Jazeera no French
[01:17.560 --> 01:21.520]  intelligence did that or Israeli intelligence but generally the French
[01:21.520 --> 01:24.680]  will only do something if they're running it they're well known for being
[01:24.680 --> 01:32.640]  very territorial in their crimes this is perfect for Sarkozy's re-election la
[01:32.640 --> 01:40.600]  pin was of course ahead of him and so instead of just arresting or making up
[01:40.600 --> 01:44.600]  some prostitution rape charges like they did on Dominique Strauss-Kahn who was
[01:44.600 --> 01:48.240]  way ahead in the polls by the way that would turn out all that was fake but
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.080]  they've re-indicted him again on some garbage pimping they're calling it
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.400]  because he had leased letter in the room even though she was a maid so the
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.960]  whole thing is a setup well didn't look like we know the whole things a setup
[01:59.960 --> 02:05.080]  but the question is how deep does it go so we've got that report and those two
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.760]  go together also our report that we put out last night is up on the drudge
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.960]  report fear of radiation treated a psychiatric disorder but the newspapers
[02:14.960 --> 02:21.840]  in Japan we've got links to them here out of the Irish examiner are reporting
[02:21.840 --> 02:27.800]  reactor radiation fatally high radiation sickness people dying but you don't get
[02:27.800 --> 02:32.200]  medical treatment and you don't get a compensation from Tokyo electric power
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.920]  they just tell you're mentally ill kind of like our trips they're ordered to
[02:35.920 --> 02:41.360]  blow up chemistry a full of us and European sold nerve gas there's a big
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.280]  mushroom cloud it rains down radiation detectors go off and collate in Iraq the
[02:46.280 --> 02:51.240]  chemical tape turns black with the stripes on it they tell them that's a
[02:51.240 --> 02:57.680]  false alarm no need to put on the hazmat gear by the way enjoy your brain
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.880]  stem rotting when you go in to get some medical treatment we're gonna tell you
[03:04.880 --> 03:08.560]  mentally ill give you some prozac and take your second amendment away but
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.000]  it doesn't stop there when you die you sign that form to have part of your
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.120]  paycheck taken out all those years in the military so your wife or your
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.080]  husband your widow a widow or gets that money the insurance company is going to
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.280]  keep it they signed a secret agreement with the Department of Defense in 1999
[03:25.280 --> 03:33.400]  to take your money because good people run the federal government there is no
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.720]  federal government it's a hijacked criminal conduit for offshore banks to
[03:37.720 --> 03:44.040]  absolutely rape this country 5,000 ways from Sunday and I get a little cynical
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.280]  a little angry about it but what am I supposed to do I'm out here risking my
[03:48.280 --> 03:53.240]  life my name my treasure I have to face all sorts of stuff every day I don't
[03:53.240 --> 03:57.080]  even talk about on air I know how real the New World Order is because they've
[03:57.080 --> 04:01.360]  tried to buy me off they threaten me they physically attacked me I my life
[04:01.360 --> 04:08.200]  has been like a movie the whole thing beyond fiction beyond reality is
[04:08.200 --> 04:13.400]  stranger than fiction and so no one would believe any of it no one would
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.360]  believe that they take the baby parts and put them in cosmetics not in China as
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.720]  they've done for 20 years but now the US doesn't of course it's all admitted
[04:21.720 --> 04:27.960]  who would believe that PepsiCo products have fetal parts in them or the
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.640]  vaccines and I saw that last year about PepsiCo and the fetal tissue I didn't
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.680]  even believe it and I went and read the federal court case and PepsiCo admits it
[04:36.680 --> 04:40.600]  and it's blocked release of it even with their shareholders the details of
[04:40.600 --> 04:47.880]  exactly the flavor secret I mean well when I can't even believe it and it's

[08:14.800 --> 08:24.120]  it is Wednesday the 28th day of March 2012 if you're joining us listening on
[08:24.120 --> 08:31.440]  XM channel 166 lasting on over 100 AM and FM of wonderful affiliates number one
[08:31.440 --> 08:36.480]  on the talk radio podcast and audio streams info wars dot com and streaming
[08:36.480 --> 08:40.720]  video at prisonplanet.tv okay here's what's coming up today that I'm
[08:40.720 --> 08:44.240]  getting into a boil down to the news and then I'll get into the first story and
[08:44.240 --> 08:51.360]  spend all day on that but all of it's at info wars dot com Bob Fletcher it's
[08:51.360 --> 08:56.000]  one of those guests that you always want to get on and then for some reason it
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.240]  falls through the cracks when I was watching access TV in 1993 1994 and
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.520]  watching locals talking about the New World Order and videotapes being mailed
[09:08.520 --> 09:11.800]  into town from different access facilities around the country with other
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.520]  investigative reporters grassroots level fighting tyranny agenda 21 New World
[09:17.520 --> 09:23.760]  Order everything it's incredible how accurate all those folks were I remember
[09:23.760 --> 09:30.200]  seeing people airing Bob Fletcher videos that were just Bob Fletcher sitting
[09:30.200 --> 09:33.840]  there in front of a map explaining they're releasing aluminum to oxide
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.520]  barium salts alter the atmosphere they're they're they're gonna hand the
[09:38.520 --> 09:41.880]  Panama Canal over to the communist Chinese then they'll break things into
[09:41.880 --> 09:48.120]  these regions he's the first person I heard talk about how there was an
[09:48.120 --> 09:53.440]  ongoing weather manipulation thing and then the last decade or so hardly ever
[09:53.440 --> 09:55.600]  hear of Bob Fletcher even though he's doing important work and I thought about
[09:55.600 --> 09:59.700]  Bob Fletcher the other day and I went to his website and I sent it to my
[09:59.700 --> 10:02.960]  producer because I know I've done it with past producers that get Bob Fletcher on
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.840]  and for some reason falls through the cracks well guess what within hours he
[10:06.840 --> 10:12.280]  responded he's a businessman investigator you name it and he's on the
[10:12.280 --> 10:18.600]  show for his maiden visit with us and he's one of those guys who's just been
[10:18.600 --> 10:25.440]  dead on and is frankly little known by new generations of people that are
[10:25.440 --> 10:31.880]  awake I never hear about Bob Fletcher and he's just so dead on and taught me so
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.360]  much because locals a lot of them I don't even know their names a lot of
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.240]  people would just quietly go down there well actually do know a few of their
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.240]  names but they never wanted to be known and they would just put videos on I
[10:45.240 --> 10:51.760]  mean I remember what finally got me up off my hind end was I'd seen Waco take
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.240]  place I was trying to intern in radio I was trying to take RTF it was worthless
[10:56.240 --> 11:04.200]  at the college teaching me nothing I was already just separately able to get a
[11:04.200 --> 11:11.800]  few voiceover jobs just by trying and doing copying commercials I'd heard on
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.320]  my cousin's sound system and then mailing into different radio stations I've got a
[11:16.320 --> 11:29.400]  few voiceover jobs and I was watching access TV one week after Oklahoma City
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.840]  and they were airing the local newscast here in Austin that they had taped and
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.160]  and the network of Patriots had mailed down from Oklahoma City to Austin and I
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.960]  was watching the police remove the bombs the governor say they were bombs I was
[11:43.960 --> 11:47.960]  then watching the newscast weeks later being threatened being told to shut up I
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.480]  was watching all of this at the feds had been there the day before and been caught
[11:52.480 --> 11:59.160]  lying about it and I said that's it I've got to go do an access TV show and the
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.560]  reason the start of the show I tell that story and digress for the news is just
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.200]  an example of how people who just wanted to tell the truth and didn't even want to
[12:08.200 --> 12:17.840]  be in the media were airing these tapes and then somebody like myself ripples in
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.040]  the water that information hit activated me because I was already historically
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.800]  awake and knew what governments had done in the past because I was into the
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.040]  history I wasn't really reading a lot of fiction I was into history and so I knew
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.400]  this stuff had happened before so I recognized it instantly and I was
[12:35.400 --> 12:39.360]  already trying to get on talk radio and stuff you know I was like 20 years old
[12:39.360 --> 12:45.120]  I did by 21 because I wanted to defend the Second Amendment I knew they were
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.560]  taking people's property in Austin and other areas for fake environmental
[12:48.560 --> 12:52.880]  reasons I wanted to fight that again more of a mainline conservative
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.400]  constitutionalist type but then I was seeing the branch Davidians interviewed
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.960]  by Mike Hansen and Jeff Davis in 94 95 and they were talking about how they were
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.200]  shooting the kids in there the the the feds and telling them come out and
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.600]  shooting them when they were trying to come out with their hands up and I was
[13:12.600 --> 13:16.960]  seeing flare footage aired on access that had never been seen anywhere that
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.720]  had been leaked out and then later of course it was released to Congress it
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.040]  was on the news of the military shooting the people and the news said well you're
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.280]  not seeing what you think you're seeing even though it was the troops behind the
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.440]  tanks with their machine guns infantry shooting people trying to run out
[13:32.440 --> 13:38.480]  Christmas tree flashes you know it was all there looks like Christmas trees
[13:38.480 --> 13:44.320]  coming off you know the jagged shape at the barrel in with a flare flash it
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.760]  looks like the the the trunk of the Christmas tree at the base and it comes
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.880]  out and then it jagged edge like a Christmas tree and you see the troops
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.400]  piling out you see him moving in with the tanks as cover shooting the people
[13:57.400 --> 14:02.920]  you see people coming out being shot you see the tanks running over their
[14:02.920 --> 14:07.560]  bodies and I was seeing all this and then watching the news called people
[14:07.560 --> 14:11.880]  conspiracy theorists that said that's what this footage showed and then I saw
[14:11.880 --> 14:18.520]  the shows getting generals on via the telephone retired generals like Parton
[14:18.520 --> 14:23.920]  saying no that's an infantry maneuver and then I saw people dig up footage of
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.800]  FLIR footage in other wars desert storm that had just happened a few years
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.320]  before and watching the Christmas tree flashes and the troops and I was like
[14:32.320 --> 14:35.920]  wow the government really murdered those people and the media is lying to
[14:35.920 --> 14:38.240]  everybody
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.840]  and here we are all these years later and the world government's out in the open
[14:45.840 --> 14:48.080]  the foreign banks are robbing everybody
[14:48.080 --> 14:54.960]  corezines robbing everybody publicly george soros is robbing everyone publicly
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.280]  media matters is now going after the drudge report that drudge and those guys
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.520]  better watch out because I mean there the media matters is a vicious group
[15:05.520 --> 15:08.720]  they're not just a bunch of liberals prancing around you know trying to shut
[15:08.720 --> 15:12.640]  down media they are dangerous
[15:12.640 --> 15:18.600]  as their memos show now they want to infiltrate groups private investigators
[15:18.600 --> 15:22.600]  all of it I've got my suspicions about who's been doing stuff here locally that
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.440]  I won't even get into but that's in the news they were forced to apologize though
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.000]  because they got caught with their pants down I'm gonna get into that heaven
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.200]  help us they can criminal conviction of soros has been upheld in France that's
[15:37.200 --> 15:43.120]  the second such upheld got an article about that at info wars calm
[15:43.120 --> 15:48.080]  soros criminal convictions exposes human rights scam
[15:50.720 --> 15:53.600]  that's just some of what we're going to cover here today let me just now
[15:53.600 --> 16:00.000]  mention what we've got here in the stack mysterious booms return to clintonville
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.080]  and they're louder this time I'm about to send reporters to clintonville
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.920]  the problem is I've got reporters in Arizona right now I'll just leave it at
[16:07.920 --> 16:10.400]  that I've only got one more group of people I
[16:10.400 --> 16:13.680]  could send and then I won't have but two people around the TV show so that's
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.040]  why we're about to hire a couple more reporters and some more video editors and
[16:17.040 --> 16:20.720]  graphics people we're looking at the funds we think we have it
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.000]  thanks to your support because I've just got to get a bit bigger reporter team
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.440]  and you're going to see more field action
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.840]  Goldberg's coming up I'm looking at attending this year that is covering it
[16:31.840 --> 16:35.360]  um attending the protest

[16:43.680 --> 16:47.600]  Osama bin Laden's death the CIA and administration stonewall
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.280]  request to even say that there's reports that are classified they just say
[16:51.280 --> 16:53.760]  there is no record period even in classification
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.040]  yeah because there's no record of the Easter Bunny existing either
[16:57.040 --> 17:02.160]  continuing they've shifted in the last week from
[17:02.160 --> 17:04.720]  getting everybody ready for the health care law
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.400]  because if you don't know the Supreme Court's controlled like a Don King
[17:08.400 --> 17:14.000]  boxing match you're naive but the Supreme Court
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.800]  they were saying in the last week was set to rule that socialist health care
[17:18.800 --> 17:23.440]  is culture really fascist health care they call it
[17:23.440 --> 17:27.920]  social self-care it's even worse than social self-care
[17:27.920 --> 17:30.720]  and I'm gonna be getting into that but now they're saying it looks like that
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.000]  it's going to get shot down don't hold your breath but let's pray and cross
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.720]  our fingers and wish on a lucky star there
[17:38.720 --> 17:42.800]  but Ron Paul is usually right he's got better sources than we do and he says
[17:42.800 --> 17:46.240]  looks like it's probably going to be ruled that it's constitutional
[17:46.240 --> 17:48.720]  and he said that back when folks thought it was going to be shot down in
[17:48.720 --> 17:51.280]  Congress he said months before no they got the votes
[17:51.280 --> 17:56.400]  it's going to pass and he's right about 95% of the time
[17:56.400 --> 17:59.520]  I hope this is the 5% where Paul is wrong
[17:59.520 --> 18:06.640]  I really really really really do I told you he was playing possum because it
[18:06.640 --> 18:10.640]  was to take air out of all the states suing and power plants pointing out
[18:10.640 --> 18:13.280]  corruption just like Obama said I'm not going to sign
[18:13.280 --> 18:16.480]  the NDAA to kill opposition oh let it pass he's not going to sign
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.560]  that I told you he would sign it probably late on one weekend evening
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.080]  he did it last day of the year in the evening New Year's Eve
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.120]  a little present a little sneak attack that's what criminals do they
[18:27.120 --> 18:30.880]  they attack in the dark they strike when you're not looking
[18:30.880 --> 18:36.480]  wolves come in the dark same thing I told you it is not a victory
[18:36.480 --> 18:39.840]  six months ago when he said okay no carbon taxes
[18:39.840 --> 18:43.120]  because Congress was threatening to pass a law saying he couldn't do it
[18:43.120 --> 18:47.200]  and blocking his out of control executive power grabs I said it's pure
[18:47.200 --> 18:50.000]  possum they've already got the older regulations
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.360]  he's instituted about by fiat already shutting down new ones being open like in
[18:55.360 --> 18:59.200]  Corpus Christi a three billion dollar facility
[18:59.200 --> 19:02.480]  so we got a buyer power from Mexico now here in Texas in many cases
[19:02.480 --> 19:06.320]  and they're starting to have blackouts I told you
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.360]  he'd be back and he'd start shutting the new power plants down and old ones
[19:11.360 --> 19:15.680]  well he is back and he's doing it by fiat
[19:15.680 --> 19:18.880]  as we told you they would
[19:18.880 --> 19:23.520]  and again why do they do that why did they say this is not an assault come
[19:23.520 --> 19:28.080]  out with your hands up at Waco it's a standard military attack procedure
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.120]  because even if it only works on five percent of the trenches
[19:31.120 --> 19:34.960]  you're rolling up in tanks in an infantry attack you got bull horns
[19:34.960 --> 19:38.720]  blasting this is not an assault put your hands up with friends
[19:38.720 --> 19:42.320]  and as your hands go up you jump in and shoot them and bayonet them
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.000]  and they found that a certain percentage will just hands up
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.200]  the Davidians came out with their hands up they were mowed down
[19:49.200 --> 19:54.000]  same thing Obama says okay cease fire I'm your friend
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.440]  rolls forward with the attack it's all military attack
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.040]  it's all military mind we'll be right back stay with us
[20:01.040 --> 20:04.480]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating
[20:04.480 --> 20:07.680]  I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working
[20:07.680 --> 20:11.520]  my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as
[20:11.520 --> 20:16.480]  key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.760]  was eating previously and be satisfied now there are

[24:16.960 --> 24:23.680]  who to free. Coney 2012 executive joked about keeping $900,000 donation
[24:23.680 --> 24:27.680]  of a million dollar donation for themselves
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.480]  we've got the mystery booms coming up i want to get some into that we've got a
[24:32.480 --> 24:36.240]  bunch of new Trayvon Martin news there people are even protesting
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.240]  in Austin about it i meant to get to this yesterday there's been new
[24:40.240 --> 24:47.360]  developments i will cover it before this hour is over
[24:47.360 --> 24:50.880]  we've got the news that i want to get into on the government takeover of
[24:50.880 --> 24:54.880]  health care and that ruling where it looked like the media was getting
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.960]  folks ready for the ruling to say it was constitutional now they're saying
[24:58.960 --> 25:01.360]  that it looks like the court will go the other direction
[25:01.360 --> 25:05.520]  wow this is a real nail biter but i'm going to go over
[25:05.520 --> 25:10.560]  some of what the justices are saying there
[25:11.280 --> 25:14.880]  as bad as the supreme court is
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.080]  and the fact that there isn't any difference between the two parties
[25:18.080 --> 25:24.160]  at the at the top levels on average the supreme court conservative
[25:24.160 --> 25:27.600]  justices did rule the second amendments at
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.320]  individual right and they have been ruling better on
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.480]  property rights and things than the democratic appointed ones
[25:36.480 --> 25:39.440]  you see the democrats are like going a hundred miles an hour off the edge of
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.840]  the cliff towards tyranny and packaging is liberal and loving
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.920]  and the republicans are going about 80 miles an hour over the cliff
[25:47.920 --> 25:52.800]  but i've really been analyzing things and
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.280]  i can see how on the surface i was a republican 18 years ago
[25:57.280 --> 26:00.960]  because on the surface it's like oh they're better but that's the loyal
[26:00.960 --> 26:03.760]  opposition but i think the system knows
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.000]  that if they would have said there's no individual right
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.600]  people aren't turning their guns in just like it was the line on the sand in
[26:11.600 --> 26:14.880]  1776 the british were coming in and taking people's private
[26:14.880 --> 26:17.600]  property they were raping people's wives they were
[26:17.600 --> 26:20.960]  engaged in all sorts of corruption and folks were putting up with it but when
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.040]  they came to take the guns it's just like you know what that's it
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.800]  come and take it barrel in first
[26:30.800 --> 26:37.360]  for 20 plus years colonists and people from the united states after that
[26:37.360 --> 26:43.600]  were coming into mexico that was oklahoma texas new mexico other areas
[26:43.600 --> 26:49.120]  and they were getting land grants because they were allowed to own guns
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.560]  and then as soon as santa anna took over and set up a dictatorship and said
[26:52.560 --> 26:55.520]  i'm taking everybody's guns all over mexico there were uprisings all over
[26:55.520 --> 26:58.720]  mexico guatemala had her uprising and broke off over gun
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.480]  confiscation wasn't just up here you're not taught that in the history books
[27:02.480 --> 27:05.200]  there were uprisings in central mexico he put those down
[27:05.200 --> 27:09.360]  there were uprisings in what was central mexico it's northern mexico today
[27:09.360 --> 27:12.640]  everything turns into a history lesson because history is everything those that
[27:12.640 --> 27:15.200]  don't know it or do them to repeat it those that know it
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.360]  have the compass of the future and the present humans act the same over and
[27:19.360 --> 27:22.320]  over again and they told my ancestor santa anna
[27:22.320 --> 27:27.360]  said you're gonna turn all your guns in and my ancestors
[27:27.360 --> 27:34.320]  said no come and take the guns and they did come
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.000]  and the war started and i know the system understands that they've done the
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.480]  psychological actuaries they know they know that's what it is so the supreme
[27:42.480 --> 27:44.960]  court because i'll guarantee you watching them if they would have known
[27:44.960 --> 27:47.920]  people would have gone along with a gun ban a restriction
[27:47.920 --> 27:54.560]  they would have pulled the trigger pun intended but they can't do it because
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.080]  the system knows that's the line in the sand
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.920]  and five million guns are being sold on average every month
[28:03.920 --> 28:10.000]  previous records were a million and a half you see that exponential parabolic
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.320]  armament curve and the surveys are out there people say i don't trust the
[28:14.320 --> 28:20.160]  government i don't trust the president i'm
[28:20.160 --> 28:27.440]  getting ready to defend myself the american people are at death con too
[28:30.400 --> 28:35.120]  and the new world order banker sitting offshore who make 40 to 1 bets and lose
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.720]  and steal private people's money and are so above the law they've gotten away
[28:38.720 --> 28:41.120]  with it
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.880]  they want to march the military and the police up against the american people
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.560]  do you have any idea what the american people will do compared to the afghans
[28:50.560 --> 28:54.720]  or the iraqis or any of these folks i mean do you have any
[28:54.720 --> 28:57.920]  idea that the american people are going to be fighting
[28:57.920 --> 29:07.840]  are the 30 million veterans who do not care about dying one bit
[29:08.240 --> 29:12.240]  the only thing holding back the american people is they don't want to kill
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.720]  police the average american is smart and is like well what does it do if i just go
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.800]  out and start popping police what does it do if i just go open fire on a
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.000]  capital
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.440]  that's why all the elite the bankers are all basically resigning
[29:27.440 --> 29:30.720]  90 plus percent of them and all buying armored redoubts
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.600]  in in in in in in rural areas of the world
[29:35.600 --> 29:43.280]  because they know they know the only so so i'm trying to stop an armed revolt
[29:43.280 --> 29:49.680]  here but i'm telling you it's close it's very close we'll be right back

[31:59.600 --> 32:03.040]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research
[32:03.040 --> 32:06.880]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving
[32:06.880 --> 32:11.120]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[32:11.120 --> 32:14.320]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[32:14.320 --> 32:18.560]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[32:18.560 --> 32:22.880]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[32:22.880 --> 32:26.800]  fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best
[32:26.800 --> 32:30.000]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[32:58.480 --> 33:09.360]  dot com
[33:10.000 --> 33:15.680]  waging war on corruption crashing to the lies and disinformation
[33:15.680 --> 33:20.880]  we're here monday through friday 12 noon to 3 p.m. eastern
[33:20.880 --> 33:24.720]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time
[33:24.720 --> 33:28.400]  and don't forget the info wars dot com nightly news
[33:28.400 --> 33:38.720]  seven o'clock each evening at prisonplanet.tv
[33:40.960 --> 33:45.200]  okay i want to explain something here to everybody of what's happening
[33:45.200 --> 33:51.360]  the globalist play nations groups races religions off against each other
[33:51.360 --> 33:55.360]  in a global scientific system that they call the new world order
[33:55.360 --> 33:58.480]  it's really just the model of the british empire the great game divide and
[33:58.480 --> 34:03.200]  conquer on a wider scale they are establishing global
[34:03.200 --> 34:06.800]  governance global taxation global carbon taxes
[34:06.800 --> 34:10.240]  but the only way these offshore mega banks can do that
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.880]  is by getting the nation states to accept their fiat currency
[34:14.880 --> 34:18.320]  these six mega banks literally issue the currency we pay them
[34:18.320 --> 34:21.760]  to have money when money is only supposed to be a symbol
[34:21.760 --> 34:25.440]  of exchange of goods so you're not just having to go through barter
[34:25.440 --> 34:30.160]  but you can have the marketplace work better
[34:30.160 --> 34:34.480]  but when money itself becomes the energy source
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.320]  it allows these elites to basically have a spinning wheel that produces gold
[34:40.320 --> 34:43.680]  and it's not going to be long until they take over the society
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.080]  it's so simple a bunch of ken lay bernie made-off types
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.680]  literally run things that's what corezine is just even bigger
[34:53.680 --> 34:58.400]  that's what the Rothschilds Rockefellers George Soros it's all coming out in
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.400]  court the Rothschilds sued a major newspaper saying we're not kingpins
[35:04.400 --> 35:08.000]  we don't have front companies we're not controlling russian oligarchs
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  and it all came out in court even though they had the power the judge
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.200]  didn't go along with the globalist control but i wonder what they're going to do to him
[35:17.200 --> 35:22.080]  and said you lied to me Rothschilds this is all true
[35:24.960 --> 35:28.720]  and now a judge twice in a row two different federal judges
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.200]  have said the hatari thing is all made up released this so-called
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.200]  group that was going to wage war against the government
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.880]  same deal again i told you it was french
[35:42.880 --> 35:46.640]  intelligence two days into it with the french shooting
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.800]  because it had all the earmarks it's always the same
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.280]  if i'm out by the lake and see a snake swimming along i don't know it's a snake
[35:55.280 --> 36:08.160]  i've seen snakes in the water a hundred times or more
[36:08.160 --> 36:12.240]  i mean it's really simple
[36:12.240 --> 36:15.120]  what's going on here i'm going to go over that and tie
[36:15.120 --> 36:19.200]  the french shooting with the hatari militia
[36:19.200 --> 36:22.560]  with trayvon martin i'm going to do that right now
[36:22.560 --> 36:29.600]  to show you how the social engineers are manipulating
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.200]  daily mail michigan militia are cleared applauding to overthrow government
[36:33.200 --> 36:37.440]  despite massive undercover fbi operation
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.200]  judge rules that offensive remarks did not amount to a conspiracy
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.800]  against the government clears the group applauding to kill
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.600]  a police officer only a few gun charges remain against militia leader
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.640]  and his son but they always do the gun charges
[36:52.640 --> 36:55.760]  this happened with the branch divisions they were found not guilty of the
[36:55.760 --> 36:58.320]  conspiracy to kill federal agents all of it
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.960]  but then they found them guilty of using guns in the commission of a crime
[37:02.960 --> 37:05.680]  even though they were found not guilty of the crime
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.040]  and the supreme court ordered that the branch divisions released
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.760]  the justice department didn't do it for six years
[37:13.760 --> 37:18.480]  i covered that case i went and bullhorned walter smith who heard the
[37:18.480 --> 37:22.560]  criminal trial and the civil which is supposed to recuse himself
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.640]  i went and bullhorned him i got phone calls and was told to stop doing it
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.720]  and to stop talking about it and next i had four guys in a parking lot
[37:30.720 --> 37:33.600]  physically attacked me telling me to shut up
[37:33.600 --> 37:37.120]  do you think they wanted me on that case
[37:37.680 --> 37:42.560]  the feds were scared of that they were scared of the fact that smith
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.760]  was engaging in judicial misconduct on a grand scale
[37:45.760 --> 37:51.040]  just like alayna kagan under u.s. code she helped write a solicitor general and
[37:51.040 --> 37:54.560]  lobbied the congress in interrogatories for the takeover
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.720]  obama care she is now sitting in judgment
[37:58.720 --> 38:05.360]  of her legislation totally illegal this is going to take over trillions of
[38:05.360 --> 38:08.960]  dollars a year of our economy and you've got this
[38:08.960 --> 38:16.400]  this creature this fraud sota mayor has been caught ruling on cases that she
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.200]  ruled on previously the case of the firefighters
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.160]  they don't care just like obama launches wars and says he doesn't need
[38:26.160 --> 38:28.800]  us approval congressional approval he's got the un
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.720]  that's so illegal that's so treasonous the word treason
[38:32.720 --> 38:38.880]  doesn't cover it it's just beyond treason that's why i pull my
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.960]  hair out on there because it's so ridiculously over the top
[38:44.960 --> 38:47.920]  like corezine caught perjuring of course he ordered the
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.080]  two billion bucks transferred of course he stole it of course he's been caught
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.360]  months ago the head of the cme group over it all was in the meetings
[38:55.360 --> 39:00.160]  said corezine ordered it he's been caught now the memos republic he ordered it
[39:00.160 --> 39:03.760]  he's not clapping irons because the justice department is a bunch of crooks
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.280]  that ship guns in a mexico to blame the second amendment
[39:07.280 --> 39:13.360]  they're a bunch of criminals don't you get it we're all in danger
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.720]  all right i'm already digressing listen
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.200]  a couple years ago out of all the hundreds of good militia groups out
[39:25.200 --> 39:27.360]  there it's part of the constitution i support them
[39:27.360 --> 39:30.480]  any militia groups that attack me for saying this you have to look at them
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.040]  for being infiltrated and run by feds because when i explained to
[39:35.040 --> 39:38.400]  militias how to not get infiltrated how to not get set up
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.800]  i always get attacked with a straw man that i'm attacking the institution
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.240]  of the republic's militia based on the swiss or dutch model
[39:46.240 --> 39:51.600]  that i'm totally for totally support anytime i talk about the militia i get
[39:51.600 --> 39:54.720]  attacked by militias and it turns out those militias
[39:54.720 --> 40:01.600]  are infiltrated or run by feds a year before hitari was set up
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.920]  i watched video of members of it dressed up like clowns and saying clownish
[40:05.920 --> 40:09.760]  things and i said that is directly out of central casting
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.520]  that is federally produced like adam gadan the grandson of the head of the
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.520]  adl being the leader of al qaeda
[40:17.520 --> 40:21.200]  uploading the video in the same resolution as the al qaeda bug
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.600]  with the pentagon bug intel center bug i said that's
[40:25.600 --> 40:32.880]  a staged government operative i told you the u.s born
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.800]  you know i had number three in al qaeda and we're all a lock he made the pentagon
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.080]  i mean i told you that before it was in the news that he worked for the pentagon
[40:42.080 --> 40:47.040]  i know scripted bad actors when i see him
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.160]  i know the mo
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.640]  the cia is good at hiring good directors to make propaganda films
[40:54.640 --> 40:58.400]  but they're not good at producing them themselves
[40:58.400 --> 41:04.240]  it looks like a high school play and i saw this in out of hundreds and well
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.400]  now it's thousands of militias i said that hitari is infiltrated
[41:08.400 --> 41:11.440]  and is going to get set up
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.040]  and then of course i got attacked because i had a little close to the bone
[41:17.040 --> 41:21.360]  didn't i this type of precision is not appreciated is it
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.200]  and of course it's not really precision it's like watching laurel and hardy
[41:25.200 --> 41:28.160]  i guess that's compared to the general public though that is precision being
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.240]  able to find my nose i mean it's just plain as the nose on your face
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.400]  one plus one equals two i'm a genius i guess in the land of the blind the one
[41:36.400 --> 41:39.040]  eyed man is king
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.280]  they set him up and i said i'll guarantee you of the dozen or
[41:45.280 --> 41:48.400]  southern arrested multiple members probably the
[41:48.400 --> 41:53.600]  leader or the number two are feds and they'll have to drop part of the case
[41:53.600 --> 41:56.800]  up front to get some of them out but then try to go after some they can trick
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.160]  into confessing to something they haven't done boom that starts
[42:02.160 --> 42:08.000]  because i've watched it hundreds of times now i'm here warning militias
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.040]  if you're meeting secret and somebody's saying let's get ready to fight the
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.920]  government and let's build bombs to test that's a fed
[42:15.920 --> 42:18.960]  99 of the time getting ready to send you to the pin
[42:18.960 --> 42:22.560]  and to put it on the news that you were planning to kill people for propaganda
[42:22.560 --> 42:24.720]  to make police think everybody that's for the second
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.600]  amendments their enemy i said why are you wearing southeast asian
[42:29.600 --> 42:34.000]  camo from the 1960s and going around calling yourself a general or an
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.680]  admiral because you own a bass boat why don't you go wear a suit and tie and
[42:37.680 --> 42:39.760]  declare yourself part of the civil defense
[42:39.760 --> 42:44.480]  militia of the second amendment and try to organize
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.400]  block captains and and be mainstream and be sharp
[42:48.400 --> 42:51.680]  and and and have that's what they're scared of that's why they created fake
[42:51.680 --> 42:54.960]  militias to act clowny on the news so that real
[42:54.960 --> 42:57.840]  military and police and others don't want to join it
[42:57.840 --> 43:01.360]  they're absolutely scared of you doing a militia right
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.680]  and when i talk about this folks i'll be attacked by dozens of groups and that's
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.520]  what you know oh you're a federal operative okay
[43:09.520 --> 43:12.960]  because you know they don't want the actual blueprint they're scared of here
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.600]  this is like stake in the heart of the vampires you're hearing right now
[43:17.600 --> 43:21.360]  and then yeah if you're doing some training then it's got to be camo
[43:21.360 --> 43:26.800]  specific for the area and instead of acting like clowns
[43:27.040 --> 43:32.880]  you know let yourself be a military history and uh shooting club
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.200]  things like that things that the the the the apple seed project getting
[43:37.200 --> 43:41.600]  everybody into the second amendment making it a big tent making it fun
[43:41.600 --> 43:44.720]  not hiding creeping around the good guys aren't
[43:44.720 --> 43:47.920]  hiding and creeping around
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.880]  the good guys aren't the good guys are also running for sheriff
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.640]  to to be the real leader of the county militia
[43:56.640 --> 44:00.240]  the real leaders aren't acting like your secret agents
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.560]  hiding out and it's like kids playing batman and robin because that's what
[44:04.560 --> 44:08.400]  most militias do because that's the meme that the globalist
[44:08.400 --> 44:12.720]  operatives put out first and through tv which you then take on and believe is
[44:12.720 --> 44:15.200]  the model
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.160]  so i told you they would shut down hitari i told you that it was completely
[44:22.160 --> 44:27.040]  fake and then they released the tapes driving to a machine gun shootout
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.920]  event contest the fed is prodding about what
[44:31.920 --> 44:34.320]  do they start arresting people what do they do all this well we'll have to
[44:34.320 --> 44:37.520]  defend ourselves and fight the new world order you know the leader of it who's a
[44:37.520 --> 44:39.840]  good guy
[44:40.720 --> 44:44.720]  the evidence shows and they i mean how many guests do we have on about i hope
[44:44.720 --> 44:47.200]  it doesn't have to go to physical like our forebears
[44:47.200 --> 44:51.680]  sheriff mac ron paul uh the list goes on and on i mean
[44:51.680 --> 44:55.760]  all anyone having a real discussion what do you think the american people are
[44:55.760 --> 44:59.040]  buying five million guns a month for the national survey say
[44:59.040 --> 45:02.240]  they're not getting drug off to the famous center they're not going to the
[45:02.240 --> 45:06.560]  super dome they're not taking inoculations
[45:06.560 --> 45:14.160]  it ain't happening so don't stick your hand in that badger hole
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.560]  we're fighting to not get a civil war going while the scumbag bankers stood
[45:18.560 --> 45:22.000]  offshore how about we just expose the bankers and start arresting them which
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.800]  is beginning that's why they're all resigning literally 90 plus
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.720]  percent the last six months and running to australia new zealand
[45:28.720 --> 45:33.120]  cook islands armored redoubts uh in the virgin islands i mean
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.640]  they're building barbed wire electrified fences with with with 10 man
[45:36.640 --> 45:40.800]  security teams there this is on the news
[45:40.800 --> 45:46.400]  why do you think they're running to paraguay the bushes and others
[45:50.240 --> 45:53.600]  the globalists have committed crimes that are so ridiculous
[45:53.600 --> 45:56.640]  we've started to get the upper hand people know there's a new world order
[45:56.640 --> 46:00.320]  people are buying guns they hate the un they hate carbon taxes
[46:00.320 --> 46:04.960]  all their hoaxes are falling you people can't believe those that we could win
[46:04.960 --> 46:08.160]  they can't believe that america is about winning
[46:08.160 --> 46:11.280]  that's why they jack our food and water with fluoride to damaskown because
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.520]  they're scared of us they know we've got the fighting spirit
[46:15.520 --> 46:18.640]  they know we everybody that came here came here through adversity
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.400]  they know they're afraid of us
[46:23.440 --> 46:26.240]  they're so scared you're going to go to the city council and the police chief
[46:26.240 --> 46:29.760]  and everybody else and sweep away the adl southern primary law center
[46:29.760 --> 46:33.520]  demonization of patriots they know you've got the moral authority they know
[46:33.520 --> 46:36.080]  you've got the strength they know you've got the leadership they know you've
[46:36.080 --> 46:37.920]  got the courage they know you've got it all
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.240]  so they're constantly trying to set up militias always with the same narrative
[46:42.240 --> 46:44.880]  of they're gonna they were training to kill cops
[46:44.880 --> 46:50.400]  nobody's training to kill cops everybody's hoping that the cops are smart
[46:50.400 --> 46:53.200]  enough to not march against the american people
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.360]  everybody's hoping that that we can identify the real enemy together as
[46:57.360 --> 47:00.560]  americans and come together and break this trance
[47:00.560 --> 47:03.920]  and break the neural orders hold over us like neneva did
[47:03.920 --> 47:06.800]  and get a reprieve
[47:07.760 --> 47:11.920]  i'm fighting in the info war i'm making zero preparation
[47:11.920 --> 47:15.840]  for physical because i will sacrifice myself
[47:15.840 --> 47:20.160]  to this system i'm ready to be destroyed i'm ready to be tortured i'm ready to be
[47:20.160 --> 47:23.440]  imprisoned but i am an example and a light in the
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.600]  night to others and that's my job
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.440]  but don't say that paul revere didn't ride
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.760]  all of you are paul revere instead of just waiting and polishing your guns
[47:37.760 --> 47:40.320]  and waiting for somebody to come and you're going to kill the first person
[47:40.320 --> 47:45.200]  that comes don't do that reach out to people now get involved now
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.600]  put a hundred times the energy into the info war that you've put
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.240]  into preparations for physical war
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.880]  and for heaven sakes police if you don't research this info you're insane
[48:00.880 --> 48:04.640]  because the globalists do have on the books a planned civil war
[48:04.640 --> 48:07.200]  that we're there's going to let us kill each other for a couple years it's in
[48:07.200 --> 48:09.920]  the imf world bank documents they've done it in third world countries and then
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.880]  everybody'll beg for martial law after that
[48:14.880 --> 48:19.280]  because of the we do not need to go there this republic can only
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.520]  fall from within heaven's sakes so here it is and
[48:23.520 --> 48:26.720]  i told you they'd set them up i told you it would happen i told you from the
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.280]  affidavits that were later released they didn't do anything
[48:29.280 --> 48:32.800]  they said yeah we may have to have physical you know war with these
[48:32.800 --> 48:35.200]  criminals
[48:36.160 --> 48:39.760]  i mean i've sat on air nobody's giving me a forced inoculation
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.760]  nobody's nobody's taking my kids
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.200]  and i don't say that it's some tough guy either i just as a man have to tell you
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.880]  i'm done negotiating with terrorists i'm done
[48:58.160 --> 49:02.160]  and you know what the american people are done too
[49:02.480 --> 49:08.400]  and the military is is awakening at an explosive rate
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.600]  but again itarii acquitted in federal terrorism craze but they're going to go
[49:11.600 --> 49:16.000]  after him same model firearms offenses the guns aren't illegal
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.480]  they're going to shay their illegals they were in the commission of crime but
[49:18.480 --> 49:21.360]  they've been acquitted to the crime watch them do the same thing that did
[49:21.360 --> 49:24.080]  the dividends
[49:26.320 --> 49:29.040]  all they did was engage in their free speech that's covered under the
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.640]  declaration of independence why did the philadelphia inquirer
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.800]  why did the bbc six months ago say should the declaration of independence
[49:36.800 --> 49:40.480]  be banned is the declaration of independence illegal if you think i'm
[49:40.480 --> 49:45.760]  joking and just tuned in just search that you'll get major newspapers
[49:45.760 --> 49:48.720]  and they said maybe we should ban the declaration of independence
[49:48.720 --> 49:52.080]  it says the people have a right when a government becomes destructive of
[49:52.080 --> 49:57.280]  basic human rights we have a right and a duty to throw it off
[49:58.560 --> 50:01.920]  of course the federal government wants to ban the founding document of the
[50:01.920 --> 50:06.160]  country because you got a right to defend yourself
[50:06.160 --> 50:09.600]  against a tyranny did people have a right to defend themselves against
[50:09.600 --> 50:16.880]  stalin mal hitler polpot fidel castrow you bet they do
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.320]  and and our own media is now attacking the declaration of independence
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.880]  because they're stinking traitor usurper criminals and anybody out there
[50:26.880 --> 50:32.240]  too stupid to not understand now's the time to two sides
[50:32.240 --> 50:35.920]  do you stand with george washington and patrick henry

[53:56.800 --> 54:00.720]  working to keep the world tied together
[54:08.400 --> 54:14.800]  so how do just a few thousand globalists manipulate seven billion people
[54:17.280 --> 54:20.720]  they do it through slick propaganda and manipulation
[54:20.720 --> 54:23.760]  and they do it through the population believing what they're told on the
[54:23.760 --> 54:27.440]  surface so you need the police to think of
[54:27.440 --> 54:32.400]  camouflage wearing gun owner rednecks as terrorist
[54:32.400 --> 54:36.080]  when they're the salt of the earth what do you do you infiltrate the groups get
[54:36.080 --> 54:39.440]  them to say stupid things on the record
[54:39.440 --> 54:43.440]  and you try to set them up and call a terrorism to roll out a new war against
[54:43.440 --> 54:46.320]  the american people and every time the globalists do this
[54:46.320 --> 54:49.200]  because they're disconnected from reality all it does is wake more people
[54:49.200 --> 54:52.160]  up so i told you years ago they would set up a tari
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.760]  i told you that it was a setup that they weren't guilty but they had been
[54:55.760 --> 54:58.960]  foolish and i told you they would probably be
[54:58.960 --> 55:03.120]  a mistrial or they would go after them on gun charges
[55:03.120 --> 55:06.880]  right on all fronts on record and rob do's digging up all the video clips of
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.880]  that for the nightly news tonight in case you missed me predicting all of that
[55:10.880 --> 55:14.480]  now also what i predicted and i want to tell people out there listening
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.120]  you can learn to know all this stuff too maybe the globalist follow handbooks
[55:19.120 --> 55:23.120]  once you learn their tricks you know the playbook
[55:23.120 --> 55:26.640]  sometimes they throw a curveball but that's in the playbook too
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.680]  italian newspaper the reported shooter of the jewish children over in france
[55:31.680 --> 55:35.440]  was french intelligence as said the jerusalem post also confirms that
[55:35.440 --> 55:37.680]  masada was ordered to let him into israel
[55:37.680 --> 55:40.960]  and he was basically french intelligence uh no kidding this guy's going
[55:40.960 --> 55:43.920]  back and forth to afghanistan this guy's being protected
[55:43.920 --> 55:47.120]  his girlfriend said he was talking about violence she went and warned the police
[55:47.120 --> 55:50.400]  nothing was done
[55:50.400 --> 55:56.480]  i mean folks i can hardly travel to europe now because of what i politically do
[55:56.480 --> 55:59.360]  erin's girlfriend couldn't even get into the u.s to see him because they had her
[55:59.360 --> 56:02.960]  in a database no criminal record
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.320]  and they said oh you're with alex jones and ron paul and she's like well no
[56:06.320 --> 56:09.760]  i'm not but i know alex jones ron paul sends you and we're screaming at her
[56:09.760 --> 56:15.200]  this actually happened in chicago but this guy can just run around everywhere
[56:15.200 --> 56:19.920]  he wants the the head of the 77 bombings it came out even on fox news
[56:19.920 --> 56:24.160]  mi6 the underwear bomber got him a plane by the government
[56:24.160 --> 56:28.560]  major assign protected by military intelligence two years
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.520]  this all came out it's the same story and i told you i said they're gonna end up
[56:33.520 --> 56:36.320]  blowing him up inside there he's gonna end up dying
[56:36.320 --> 56:41.840]  just like in the madred bombings of 2003 that it came out in the in the
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.360]  spanish news was staged that was confirmed
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.520]  that actually backfired because the spanish are not that naive
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.920]  got a hand at the folks in spain they didn't buy it and it came out it was
[56:51.920 --> 56:54.320]  staged
[56:54.640 --> 56:59.120]  they just killed some innocent patsy now it's come out
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.840]  and this is in
[57:02.400 --> 57:05.440]  associated press
[57:05.840 --> 57:09.600]  that someone else shot video of him doing the killings of the
[57:09.600 --> 57:12.320]  children of course that's the intelligence ops like the video of the
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.640]  first plane hit in the world trade center and no one says who shot it
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.080]  you think that person would be super famous like zebruder
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.720]  no you don't know who shot it see this is how they operate
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.240]  and it's for sarcosis reelection and got him a big boost
[57:28.240 --> 57:31.680]  now it looks like he'll probably win dominik strauss con got set up by
[57:31.680 --> 57:34.960]  french intelligence on record where the fake hooker that just came into his
[57:34.960 --> 57:37.600]  room as the cleaning lady totally made it up
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.760]  we told you that was fake this is what they're doing
[57:41.760 --> 57:45.680]  and it's the same thing they want us they want law enforcement hating gun
[57:45.680 --> 57:49.520]  owners and conservatives and militias so they stage events to demonize them
[57:49.520 --> 57:52.720]  they want the french people at each other's throats so they stage this
[57:52.720 --> 57:55.920]  confirmed all the earmarks and then you've got the
[57:55.920 --> 57:59.440]  trayvon martin thing they got protest here in austin
[57:59.440 --> 58:03.120]  it's all about hating white people just like the lacrosse thing was a big set up
[58:03.120 --> 58:07.120]  and made up turned out it was all made up it's to get everybody at
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.800]  each other's throats and when i say the trayvon martin thing is a
[58:10.800 --> 58:13.280]  hoax we don't know the truth of what happened
[58:13.280 --> 58:17.440]  the point is the whole media frenzy has manufactured it
[58:17.440 --> 58:20.560]  you know you got tens of millions of blacks aborted in this country
[58:20.560 --> 58:26.160]  all the rest of all the black leaders aren't worried about that one guy
[58:26.160 --> 58:29.760]  and i get the point that walking while black is not illegal like driving while
[58:29.760 --> 58:32.800]  black the point is is that it's all about divide
[58:32.800 --> 58:36.160]  and conquer so the bankers can sit back and manipulate us off against each
[58:36.160 --> 58:43.120]  other learn their moves

[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.320]  and then these ignorant people are like they're like five percent you just got
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.520]  like 96 positive votes on the videos we've done on it
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.320]  they're like oh come on man everything that five percent
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.600]  look i'm sorry i'm informed okay but i'm right and if you haven't gone and read
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.120]  all these uan documents and then you see a movie
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.240]  showing you in living high death what they're going to set up if they're
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.880]  successful
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:42.640]  these people are crazy these people are crazy and i know
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.080]  truestrange is in fiction but it's buck rogers it's 2012
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.920]  i mean the the head of the cia two weeks ago says every appliance that's coming

[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.200]  when you're not aware of it it's a tiny group they're trying to get this grid
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.880]  built look how fast stuff's changing now 10 years ago would you have ever
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.240]  believe the tsa'd be on the highways now and sticking their hands down your

[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.320]  the universe who would have thought hitler would have
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.640]  thought he was god and had ss people at black castles worshiping him who would
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.480]  have thought poll pot would kill everybody who could write and had glasses
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.680]  you know 30 of the country i mean who would have thought
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.680]  kim jong-il would be in a seven-story pleasure palace having asian film stars
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.320]  kidnapped so he could rape him to death in dungeons
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.760]  i mean who would have thought any of this
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.800]  who would have funk it

[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.520]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.280]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.200]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.120]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.240]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.160]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.040]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.160]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.800]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.280]  they are allowing combat trips now to be on serotonin reuptake inhibitors that
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.080]  destroy the normal compulsion control where
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.680]  where people have their normal boundaries and i'll bet you money
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.120]  this pilot was on some serotonin reuptake inhibitor because they are in
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.880]  the psychotropic hallucinogen class most of the time you're having a nice day
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.840]  in la la land but when things go wrong
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.720]  compulsions people just throw babies off balconies

[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.520]  it ends up that people are on the psychotropic suite to look into that
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.200]  with the bales shooting and this situation with the
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.400]  screaming captain going crazy so that's all coming up
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.360]  we're gonna go to bob fletcher here in a moment i don't know why he hadn't been

[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.600]  and i asked him when did you first wake up and he said 1985
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.760]  i mean this is a guy who helped wake me up like so many others but still
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.280]  had never been on the show and i used to watch him you know in the early 90s about
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.520]  weather weapons and think yeah this guy he covers some good stuff but this can't
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.960]  be real turns out he was exactly right
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.560]  we're gonna cover the waterfront with him today and he'll be back hopefully a lot

[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.280]  and uh i'm not going to go over uh his bio on my shelf or even give you his
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.960]  website i want him to do that because i like to have guests on in their maiden
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.160]  visit with us to describe how they woke up and he woke up running right smack
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.240]  dab into the cia i woke up when the police were dealing drugs
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.360]  in the town where i lived and busting people who had them later
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.800]  and then i spoke out they threatened to kill me so
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.560]  that's how i found the rabbit hole bob Fletcher joins us for the balance of
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.600]  the hour bob uh great to have you on with us
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.640]  today tell us about yourself and how you woke up
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.960]  very good and it's my pleasure i uh thanks a lot for having me on
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:30.320]  uh and again it's strange uh you and i missed each other all this time i
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.800]  should it's my fault i should have screamed at you i guess earlier and
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.720]  we could have shared some air time uh as far as how i got started it's
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.240]  absolutely mind boggling and i'm going to really have to abbreviate this
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.360]  i love to tell the whole in-depth story but it takes so long that then it cuts
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.320]  into everything else that we might want to cover
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:59.040]  um i had a toy manufacturing company in Atlanta Georgia
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:06.400]  and this is in the mid 80s 1983 84 85 that period of time
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:12.960]  um i i manufactured puppets and uh unique little baseball hats with the
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.520]  the everybody seen them originally was my one of my ideas and that was a
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.440]  with the funny little animal faces on the front of them and all that stuff
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.080]  uh and basically doing very well we were expanding i had a
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.560]  retail operation and the the toy is extraordinarily
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.200]  my primary product was very very unique and we were selling them
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.680]  uh giant numbers i couldn't even keep up with it
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.440]  and i ran into a guy in new york city at a giant
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:50.080]  marketing and merchandising show and uh as in those those shows where they
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:55.360]  have 35 000 buyers show up at these gigantic
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.880]  exposés and i uh just gathering up business cards of people that uh
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.520]  were interested in buying my product and uh basically i would just gather it up
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.360]  write a little note on the back and put the card down with full intent to get
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.960]  back to them later on when i get back to Atlanta
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.680]  i contact this one number that i look at on the card
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.480]  once i get back to my factory and i look at it and i say well this is
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.320]  this is my address and i looked at it again and i said yes this is my address
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.520]  and then i looked at more carefully and i realized
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.280]  that it was a guy that had a uh an operation
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.200]  um a hundred feet from me in the same um the manufacturing area
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.920]  uh and i could hit it with a stone so wow i thought that was pretty strange
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.000]  anyhow to make that long part of this rather short
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.680]  apparently i had been targeted by this guy uh
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.280]  and i think primarily because the previous five years of my life i had
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.400]  had a uh an international uh marketing company
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:13.520]  and had actually been partners with uh the um uh a uh excuse me the um
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.000]  ambassador actually he was the the consulate general
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.280]  for the country of Liberia and we were doing business with West Africa
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.000]  et cetera et cetera and it was a couple years prior to my toy company
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.360]  so i found out much later that was the reason i was targeted
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.160]  now when i say targeted here's what took place
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.160]  we're um uh i i merged my business with this guy
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:43.360]  he owned two or three companies a gigantic company uh or i say gigantic
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:50.080]  was a large uh a national company where he he sold novelty watches uh to seven
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.200]  eleven stores and things of that sort you know talking
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.520]  hundred thousand dollar at a time uh kind of contracts
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.400]  so that was pretty big and he employed a hundred people with that company
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.840]  so i thought i kind of hit pay dirt all of a sudden i had this business partner
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.080]  with tons of money to do what i needed to do with my toy company
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:19.920]  well the bottom line was this guy was a major covert supplier of weapons
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.320]  for the central intelligence operations worldwide
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:30.960]  and that's his intent with my company and with the other company that he had
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.200]  which was his watch company was using them as
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.160]  covert fronts to be wherever he wanted to be
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.680]  in my case he had a full intention of moving
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.760]  and having myself function as a courier
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.560]  into angola that's where the african connection comes in
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.680]  and uh needless to say it blew me away uh the first couple of months was great
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.320]  the money was flowing this guy was going to do television advertising with my
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.400]  toys and etc etc we were just going to go to the
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.920]  moon with what i was doing however when uh one day
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.680]  uh he said we're going to have some visitors i want you to meet them
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.600]  they turned out to be general heiny adderholt
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:26.160]  and general uh john singlop that people would meet a few years later
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.320]  in the iran contra investigations this guy was
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.080]  hit by the way his name the the covert operatives name
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.240]  is gary best and his company was called vista
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.840]  and vista international usa and uh even changed the name of my company
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:49.760]  to vista uh the long and short how to why did you get out of it
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.760]  well in in short uh eventually after meeting
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.080]  generals and finding out about what was going on or at least finding out
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.120]  partially what was going on like i say he wanted to bring me in to function as
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.880]  an international courier the downside he says
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.240]  was that if you talk to the wrong guy you're going to be killed
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.160]  i thought that was kind of negative compared to the positives
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.600]  obviously you just wanted to sell toys above board
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.560]  in america and and around the world and be a regular toy salesman
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.560]  you didn't want to be a spy absolutely just blew my mind
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.400]  and i mean these guys were coming in and out we were getting telexas at that
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.480]  time there was no email it was telex time back then
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:39.360]  we would get telexas that were coded messages and this fellow gary best would
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.760]  tell me that oh by the way this means one of our guys was just
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.320]  blown away over there and so this operation had fallen down
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.400]  i had come in on telephone conversations where he was selling
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.640]  and putting together contractual agreements for 747 aircraft making as
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.200]  much as 10 million net profit on these now you came into a high level
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.720]  operation high level unbelievably high level
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:13.120]  because i after after finally i just said hey i gotta get out of here
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.960]  the guy owed me a quarter of a million dollars that he hadn't paid me
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:22.320]  uh yet i said pay me up or give my toy company back
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.120]  and he said you're out of here and if you say anything about what you've
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.880]  learned here uh you you're gonna what he did
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.400]  he didn't say anything verbally he reached in his pocket
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.080]  his vest pocket pulled his hand out the shape of a gun
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:44.240]  pointed it towards my forehead and pulled the trigger of the pretend gun
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.120]  wow stay there we gotta go to break you gotta finish the story then we'll

[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.560]  who actually got Charlie seen into quote conspiracies
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.080]  now that's who got Charlie into it and I've met him a lot of few times and
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.480]  hung out with him great guy really smart he was looking at doing a story of
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.760]  Bob Fletcher's life and why I've never had Bob on to
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.880]  now I'm still marveling but I don't want to burn the time up
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.800]  repeating that obviously we'll catch up in the 17 years I haven't had him
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.920]  because he's such an interesting fellow finishing up your story and
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.360]  abbreviating it then we'll get into the weather weapons
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.560]  all the other stuff he started discovering after that since then and
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.400]  what you think of what's happening today with Obama
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.520]  and all of the big developments Bob please continue
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:57.840]  okay yes again a legacy we have to really I kind of compress the the front end of
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:04.320]  this thing in terms of what happened so here I am I'm sitting in my own toy
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.000]  company has now been taken over the contracts have done
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.760]  this guy technically owns it he hasn't paid for me
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.320]  paid for the the agreement yet but and he said we owes me a lot of money
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.480]  the bottom line was these the things that were going on were just so far over
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.160]  my head and I was just uh you know again I had
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.960]  done an awful lot in my life prior to this so I certainly didn't consider
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.600]  myself to be naive uh and uh I mean so much
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.080]  that's another whole story too which included being in the music and record
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.320]  business for many years I was an executive with mca records
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.400]  I was the promotion director that introduced Elton John
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.160]  to the United States of America I was on the road with the who
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.360]  I mean etc etc this was my prior long before I got involved with the
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.880]  my toy manufacturing so uh again I didn't consider myself naive but as
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.200]  everybody else I knew nothing about the
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.760]  unbelievable corruption at the highest levels of our country
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.880]  and I all of a sudden was popped into the middle of it
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:19.040]  now first I thought when I I I just left I mean I I left with a thread on my
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.320]  life I said I'm going to get out of here I said but this guy
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.160]  I'm going after him uh he's fooling with the wrong guy
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.920]  so I get with my lawyer friend uh right away a friend of
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:36.240]  many years and uh a lady and her husband who actually used to work for me
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.480]  and I uh I got with her and I said spelled out this whole thing
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.400]  and she said well this is you know we just go in and file a lawsuit against
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.080]  this guy and and and find out who the heck he is
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:52.960]  well when I went first to and again I have to compress this we're going to run
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.040]  out of time uh I I went to believe it or not I
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.960]  called the CIA okay uh and you can't talk to the CIA
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.040]  they told me that I tried to set up an appointment with somebody
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.120]  I said you were the guys that have to look into this so they that was nothing
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.520]  that went no place at all uh next point I I touch base with the
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:23.200]  ATF with the firearms people I said this guy uh this guy a couple of weeks ago
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.600]  through the brochure on my desk telling me this was something
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.160]  new that we were going to start handling I thought maybe it was going to be a
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.560]  new toy and it was a hellfire missile this guy was
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.800]  selling putting together contractual agreements to supply the hellfire
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.440]  missile to some of the covert operations at that time
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.400]  he was in the middle of the iran contrast stuff he was assisting
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.480]  general john singlough tiny general heini adderholt
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:58.400]  and general richard cccord and believe it or not
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:05.360]  I met in my toy factory bow great when he came back from one of his
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.520]  pow adventures bow came through the factory
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.160]  I met bow and then of course later on bow and I end up speaking together
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.480]  on the same uh platforms the same speaking engagements
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.480]  and here we became close friends and he even ended up performing
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.600]  my wedding ceremony with my uh my present wife anyhow that's another
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:32.880]  whole complex crazy story but the bottom line was I left
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.840]  uh a was unable to get any place would find it out who this guy was
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.480]  you know who he really was nobody obviously no cooperation
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:50.080]  the a year later approximately 1986 87 I see the iran
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.280]  contrast stuff is starting to be investigated
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.360]  senator john carries people investigating and
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.920]  I saw I'm watching the tv and I heard a name or two
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.920]  and I said these are the guys that were in my toy factory
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.760]  so I called up believe or not just called straight in
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:15.200]  dialed in and uh I contacted uh senator john carries office
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:21.360]  and I said um uh I these people that you said you didn't know who they were
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.640]  I know who they are so one thing led to another
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.080]  and I became involved with the iron contra investigations
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:34.480]  I was uh interviewed as a witness and I became a federal sworn witness in the
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:38.960]  christic institutes legal action against all of these

[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.520]  and Bob Fletcher's been doing it since the mid 1980s when he ran
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.440]  smack dab into it you know people that are ignorant who don't look at the info
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:31.120]  they sometimes say are you sure there's a corrupt shadow government which now
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.760]  it's out in the open but are you sure and it's the things I've seen the things
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.960]  I've witnessed oh yes it's real and you know here's
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.280]  Bob Fletcher the same thing I ran contra witness all of this to make a
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.960]  long story short any other points on that then let's get into your journey
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.280]  of then discovering this whole shadow system and where that's led you today
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.640]  and what is number one on your radar right now what some of your new
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.920]  investigations are what you're most concerned about
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.200]  well okay sure this is kind of a yeah like I said the front end of this thing
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.880]  is amazing all the ins and outs and everything which by the way I've done
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.520]  it's finalizing a book now and I'm gonna need to do is get a
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.200]  publisher that may be a trick I need to get somebody to help me out
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.640]  on the publishing side because my book is now finally
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:24.880]  you know down to finished and I'm talking as of maybe two weeks ago
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.920]  the uh and and the rough draft of that is what
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.600]  amalia west of us had looked at and uh and
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.040]  his initial statement was that it was the greatest thing that he had read in
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.560]  five years but he vanished on me uh and I'm not sure I
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:43.760]  think maybe there were some names in the book that
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:49.200]  were maybe close friends to uh to martin she and his father whatever but
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.240]  um I don't know what happened there but dropping that off though we um
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.840]  I started chasing this I realized that these guys were directly involved
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.280]  this is 1987 they were directly involved with the
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.600]  contrast stuff uh I started um uh contacting making
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:12.560]  contacts with the investigators there uh little by little what was happening
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:19.520]  how I am morphed into uh doing all of the investigations I was blown away
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:26.880]  every week as you have been by by finding out uh who these people were
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.560]  and finding out the same guys that did air america
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.400]  during the war way back in the the vietnam war
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.280]  these were the guys that were doing and supplying covert weapons uh they
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:44.560]  considered themselves suppliers of air and what they meant by that was
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.720]  transportation aircraft helicopters and that type of thing
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:55.520]  but in the midst of this of course was uh the supplying of all of the weapons
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:03.040]  that go into all of the little tiny unrecognizable wars that we carry on
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:09.280]  over and over and over again worldwide it's a very small group of guys
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.600]  that are always available the same as there's a small group of
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.760]  assassins that are always available to remove problems from the scene
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.480]  so a telephone call will come in and a guy will pick it up and they'll
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.080]  simply say we've got the problem we got to solve
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.520]  and these guys will go out and eliminate whoever it is
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.240]  that they want to eliminate or they have to give weapons to an area
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.160]  they will call these same specific guys and just say
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:44.240]  we are we're going to start functioning in angola and we're going to start
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.200]  functioning here and functioning there and they set up the necessary secret
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:55.280]  weapons etc and uh i was finding out on a regular basis
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.600]  that the guys that i dealt with yesterday that i was chasing
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.200]  were some of the same guys that i was going to deal with next month
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.040]  and that they were all interrelated and it ended up
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.640]  that all of the investigations that i've done
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:17.680]  in the over the the last 25 30 years um i ended up being
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.960]  physically involved one way or interconnected one way or another with
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.200]  what i was looking into and it was usually it all went back to these same
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.040]  characters that were in bob fletcher's toy company
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.880]  and tell folks what happened to sonny bono sonny's situation was during this
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:42.320]  period again from from the 80s up through the 90s and up to the 2000
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:46.640]  um i was involved with many many inquiries
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.920]  that the senate and the congress were carrying out
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.080]  i dealt with the dot if i sell as it related to
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.320]  the old october surprise inquiries uh i supplied them with material that bar
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:05.280]  brahaniker had given given me after being unable to do anything
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.200]  i was involved with that in inquiry i was involved with it
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:15.360]  i did do a thing on the gf jfk murder because i had gotten some actually
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.160]  footage from a central intelligence agent way back in the 80s
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.080]  what was happening my name was banging around
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.000]  in the corridors of the congress and the senate as somebody
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.520]  that knew this or knew these guys or knew what was going on sure and they
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.640]  wanted to use you as a conduit to put stuff out because they knew you had the
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.840]  courage to do it and and right and yes that's right
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.040]  absolutely and also they were coming to me and saying
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.360]  what do you know about this do any of your people fit this or fit that
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:49.760]  i was even hired by manuel noriega's lawyers
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:56.000]  to do an investigative report for him and what they were looking for was the
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.560]  connections between uh him uh the manuel noriega
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.720]  after he was captured the connections that he had previously had
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.640]  into the white house and and other government levels
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:12.480]  i did do that report i was paid by the lawyers
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:16.240]  but uh they ended up uh actually not doing anything because
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.840]  uh they were also in bed with uh some of the bad guys that
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.000]  that i was reporting on i was asked by our inspector
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.480]  to do a report on the oklahoma bombing because
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.160]  when i testified before the united states senate
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:35.600]  intelligence subcommittee see that's what's crazy i forget to say i've seen
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.720]  you on c span folks now this sounds all of this is
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.080]  true i mean bob i guess in 30 years of fighting
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.040]  tyranny you have seen so much everything everything and just
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.800]  and like i said it went from one to another and they were always
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:56.320]  some kind of an interrelationship it was either with an event tied to an event
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:02.240]  or people that did a and b were doing c and d and then sometimes the people that
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.200]  were actually doing the crime have somebody investigating it
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.160]  because they want to have an investigation and look like they were
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.680]  looking into it so they can spin it and then use it against other people
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.640]  and they're all blackmailing each other i've had high level former famous spies
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.440]  and others tell me generals tell me jones the reason you're alive is
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:25.040]  uh because you know the system in a way finds it entertaining
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.240]  and it's almost a way that everything's just fleshed out so
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.600]  they can look at it from different perspectives but there's so many
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.720]  different camps involved no one wants to kill you because you're so well known
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:40.240]  then that can be used to be blackmail against them
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.160]  so so the way it's been put is there's too much paperwork
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.160]  there's no question about that that's absolutely you're right on with that
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:51.600]  now there have been a couple of attempts one guy one time
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.480]  when i was in middle of the iran contrast things uh et cetera doing
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.560]  exposés relative to that a guy drove a station wagon through my
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.040]  sliding glass doors and and missed killing me by three feet
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:10.160]  in my office that's their favorite way to kill you i was about to say if it's a
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:13.600]  certain case where you've got original data that can get them that's when they
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:17.040]  kill you that's right that is right and there's also
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.880]  different ways to to do it and there's two or three other events but
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.880]  we'll talk about that some other time but on sunny's case
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:30.400]  i had delivered uh as a matter of fact it was related to
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.000]  originally the uh i believe probably
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.600]  one of my journeys to uh washington talking to
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.280]  um some of the donty phycells people doing or or Henry Gonzalez i did things
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.760]  relative to the finances when he was um connected with the investigating some
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.240]  of the financial garbage going on uh he was at congressman out of
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.360]  texas uh anyhow to um the bottom line was somehow
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.800]  we crossed paths i crossed paths in washington
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:05.200]  with one of the guy that ran sunny's offices
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.680]  sunny bono and uh i told him i was working on this major thing
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:18.640]  connecting the cia and drugs now this was after uh the waco
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.560]  events and all of that stuff sunny had become
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.840]  so traumatized when he got up to washington
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.120]  you know again he knew about corruption but
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.640]  he was destroyed when he started finding out
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.880]  how high it went and how deep it went and how
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.160]  extraordinary it was relative to billions and multi millions of dollars
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:45.920]  i'm going from memory but didn't he break down and cry over waco and stuff
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.360]  yes he did i remember watching him on c-span because i was addicted to c-span
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:52.080]  at that time and he was really starting to get in people's
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.520]  faces and you could tell he was freaking out that he was in the middle of a
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.680]  bunch of crooks yes yes he did he actually broke down and
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.920]  cried uh you know you can look at that from two sides
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.600]  um his life and mine were so terribly familiar
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.080]  i did things in the record business that he did in the record business
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.400]  uh he of course became much more famous uh but nonetheless
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.000]  he and i ran down uh mutual railroad lines
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.440]  side by side like you and i but anyhow to get to get back to what took place
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.840]  there so i told them the sunny was looking into
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:35.040]  the narcotics etc and um and of course maxine waters
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:40.320]  was doing her theatrical thing relative to it on the floor of the congress
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:43.840]  screaming and yelling about the connections uh so
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.720]  i at that time now i was in living in los angeles
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.760]  all right this is early 90s um i had moved to la uh and
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.880]  congressman waters offices were right close by i contacted them and i said i'm
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.040]  going to finish this report in a couple of weeks i want to give it to you
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:09.680]  and uh and i said now this names names that you're not going to want to
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:14.960]  talk about you know and uh they said which of course i heard that before
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.720]  they said oh we don't care wherever the chips fall you know in the name of
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.040]  honesty you know and i thought yeah haha on that one so
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.280]  i supplied her with a copy of this her offices
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:33.520]  and i supplied the sunny now sunny took a couple of months in that
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.480]  interim period of time uh waters uh slowed down it was no
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:42.560]  longer screaming and yelling about the narcotics being supplied
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:48.000]  to the streets of america by our um high-level somebody got a message to her
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.240]  because she was on the news before that i remember
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:53.680]  right she was going and confronting the cia director
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:58.400]  mike rupert was uh that was big news then right and mike and i are good
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.000]  friends too by the way but okay so we do um uh so she did nothing
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  as a matter of fact part of that believe it or not something that was missed
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  uh but greenspan alan greenspan visited her walked the streets of her
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:22.080]  backyard in california in southern california and promised her a hundred
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.720]  million if i remember right financial assistance now i don't know where the
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.440]  heck he's supposed to get that assistance but they got an awful
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:35.760]  lot of community assistance exactly in this period of time
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:39.920]  i'm talking within a couple of weeks of what i'm talking with them report
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.680]  and that was the end of her she never complained anymore
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.120]  so not to say that that was directly related but
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.560]  it's very possible for those that don't remember the inner city areas were
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.840]  turned into war zones when the cia started bringing the crack
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.000]  in and there were actual people so drugged out they wouldn't eat or even
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.840]  drink that looked like zombies with all their hair falling out
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.720]  literally because i grew up in dallas and saw a lot of these
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.560]  they look scarier than actual you know fake zombies in movies
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.160]  so so i could see why she was wanting to get the drugs stopped being shipped in
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.680]  but i mean that's like putting a band-aid on a on an axe wound
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.560]  how to say oh here's a hundred million dollars for community stuff
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:21.680]  yeah i think actually she wanted to just get the credit
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.120]  i don't know whether she really had a lot of care for that
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.560]  but uh for that area okay so i supplied my report to sonny and by the way
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.640]  which is one of the ones that i have available at my website and that's the
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.440]  one on uh it's titled uh government excuse me
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  it's titled the cia and drugs uh etc etc i supplied this in a dvd form
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:51.920]  sonny finally got to look at it he got back to me
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:57.840]  i received an advance uh information that sonny had gone over it
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:03.360]  he had freaked out and was moving forward to initiate a congressional
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:08.160]  inquiry based on primarily what i had supplied him with
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:12.080]  and there's specifically a few people that he wanted to go after
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:16.160]  i said great let me know how that happened what's going on with it
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:21.200]  another month went by or whatever and i i received the call
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.480]  right in the middle of december uh and uh i was told
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:32.080]  uh bob sonny has it all set up in three weeks when he comes back from the
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.720]  christmas holidays we're going to begin the inquiry
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.160]  into all these all these characters and everything that's going on
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.840]  we want to make sure you're going to be a witness and that you will assist us
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.560]  to go from there forward i said absolutely i'm in los angeles now
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.000]  but when you need me you let me know and i'll be in washington
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.360]  and let's go and do it and the big deal was
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.680]  that sonny had said that they were going to they had
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:06.080]  set up subpoena powers for the congressional inquiry now this may not
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.200]  mean anything it's just a word to a lot of people
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:14.080]  but the bottom line is that commonly with all of these inquiries
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.320]  that are by congress and senate they're shut down all the time
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.760]  their side steps we are lied to they come in they have experts that come in
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.520]  and sit on the committees they know how to shut up everything
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.160]  well here's an example the tsa ordered congress not to have all these top
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.760]  forensic security experts testify proving their
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.320]  machines are frauds and it's all theater
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.000]  and and they tell that was in the news the other day the tsa
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.160]  tells congress and obama tells congress
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:52.160]  what he can and can't do uh he he tells congress hey we're gonna have a war
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:56.720]  and and you're not over that the un is now yes absolutely they said that
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.760]  the total control thing by this time is just forget about it anybody that
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.720]  thinks you're gonna get anything done you know like the idea of right your
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.680]  congressman give me a break that's almost a comedy routine
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.680]  but let me get to the most upsetting thing in
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.080]  30 years in my life i think was the sunny situation
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.600]  so what happened is he gets my he gets my report
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.800]  they're going to move forward with the subpoenas
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.000]  subpoenas means that they're going to be able to
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.440]  tell these people to answer the questions or do jail time for not answering
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.840]  the questions that's the difference that sunny had set up
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.520]  he was going to be on this new intelligence committee
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:44.720]  it was all everything was set and in place
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:49.920]  and uh so i said great i i wished them all a nice christmas
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:58.240]  and that was it um uh 10 days after i received that telephone call
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:05.520]  sunny bono was murdered on the top of the ski slopes period end of story
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:09.600]  when it happened i mean of course i mean i just
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:13.680]  totally freaked me out because the bottom line is i genuinely feel
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.600]  somewhat responsible for his death because i know
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.800]  the materials i sent him and the phone call i had gotten 10 days earlier
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:29.040]  was was the the last straw for the bad guys they were in a position
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:36.960]  to either stop and actually they had to kill and terminate sunny
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.680]  before he came back which would have been
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:46.960]  about 10 15 days after he he was killed he only they only had 10 15 days left
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.360]  if they hadn't killed him and uh where he was going to move forward with the
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.120]  investigation the investigation would have been started
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.440]  and somebody would have finished it even if he had been killed then
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:02.560]  incredible incredible stand there over a year ago
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.880]  i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good sized meal
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:10.640]  that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.320]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:18.480]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.200]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild

[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:29.040]  we know what's going on and we know that going along with corruption
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:32.320]  might work up front but in the final equation it destroys

[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:18.800]  freaked out in this video so and we talked to their chief investigator we
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:21.360]  got hours of incredible stuff for the nightly news but
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.160]  we've got about 10 minutes of this coming up later towards the end of the
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.960]  third hour i'm trying to digest it during the
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.080]  breaks it's it's powerful
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:34.160]  and the type of censorship and intimidation the sheriffs going through
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.200]  it's amazing uh so that's coming up going back to bob
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.320]  fletcher a bob fletcher investigations dot com finishing up with a sunny
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:42.720]  bonus i'm gonna spend a little bit of time with you and then if you want we'll
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:45.360]  have you back next week of the week after to really get into
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:48.640]  weather weapons everything i originally wanted to get you on with but i remember
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.960]  93 94 watching access tv people putting bob fletcher
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:57.040]  investigation videos on and it was just i'm like this guy's really credible i've
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:00.720]  seen him on c-span testifying to congress but then he's talking about
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.000]  weather weapons that was just too far out for me now it's just all the
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.080]  government's weather modifying but it's secret and it's everything bob exposed
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.800]  so i'm gonna do a whole hour with him on how he knew all that
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.400]  i've been finishing up with sonny bono's murder
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.920]  okay sure enough um and i like i said we end up
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:22.080]  end up running out of time because this whatever we're talking 30 years of
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:27.120]  crazy stuff here um the um so with sonny's case
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.120]  i called sonny's office right away to uh uh my
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:34.880]  my longtime associate up there uh for a few years
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.800]  um and um he would not take my calls
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:42.240]  this is a guy i normally would eat lunch with in washington
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.400]  uh and so this is right afterwards so then i knew
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:49.840]  i was right the worst situation had happened
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.840]  that he had been hit uh so i started chasing it
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:57:00.320]  and uh i had done a a profuse inquiry it took me a long time they were totally
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:06.960]  withholding uh the autopsy reports which which i guess i'm
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.600]  still the only guy that's gotten it um uh there that's the they're holding a
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:14.960]  little bit of it back but the autopsy in reality
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:19.360]  shows that he had done there's no way he could have run into the tree
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.680]  that's all baloney i got the footage of the area that was taken
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:27.920]  only a couple hours after he was found and all the rest of that
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.840]  i did an extensive uh i've done a dvd report which is available at my
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.760]  website also on sonny's murder but the bottom line
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:42.400]  without getting into all the intricacies of it uh there's no question
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.240]  it was impossible for him to go fast enough
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:53.360]  he was 120 feet inside the uh tree line where it was off of the ski run
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.560]  uh he was up actually in the wood what did they do like kazer even then
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.720]  drag him in and beat his brains out or what they do
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:02.400]  you know that part of not positive it's one of two things
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.800]  either they had a deal somehow to to like meet him
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.240]  it's possible somebody told them they were going to give him information
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.240]  for his investigation uh meet him secretly there
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:20.800]  or he was hit someplace else and brought up on a ski sled and then rolled
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.240]  over into the snow and dragged up against the tree
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.560]  but he was pistol whipped on the right side of his head
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:33.040]  probably by a left-handed assassin you know
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:36.800]  well they they said on the news benazar budo hit her head she's on tape being
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:40.800]  machine gunned we'll be right back
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:50.720]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.040]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.920]  even if i had a pretty good sized meal that i was still starving
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:00.960]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:04.240]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:07.840]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.360]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.280]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.640]  healthy i then searched out the best vitamin and

[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:35.600]  i mean this is crazy what's your view in the general world where we're headed
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:40.800]  what the new owner's up to uh well it's going to be interesting because i'm
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:45.520]  i'm not sure they're having to mix uh the crazy stuff that they're
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:51.120]  artificially put on us with some of the real changes of the earth
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:55.440]  so to speak that may put us into a dire emergency
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:59.280]  so between the false stuff that they're applying
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:02.640]  and the real stuff that's coming down from
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.080]  nature uh i don't know if they know what to do
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.760]  but what's really spooky that i have not investigated
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:16.000]  very much is the multitude of gigantic underground facilities
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.120]  that the bad guys have spent our money on
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:25.840]  yes preparing for themselves to have a place to jump and hide
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.560]  when the stuff hits the fan and so uh i don't know it's putting them into a
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:33.120]  little trick bag i don't know what they think they're going to be
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:36.960]  controlling if in fact everything's uh blown up and
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.440]  thrown apart uh above ground all right well the
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.480]  first thing we're going to cover then is weather modification
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.520]  and and deep underground bases which they admit they've built but again that's
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.680]  secret the details are secret uh unbelievable amounts of money there
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:53.360]  what else are we going to cover next week
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:57.040]  well we can talk about of course uh i'll tell you something
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:00.800]  that is some brand new things that nobody's ever even
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.320]  i'm not even talked much about is uh the bombs
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:07.520]  the uh oklahoma you know we have the anniversary coming up in a couple of
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.000]  weeks on the oklahoma bombing and uh i have connections

[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.640]  it's really uh it really freaked me out it's very real
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.160]  about who was involved with uh some of that uh

[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.280]  detonators for c4 plastics for the contras

[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.960]  part of our exclusive interview with sheriff joe arpaio
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:45.040]  with our reporters patrick henningsson and rob jacobson
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:48.480]  they both went there interviewed arpaio i didn't want to talk about it until they
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.760]  gotten back with the footage and there's a bunch of it we
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.640]  they had a long hour long meeting with the chief investigator what zolo
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.360]  he's been up all night they got he got back last night
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.000]  a late last night and jacobson hasn't slept
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.920]  and it's done now so that's coming up strangely enough lindsay who lives out
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:08.640]  there's got was the one that told us about some of this
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:11.600]  info and to go out there but he can't even get into it himself because he's
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.720]  sworn to secrecy arpaio is pretty freaked out
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:17.440]  i mean they really believe that the birth certificate's all fake which of
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:20.880]  course it is and everything else and you can watch the video the police and the
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:24.320]  press conferences they're all pretty scared and they should be in fact i can
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.920]  now say because it's on record because one of their chief
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:31.920]  investigators a private investigators they've got
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:38.080]  dr. Jerome Corsi that he's he's been told by arpaio get security and
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.200]  arpaio has more security and that's breaking news that broke like a week
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.360]  ago and nobody picked it up here on the show
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:46.880]  i think we should do an article about it that arpaio has increased security
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:53.120]  because of the from the white house so we've got that coming up now
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:57.920]  lindsay williams one of his oil company exec sources died about a year ago ken
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:00.960]  from a little more than a year ago he's got the other source out of the source
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:04.240]  his name uh and they lindsay said here about six
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:07.040]  months ago he said now it's going to start going up
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.800]  and then now we have the headlines a 200 dollar a barrel oil
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:15.200]  the national average triple a says is 390 some areas over 450
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:20.640]  it's all starting dollar devaluation now they're finally talking about qe3 a
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:24.000]  little bit later than some people thought lindsay said no it's not going
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.760]  to be till the end of 2012 and of course much of what
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.040]  lindsay said over time has turned out to be frighteningly accurate so no need
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:34.160]  to thank us for anything lindsay just out of the gates give us those bullet
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.600]  points we didn't even get to them all sunday we've got limited time
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:43.120]  you're gracious to join us give us the data dump up front the latest info
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:49.040]  that mr x has given you there is not going to be a financial collapse in
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.000]  april may or june uh you did hear correctly
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.080]  there is going to be one that positively will be a financial collapse it is
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.440]  already planned there were many people who made
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.880]  fortunes during 1929 through 33 during the great depression because they knew
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:09.600]  what was going to happen if you will listen to my
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.600]  elitist friend you can spare yourself major haughty
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:17.440]  now you have time this is a window of opportunity
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.800]  take advantage of it right now when will the financial collapse take place i am
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.680]  going to tell you today right here on the alex jones show also
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:31.440]  my elitist friend has told me why mr obama
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:34.960]  may not be reelected you heard me correctly
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:38.160]  i said he may not i didn't say he wasn't going to be
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:42.240]  i said he may not and it's all because of the keystone pipeline
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:46.720]  and there's so much more involved in that than you ever could have imagined you
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:53.760]  are going to be amazed back in 1966 i bought gasoline for 35 cents a gallon
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:57.520]  at the same time that same year i could go into a bank
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:02.400]  and place a one dollar bill on a counter and get a silver dollar
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:08.640]  one ounce of silver 1979 for the first time gasoline in september that year
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.640]  went to one dollar a gallon and we thought the world was coming apart
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:19.600]  in 2004 in may of that year it went to two dollars a gallon 2005 went to three
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:26.160]  2008 it went to fail in the past two weeks you've seen it go up 19 cents
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:30.880]  it is going to seven and eight dollars mark my words you may as well prepare
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.280]  and get ready for it there are things taking place amongst the elite right
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.920]  now that are so startling if you will take time to do something
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.280]  about it you can prepare and spare yourself
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.520]  major heartache now alex i've got to say congratulations on what you did we
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:52.240]  shared two off bio and i thank you for that you allowed me to give it to one
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:55.680]  of your producers here a while back that you should contact him immediately
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:59.120]  well sure he didn't get into everything he didn't get into all of it but he
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.640]  covered a lot it's coming up we have even more of the chief investigator
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:05.120]  that we're going to get on the nightly news as soon as we can we've got like
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:10.320]  hours of stuff but let me tell you i already found what their investigation
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.760]  found and i just went and looked at it and i said okay here it is let's go
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:18.560]  look at it and i know fake typewriter fonts on computers
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:23.280]  every typewriter strike is original like a fingerprint or a snowflake
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:26.480]  because of how hard you hit the key and what's going on the ribbon
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:30.240]  the it's all fake typewriter the c's are the same
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:34.880]  the b's are the same the the you know the t's are the it's all the same
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:40.960]  it's a fake computer typewriter font it's 100 percent just on that everything
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.040]  else is fake the selective service is fake the social
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.200]  security number is somebody else's the state department said his dad
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.960]  wasn't his dad and kicked him out of the u.s no kidding looks nothing like him
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:57.040]  it his real name is berry sataro they admit that
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.360]  three years ago we were coaxed to talk about it on and on and on it's all fake
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.080]  and uh our pio is uh well we're going to get to the interview but
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:11.040]  let's start getting into i mean did he tell you specifically when the collapse
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:14.240]  of the plant collapse is going to take place
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:19.120]  uh all right we'll go to the collapse first now you positively are going to
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:22.560]  see one about a year ago i was put in touch with a gentleman
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.600]  please write his name down folks i beg of you everyone out there listening
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:28.960]  audience today please get a pencil and piece of paper
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:33.120]  right now and write down some of the facts that my elitist friend have told me
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:36.800]  keep in mind these people are now in their 70s and 80s
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:40.800]  they are concerned about their children one of them has talked with me on a
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.360]  regular basis for the past few days he's concerned about his wife
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:48.880]  and when you get to the place you're facing the graveyard sometimes you say
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:53.120]  things you won't say otherwise i live with these people for three years have
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:56.720]  kept in touch with them over the years and as a result i can
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.560]  honestly say there positively is a group of people on the face of the earth to
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:03.440]  control the world what about the financial collapse
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:06.560]  yes it is going to take place i was put in touch
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.400]  about a year ago with a gentleman by the name of tom flower please go and look
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:13.040]  him up you can talk with him personally if you wish
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:17.760]  he just completed a dvd series with me which he tells his entire story on
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:21.680]  wall street and the corruption that he saw there and i said tom
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.360]  would you be willing to tell your story and he said yes
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:28.960]  well i did mine also and he said and was told and so
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:32.800]  also i was told that it's perfectly together
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:38.480]  when will the collapse take place it is not going to take place during april
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:42.640]  may and june for a reason the elite are intentionally
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:48.960]  creating massive debt in every nation every city every county
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:53.920]  every state all over the world they have not created all of the debt that they
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:57.040]  want to create yet they're creating it for the purpose
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:01.680]  of when they finally do decide to let the collapse take place
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:04.160]  they will have no share let's take for instance greece
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:09.280]  whenever greece they bought their bonds who in the world in their right mind
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:13.360]  would buy any greek paper they know goodwill it's bankrupt there's no way
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:17.200]  that they're going to make their money back but that's what it's all about
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:20.800]  the elite have bought the greek bonds and the greek paper
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:26.160]  but when greece fell the whole financial system did not collapse
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:30.080]  and many people were saying it was going to and i said no it's not going to
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:33.280]  well whenever they do allow it to collapse
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:37.360]  they can merely step in and say greece you have no choice we on your paper we
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.880]  on you we have bought your bonds now you have no choice
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:44.160]  but except now when you currently after all your curses already collapsed
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.520]  but folks that's not only greece do you realize that's going to happen in
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:52.560]  america when we get up to 15 18 20 trillion dollars worth of
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:56.720]  debt and the american dollar has to oh by the way please put it down if you
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.920]  haven't before the dollar will be dead by the end
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:08.000]  of 2012 i did not say it was going to be non-existent it will still be there
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.080]  listen to the words carefully of the elite the dollar will be dead
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:17.120]  by the end of 2012 and whenever they do allow the collapse to take place they
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:20.640]  can step in and say america forget about your constitution your
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.800]  children are crying you're going hungry your dollar is so worthless that you
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:28.000]  take a wheelbarrow load of dollars to the grocery store to buy a local
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.600]  you're saying you're saying that by december it's going to be no longer
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:34.960]  the world reserve currency how long will it take then
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:40.960]  if your source is right for people to really get desperate
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:44.480]  get desperate shortly let me prove to you what please now i'm glad you have
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:48.240]  those pens from some paper by now china and japan
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.240]  two months ago signed the largest trade agreement that's ever been signed on the
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:57.680]  base of the earth in in history and they said we'll sale and trade amongst our
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.000]  sebs america is the number one economy in the
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.960]  world china is number two japan is number three
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:07.040]  and they said we will not use the american dollar
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:11.520]  the petrol dollar the reserve currency of the world for this trade agreement
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:16.000]  we will use other currencies the dollar at that point for all practical
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.680]  purposes the mail was driven into the coffin of the dollar
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:22.240]  two months ago and the average person didn't know it
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.560]  now watch the other two times and you will see the progression
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:30.160]  end toward the end of 2012 the elite have it all planned
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.960]  iran and india as you know the united states of america plays sanctions on
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:38.400]  iran then the european union plays
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:42.800]  sanctions on iran and said you cannot buy any iranian oil
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:46.640]  as off tune the first then the united nations came along
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.080]  do you realize that when we play sanctions on iran the united states of
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:54.160]  america that we basically said you cannot use the petrol
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:59.760]  dollar for the sale of your oil anymore if iran is the third largest supplier of
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:03.840]  oil in the world number one is russia number two
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:10.960]  is uh saudi arabia number three is iran do you realize what this does to iran
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.840]  oh india stepped up and said iran no problem you can't use the petrol dollar
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:20.080]  anymore but we will buy that million barrels
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:23.360]  oil that you're selling to the european union every
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:27.200]  every day we will be more than happy to buy it our economy is growing
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.200]  we need it and oh please you've got to catch this
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:37.280]  and we will pay you in gold oh my god we'll get to that when we come back we

[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:41.600]  the type of currencies are going to be used in the future
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:49.120]  he said you you must get into a certain type of currency immediately
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.360]  alex also need to go back to the america dollar for a moment and also please
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:56.720]  folks the keystone pipeline is so much more important than
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.720]  the average person knows i've got so much stated to try to get it all in
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.280]  you must immediately get into the proper type of currency
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.200]  i hope you're hearing this now there is going to be a financial collapse
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.640]  i'll tell you when it's going to be and i'll tell you exactly how you can know
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.240]  when it's going to be but there were people
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:21.440]  many people made great fortunes in 1929 not everybody stood in a
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.440]  soup line in 1933 and the people who prepared
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.040]  in advance knew that the great financial collapse
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:32.640]  of 1929 the depression was going to take place
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:36.480]  they had no problems whatsoever surviving and made great fortunes in that
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.400]  period of time you can also and you'll remember that before
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:44.800]  mr. farm died we had that conversation i related to this in the archives of your
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.280]  programs alex that they said to me the currency of the elite is
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:53.120]  gold and silver now let me clarify i do not sell gold and silver alex can tell
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.320]  you where to get it you couldn't buy an ounce from me if you tried i'm only
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.440]  telling you what they've told me and don't try to save you
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:03.600]  much heartache he said to me the currency of the elite
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  is gold and silver if you had listened to my elitist friend
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:11.120]  three years ago when i first told that on the alex shown show
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.200]  your money right now would be worth three times what it was at the time that my
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.320]  elitist friend said it to me instead many i'll be
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:22.240]  invested in every other thing imaginable and now you've lost it whether it be the
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:26.880]  stock market to 401k the ira the denars i don't care what it is
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:31.440]  you listen to the elite this time please you need to invest
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:35.840]  in you ready please jot this down you have those pencils and paper ready
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:39.840]  please invest in currency gold and silver
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:44.720]  minted by the united states mint please hear this
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:49.440]  you cannot go and invest in foreign coins you need to invest in gold and
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.240]  silver minted by the united states minted
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:55.600]  why the state of utah just passed a law the other day
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.760]  and it's actually on the books now three states on the tent have done this
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:06.480]  saying that gold and silver minted by the united states mint legal tender
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:10.240]  must be accepted at the grocery store the hardware store and the drug store
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:13.440]  yeah a bunch of states are doing that and i know they say stuff
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:19.040]  pre 1933 that's us is non confiscatable but i mean if they pass a law like that
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:22.160]  again i'm not turning in a little bit of gold and silver i've got i mean they're
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.480]  a bunch of crooks i know my great-granddaddy
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:28.160]  actually my great-grandfather my my grandfather's father owned a car dealership
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:31.120]  in dallas was the first chevy dealership up there
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:34.240]  he didn't turn his gold and he laughed at all people that did
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:37.760]  but uh but i mean your elitist friend is actually implying they're going to
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.600]  confiscate gold he did not say that he said just
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:46.000]  in case that keep in mind the elite don't always get what they want
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.080]  in fact mr. obama just double crossed the elite the other day when he canceled
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:53.200]  out briefly tell folks about the leah keystone
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:59.600]  well first of all get into pre 1933 gold and get into silver of any date
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.600]  according to federal law they cannot confiscate one ounce
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:07.520]  gold which you call silver dollars minted by the united states mint
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:12.320]  on any date 2012 2011 all the way back on silver but
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:16.800]  gold anything prior to pre 1933 cannot be confiscated
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:20.640]  get into it you need to get into the currency immediately that the elite
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:24.080]  have been voted by the time secondly keystone pipeline
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:26.640]  this was so significant you can imagine i think
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:30.560]  think keep come on get your thinking cap on a moment
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:34.480]  mr. obama said i am going to announce on a certain
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:38.320]  date as to what the united states of america will do in relation to the
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:42.320]  keystone pipeline he did not announce it that day this is
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:46.960]  more significant than you can imagine please watch it and then
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:50.560]  two weeks later he announced what he was going to
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:54.320]  do about the keystone pipeline and he said it's not to the advantage of
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:57.360]  americans to do oh what a flowery speech he gave
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:00.640]  why did he say this i went to my elite friend
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:04.640]  i was amazed i mean he was livid you're talking about mad
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:08.240]  i've never heard him so mad in my life now this man's in his 70s
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:12.160]  he he's the one that gives me information so much after mr. prom died
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:17.200]  and he said i will give you his exact words i said why did he cancel out on
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:21.280]  the keystone pipeline i will give you his exact words he said i hope you'll
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.600]  write him down he is a muslim oh my goodness
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:28.880]  that said more than you can imagine i said what do you mean he's a muslim
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:34.000]  mr. obama doubled the elite they are livid at him right now
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.800]  they may not allow him to get reelected he cancelled out on the keystone
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:43.200]  pipeline in favor of his muslim brotherhood brethren

[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:19.360]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key

[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:06.320]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.960]  arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:12.160]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:15.440]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:17.760]  and it's possible that could even happen again

[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:50.000]  I'm really glad you have an old school person like
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.080]  your guest on there because he remembers in 1981 when Bank of America was being
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:59.760]  22 interest and uh anyway what I'd like his reaction to
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:03.520]  is uh what's been going on with the MDAA
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:07.120]  I'm actually running for a political office here and I've incorporated
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:11.120]  your immaterial that I've learned on your program to asset our local law
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:14.240]  enforcement you're proactively look at this and say they're not going to
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:18.240]  enforce this unconstitutional law and nullity well there are a bunch of
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:22.080]  states moving to block it Virginia's passed a law saying police don't
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.520]  put bags over citizens heads and help the feds take them away and if you see the
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:29.440]  feds doing it arrest them so there's like eight states now passing
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.560]  laws or that have passed them great questions thank you for the call
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:38.240]  Lindsey Williams, NDAA, martial law provisions, executive orders, power grabs
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:43.280]  did your former role company head exec give you any intel on that?
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:47.520]  Mr. Prom did before we ever passed away in fact I'll never forget today that the
[02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:50.720]  healthcare bill was supposed to have been put before Congress and with the
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:54.640]  prior to that he knew everything that was in it and he said to me one day when
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:57.280]  we were talking about it I said I understand there's going to be a
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:00.960]  healthcare provision before Congress he said chaplain that is not a
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:03.680]  healthcare bill I said Ken what are you talking about
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.520]  he said that is not a healthcare bill he said that is total control he said
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.720]  that the Patriot Act along with the healthcare bill
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:14.960]  brings about total control to the American people it was hatched up by
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.040]  them no congressman ever read it the president himself did not read it before
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:23.680]  he signed it and it was put before Congress by the elite and the story of
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:27.120]  the inside workings of how they got votes on that
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:30.400]  you are going to be done founded when you hear
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:34.240]  the person who appeared with me on this DVD and secrets of the elite tell the
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:37.360]  story. Wow yeah it is the takeover of the
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.760]  infrastructure thank you so much caller there from Santa Cruz
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:45.120]  we got two affiliates of Santa Cruz you listen to us like that as well

[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:53.440]  hello Alex Lindsey how you doing hi Tommy
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:59.360]  good listen Lindsey put your thinking cap on about 1974
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.840]  you walked into a bar with mr. Fromm and mr. L in Anchorage Alaska
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:10.480]  the Anchorage International where I was a bartender part time wellness service
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:15.120]  uh I said hello to you and mr. Fromm I think it
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:21.840]  introduced you as the tea totaler but beyond that I had met Ken or talked to
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:26.880]  Ken a couple times after after that incident
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:30.720]  and Ken drew me aside one time and told me
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:36.080]  he knew I was in the service and he said never mind the standing armies
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:41.840]  beware of the bankers and this stuck in my mind for the longest time
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:45.120]  I had people from oh that's a good quote I mean
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:48.000]  we've got the Rothschild quote about I don't care who runs the government
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.080]  long as I control the money you know don't worry about standing armies
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:57.920]  it's the bankers wow go ahead exactly drag it I never forgot that and Alex I
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:01.680]  was going to call you earlier on this because Lindsey I thought I'd call you
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.560]  today uh it's uh also some people came in I
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:09.920]  thought they were working on the pipeline this relates to Fletcher
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:14.000]  uh about what are you guys doing I said what are you guys doing up here
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:17.120]  working on the pipeline no we're working we're in the
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.240]  Galkina we're working on a way to control the
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.720]  weather and this is back in 1974 well that's what they do up there in
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:27.520]  Alaska do you remember walking into that bar with
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:34.160]  Mr. L and uh Mr. Fromm there Lindsey I am so glad that you called from Costa
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:37.200]  Rica I want to thank you you know for so many years
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:41.040]  people said Lindsey Williams is not in the world but just a point he really
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:45.600]  didn't know all these people and now of course from Mr. Fromm passed away
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:49.280]  now even Alex and others know I'm glad that you did not mention the name of
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:52.720]  the second gentleman he's still alive he's in his seven as you and I know who
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:55.520]  he is this gentleman is exactly right I remember
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:59.200]  walking into the bar you know ministers can walk into bars they just don't have
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:02.240]  to drink the alcohol I walked in that day and we had a great
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:06.240]  time and I remember it well thank you thank you thank you for adding
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:09.840]  credibility to the fact that I've been telling the truth all these years
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:14.080]  absolutely and I met you at the captain cook athletic club
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:18.400]  briefly shook your hand I was one of the muscle idiots down there in the
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.400]  basement but uh that's another long story
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:28.560]  anyway uh my question Alex and Lindsey I listened to your show on Sunday
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:33.520]  and we're talking about Obama being elected and now he got his money
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:36.880]  and we're talking about the Muslim Brotherhood
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:42.800]  now how how did the elite let that get by them
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.320]  do you follow what I'm telling you they have such control well but do you heard
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:49.840]  Fletcher there's all this constant backstabbing going on
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:54.400]  yeah it's true I know that Alex but I'm just I'm just saying how did it get
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:58.160]  rid of the elite I mean they've elected every president since Canada
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:00.640]  yeah they were going to double cross the Arabs and that's what they were going
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:03.120]  to do was break that deal and it sounds like Obama
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:08.320]  is not doing that I appreciate your call it's a great question
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:12.240]  Lindsey that's a good question okay first of all there was Egypt and
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:14.880]  after Mubarak was deposed in Egypt I went to my
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:19.840]  latest friend who this gentleman is referring to right here on the air and I said
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:24.880]  what in the world is going on he told me everything that the elite were going to
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:28.640]  do for the next few years how that they would go
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:33.120]  right into Libya Qaddafi sent them oh please listen to the dates here Qaddafi
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:36.880]  sent the elite back two to three months because he wouldn't give in as quick as
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:41.040]  they thought he was going to then they came around to Syria
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:45.840]  right now and Assad Assad has set them back another three to four months
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:49.440]  you see the elite only human they think they're God but the only human beings
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:53.120]  and they're not getting what they want as a result they were set back some here
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:57.120]  here and they told me the entire story which Alex you'll remember one year
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:00.320]  ago approximately I produced the series
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:04.640]  the Middle East the rest of the story and told every bit of it because you said
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:07.040]  before that they were going to bring down
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:09.600]  sure sure you said before that they were going to bring down the Middle East though
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.920]  Lindsay we got to jump to another caller thank you caller from Costa Rica
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:18.480]  Marty in Wisconsin quick question for our guests go ahead
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:25.280]  thank you very much for taking my call I live in a small city in Wisconsin
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:30.560]  and I'm looking to purchase a rural property would I would I be better and
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:36.000]  this is a question for both of you guys would I be better off waiting until
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.960]  you know after December or would I be better off doing this now
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:43.680]  well I don't want to give you financial advice because everybody's case is
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:46.160]  different and then even if it's good advice
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:49.920]  something changes that it's bad advice I just think
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:53.680]  you know you should pray about it and do and do your own research and make your
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:57.200]  own decision Lindsay yes all my new DVD series
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:00.320]  secrets of the elite I said to Tom Fowler I said Tom
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.840]  are you willing for people to actually call you personally you will find his
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:07.520]  phone number he's one of the most knowledgeable Wall Street insiders
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:11.280]  you'll ever find if you want to talk to a man who knows it and has the license
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:14.560]  to be able to advise you I'd suggest that you give him a call
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:20.080]  yeah and again make your own decision and keep your own counsel
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:26.320]  as well but again it's a complex issue anything else Marty

[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:18.960]  then we have their head investigator in a longer interview
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:23.120]  and he brought up the fact that in 50 years this is the worst
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.680]  censorship he's ever seen of what he's actually found and put out
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:31.040]  and he also got into the fact this is breaking that regardless of what the
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:35.120]  legislature does with their bill to demand the original real birth certificate
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:36.800]  with proof they're going to go ahead with their
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:40.400]  investigation so his investigation is going to continue regardless of what the
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:44.480]  state does there and more here is that interview
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:47.120]  that Patrick Henningson and Rob Jacobson conducted
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:51.360]  yesterday at the sheriff's office in Maricopa County
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:55.520]  Arizona here it is and full wars dot com exclusive
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:59.280]  what's the significance of this bill today this legislation that's been
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:04.400]  introduced this week well I think it's important it's only common sense
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:10.720]  using a lot to pursue to make sure the person
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.080]  is running is who that person is I don't think it's asking too much
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:19.280]  I believe that our investigation probably
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:25.440]  substantiates the need for this when you look at the evidence that we have a
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:29.520]  crewed in the last six months with our cold case possibly anybody would
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:33.920]  common sense looking at those two documents that we feel are forage
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:38.080]  would say wait a minute you know we better get another system going
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:42.160]  make sure this doesn't happen again so it's only
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:45.120]  common sense but there's a lot of politics involved
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:48.880]  people don't want to even talk about it you can see there's not many people
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:52.400]  that showed up here everybody wants to ignore this
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:56.080]  subject and most of the questions in that
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:00.080]  press conference on march one wasn't about the evidence they didn't want to
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:04.160]  talk about that it's all this has been already
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:08.880]  done you know this is old stuff why don't they talk about the evidence
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:12.480]  nobody's talk about the evidence which is very interesting
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:16.800]  and this seems to be a national blackout on this
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:21.360]  I mean you know whatever I do I make national news
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:27.120]  when I put people in pink underwear boy I always make national news but this one
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:30.640]  they don't want to talk to me sure how's the response been from your
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.320]  constituents in general about those who know about this effort well quite
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:38.080]  frankly I didn't know how would work whether
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:41.680]  they would be against me since everybody else
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:47.840]  seems to avoid the issue but it hasn't been as bad as I thought
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:51.680]  I I don't get many negatives other than these
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:56.080]  Mickey Mouse threats and garbage through blogs but the people
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.360]  that I meet and I meet every day I'm giving speeches
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:02.960]  hundreds of people a day come up for my picture and so on
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:07.680]  but they never say anything bad about what I'm doing on the Obama thing
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:11.280]  act a lot of them like what I'm doing so
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:16.560]  politically it hasn't hurt me but it doesn't matter because I would have
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:21.760]  done it anyway but I'm a little surprised at the support
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:26.720]  on this issue those that are willing to talk about it now all the
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:30.000]  the majority of politicians don't even want to talk about
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.960]  republicans and democrat it's like the plague to talk about this I've never
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:39.040]  seen anything like this and I've been a top federal law enforcement
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:43.280]  official for years and years and I knew about the water gate I've
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:49.920]  been through it all but I never seen this this situation
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:53.680]  what is that censor has arizona got a higher standard
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:57.280]  of vetting is that that's what's really being shown here is arizona that's what
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:00.880]  you'd like you stepped they've stepped up to that's what they want to the
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.080]  other side that's what they want to and I think
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:10.720]  that what I came up with probably is really reiterated the need for this it
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:15.520]  just happens to be in arizona and the tea party came to me
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:20.400]  and asked me to look into it and I gave it to my volunteer posse
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:26.080]  made up of x cops and attorneys and no cost to the
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:30.240]  the taxpayers and they report to me I had 3,000
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:35.360]  posse's happen to have a cold case posse and I told them to look into it I mean
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:39.040]  what's the big deal and uh when they did they
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:43.600]  did a good job in coming up with a lot of evidence
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:47.280]  so what should I do dump it in a waste basket and forget it
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:51.200]  it's incumbent on me when I find suspicious activity
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:54.560]  if I can't handle it give it to other authorities
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:59.600]  that can if they will and not drop it so I'm not dropping this I'm gonna keep
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:02.800]  moving forward all right let me stop you right there we're gonna come back and
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:08.800]  play the rest of this but here's the issue we have inside sources inside the
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:15.360]  sheriff's department that have confirmed that Arpaio is fearing for
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:19.360]  his life from Obama and that Arpaio has a lot more
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:22.480]  information than he's even released the fact that there's probable cause and the
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:25.360]  birth certificate is clearly fake no kidding
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:29.600]  it's a fake typewriter computer font because with a real typewriter
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:32.480]  every strike is original even of the same letter
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:36.160]  because it splats you you hit the button with different force
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:40.720]  it hits the ribbon all that's one issue our pile has even more
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:44.960]  and we can confirm what our other sources have the department said because
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:48.080]  we have Jerome Corsi who's been told by the sheriff's department that they've
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:50.800]  gotten more security because they're worried about the
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:56.240]  White House coming after him you name it and and so this is big news we're
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:51:01.840]  gonna come back with the rest of the interview straight ahead stay with us
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:06.720]  folks Iran and the mid-east nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices

[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:30.960]  news uh David i tonight seven o'clock let's go the rest of this piece with
[02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:35.760]  our pio there in phoenix and not dropping so i'm not dropping this i'm
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:39.920]  going to keep moving forward how good is this team you assembled uh in your
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:44.720]  opinion well they're x cops so uh mike has done a great job
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:48.560]  on this he's living this for 24 hours a day
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:52.400]  and it does just as good if he was full time but he's an x cop
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:58.640]  just doesn't get paid but he has the authority under me under the constitution
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:02.880]  i can swear in private citizens called the posse
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:06.160]  and they have the same coverage as a regular deputy
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:10.480]  they just don't get paid so isn't this great so i can't get all the public to
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.800]  see you're wasting taxpayers money i decided to do this right up the
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:17.040]  back because the media would be after me
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:20.480]  why are you wasting taxpayers money although right now at this point of
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:24.320]  time i could use regular deputies we're talking about two
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:29.760]  possible fraud and forgery case if the if the legislation gets
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:33.200]  killed for whatever reason this week you're still going to continue with your
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:35.920]  efforts and and what do you see where where's it going next
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:39.200]  next step for instance on a federal level or
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:43.840]  so forth oh we're not stopping whether it's past or not past we're going to
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:47.520]  continue doing our job this would just help us a little
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:51.440]  actually this was passed last year the governor vetoed this
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:54.720]  okay so i don't understand and they they made a little
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.760]  milder at this time around so i don't understand why it can't be passed again
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:02.800]  but nobody wants to talk about it probably because i
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:06.880]  stuck my nose in it i'm kind of coming up with evidence
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:10.560]  that there's something wrong you think that would make everybody
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:14.160]  want to do something about it but everybody wants
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:17.840]  keep it as don't talk about it democrats republican
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:21.040]  you name it so what is this a political year
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:25.120]  that everybody's afraid to talk about it or they don't want nothing done about
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:30.480]  it they don't want to face this issue that's sad
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:35.120]  do you think america asks a lot of the countries around the world to uphold a
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:38.400]  certain standard of democracy and transparency in their affairs
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:42.960]  how important is it for us to have that level of transparency and accountability
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:46.000]  and integrity here at home is that is that what this represents i think it's
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:49.680]  very important now i'm just looking at as a law enforcement guy
[02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:52.880]  i'm looking at two crimes i'm not accusing the president
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:57.120]  of violating any law well we're looking at as two
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:02.800]  possible forage government documents if it was you or anybody else everybody
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:05.840]  would be saying how come you're not arresting this guy how come you're not
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:11.520]  doing it just because it's the president it's nobody wants to touch it
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:17.280]  that's sad so as i say we're not accusing the president but we sure know
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:20.800]  somebody's responsible for that selected service
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:24.960]  form and for the birth certificate that he went public and showed
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:32.480]  what confuses me is the amateur type of operations they were performing
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:35.520]  when you look at the birth certificate that's sort of amateur
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:39.600]  and yet everybody says that that's a legitimate birth certificate
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:43.920]  well i'll tell you how to solve this in day one when i launch this
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:49.040]  operation all i said show me the microfiche show the microfiche and it's
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:52.720]  all over where's the microfiche and i said come on
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:58.160]  we got two twins born at the same time so just show us the microfiche
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:02.720]  another thing that's suspicious is i have sometimes i have a conspiracy theory
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:06.480]  is the fact we went to the archives in washington
[02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:10.960]  and looked at all the immigration forms up to
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:18.640]  august 1 1961 and then august 7 but there's a whole week missing
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:24.720]  when he was born now is that another coincidence i can go on and on
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:29.280]  in the eye yet nobody wants to talk about it
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:34.080]  well chair part thank you very much pretty powerful
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:39.760]  and the kenyon records are missing too stolen
