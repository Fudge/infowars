[00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:09.659]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.239]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.742]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:23.662]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:26.923]  It is the 26th day of August 2009.
[00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:29.004]  This is Wednesday.
[00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:30.704]  I am not Alex Jones, I'm Jason Burmiss.
[00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:40.553]  Sitting in for the first hour, Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours with Jerome Corsi, Dr. Tempany, and John Rhys-Davies.
[00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:42.675]  We're going to do a bit of a news blitz here.
[00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:47.759]  I want to thank everybody out there for making my Invisible Empire trailer a success on YouTube.
[00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.743]  Over 25,000 hits in less than 24 hours.
[00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:54.846]  I am hoping we're going to get over 100,000 hits by the weekend.
[00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:55.707]  I don't know if we're going to do it,
[00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:58.666]  I hope you make it happen out there, listeners.
[00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:04.848]  We are streaming live right now over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:09.489]  We're going to be talking about the latest swine flu news, including this headline story.
[00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:13.050]  Residents can get $50 for swine flu shot.
[00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.431]  You see, they're not lining up in droves, so let's offer them money.
[00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:18.751]  Let's offer them an incentive to roll up their sleeve.
[00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.412]  We can't just fear monger.
[00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:22.536]  The general populace.
[00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.198]  Not everybody has kids.
[00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:27.362]  Not everybody has to send their children to government institutions.
[00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:29.185]  We can't get everybody...
[00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.609]  So we'll offer some scratch.
[00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:37.632]  You know, this is just like the program out in Canada where we don't know what we're going to do with the 18 to 30 crowd.
[00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:40.433]  They're not just going to voluntarily walk in and take this shot.
[00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.013]  What do we do?
[00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:42.834]  Hmm.
[00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:44.275]  I've got an idea.
[00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:50.578]  We'll set up mass vaccination centers outside of the bars on the weekends.
[00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:55.140]  That way we can get people who are inebriated to roll up their sleeves unwittingly
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.241]  and take this shot.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.001]  We're good to go.
[00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:49.532]  I don't know.
[00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:16.573]  Now, I've got a whole three minutes in the show and I have not mentioned the death of Ted Kennedy.
[00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:18.674]  Look, I'm no fan.
[00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:27.936]  I know there's going to be some tears on people's pillows that I'm not lavishing Mr. Kennedy, but both of his brothers, they got capped in the head and he shut his mouth.
[00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:33.618]  And I didn't hear a deathbed, oh, we need to reinvestigate, or my brothers were murdered.
[00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:37.319]  I didn't hear him saying, we really need to get to the bottom of this.
[00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.659]  What I saw is somebody
[00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.531]  Who was a cowardly lion of the Senate.
[00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:45.252]  Everybody's like, he's the lion of the Senate, the liberal lion.
[00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:47.452]  These are all the headlines, all the propaganda.
[00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:52.594]  This is gonna be just like when Michael Jackson died, where you're gonna just see Ted Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, Ted Kennedy.
[00:03:52.594 --> 00:04:02.336]  I won't be surprised when you see Ted Kennedy and his funeral on Entertainment Tonight and The Insider, because that's how far we have fallen in this infotainment society.
[00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.277]  Forget about his record!
[00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:04.337]  He didn't do anything!
[00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:07.779]  He was basically a nobody in the Senate.
[00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:08.660]  He had a face.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.201]  He had a name.
[00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:12.582]  Based on his brother's performance.
[00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:15.264]  Based on their bravery.
[00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:17.446]  Based on their outspokenness.
[00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:19.827]  Oh, but Jason, what about Chapaquiddick?
[00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:22.249]  You know, they set him up and he didn't want to get killed.
[00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.591]  Look, somebody shoots my brother in the head?
[00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:26.433]  I'm going out swinging.
[00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:32.879]  I'm not just going to shut my mouth and take a happy life somewhere and just go along with the establishment line.
[00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.600]  You don't ice my family.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.543]  Okay, so Ted Kennedy, hey, good riddance.
[00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.324]  I got no love for you, baby.
[00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:40.225]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:41.166]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:44.389]  We are streaming live over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.512]  Don't forget to check out the trailers for Fall of the Republic and Invisible Empire.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.361]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:03.363]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:04.004]  Well, you should.
[00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:08.829]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:09.630]  That's right.
[00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:18.298]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:19.660]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.801]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:26.985]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:33.889]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.072]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:40.853]  This is real.
[00:05:40.853 --> 00:05:41.913]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:50.476]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:52.837]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:05:52.837 --> 00:05:56.519]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.460]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:06.659]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:14.243]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:20.406]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:22.788]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:22.788 --> 00:06:25.290]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:36.878]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:36.878 --> 00:06:38.560]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.421]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:46.686]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:55.590]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.172]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.172 --> 00:06:58.354]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:04.385]  Being a part of Life Change T has been an exhilarating experience.
[00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:05.906]  I love the testimonies.
[00:07:05.906 --> 00:07:08.507]  Julian New York writes, I love this product.
[00:07:08.507 --> 00:07:09.427]  I feel great.
[00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:10.708]  It worked immediately.
[00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.689]  You can feel the cleansing right away.
[00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.730]  Other products don't work right away like this one does.
[00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.471]  Mrs. Luella from Missouri writes,
[00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.172]  My daughter has lost 27 pounds.
[00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:21.513]  She loves the tea.
[00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:27.517]  And David from Tennessee writes, My wife has a lot of digestive problems and the tea really helps her a lot.
[00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:28.537]  I like it too.
[00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:31.299]  And here's my favorite from CJ in Minnesota.
[00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.640]  He writes, This stuff really works.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.601]  No, I mean it really works.
[00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:38.003]  No, I mean it really works.
[00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:41.264]  Be one of the many testimonies that we receive every month.

[00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:46.788]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:47.528]  Or you can call us.
[00:07:47.848 --> 00:07:49.569]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.309]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:52.710]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.491]  Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours.
[00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:21.841]  International Swine Flu Conference!
[00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:38.087]  Alright, so this happened August 19th and 20th and then the actual workshop where they role-played and set everybody up to get ready for what's coming in one month, two months, three months, four months, because again, this is a three-spot shot flu.
[00:08:38.087 --> 00:08:39.708]  It's not just one wave.
[00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:43.329]  They're already making it clear there's going to be three waves and they kind of have to make it that way.
[00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:48.751]  Because after the initial inoculations, that's when you're actually going to see people get sick.
[00:08:48.751 --> 00:09:01.816]  After the kids take it and they inject them with, you know, live bird flu, live H1N1, which is the pig flu virus, just like they did in the Czech Republic and 13 other countries in February.
[00:09:01.816 --> 00:09:05.778]  Remember, Baxter International sends out, quote-unquote, mixing agents now.
[00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:06.418]  Mixing agents.
[00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:09.136]  I don't know.
[00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:26.945]  Silence.
[00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:32.067]  Then literally less than a month later, the pig flu shows up.
[00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:34.927]  And remember, it came from Mexico at first, and then it's not from Mexico.
[00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:37.268]  It's from Mexico, and then it's not from Mexico.
[00:09:37.268 --> 00:09:38.348]  And we've got all these pigs with it.
[00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:38.688]  Wait, wait!
[00:09:38.688 --> 00:09:41.349]  We can't show you any pigs that actually have it.
[00:09:41.349 --> 00:09:44.670]  And then the first pig that they find is in Canada.
[00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.491]  In Canada, folks!
[00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:47.753]  And how do they explain that?
[00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:52.397]  They go, well, that pig in Canada, he'd been handled by a Mexican migrant worker.
[00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:54.560]  They don't name the Mexican migrant worker.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.722]  They have no evidence whatsoever.
[00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:58.944]  They just said it.
[00:09:58.944 --> 00:10:02.968]  And they hyped up all these deaths in the United States from pig flu.
[00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:07.573]  When you looked at the initial deaths that they were reporting, none of them were from the pig flu virus, okay?
[00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:09.715]  Let's go through the first one.
[00:10:09.715 --> 00:10:17.547]  First one, a two-month-old boy, or I'm sorry, two-year-old boy who had chronic illnesses since he was two months old, okay?
[00:10:17.547 --> 00:10:19.370]  In and out of hospitals all over in Mexico.
[00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.553]  He crosses the Texas border.
[00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:22.354]  He doesn't make it.
[00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.731]  Pig flu killed him.
[00:10:24.731 --> 00:10:25.492]  Total lie.
[00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:26.512]  Total propaganda.
[00:10:26.512 --> 00:10:29.135]  Next person who dies from the pig flu.
[00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:36.561]  Somebody who was in the hospital because she was pregnant since April, since mid-April, had all these other chronic illnesses.
[00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:37.541]  The baby makes it.
[00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.342]  She doesn't.
[00:10:38.342 --> 00:10:39.503]  Pig flu.
[00:10:39.503 --> 00:10:41.705]  The next person who dies from pig flu.
[00:10:42.728 --> 00:10:47.935]  He is a principal out in New York City who had gout and a ton of health issues.
[00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:51.740]  No, he didn't die from gout or his other health issues, his other respiratory illnesses.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.042]  No, pig flu.
[00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.768]  So, I just, I have to go through this because this is not a deadly virus.
[00:10:57.768 --> 00:11:00.570]  Listen, let's say you do get infected with this swine flu.
[00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.031]  Oh no, the swine flu.
[00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:10.878]  I'm sorry, you might have some sniffles, you might need some chicken noodle soup, a couple glasses of Schweppes ginger ale, maybe a little ibuprofen for the pain.
[00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:12.039]  That's about it.
[00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:13.960]  No one's gonna die from this thing.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.043]  Okay, but that doesn't stop them from having these conferences.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.222]  And going over mass fatality management planning.
[00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.663]  Let me repeat that for you.
[00:11:22.663 --> 00:11:24.845]  Mass fatality management planning.
[00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:28.548]  If you're not on PrisonPlanet.tv right now, you really need to be.
[00:11:28.548 --> 00:11:30.029]  So what is this?
[00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:42.518]  Top leaders and key decision makers of major companies representing a broad range of industries will meet with distinguished scientists, public health officials, law enforcers, first responders, and other experts to discuss pandemic prevention, preparedness, response,
[00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:47.800]  And recovery, and this is the first international swine flu summit.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.440]  Who's behind it?
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.761]  Who is behind it, actually?
[00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:51.821]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:11:51.821 --> 00:11:52.902]  W.H.L.
[00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:53.622]  U.N.
[00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:55.562]  controlled propaganda.
[00:11:55.562 --> 00:12:04.686]  The United Nations Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, Alex Therman of the World Health Organization, was the person who headed this up with Dr. Wenning Zhang.
[00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:07.970]  Alright, what will the topics include?
[00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:14.873]  Right at the top of the list, numero uno, mass fatality management planning.
[00:12:14.873 --> 00:12:15.814]  What does that mean?
[00:12:15.814 --> 00:12:20.656]  That means you get sick, you die, we gotta find a way to get rid of your body.
[00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:21.336]  Okay?
[00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:21.977]  You're nothing.
[00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:24.198]  You get no funeral, you get no hurrah,
[00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:30.451]  You are part of the problem you need to be burned up and forgotten about.
[00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:31.472]  That's what this is.
[00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:34.075]  Mass Fatality Management Planning.
[00:12:34.075 --> 00:12:38.179]  And then another one is National Pandemic Influenza Medical Countermeasures.
[00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:46.349]  Now under the concurrent breakout session of the Mass Fatality Management Planning, they have develop and implementing training and exercise programs.
[00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.148]  You have to make the people more docile.
[00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:50.808]  You have to get them acclimated.
[00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:56.410]  You have to get them used to seeing all these dead bodies of their friends, their family, their co-workers, their neighbors.
[00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.270]  Do you understand?
[00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:02.232]  You have to make them aware people are going to die and you've got to help.
[00:13:02.232 --> 00:13:06.174]  Direct Fatality Management Tactical Operations.
[00:13:06.174 --> 00:13:07.834]  What are we going to do with these dead bodies?
[00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:08.714]  We've got to ship them somewhere.
[00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:10.235]  We've got to burn them somewhere.
[00:13:10.235 --> 00:13:13.036]  Maybe these mobile incinerators they're making will help out.
[00:13:13.866 --> 00:13:16.989]  Activate Fatality Management Operations!
[00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:18.771]  So in other words, we're going to need the National Guard involved.
[00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:20.833]  We might need local police involved.
[00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.596]  We might need the UN and NATO involved.
[00:13:23.596 --> 00:13:27.339]  After all, this is an international issue.
[00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:31.083]  Folks, they've openly stated 4.9 billion vaccinations.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.664]  4.9 billion vaccinations for a populace of 6 billion people.
[00:13:41.664 --> 00:13:43.505]  Not many are going to slip through the cracks, okay?
[00:13:44.485 --> 00:13:46.626]  They are actually passing legislation.
[00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.886]  See, they know there's no law.
[00:13:48.886 --> 00:13:53.108]  They know international law, even though they've declared WHO level 6.
[00:13:53.108 --> 00:13:55.769]  Okay, and you have no individual human rights under this.
[00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:59.870]  Okay, I don't have the document off hand, but I know it's somewhere here.
[00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:05.432]  It is the checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning.
[00:14:05.432 --> 00:14:09.753]  And in it, it openly states in subsection 1.5.1 that they will quarantine you.
[00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:17.470]  That they will make makeshift vaccination centers out of other buildings.
[00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.952]  That you have no individual human rights.
[00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:23.512]  That they are suspended.
[00:14:23.512 --> 00:14:25.433]  Now you say, well, we're not under international law.
[00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:32.915]  Well, some people would argue that we are, especially the globalists and the elite and people like Barack Obama and his administration.
[00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:34.076]  But they got another one for you.
[00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:38.958]  You see, if you don't want to go by international law, there's an executive order they can call out.
[00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:39.878]  13-375.
[00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:41.479]  All of a sudden, one year in prison, 250 G's.
[00:14:41.479 --> 00:14:48.702]  That's right, one year in prison, fine $250,000 for not taking the swine flu shot.
[00:14:48.702 --> 00:14:50.922]  What this is for is intimidation.
[00:14:50.922 --> 00:14:52.463]  They're intimidating you into doing it.
[00:14:52.463 --> 00:14:53.884]  Just take the shot, guys.
[00:14:53.884 --> 00:14:59.186]  Listen, you take the shot, no big deal, no prison sentence, no fine, just do it.
[00:14:59.186 --> 00:15:00.086]  It's no big deal.
[00:15:00.086 --> 00:15:01.847]  Now they're trying to do it on local levels.
[00:15:02.793 --> 00:15:08.616]  Where they're going state to state to state and saying that they can find people $1,000 a day.
[00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.837]  So again, they try to do it at the state level.
[00:15:10.837 --> 00:15:12.298]  They are doing it at the federal level.
[00:15:12.298 --> 00:15:13.679]  And then the international level.
[00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.740]  They keep climbing the ladder, but they're really reverse climbing it.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:23.464]  See, they institute the top-down mentality where they say, look at this authority, look at this authority, look at this authority.
[00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:27.406]  And if that authority doesn't work, they fall back on other authority.
[00:15:27.406 --> 00:15:29.427]  Alright, let me continue with this document.
[00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:35.253]  They have to conduct morgue operations and manage anti-mortem data.
[00:15:35.253 --> 00:15:39.115]  Now here's the next section of this conference.
[00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:40.716]  Psychological issues.
[00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:45.299]  What are we going to do with people who are unwilling to follow government orders?
[00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:50.252]  What are we going to do to the people that don't want to be rounded up?
[00:15:50.252 --> 00:15:52.692]  What are we going to do to the people that don't want to be quarantined?
[00:15:52.692 --> 00:15:57.973]  What are we going to do with the people that won't let their children go to school when they become mass vaccination centers?
[00:15:57.973 --> 00:15:59.313]  What do we do with those people?
[00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:03.294]  Well, we enact the Continuity of Government Program!
[00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:04.034]  Continuity of Government?
[00:16:04.034 --> 00:16:04.454]  What's that?
[00:16:04.454 --> 00:16:07.135]  That sounds like a big operation, Jason.
[00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:09.135]  Well, actually, folks, it's the Shadow Government.
[00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.156]  That's right.
[00:16:10.156 --> 00:16:13.276]  The Shadow Government is not just in James Bond movies.
[00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:14.796]  It's not just in action thrillers.
[00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:16.097]  It actually exists.
[00:16:16.097 --> 00:16:17.137]  It's been around for a while now.
[00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:23.677]  It's government name is the Continuity of Government Program.
[00:16:23.677 --> 00:16:24.477]  C-O-G.
[00:16:24.477 --> 00:16:29.481]  And you know we're going to have Peter Dale Scott up in Texas sometime next month.
[00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:31.583]  He's going to be interviewed for my film Invisible Empire.
[00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:34.024]  Again, we're going to play the trailer for that later.
[00:16:34.024 --> 00:16:36.926]  But we're going to be discussing the shadow government and C-O-G.
[00:16:38.354 --> 00:16:38.995]  C.O.G.
[00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:40.436]  was in place on 9-11, folks.
[00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:42.238]  We're not that far away from the anniversary.
[00:16:42.238 --> 00:16:45.722]  I just want you to know there were drills using C.O.G.
[00:16:45.722 --> 00:16:47.804]  operations before the attacks.
[00:16:47.804 --> 00:16:49.185]  And then C.O.G.
[00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:52.909]  was mysteriously on the scene of the Pentagon as it got struck.
[00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:54.791]  And mysteriously, another plane...
[00:16:55.672 --> 00:17:03.197]  That looked government, that looked COG, was on the scene of New York before the second plane struck the World Trade Center.
[00:17:03.197 --> 00:17:04.458]  Very odd!
[00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:07.180]  Part of Global Guardian, this mass Armageddon drill.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.101]  Okay?
[00:17:08.101 --> 00:17:08.942]  So anyway, here we go.
[00:17:08.942 --> 00:17:10.803]  Conduit of government operations.
[00:17:10.803 --> 00:17:19.429]  When H1N1 flu pandemic unfold in the next two or three successive waves of our calendar year, remember two or three successive years, how do we institute this program?
[00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:21.711]  And how do we get the public to go along with it?
[00:17:23.399 --> 00:17:26.421]  So, uh, what are we going to do with the first responders in the fire department?
[00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:32.725]  Well, we're going to figure out how they can effectively undertake mass vaccinations and enforce quarantines.
[00:17:32.725 --> 00:17:33.426]  You see?
[00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:34.747]  Enforce quarantines.
[00:17:34.747 --> 00:17:45.914]  That's why in Paris, Maine, they have these drills with the National Guard dressed up in full riot gear like a police state.
[00:17:45.914 --> 00:17:48.636]  Okay, they're not wearing... Listen, the National Guard's there.
[00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:58.668]  No reason for them to be in bulletproof vests, in big, you know, face helmets, in body armor, batons.
[00:17:58.668 --> 00:18:00.050]  No, they're the National Guard.
[00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.112]  They should be in regular military uniforms.
[00:18:02.112 --> 00:18:05.397]  No, these are militarized police uniforms.
[00:18:05.397 --> 00:18:06.899]  Ending posse commentatus, alright?
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:20.366]  They're softening you up with the National Guard, but they're openly stating, and by they I mean the Pentagon, that 400,000 troops are going to be on the streets in the United States while this occurs.
[00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:23.948]  And you can bet it will be Army, Navy, and Marines.
[00:18:23.948 --> 00:18:26.970]  But they're softening you up with the National Guard because they know that's what you're used to.
[00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:36.008]  They have to figure out how law enforcement agencies will control and defuse social unrest and public disorder.
[00:18:36.008 --> 00:18:38.189]  We've got to keep disorder at bay, folks.
[00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:39.770]  That's what we need to do.
[00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.771]  And isolate prisons and other facilities.
[00:18:42.771 --> 00:18:46.853]  They need to control traffic, evacuation, and mass transportation.
[00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:49.094]  You think you're leaving without taking that shot?
[00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.375]  No way, buddy!
[00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:52.416]  You're taking it or you ain't leaving the county!
[00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.662]  This is what really scares me.
[00:18:55.662 --> 00:19:00.446]  They're saying that they're planning for a 30% to 40% drop in the workforce.
[00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:01.907]  30% to 40%?
[00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:11.415]  Whoa, Buster Brown, you're telling me one-third to almost one-half of workers aren't going to be showing up for their payday?
[00:19:11.415 --> 00:19:14.197]  This is the worst economy in the world!
[00:19:14.197 --> 00:19:20.542]  I mean, this is possibly the worst economy in world history right now, right now!
[00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:22.824]  And we know it's the worst economy since the 20s.
[00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:27.027]  And, you know, 29 and the Great Depression.
[00:19:27.027 --> 00:19:28.327]  We know this, okay?
[00:19:28.327 --> 00:19:32.510]  You're telling me that 30 to 40 percent of the labor force ain't showing up for work?
[00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.271]  They need a check, son!
[00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:35.792]  They'll go with the sniffles.
[00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:43.676]  The only way they're not going to work is if they're in a camp, or they're quarantined, or they're forced not to show up because they shut down the facilities.
[00:19:43.676 --> 00:19:44.536]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:46.037]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:19:46.037 --> 00:19:48.058]  Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours.
[00:19:48.058 --> 00:19:49.659]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:50.299]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.615]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:07.415]  and the world.
[00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:11.278]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:17.784]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:19.805]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:27.752]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:32.738]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:20:32.738 --> 00:20:38.545]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:20:38.545 --> 00:20:40.728]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:20:40.728 --> 00:20:44.072]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[00:20:44.392 --> 00:20:46.354]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:20:46.354 --> 00:20:48.496]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:48.857]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:02.670]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:02.991]  August 26, 2009.
[00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:04.091]  Gold opened this morning at $9.4660.
[00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:07.153]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7369, $4.8685 for a half ounce, or $2.4342 for the quarter ounce.
[00:21:07.153 --> 00:21:07.914]  That's $9.7369, $4.8685, and $2.4342.
[00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:33.452]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:42.039]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, the central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.379]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:43.379 --> 00:21:47.741]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:48.841]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:50.082]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:50.482]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.482 --> 00:21:50.922]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.794 --> 00:22:06.819]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:12.704]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:22:12.704 --> 00:22:18.870]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.152]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:21.152 --> 00:22:23.634]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:34.564]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:38.483]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:40.345]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:47.252]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.252 --> 00:22:55.520]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.101]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.101 --> 00:22:58.283]  The people strike back.
[00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:05.883]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:23:05.883 --> 00:23:06.644]  Think about that.
[00:23:06.644 --> 00:23:09.767]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:12.989]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:23:12.989 --> 00:23:22.778]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:29.039]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.220]  The choice is yours.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:35.821]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:23:35.821 --> 00:23:36.841]  Choose for Health.
[00:23:36.841 --> 00:23:40.902]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:23:40.902 --> 00:23:43.363]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:47.488]  1-800-210-1922.

[00:24:22.863 --> 00:24:25.045]  For those that don't know, I'm a bit of a filmmaker.
[00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:26.626]  I've got this film right now.
[00:24:26.626 --> 00:24:28.347]  9-11 anniversary coming up.
[00:24:28.347 --> 00:24:34.571]  It's not too late to order Fabled Enemies and show people what really happened on 9-11.
[00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:35.432]  Who was detained?
[00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:36.392]  Who was behind it?
[00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:38.234]  Who were the main funders?
[00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.059]  What happened with the 9-11 Commission?
[00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:53.013]  What happened with the anthrax attacks featuring Michael J. Springman, Cynthia McKinney, Bo Dietl, Michael Rivero, Barry Jennings, Joe Biden, and many others over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:57.018]  And who can forget the Obama deception, Alex Jones' latest blockbuster.
[00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:07.744]  It has really gotten more traction than all his films combined because of the timing and the spot on research and production value of this picture.
[00:25:07.744 --> 00:25:14.968]  And remember you can watch it now at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality or get the DVD from Infowars.com.
[00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:18.489]  I want to thank one of our great sponsors, eFoodsDirect.
[00:25:18.489 --> 00:25:23.310]  That's 1-800-409-5633, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.531]  Okay, so we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[00:25:26.531 --> 00:25:31.813]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:44.378]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the Freedom Movement for years and years with the looming food shortages and the current economy, not to mention the possibility of quarantines with this swine flu vaccination.
[00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:46.839]  Who knows what's going to happen in the next few months, folks?
[00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:50.740]  If you want to be holed up with your family and you want to make sure that they actually have food, eFoods Direct 1-800-409-5633.
[00:25:54.662 --> 00:25:57.964]  Now I'm going to wrap up on this swine flu conference in just a moment.
[00:25:57.964 --> 00:26:02.347]  We were hitting up the point that 30-40% of the labor force is supposed to drop from this.
[00:26:02.347 --> 00:26:07.290]  I mean, that should tell you that they are getting ready for mass quarantines, for mass vaccinations.
[00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:15.396]  Even though they've said it, it's all over the Washington Post, it's in the Washington Times, the New York Times, the New York Post, the Chicago Tribune.
[00:26:16.217 --> 00:26:24.108]  In fact, I think I have the Boston Globe in front of me right here, where they say they're going to pay people 50 bucks a piece to take the shot!
[00:26:24.108 --> 00:26:26.031]  I can't make this stuff up!
[00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:30.858]  Residents can get $50 for a swine flu shot, okay?
[00:26:31.872 --> 00:26:33.994]  But on the other side, we're going to do some video action.
[00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:37.558]  We're going to show you Tim Geithner talking about how we just can't audit the Fed.
[00:26:37.558 --> 00:26:38.299]  Just can't audit the Fed.
[00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:42.423]  It doesn't matter if there was a huge victory yesterday in New York.
[00:26:42.423 --> 00:26:47.488]  A New York judge finally stepped up to the plate, swung at the ball, and hit a double.
[00:26:47.488 --> 00:26:54.856]  He didn't knock it out of the park yet, because there is an appellate court, and I'm sure that the Fed, even though they lost, they're going to claim they need an appeal.
[00:26:55.436 --> 00:27:05.143]  Basically, he wrote a 47-page letter saying, look, these guys have to report who they're giving the money to, they have to report on these loans, we need transparency.
[00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:06.564]  But that's the last thing they want.
[00:27:06.564 --> 00:27:16.531]  That's why Barack Obama stands up there in grandstands and says, you know, Ben Bernanke has studied the Great Depression so much, we are honored to have him as a Fed Chairman.
[00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.353]  I nominate him again.
[00:27:19.557 --> 00:27:30.099]  So, Bernanke's so well-studied on this economic collapse that happened in the late 20s and early 30s, that he knows how to make it even more gradual here at home now!
[00:27:30.099 --> 00:27:31.560]  That's what that's about!
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.540]  It's about gutting this economy one more time!
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.201]  Let's gut it!
[00:27:35.201 --> 00:27:39.962]  Let's take it apart and put it back together in our own little New World Order image.
[00:27:39.962 --> 00:27:40.762]  And that's what this is.
[00:27:41.522 --> 00:27:44.506]  Anyway, we're going to play Geithner for about five minutes on the next segment.
[00:27:44.506 --> 00:27:46.288]  We're going to play the Invisible Empire trailer.
[00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:56.179]  We're also going to come up and show you exclusive footage of Jesse Ventura and Alex Jones discussing the new true TV show that Jesse is doing.
[00:27:56.179 --> 00:27:58.622]  I think it's called Conspiracy Theory, tentatively.
[00:27:58.622 --> 00:27:59.663]  We'll see what happens with it.
[00:27:59.663 --> 00:28:01.145]  But let's continue with this document.
[00:28:03.069 --> 00:28:08.832]  We need to train our workers to screen for symptoms and know what to do when workers fall ill.
[00:28:08.832 --> 00:28:10.773]  I mean, the guy next to you starts coughing?
[00:28:10.773 --> 00:28:12.554]  We may need to call in the National Guard.
[00:28:13.522 --> 00:28:14.583]  There's a little sniffles.
[00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:16.425]  He's got a little runny nose.
[00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:17.426]  Could be the swine flu.
[00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:18.727]  We better call the officials.
[00:28:18.727 --> 00:28:20.409]  That man needs to be quarantined.
[00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:23.392]  And the thing is that they're doing the same thing in schools.
[00:28:23.392 --> 00:28:24.273]  Okay, here it is right here.
[00:28:24.273 --> 00:28:25.895]  Concurrent Breakout Session Number 12.
[00:28:25.895 --> 00:28:29.378]  School and University Pandemic Planning.
[00:28:29.378 --> 00:28:34.103]  They are going to train teachers to screen for symptoms and know what to do when students' teachers fall ill.
[00:28:35.049 --> 00:28:36.890]  Look, don't get too excited.
[00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.690]  Don't get too excited.
[00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.291]  Don't warn anybody.
[00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:41.712]  Keep everybody nice and calm.
[00:28:41.712 --> 00:28:43.253]  Keep the situation calm.
[00:28:43.253 --> 00:28:44.934]  Then say you have to go to the office.
[00:28:44.934 --> 00:28:46.735]  You step outside.
[00:28:46.735 --> 00:28:48.655]  You tell the authorities what's happening.
[00:28:48.655 --> 00:28:51.177]  All of a sudden, they can transport ill students.
[00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:53.600]  Transport ill students.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.223]  And they also talk about the bus routes here to get the general populace.
[00:28:58.223 --> 00:29:00.204]  That's why the school systems are good.
[00:29:00.204 --> 00:29:06.167]  Because they can use the bus routes to ship people into the school systems for mass vaccinations, whether they're children or not.
[00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:08.349]  Remember, they expect to get all the parents.
[00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:10.630]  But how do you get the people that don't have kids?
[00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.231]  How do you get that 18 to 30 crowd?
[00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:13.932]  You force them to go.
[00:29:15.106 --> 00:29:19.208]  Effectively transform school facilities into shelters.
[00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:22.229]  See, there might be a quarantine center right at the school.
[00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:27.311]  See, they'll be the main part where everybody's being vaccinated and where people are learning.
[00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:30.012]  And then they'll take, oh, you know, it's decent weather out here.
[00:29:30.012 --> 00:29:33.914]  We'll take them out to the soccer field or we'll take them out to the football field.
[00:29:33.914 --> 00:29:37.876]  We'll make that the makeshift vaccination quarantine center.
[00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:38.656]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:38.656 --> 00:29:39.776]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:29:39.776 --> 00:29:43.218]  We're live over at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com back after this.
[00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:55.060]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.767]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.404 --> 00:30:05.605]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:05.605 --> 00:30:09.646]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.646 --> 00:30:15.547]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:16.188]  It's true.
[00:30:16.188 --> 00:30:20.609]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.609 --> 00:30:26.930]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.713]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:30:30.713 --> 00:30:34.377]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:34.377 --> 00:30:39.102]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:30:39.102 --> 00:30:44.827]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:30:44.827 --> 00:30:47.890]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.511]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:51.293]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:30:51.293 --> 00:30:53.855]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:30:53.855 --> 00:30:58.819]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[00:30:58.819 --> 00:31:02.402]  It is a big idea.
[00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:05.225]  A new world order.
[00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:10.129]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:12.951]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:12.951 --> 00:31:15.133]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:18.897]  Or thousands of years their Dark Order grew.
[00:31:18.897 --> 00:31:26.223]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.246 --> 00:31:34.690]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.552]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.552 --> 00:31:41.134]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.134 --> 00:31:42.295]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:43.075]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:44.356]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.356 --> 00:31:45.337]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.337 --> 00:31:46.498]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:31:46.498 --> 00:31:51.241]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:55.203]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.203 --> 00:31:55.964]  Endgame.
[00:31:55.964 --> 00:31:58.025]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:31:58.025 --> 00:31:59.106]  You have been warned.
[00:32:00.247 --> 00:32:02.308]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:32:02.308 --> 00:32:05.250]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.492]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:08.472]  Here's the story.
[00:32:08.472 --> 00:32:13.275]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:32:13.275 --> 00:32:14.516]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:19.600]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.441]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:26.324]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:32:26.324 --> 00:32:31.828]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:32:31.828 --> 00:32:34.029]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:42.735]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:32:43.035 --> 00:32:48.218]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:52.320]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.102]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:33:09.466 --> 00:33:10.807]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:12.689]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in for the first hour.
[00:33:12.689 --> 00:33:18.774]  Alex will be up in the second, third, and fourth hours with Horsey, Tempany, and John Rhys-Davies.
[00:33:18.774 --> 00:33:24.439]  But without further ado, let's just cut to this Geithner clip where he just blatantly says, we can't audit the Fed.
[00:33:24.439 --> 00:33:27.181]  You can't know what we're doing.
[00:33:27.181 --> 00:33:28.442]  This is our country.
[00:33:28.442 --> 00:33:29.904]  This isn't yours, America.
[00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:30.144]  Hit it.
[00:33:30.743 --> 00:33:33.866]  And then members of the community voted on those questions.
[00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:36.168]  I'm going to ask you the top 10.
[00:33:36.168 --> 00:33:38.330]  First one came from Borez.
[00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.211]  B-O-R-E-Z.
[00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:44.675]  These people don't always use their real names, but that's his dig name.
[00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:45.796]  1,134 digs.
[00:33:45.796 --> 00:33:48.298]  Why has the Federal Reserve Bank never been audited?
[00:33:49.073 --> 00:34:06.387]  You know, the Fed actually is subject to very comprehensive oversight by the Congress, by a series of external auditors, and it does play this very important role in the system, and that requires that Congress have the ability to do a very careful review of how it conducts its operations.
[00:34:06.387 --> 00:34:12.852]  But, very important, as I'm sure people understand, that you want to keep politics out of monetary policy.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.242]  And there are good reasons for that.
[00:34:17.242 --> 00:34:23.265]  You know, we went through centuries of financial crisis in the United States, at least two, before the Fed was established.
[00:34:23.265 --> 00:34:29.788]  Those crises were produced in part by the fact that we didn't have a central bank, that had independence, ability to deal with these kind of things.
[00:34:29.788 --> 00:34:35.731]  And you need to keep those kind of things away from, you know, political influence that can compromise the effectiveness of policy.
[00:34:35.911 --> 00:34:40.875]  But as this shows, there clearly is a group of people out there that feels very passionately about this.
[00:34:40.875 --> 00:34:54.925]  The third question on the list, with 712 digs, was from MotoBikeMan, who said, what is your position on Ron Paul's House Resolution 1207, which, as I understand it, calls for a comprehensive audit of the Fed?
[00:34:54.925 --> 00:35:00.349]  Why does this persist if, as you say, the Fed is already fully audited?
[00:35:00.509 --> 00:35:07.093]  Well, the Fed is dramatically more transparent than it was, is subject to very comprehensive oversight and audits.
[00:35:07.093 --> 00:35:13.877]  But there are certain things about what the Fed does that, again, you need to make sure that you preserve as independent of political influence.
[00:35:13.877 --> 00:35:16.518]  And that line is a line that we don't want to cross.
[00:35:16.518 --> 00:35:19.340]  And I think that even the sponsor of that bill,
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.480]  Thank you.
[00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:42.681]  You don't want to cross the line, but does this kind of concern indicate that maybe the line needs to be moved?
[00:35:42.681 --> 00:35:45.822]  That maybe the Fed needs to be more transparent than it's been in the past?
[00:35:45.822 --> 00:35:46.162]  Yeah, I do.
[00:35:46.162 --> 00:35:47.123]  I think it's very important.
[00:35:47.123 --> 00:35:53.726]  And I think this chairman has gone a long way to open up the workings of the Fed so that people can assess them.
[00:35:53.726 --> 00:35:55.827]  And remember, what the Fed does
[00:35:56.827 --> 00:35:58.368]  Every day.
[00:35:58.368 --> 00:36:05.655]  People can see, and they make their judgment about whether they're having the right impact in terms of making sure we're sustaining growth with low inflation.
[00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:11.400]  Those actions, you know, are subject to the test of the market, public opinion, really every day, every hour.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.464]  You can see, people can judge for themselves whether the Fed is doing what it's supposed to do under the laws of the land.
[00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:19.927]  Well, some of them clearly don't like what they see.
[00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:25.731]  The ninth question on the list was from Zwendkas, 357 digs.
[00:36:25.731 --> 00:36:28.714]  He wrote, you are a member of the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:28.714 --> 00:36:31.496]  I think he meant you were a member of the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:31.496 --> 00:36:37.200]  A group that so thoroughly mismanaged our monetary policy that they helped create a massive housing bubble.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.441]  Alright, let's cut the clip right there.
[00:36:38.441 --> 00:36:40.043]  I mean, this is equivalent.
[00:36:40.819 --> 00:36:55.118]  to somebody standing over a lifeless bloody body with the dagger in hand, blood all over his shirt, all over his pants, saying, we don't need to investigate, we're very transparent.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.862]  We are very transparent.
[00:36:59.862 --> 00:37:06.946]  We won't tell you what banks got the money, how much money we're printing, who our buddies are, who our cronies are, how this system works.
[00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:10.589]  I'll just sit here and lie to you and tell you Congress has oversight.
[00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:13.451]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul is part of the Congress, folks.
[00:37:13.451 --> 00:37:21.937]  For the really small-minded, you know, individuals out there that just kind of came across this program, have no idea what's going on in the real world, let me explain how this works.
[00:37:22.837 --> 00:37:26.398]  This guy tells you Congress already has oversight.
[00:37:26.398 --> 00:37:27.499]  Congress does not.
[00:37:27.499 --> 00:37:28.759]  They should.
[00:37:28.759 --> 00:37:30.120]  This is a private institution.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.261]  They'll tell you it's a quasi-government institution, please.
[00:37:33.261 --> 00:37:40.223]  I mean, this guy just stood up there and said, we had centuries of economic misfortune and disaster before the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:40.223 --> 00:37:48.466]  No, the Federal Reserve came in after the bankers promulgated crises to consolidate power, and now they are consolidating it.
[00:37:49.046 --> 00:37:55.189]  Then he goes on to lie to you and tell you that Congress already has oversight, but we don't want to make it political.
[00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:56.770]  You don't want to make it political?
[00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.471]  You are our monetary system!
[00:37:59.471 --> 00:38:01.012]  Of course that's political!
[00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:03.173]  You are political by default!
[00:38:03.173 --> 00:38:13.938]  What you don't want to do is tell us where the money went, because then it does become more transparent to the American public that you are dirty, dirty criminals.
[00:38:14.858 --> 00:38:19.600]  Cutthroat psychopaths who work for offshore banks.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.361]  That's the reality, Mr. Geithner.
[00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:23.081]  And he'll sit there and smile.
[00:38:23.081 --> 00:38:26.823]  It's very easy for him to do that with a one-on-one pushover.
[00:38:26.823 --> 00:38:28.223]  Put me in a room with Geithner.
[00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:33.145]  Put me in a room with Geithner with a hundred people that recently lost their homes and jobs.
[00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:38.487]  And I guarantee he won't be snickering and smirking so much.
[00:38:38.487 --> 00:38:39.608]  All right, folks.
[00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:42.369]  From that video to the next, I want to cue up
[00:38:43.466 --> 00:38:45.308]  My Invisible Empire trailer.
[00:38:45.308 --> 00:38:46.909]  I've been working real hard on this film.
[00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:47.770]  I continue to work hard.
[00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.893]  By the way, everybody's freaking out about the winter 2010 date.
[00:38:50.893 --> 00:38:53.034]  That means February 2010.
[00:38:53.034 --> 00:38:56.077]  I originally was going to release this on Christmas Eve.
[00:38:56.077 --> 00:39:00.140]  I didn't get the graphics guy in here until about two weeks ago.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.481]  Really want to polish this movie up.
[00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:02.422]  Really want to give it a look.
[00:39:02.422 --> 00:39:07.326]  Really want to make this the definitive movie on global government and the New World Order.
[00:39:07.326 --> 00:39:09.428]  And that's why we're calling it Invisible Empire.
[00:39:09.428 --> 00:39:10.989]  A New World Order Defined.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:26.092]  And yes, some of the clips have been seen before, but I'm pretty sure no one's ever heard the... I mean, they've seen the quote by FDR about the New World Order and this is not new in order in the monument, but never has the speech been out there.
[00:39:26.092 --> 00:39:27.393]  I dug that up.
[00:39:27.393 --> 00:39:30.635]  Some of the Zbigniew Brzezinski clips look brand new to me.
[00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:32.097]  I haven't seen them anywhere on YouTube.
[00:39:32.697 --> 00:39:32.977]  I don't know.
[00:39:55.572 --> 00:39:58.836]  These political figures of power are using this term.
[00:39:58.836 --> 00:40:00.317]  So what is this term?
[00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:01.539]  Why are they using it?
[00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:04.702]  Why does it seem to progress throughout history?
[00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:10.268]  And why does it always seem to be promoted by madmen hell-bent on world domination?
[00:40:10.268 --> 00:40:12.911]  Here it is, the trailer for Invisible Empire.
[00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:42.201]  Nazi forces seek to establish systems of government based on the regimentation of all human beings by a handful of individual rulers who seize power by force.
[00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:48.285]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:52.288]  And the hope that each of us has to build a new world order
[00:40:53.367 --> 00:41:01.917]  A new world order is coming into being, but it looks less and less like the world order that Mr. Kissinger had constructed in his own mind.
[00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:09.285]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths.
[00:41:10.106 --> 00:41:12.007]  And his secret proceedings.
[00:41:12.007 --> 00:41:13.227]  What is the Bohemian Grove?
[00:41:13.227 --> 00:41:16.468]  Well, it's a kind of summer camp for the powerful.
[00:41:16.468 --> 00:41:23.390]  Among its members, political figures like Gerald Ford, President Reagan, Vice President Bush, Richard Nixon is a Bohemian.
[00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:29.552]  Each year, guests like Henry Kissinger or Spygnew Brzezinski address members on their areas of expertise.
[00:41:29.552 --> 00:41:39.315]  Be a poster child for these people because you have served on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations, you started, helped start the Trilateral Commission, and you've been to the Bilderberg Groups.
[00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:46.915]  For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy.
[00:41:46.915 --> 00:41:52.996]  I don't believe in this notion of some sort of secret societies controlling people.
[00:41:52.996 --> 00:42:01.318]  But, of course, in any political system there are sort of over-the-table and under-the-table arrangements.
[00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:08.720]  It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit,
[00:42:09.622 --> 00:42:13.325]  We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher purpose than ourselves.
[00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:14.846]  A shining purpose.
[00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:17.548]  The illumination of a thousand points of light.
[00:42:39.195 --> 00:42:45.839]  No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.
[00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:53.965]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order.
[00:42:53.965 --> 00:43:01.390]  The quest for the new world order is in part a challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay.
[00:43:02.049 --> 00:43:09.516]  We were interested today to hear that more than a hundred law enforcement officials in Mexico are having microchips implanted in their arms.
[00:43:09.516 --> 00:43:13.340]  The chips allow a person to be scanned, sort of like a cereal box at the supermarket checkout.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.763]  What do you think the most important thing is for Barack Obama?
[00:43:16.645 --> 00:43:27.096]  I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new world order can be created.
[00:43:27.096 --> 00:43:35.384]  I think a new world order is emerging and with it the foundations of a new and progressive era of international cooperation.
[00:43:35.384 --> 00:43:39.928]  But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together.
[00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:48.518]  In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more, not less.
[00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:53.463]  Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice.
[00:43:53.463 --> 00:44:01.230]  Yes, these men and their hypnotized followers call this a new order.
[00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.374]  It is not new, and it is not order.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:12.288]  I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people.
[00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:25.218]  Coming to the Infowar in 2010, February.
[00:44:25.218 --> 00:44:28.560]  It is my latest and greatest and really my dream project.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:34.404]  Something that I've been, you know, really working on for the past three or four years wanting to do this picture.
[00:44:34.404 --> 00:44:45.412]  Just doing the research, grabbing the video and now it's coming into culmination and I really hope this is what breaks the term New World Order into the mainstream without this kind of
[00:44:46.172 --> 00:44:48.713]  You know, oh no, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:48.713 --> 00:44:50.633]  Oh, he's a tinfoil hat wearer.
[00:44:50.633 --> 00:45:04.778]  I really hope this does, for 9-11 Truth, for the realization of what is happening in this country, is happening in the world, the way that loose change, you know, brought 9-11 Truth into the mainstream.
[00:45:04.778 --> 00:45:11.080]  I'm hoping this does the same for global governments, global governments and the New World Order.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.461]  I want to thank another one of our sponsors, FrontSite.com.
[00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:15.241]  That's www.frontsite.com.
[00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:16.661]  FrontSite.com.
[00:45:16.661 --> 00:45:27.204]  Have you ever heard of the millionaire patriot Dr. Anastasios Piazza, the founder of the FrontSite Firearms Training Institute, is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[00:45:27.204 --> 00:45:33.926]  Look, you want to learn how to use a firearm, you want to learn how to defend yourself, FrontSite.com can help.
[00:45:33.926 --> 00:45:35.206]  They are the best out there.
[00:45:35.206 --> 00:45:36.787]  They're one of our great sponsors.
[00:45:36.787 --> 00:45:38.127]  FrontSite.com.
[00:45:38.507 --> 00:45:45.635]  All right, what I got left in this segment, I'm going to play some of this Jesse Ventura and Alex Jones conversation.
[00:45:45.635 --> 00:45:53.103]  Basically, Alex went down there in light of this new television show, Conspiracy Theory, on TruTV, and they had a little chatski and hutch.
[00:45:53.103 --> 00:45:54.125]  So, let's hit the clip.
[00:45:56.158 --> 00:46:02.220]  Well, I'm here with Jesse Ventura, and we just did an interview for his upcoming television program, Conspiracy Theory.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.540]  Governor, it's good to be here with you.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.140]  Great, Alex.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.160]  Always nice to see you.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.701]  Never hung out with you in California.
[00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:08.041]  Tell us about the TV show.
[00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:09.202]  Well, it's a TV show.
[00:46:09.202 --> 00:46:21.765]  It's going to be on the True Network, and we're going to deal with conspiracies, and we're going to deal with all sides of them, and it's going to be multiple different ones that we'll deal with, and I think people are going to find it not only enlightening, but entertaining at the same time.
[00:46:22.225 --> 00:46:25.729]  What did you think of our little discussion about population reduction?
[00:46:25.729 --> 00:46:29.273]  Well, it's kind of stunning when I talk to you about it.
[00:46:29.273 --> 00:46:33.999]  It's the kind of thing, when it's told to you, you're not sure if you can believe it or not.
[00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:39.545]  Because it's so outrageous and outlandish in its concept that you can't imagine that
[00:46:40.057 --> 00:46:53.088]  Things like that can occur in our lives, but the more I'm doing conspiracy theory, the more I'm learning about different conspiracies out there beyond, of course, just the assassination of John F. Kennedy and things of that nature.
[00:46:53.088 --> 00:46:57.571]  It's pretty enlightening and pretty shocking when you do learn about them.
[00:46:57.571 --> 00:47:08.040]  Well, I'm glad that your show is somewhat of an investigation of these ideas, because a lot of it out there, from my research, is baloney, or part of it's wrong, part of it's right.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.081]  More often than not, that's the case.
[00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:16.229]  I'm just seeking for the truth and trying to find out historically what's happened, what's happening currently, and what's coming up in the future.
[00:47:16.229 --> 00:47:22.071]  But I will tell you, on the subject of eugenics, on the subject of world population reduction, it's part of the public record.
[00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:23.612]  It's just not popularly known.
[00:47:23.612 --> 00:47:26.113]  That's what's so exciting about you doing this TV show.
[00:47:26.113 --> 00:47:30.274]  Tell us about some of the other topics that are going to be covered and when it's going to be airing.
[00:47:30.274 --> 00:47:32.215]  Well, we don't know exactly yet.
[00:47:32.215 --> 00:47:37.597]  And, you know, the other topics, I don't know if I want to be at liberty right now to say any of them.
[00:47:37.777 --> 00:47:38.197]  You know?
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:39.797]  It's double top secret probation?
[00:47:39.797 --> 00:47:43.898]  Yup, it's double secret probation just like Animal House at this point in time.
[00:47:43.898 --> 00:47:53.221]  But you know that Alex, you'll be a part of the shows and we've talked to some very interesting people on a lot of very interesting subjects and I'll just leave it at that for right now.
[00:47:53.221 --> 00:47:57.642]  Tentatively it should be out I'm guessing around November or around Christmas time.
[00:47:57.642 --> 00:48:00.802]  We should hit the air somewhere in that general vicinity I hope.
[00:48:00.802 --> 00:48:02.683]  But it's been in the news that you are tackling 9-11.
[00:48:03.963 --> 00:48:04.464]  Oh, it has?
[00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:06.745]  Okay, yeah, well that would be one of them then.
[00:48:06.745 --> 00:48:17.894]  9-11's one because, you know, we all know that there's conspiracy theories about 9-11 and our mainstream media won't cover any of this stuff, so they leave it to me, so I have a job now.
[00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:18.894]  That's another question.
[00:48:18.894 --> 00:48:21.817]  We haven't really seen any big national TV shows look at this.
[00:48:21.817 --> 00:48:25.399]  I think you're going to be one of the first that is going to objectively do it.
[00:48:25.399 --> 00:48:25.840]  Hopefully.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.963]  And hopefully that'll get us some ratings, and hopefully we'll be bought up and we'll be on another season.
[00:48:30.963 --> 00:48:37.588]  It's all part of what you do in this particular business, and Alex, for me, it's a case they won't let me retire.
[00:48:37.588 --> 00:48:38.648]  I want to retire.
[00:48:38.648 --> 00:48:40.149]  I want to go surfing.
[00:48:40.149 --> 00:48:45.573]  But yet, this is so intriguing to me, I'm holding off my retirement until we get this project done.
[00:48:45.993 --> 00:48:47.034]  How did you get into this, Governor?
[00:48:47.034 --> 00:48:50.857]  Because I remember about three and a half years ago, I first met you in San Antonio.
[00:48:50.857 --> 00:48:51.397]  I interviewed you.
[00:48:51.397 --> 00:48:52.938]  I gave you my film, Terror Storm.
[00:48:52.938 --> 00:48:59.543]  You knew a little bit about Gulf of Tonkin and some issues, but it seems like more and more you're writing a book, I heard, on the subject.
[00:48:59.543 --> 00:49:00.924]  You come on my show.
[00:49:00.924 --> 00:49:05.227]  I mean, it seems like Jesse Ventura is kind of... Well, here's the problem, Alex.
[00:49:05.227 --> 00:49:08.049]  I now live half the year down in Mexico.
[00:49:08.049 --> 00:49:10.311]  Well, I don't watch TV in Mexico.
[00:49:10.311 --> 00:49:12.512]  When I'm down there for the six months, I read.
[00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:20.340]  And so I go out, I get books on interesting topics, I like to study history, and I like to study real things.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:28.388]  I don't like to particularly read novels because that's simply someone else's imagination writing a story in a book.
[00:49:28.388 --> 00:49:29.909]  Well, I have my own imagination.
[00:49:29.909 --> 00:49:31.831]  I don't need anybody else's, generally.
[00:49:32.211 --> 00:49:35.753]  So I like to read history, and I like to read controversial history.
[00:49:35.753 --> 00:49:39.875]  And so, really, this has blossomed because of my time in Mexico.
[00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:45.297]  I mean, I remember three years ago, I actually read 17 books in one winter down there.
[00:49:45.297 --> 00:49:48.319]  Alex, that's more books than I read in my entire school career.
[00:49:49.315 --> 00:49:55.420]  You know, so it's reading, and it's doing that, and this show was... I'm the creator of it, basically.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:02.426]  I took it with my people, and we sold it, and the True Network bought it, and they found it interesting enough, and here we are.
[00:50:02.426 --> 00:50:15.176]  Governor, doing the research for this television show, and now that you're really immersed in this, and reading all these books when you're down in Mexico part of the year surfing, what do you think of the New World Order itself, the move towards world government, or are you not even convinced of that?
[00:50:15.176 --> 00:50:16.758]  Well, I, you know,
[00:50:19.258 --> 00:50:22.820]  I guess I'm 50-50 right now, you know, as I look at it.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:27.561]  Because I don't want to believe it, and that's probably what holds me back on it.
[00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:32.584]  But I'm certainly seeing enough indication that it could be true.
[00:50:32.584 --> 00:50:33.264]  Absolutely.
[00:50:33.264 --> 00:50:39.126]  Because they're always talking about Mexico and the United States and Canada ending up like Europe.
[00:50:39.126 --> 00:50:42.928]  And there's things done politically that seem to take us in that direction.
[00:50:43.428 --> 00:50:46.131]  Alright, folks, we will be back after this.
[00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:47.113]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:47.113 --> 00:50:48.995]  I'm Jason Vermas, sitting in.
[00:50:48.995 --> 00:50:50.957]  Artificial life will be created within months.
[00:50:50.957 --> 00:50:53.180]  That's the big story over at the Daily Mail.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:57.005]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:51:00.655 --> 00:51:04.417]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:51:04.417 --> 00:51:14.584]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:51:14.584 --> 00:51:21.828]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:51:22.048 --> 00:51:22.388]  I don't know.
[00:51:37.978 --> 00:51:46.805]  23-year proven track record of using certified organic herbs that make up an excellent formula to balance and support the heart and circulatory system.
[00:51:46.805 --> 00:51:53.390]  In as little as two weeks, you can feel amazing results when your two-month supply of Heart and Body Extract today.
[00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.091]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to hbextract.com.
[00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:06.617]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.617 --> 00:52:14.205]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.205 --> 00:52:20.352]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:20.772 --> 00:52:22.754]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:22.754 --> 00:52:25.256]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.256 --> 00:52:36.846]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:36.846 --> 00:52:38.527]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.527 --> 00:52:40.369]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.369 --> 00:52:46.634]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.274 --> 00:52:55.544]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.544 --> 00:52:57.125]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.125 --> 00:53:00.409]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.409 --> 00:53:04.874]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain
[00:53:08.407 --> 00:53:09.027]  We're good to go!
[00:53:31.135 --> 00:53:31.935]  We're good to go.
[00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:06.241]  Yeah.
[00:54:12.605 --> 00:54:20.571]  We got Alex Jones coming up in the next hour with Jerome Corsi, then Dr. Tempany, and then John Rhys-Davies.
[00:54:20.571 --> 00:54:27.317]  So I want to hit up some of these news stories that I just didn't get to because we were talking about the swine flu playing in those trailers.
[00:54:27.317 --> 00:54:31.900]  Artificial life will be created within months as genome experts claim vital breakthrough.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.482]  They're saying that AI is on...
[00:54:35.623 --> 00:54:41.355]  Artificial life, intelligent life beyond what we've ever seen before is coming.
[00:54:41.355 --> 00:54:44.803]  Craig Ventner claims that we will make it later this year.
[00:54:45.939 --> 00:54:47.100]  Just go check it out.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:51.001]  History can no longer guide farmers, investors, UN.
[00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:57.224]  The United Nations is promoting propaganda that because of climate change, the farmers' almanac is useless.
[00:54:57.224 --> 00:54:58.825]  We can no longer look to the past.
[00:54:58.825 --> 00:55:00.265]  We've ruined the earth.
[00:55:00.265 --> 00:55:03.667]  We're in erratic, sporadic periods of time.
[00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:06.568]  We just can't go off of this old data.
[00:55:06.568 --> 00:55:07.889]  We've ruined the planet.
[00:55:07.889 --> 00:55:08.469]  Give me a break.
[00:55:10.539 --> 00:55:15.141]  Let's see, US budget update stands pat on CO2 permit auction.
[00:55:15.141 --> 00:55:22.804]  They act like it's an auction, but they're basically going to be giving carbon credits away to big business so that they can tax the hell out of the average American citizen.
[00:55:22.804 --> 00:55:27.586]  After all, this climate change bill is all about the greatest tax increase in
[00:55:28.166 --> 00:55:29.166]  In world history.
[00:55:29.166 --> 00:55:32.788]  Because it is going to be a global tax that they're trying to set on all U.S.
[00:55:32.788 --> 00:55:37.450]  American citizens, world citizens alike, and say, hey, you like to breathe?
[00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:38.610]  Good, we'll tax you for it.
[00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:39.771]  You like to drive two cars?
[00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:40.971]  Good, we'll tax you for it.
[00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:42.532]  Ooh, you got a little too much garbage there?
[00:55:42.532 --> 00:55:44.413]  Good, we're gonna tax you on it.
[00:55:45.876 --> 00:55:46.196]  U.S.
[00:55:46.196 --> 00:55:47.917]  power bill's down, but not for long.
[00:55:47.917 --> 00:55:51.758]  They're saying that the power bills are down now, but wait till this tax increase kicks in.
[00:55:51.758 --> 00:55:52.299]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:52.299 --> 00:55:55.220]  We're all going to be paying three to four times more for our power.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.261]  You know, the energy bill isn't enough.
[00:55:57.261 --> 00:56:02.443]  It's not enough that, you know, you pay $400 plus a month for your house during the wintertime.
[00:56:02.443 --> 00:56:09.246]  It's not enough that people in the heat like me in Texas are paying over $200 a month to kick on that central air.
[00:56:09.246 --> 00:56:12.547]  We want to charge you more because we haven't made you destitute enough.
[00:56:13.712 --> 00:56:17.856]  This isn't a sign that the economy is in total shambles.
[00:56:17.856 --> 00:56:18.456]  The U.S.
[00:56:18.456 --> 00:56:24.582]  Postal Service is about to cut 30,000 jobs via buyouts.
[00:56:24.582 --> 00:56:27.284]  In other words, they're trying to get people to retire early.
[00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:30.607]  They're trying to get them to quit.
[00:56:30.607 --> 00:56:32.029]  30,000 people at the U.S.
[00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:33.330]  Postal Service.
[00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:34.371]  Nixed.
[00:56:34.371 --> 00:56:35.632]  Nixed.
[00:56:35.632 --> 00:56:37.594]  You know, I forgot to cover over the weekend.
[00:56:38.906 --> 00:56:41.828]  Yet another bank has gone under, this time in Texas.
[00:56:41.828 --> 00:56:44.870]  A large Texas bank shut down by federal regulators.
[00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:48.713]  And you're going to see more and more and more of this.
[00:56:48.713 --> 00:56:51.154]  Garante Bank became the second largest U.S.
[00:56:51.154 --> 00:56:59.720]  bank to fail this year after the Texas lender was shut down by regulators and most of the operations sold at a loss of billions of dollars for the U.S.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.182]  government to a major Spanish bank.
[00:57:03.182 --> 00:57:03.742]  Isn't that lovely?
[00:57:05.043 --> 00:57:10.889]  The transaction approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Court marked the first time a foreign bank has bought a failed U.S.
[00:57:10.889 --> 00:57:11.129]  bank.
[00:57:11.129 --> 00:57:17.856]  See, foreign banks now openly taking over United States banks.
[00:57:17.856 --> 00:57:18.797]  Just type it in, folks.
[00:57:18.797 --> 00:57:24.663]  I mean, these are the mainline articles that you're not hearing about all over the media.
[00:57:24.663 --> 00:57:25.383]  But don't worry!
[00:57:26.224 --> 00:57:30.888]  You'll hear about Michael Jackson taking a huge shot and maybe being killed from it.
[00:57:30.888 --> 00:57:33.050]  You'll hear about his doctor claiming he's innocent.
[00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:44.279]  You'll hear about Teddy Kennedy and what a great person he was, even though he didn't have the cojones to step up to the establishment, to the elite that murdered his brothers on television.
[00:57:45.592 --> 00:57:49.595]  Well, I guess you could argue that Kennedy's wasn't live, but it was pretty much broadcast live.
[00:57:49.595 --> 00:57:51.176]  I mean, the event, the parade was there.
[00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:53.998]  We didn't see the Zabruder film until 13 years later.
[00:57:53.998 --> 00:57:59.462]  But we sure saw his brother, Robert, get shot in the back of the head, didn't we?
[00:57:59.462 --> 00:58:01.344]  Couldn't step up to the plate, Ted.
[00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.305]  Went to your grave with that.
[00:58:03.305 --> 00:58:06.748]  That is gonna be something that bears over your soul for eternity.
[00:58:06.748 --> 00:58:10.811]  I guarantee you, if we have souls, and you didn't stick up for your brothers, your blood,
[00:58:12.301 --> 00:58:14.063]  Yeah, there's no coming back from that.
[00:58:14.063 --> 00:58:20.449]  Alex Jones coming up after this break with Jerome Corsi, again Tempany, and John Rhys-Davies.
[00:58:20.449 --> 00:58:21.370]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.691]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:30.920]  Please go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, support us, get Aaron Russo's Reflection and Warnings, Fabled Enemies, and the Obama Deception back after this.
[00:58:42.065 --> 00:58:43.488]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.488 --> 00:58:46.475]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.933 --> 00:58:53.954]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.954 --> 00:58:59.276]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.276 --> 00:59:01.316]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.316 --> 00:59:06.318]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.318 --> 00:59:07.498]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.498 --> 00:59:08.639]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.639 --> 00:59:10.519]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:11.579]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.579 --> 00:59:13.780]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.141]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:15.141 --> 00:59:16.441]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.681 --> 00:59:21.928]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.928 --> 00:59:25.513]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.513 --> 00:59:29.338]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.338 --> 00:59:30.560]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.461]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:32.582]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.582 --> 00:59:33.323]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:34.305]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.585 --> 00:59:37.627]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.627 --> 00:59:39.869]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.869 --> 00:59:40.849]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:42.030]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:43.872]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:05.965]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.965 --> 01:00:07.726]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.726 --> 01:00:09.487]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.487 --> 01:00:11.068]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.068 --> 01:00:12.630]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:16.812]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.812 --> 01:00:20.855]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:25.692]  It is incredible to see this happening.
[01:00:25.692 --> 01:00:29.916]  Democrats and Republicans are being booed off stage.
[01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:33.498]  Then they always run from the crowds for over 90%.
[01:00:33.498 --> 01:00:39.663]  Whether it's Senator Specter, Senator Cornyn in Texas, whether it's Congressman Doggett in Texas, Congressman Castle.
[01:00:40.784 --> 01:00:42.286]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:00:42.286 --> 01:00:46.109]  I mean the reports are pouring in so fast I can't even keep track of them.
[01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:52.033]  We need to create a little side banner on InfoWars and just chronicle the videos and news articles about this.
[01:00:52.033 --> 01:00:52.914]  Now out of St.
[01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:54.235]  Louis, a town outside St.
[01:00:54.235 --> 01:00:58.739]  Louis, union thugs with Obama people beat up
[01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:05.937]  Peaceful listeners of mine, we've been contacted by the listener's lawyer, we have the video of him being beat up, then they arrest the St.
[01:01:05.937 --> 01:01:11.738]  Louis Post-Dispatch reporter, because they were a witness, but thank God a video from a distance got out of there.
[01:01:11.738 --> 01:01:18.480]  Just like when they attacked the We Are Changer with a wheelchair, and then luckily witnesses came out and that got defeated in court.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.121]  So they attack you, and then you go to jail.
[01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:25.102]  Just amazing tyranny and frame-up.
[01:01:26.644 --> 01:01:39.455]  The establishment is using Chicago, big city, New York, big city, mafia machine, daily crime machine, thuggery, to try to enforce this, and bludgeon people into submission.
[01:01:39.455 --> 01:01:43.679]  And it's time we stop cowing, it's time we stand up and say no.
[01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:46.121]  Or the sky's the limit with these crooks.
[01:01:46.121 --> 01:01:50.865]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us in the next segment, and Bob Chapman on his weekly financial visit with us.
[01:01:50.865 --> 01:01:53.788]  I'm gonna go over the healthcare plan again and show the lies of Obama.
[01:01:55.592 --> 01:02:09.581]  That is all coming up and then in the fourth hour we're going to be breaking down a bunch of different videos and audio for the radio listeners, but video for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers of these bipartisan groups going after Republicans and Democrats alike.
[01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:12.938]  The media is desperate to make this a partisan issue.
[01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:27.230]  If it comes out that it's both parties that people hate and that the system across the board is doing the opposite of what the people want and what's constitutional, then all support for these crooks will collapse and they are not going to be able to continue their looting.
[01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:31.694]  Now, they've already stolen an irrevocable 23.7 trill.
[01:02:31.694 --> 01:02:35.898]  But we have to come out and say that debt is fraudulent and triageant and it's not going to be paid.
[01:02:39.286 --> 01:02:45.029]  All these idiot foreigners are emailing me going, but you owe that money to us, what do you mean don't pay it back?
[01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:47.831]  The same banks have been ripping you off with the bailouts.
[01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:49.392]  You're not getting any of that money.
[01:02:49.392 --> 01:02:53.334]  That's like rednecks that are like, I like it, we're in Iraq, I'm getting oil.
[01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:56.656]  No, you're paying for the oil companies to get the oil, you're getting nothing.
[01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:59.777]  Stop thinking you're part of the system.
[01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:05.560]  There's still a lot of you out there who are delusional and on power trips and think you're part of the system.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.182]  And you play mind games with yourself that you're part of the system.
[01:03:10.239 --> 01:03:23.421]  And so you feel like you're powerful by extension through Obama, or you feel like you're powerful through George Bush, and you get in these two camps as the elite play us off against each other.
[01:03:23.421 --> 01:03:28.162]  So the media first said these were all staged, now they're having to admit they're not staged.
[01:03:28.162 --> 01:03:30.822]  Now they're falling back and saying it's only partisan.
[01:03:30.822 --> 01:03:31.883]  No it's not!
[01:03:31.883 --> 01:03:36.243]  The Republicans are being booed off the stage, but the media won't report on it!
[01:03:36.243 --> 01:03:39.404]  The only Republicans not being booed off are people like Ron Paul and Gohmert.
[01:03:40.365 --> 01:03:49.227]  And Senator DeMint, who are actually saying no to cap-and-trade, no to open borders, no to gun-grabbing, no to socialism, no to the New World Order!
[01:03:49.227 --> 01:03:52.327]  If you say no to the New World Order, you're on a bed of roses!
[01:03:52.327 --> 01:03:55.068]  If you say yes to it, you get run out on a rail!
[01:03:55.068 --> 01:03:56.088]  It's simple!
[01:03:56.088 --> 01:04:00.409]  There's nothing more American!
[01:04:00.409 --> 01:04:03.749]  I want to thank some sponsors before we go out to break and come back with Dr. Corsi.
[01:04:03.749 --> 01:04:06.990]  MySolarBackup.com, a lot of things can happen in a hurricane.
[01:04:08.021 --> 01:04:12.788]  Snow, ice storms, electrical power can go off, all the talk of depression, war, all this other crud.
[01:04:12.788 --> 01:04:14.550]  It's good to have some solar backup systems.
[01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.313]  You can get an emergency backup power kit.
[01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:23.218]  Which consists of a power source, 1800 watt generator, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:04:23.218 --> 01:04:28.061]  Remember, too, the gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:04:28.061 --> 01:04:30.462]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:04:30.462 --> 01:04:33.684]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:04:33.684 --> 01:04:35.125]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.146]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:04:37.146 --> 01:04:37.626]  Or give them a call.
[01:04:37.626 --> 01:04:38.106]  It's toll-free.
[01:04:38.106 --> 01:04:38.166]  877-327-0365.
[01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:38.226]  877-327-0365.
[01:04:38.226 --> 01:04:38.887]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:04:46.187 --> 01:04:47.350]  I am fired up.
[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:50.617]  This is 1776 all over again, but peaceful.
[01:04:50.617 --> 01:04:56.629]  Just like it was before 1776, but the Redcoats punched one too many people in the nose.
[01:04:56.629 --> 01:04:57.331]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:04.577]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:05:04.577 --> 01:05:06.579]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:05:06.579 --> 01:05:15.108]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:05:15.108 --> 01:05:20.653]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:20.653 --> 01:05:22.275]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:22.515 --> 01:05:29.016]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:29.016 --> 01:05:40.059]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:05:40.059 --> 01:05:40.839]  That's right.
[01:05:40.839 --> 01:05:43.399]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:05:43.399 --> 01:05:45.180]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-HELP.
[01:05:47.561 --> 01:06:05.555]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:06:05.555 --> 01:06:07.636]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:10.078]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:06:10.078 --> 01:06:12.360]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.981]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:06:13.981 --> 01:06:15.022]  There is a solution.
[01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:23.667]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:31.111]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:06:31.111 --> 01:06:37.155]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[01:06:37.155 --> 01:06:42.738]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:06:43.158 --> 01:06:47.323]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:06:47.323 --> 01:06:53.530]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:54.792]  866-762-9238.
[01:06:54.792 --> 01:06:58.096]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:07:00.586 --> 01:07:02.948]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:07:02.948 --> 01:07:03.488]  Hi.
[01:07:03.488 --> 01:07:06.270]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:10.812]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:07:10.812 --> 01:07:13.294]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:07:13.294 --> 01:07:16.316]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:18.557]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:07:18.557 --> 01:07:21.359]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:25.082]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:29.485]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:33.587]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:07:33.587 --> 01:07:39.411]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:42.272]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:07:42.272 --> 01:07:44.373]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:07:44.373 --> 01:07:49.254]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:07:49.254 --> 01:07:50.175]  Start now.
[01:07:50.175 --> 01:07:51.875]  Knowledge is power.
[01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:52.875]  Better take action.
[01:07:52.875 --> 01:08:01.038]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:03.799]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.799 --> 01:08:06.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.738 --> 01:08:17.960]  We have two hours and 52 minutes spanning out the forest today.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.081]  Bob Chapman joins us right now with what's happening in the economy and the government takeover of healthcare.
[01:08:23.081 --> 01:08:26.162]  We're going to go through point by point in the next hour.
[01:08:26.162 --> 01:08:29.403]  We have some surprise guests coming up in the fourth hour today.
[01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:38.006]  We're now simulcasting live, not just on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave, XM satellite, and of course the internet at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:44.705]  We're also streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv live right now and also archive this.
[01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:47.007]  By the way, I've never had a t-shirt sell like this.
[01:08:47.007 --> 01:08:48.949]  We ordered a whole bunch of them.
[01:08:48.949 --> 01:08:51.211]  They are UPS delivery time today.
[01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:53.232]  We put the order in to make them on Monday.
[01:08:53.232 --> 01:08:54.173]  They're delivered today.
[01:08:54.173 --> 01:08:56.755]  Over the weekend on Monday, we'll ship them out.
[01:08:56.755 --> 01:08:58.316]  They just sold out this morning.
[01:08:58.316 --> 01:08:59.297]  We put in another order.
[01:08:59.297 --> 01:09:01.299]  They'll be here next Tuesday.
[01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:03.641]  We were the first to say, take that Joker face.
[01:09:04.714 --> 01:09:13.839]  And put it out with socialism, with New World Order, with fascism, with End the Fed on the back, with Stop the Criminal, Obama on the back.
[01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:20.243]  We've got eight different shirts based on the Obama Joker.
[01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.543]  And they're very upset by it.
[01:09:21.543 --> 01:09:24.725]  We've launched a $1,000 prize that we'll announce next Friday.
[01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:27.667]  Have your email contest at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:28.948 --> 01:09:31.170]  And we'll pick the winner and announce it Friday.
[01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:36.734]  The best YouTube video showing yourself putting up the Obama poster with InfoWars.com.
[01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:41.638]  You can print the flyers off at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:41.638 --> 01:09:47.603]  Using the Obama poster that says InfoWars.com, and you can smatter in the fascist and socialist one.
[01:09:47.603 --> 01:09:49.705]  Just make sure InfoWars.com is included.
[01:09:49.705 --> 01:09:52.007]  We have a whole bunch of different free flyers there in color.
[01:09:52.007 --> 01:09:53.288]  Download them, print them off.
[01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:56.610]  Whoever puts up the most in the most visible area will win the $1,000.
[01:09:58.254 --> 01:10:00.655]  Okay, we're going to take that all into consideration.
[01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:05.277]  And put your videos out on YouTube, print the flyers off, $1,000 contest.
[01:10:05.277 --> 01:10:11.079]  We'll announce it seven, eight days from now, next Friday, here on the show.
[01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:13.660]  So you definitely don't want to miss that.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.400]  Very, very exciting.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.661]  And get your t-shirt at Infowars.com.
[01:10:16.661 --> 01:10:17.401]  Get your order in.
[01:10:17.401 --> 01:10:19.442]  We'll ship it out to you next week.
[01:10:19.442 --> 01:10:20.803]  We've already sold out of these.
[01:10:20.803 --> 01:10:23.964]  Everybody that ordered Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, they're sold out.
[01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:26.192]  But we just put another order this morning.
[01:10:26.192 --> 01:10:30.134]  Our place is printing them today, shipping them out Saturday and Monday.
[01:10:30.134 --> 01:10:32.415]  So we'll be shipping them out to you on Tuesday.
[01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:35.877]  These are just now arriving today and they're already all sold.
[01:10:35.877 --> 01:10:39.059]  Get your order in now to GetTheInfoWars.com.
[01:10:39.059 --> 01:10:41.080]  Obama, Joker, the pitcher.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.062]  You know, they're calling it racist, they're calling it evil.
[01:10:44.062 --> 01:10:45.923]  The Democrats put out Bush as a joker.
[01:10:47.553 --> 01:10:50.456]  Uh, they put him out as a vampire sucking the blood of Lady Liberty.
[01:10:50.456 --> 01:10:52.237]  We actually like that image and posted it.
[01:10:52.237 --> 01:10:53.238]  We're non-partisan.
[01:10:53.238 --> 01:10:57.362]  We don't like anybody who's for the New World Order.
[01:10:57.362 --> 01:10:59.644]  And, so, we're not putting up with political correctness.
[01:10:59.644 --> 01:11:02.507]  We put out posters all over South Congress last night.
[01:11:02.507 --> 01:11:03.968]  That's going up on YouTube tonight.
[01:11:03.968 --> 01:11:06.010]  We're actually out doing it ourselves.
[01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:08.432]  Rob New and, uh, Jason Douglas did a great job.
[01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:09.433]  I put up a few last night.
[01:11:10.752 --> 01:11:21.065]  We're going to stand up against this criminal because they're trying to bring America down with the open borders, the North American Union, the Obamacare, the cap and trade, and an expert fighting as he writes for WorldNetDaily.
[01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:24.882]  He puts out the great Red Alert newsletter, which is excellent.
[01:11:24.882 --> 01:11:26.983]  He's a best-selling author many times over.
[01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:29.665]  He wrote the Obama Nation.
[01:11:29.665 --> 01:11:34.067]  He wrote the late, great USA that we sell at InfoWars.com, the latest edition.
[01:11:34.067 --> 01:11:43.011]  He is Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us for the Balance of the Hour to talk about the NAU meeting on Mexico that nobody's talking about, but he's covering.
[01:11:43.903 --> 01:11:46.505]  I'd mentioned it a few weeks ago, but I'd kind of forgotten about it.
[01:11:46.505 --> 01:11:53.128]  We're going to talk about how they're beating up people with the police that are now against Obamacare on video, and then arresting those.
[01:11:53.128 --> 01:11:58.091]  They beat up, we've got the lawyer coming on later, one of our listeners, they contacted us, we have the video.
[01:11:58.091 --> 01:12:02.934]  This is happening everywhere, and he's going to cover, of course, the birth certificate, what he really thinks is going on there.
[01:12:02.934 --> 01:12:05.035]  Dr. Corsi, it's great having you on with us.
[01:12:05.035 --> 01:12:07.616]  Hi Alex, it's great to be back, thank you.
[01:12:07.616 --> 01:12:08.017]  You bet.
[01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:17.192]  Out of the gates, let's get into what's happening with demonstrations everywhere, truly spontaneous.
[01:12:17.192 --> 01:12:22.513]  I've had neighbors and friends that went to them with the Lloyd Doggett last weekend at the Randall's grocery store.
[01:12:22.513 --> 01:12:24.954]  I didn't even know about it until I saw the video.
[01:12:24.954 --> 01:12:28.734]  I talked to my neighbor, talked to one of my dad's employees who was there.
[01:12:28.734 --> 01:12:32.555]  Most of these are Democrats because they only sent letters out to them.
[01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:37.236]  They're mad and the media is trying to spin it, saying it's staged.
[01:12:37.236 --> 01:12:37.976]  What do you make of this?
[01:12:38.416 --> 01:12:44.723]  Well, first of all, the people who are showing up at the town hall meetings are average Americans.
[01:12:44.723 --> 01:12:49.769]  They're middle class Americans who are upset predominantly about the health care.
[01:12:49.769 --> 01:12:58.839]  They're very concerned that this takeover of the health care system is going to give them poorer health care, cost more in taxes than the seniors.
[01:12:59.457 --> 01:13:03.139]  Our very concern is going to end up being rationing of health care to seniors.
[01:13:03.139 --> 01:13:04.800]  Well, Daschle said that in his book.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.021]  It's in the bill.
[01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:07.782]  And this is nothing but eugenics.
[01:13:07.782 --> 01:13:09.603]  I mean, even Fox News has said it's eugenics.
[01:13:09.603 --> 01:13:13.946]  The doctor they had on, I mean, this is the government running your health care.
[01:13:13.946 --> 01:13:16.908]  I can't think of anything worse with these control freaks.
[01:13:16.908 --> 01:13:21.851]  Well, I don't think people want a 28-year-old bureaucrat making decisions on what health care they can get.
[01:13:22.552 --> 01:13:24.233]  Especially seniors.
[01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:31.659]  The history of countries that have had government-run health care is that health care is going to be rationed.
[01:13:31.659 --> 01:13:41.225]  It's been pretty clearly stated, I think in the whole intention of this bill, that there's no way people can be provided this universal health care unless there is rationing.
[01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:42.806]  Obama said it.
[01:13:42.806 --> 01:13:52.113]  Now, to get back to the issue, what we're finding at World and Daily, and I'm continuing to get emails through the day, of various SEIU unions
[01:13:53.039 --> 01:14:04.204]  Employees attending these rallies, I guess a series of rallies last night were attended, and the SEIU attendees appeared to be the ones causing the disruption in the protests.
[01:14:04.204 --> 01:14:08.126]  They were the ones pushing and shoving and shouting and screaming.
[01:14:08.126 --> 01:14:19.851]  In fact, there's one video I've gotten that shows one of the SEIU anti-protesters being arrested by the police for disrupting, causing disruption on the scene.
[01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:24.359]  So there's pushback here from the White House.
[01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:37.349]  Also, Paul Krugman's article in the New York Times today, which I thought was particularly offensive to the protesters, saying that this was just white, angry racists.
[01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.587]  A redneck Republican.
[01:14:39.587 --> 01:14:41.529]  No, no, my listener is black.
[01:14:41.529 --> 01:14:42.790]  His lawyer's contacted us.
[01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.870]  There's video.
[01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:50.455]  They run up and beat him and say, how can an N-word be at a meeting against Obama and punch him in the nose?
[01:14:50.455 --> 01:14:52.637]  In fact, I've seen that video on the Internet.
[01:14:52.637 --> 01:14:54.518]  That's now playing on the Internet.
[01:14:54.518 --> 01:14:55.779]  Yeah, we have it on InfoWars.com.
[01:14:55.779 --> 01:14:56.520]  Go ahead.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:06.968]  Okay, and so, you know, the, if the White House is taking the position that any, and this is what I wrote on the Obama Nation, it's been going on since the campaign.
[01:15:07.685 --> 01:15:17.991]  Anyone who politically objects to a position taken by President Obama or Candidate Obama is by definition called a racist by their supporter.
[01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:35.681]  So, and now with the White House putting up this feed, you know, this site to turn your neighbors in, report people who don't agree with President Obama, this flag at WhiteHouse.gov, and President Obama had a clear opportunity, he could have said to Nancy Pelosi,
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:52.068]  Quit demonizing the town hall protesters by saying people showing up with signs and swastikas and portraying them as if this is a right-wing organized effort to object to Obama by a small group.
[01:15:52.068 --> 01:15:55.550]  It's not the case.
[01:15:55.550 --> 01:16:00.653]  This is a very broad-based reaction.
[01:16:00.653 --> 01:16:05.315]  And if you take a look honestly at the numbers, the President's poll numbers are plummeting.
[01:16:05.925 --> 01:16:09.028]  It's now down to about 50 percent.
[01:16:09.028 --> 01:16:11.129]  And those are... Lower in some polls.
[01:16:11.129 --> 01:16:12.751]  I've seen them as low as 45 in some.
[01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:13.071]  You're right.
[01:16:13.071 --> 01:16:15.553]  Rasmussen and the Gallup, he's at 50.
[01:16:15.553 --> 01:16:18.875]  The Quinnipiac University just came out.
[01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.937]  They are about 50 percent.
[01:16:20.937 --> 01:16:22.278]  That was this week.
[01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:25.441]  I think that was reported yesterday by Fox.
[01:16:25.441 --> 01:16:34.348]  And the dropping, which is dramatic, I mean, the approval rating was about 63 percent when President Obama was inaugurated in January.
[01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:39.293]  Now this is a more precipitous drop than even Jimmy Carter.
[01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:43.516]  Jimmy Carter was into August before he hit under 60.
[01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:49.659]  And now President Obama is risking hitting under 50 in August of his first year in office.
[01:16:49.659 --> 01:16:52.661]  So this is dramatic and polarizing.
[01:16:52.661 --> 01:17:02.547]  And President Obama is ending up being not the uniting president he came on saying he was going to be, but probably one of the most divisive presidents we've ever had.
[01:17:02.547 --> 01:17:04.368]  And I think the attempt by the White House
[01:17:05.429 --> 01:17:09.511]  By the way, at PrisonPlanet.tv I'm playing the video of
[01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:33.543]  A black man being attacked for being against the health care.
[01:17:33.543 --> 01:17:36.265]  This is the democracy of Obama.
[01:17:36.265 --> 01:17:37.325]  And let's remember it was St.
[01:17:37.325 --> 01:17:48.211]  Louis where they had the prosecutors and the sheriff in the county announce on TV themselves that they would arrest people that they deemed were being dishonest about Obama.
[01:17:48.211 --> 01:17:49.572]  That of course would be a civil matter.
[01:17:49.572 --> 01:17:52.013]  If Obama thinks you're lying about him, he has to sue you.
[01:17:52.013 --> 01:17:54.515]  But no, the police said they'd be judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:17:55.407 --> 01:18:12.980]  And this is shocking video of the Union thugs attacking people, and what's even more shocking is, then the police arrest one of the reporters who is covering it, and it appears to then persecute some of the people that are being attacked, Dr. Corsi.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:23.248]  Well, and the irony here is that, you know, President Obama is supposed to be, he portrays himself as the community organizer-in-chief.
[01:18:23.248 --> 01:18:24.609]  I mean, on the films about him,
[01:18:25.515 --> 01:18:32.017]  You know, films maturing into office, all the stories about his community organizing efforts in Chicago.
[01:18:32.017 --> 01:18:42.261]  And then, while Obama was working in a Solinsky organization, which is about as radical to the left socialist organization as you could get.
[01:18:42.261 --> 01:18:47.423]  Yeah, his rules for radicals is dedicated to Lucifer.
[01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:51.344]  Correct, it's dedicated to Lucifer, who Solinsky calls the first radical.
[01:18:52.088 --> 01:19:01.054]  And among the rules, you know, basically the advice from Paul Lipke is, cut your hair, put on a business suit, act like you're going to be a moderate, and get elected.
[01:19:01.054 --> 01:19:11.521]  And then when you get elected, break all your campaign promises, because you only said those on a Machiavellian principle, that people believe what seems to be the case.
[01:19:11.521 --> 01:19:13.001]  So, seem to be moderate.
[01:19:13.001 --> 01:19:18.365]  Then when you get into office, redistribute wealth, and put central government control over the economy.
[01:19:18.365 --> 01:19:21.587]  And as I wrote in the Abomination, that's how Obama was trained.
[01:19:22.321 --> 01:19:32.108]  Now, that community organizing, or ACORN, or SEIU, of the Obama administration, which is extremely far left, that's all fine.
[01:19:32.108 --> 01:19:45.537]  But if middle Americans speak up at town hall meetings, then they've got to be demonized by the White House as if they were, you know, right-wing, organized, redneck, Nazi thug, which is ridiculous.
[01:19:45.537 --> 01:19:51.401]  Well, they also mix the term Nazi in with redneck and rural and white, as if being redneck or white's a bad thing.
[01:20:00.567 --> 01:20:04.090]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.012]  Now going green can save money.
[01:20:06.012 --> 01:20:11.577]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:20:11.577 --> 01:20:12.398]  The Renaissance Charger

[01:21:01.226 --> 01:21:03.448]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.448 --> 01:21:06.370]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:14.976]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[01:21:14.976 --> 01:21:18.658]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[01:21:18.658 --> 01:21:23.202]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[01:21:23.202 --> 01:21:24.783]  How much are you willing to lose?
[01:21:25.163 --> 01:21:26.224]  Take action now!
[01:21:26.224 --> 01:21:31.047]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[01:21:31.047 --> 01:21:35.010]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:38.352]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:44.777]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[01:21:45.077 --> 01:21:50.440]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.361]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[01:21:53.361 --> 01:21:55.082]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:22:00.894 --> 01:22:06.701]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.701 --> 01:22:14.290]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:14.290 --> 01:22:20.457]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:20.997 --> 01:22:22.839]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.839 --> 01:22:25.341]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:36.911]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:36.911 --> 01:22:38.593]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.593 --> 01:22:40.454]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.454 --> 01:22:46.700]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:55.619]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:22:57.201 --> 01:22:58.383]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.539 --> 01:23:09.604]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[01:23:54.244 --> 01:23:57.005]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:57.005 --> 01:23:58.666]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:02.067]  In the last 30 minutes of the show today,
[01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:29.212]  We have the lawyer for the black man that got beat up and is now in the hospital, beat up by Obama supporters, calling him the n-word and beating him.
[01:24:29.212 --> 01:24:35.942]  Saying, how dare another n-word come to one of these events?
[01:24:35.942 --> 01:24:37.585]  It's just absolutely incredible.
[01:24:39.835 --> 01:24:43.137]  And this lawyer is a listener of the show, the man that got beat up is a listener.
[01:24:43.137 --> 01:24:45.058]  So that's great, they now contact us.
[01:24:45.058 --> 01:24:50.121]  He's gonna be on Fox News right before he comes on with us, right before 2.30 Central, that's what he told us.
[01:24:50.121 --> 01:24:52.802]  So, this story is going mega viral.
[01:24:52.802 --> 01:24:58.365]  And I tell you, it doesn't matter if it's the castle being booed off the stage, that's our listener, sends us the video.
[01:24:58.365 --> 01:25:00.406]  Lloyd Doggett, our listeners.
[01:25:00.406 --> 01:25:03.548]  You know, you wanna talk about stage, it's my listeners.
[01:25:03.548 --> 01:25:06.950]  And I'm not telling them to go out and do this, this is their First Amendment right to do it.
[01:25:07.611 --> 01:25:10.795]  But it's not just our listeners, it's everybody across the board.
[01:25:10.795 --> 01:25:14.680]  Dr. Corsi continuing, how is the establishment going to counter this?
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.104]  I mean, do you think Obama will stage a crisis or something?
[01:25:18.104 --> 01:25:19.926]  I don't see any other way.
[01:25:19.926 --> 01:25:22.249]  He is falling faster than any other president.
[01:25:22.249 --> 01:25:25.673]  He's lower than Bush was at this time, lower than Jimmy Carter.
[01:25:26.423 --> 01:25:28.204]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[01:25:28.204 --> 01:25:32.646]  The hoax that is Obama is deflating monstrously fast.
[01:25:32.646 --> 01:25:33.986]  What do you see them doing?
[01:25:33.986 --> 01:25:39.028]  Well, what he's going to do immediately is on Sunday, he's headed to Mexico.
[01:25:39.028 --> 01:25:44.771]  We've got another meeting, which should be the Security and Prosperity Partnership meeting.
[01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:47.372]  They've renamed these meetings now.
[01:25:47.372 --> 01:25:51.874]  Alex, as you know, they're calling it the North American Leaders Summit.
[01:25:52.645 --> 01:26:14.200]  As I reported on World Net Daily and also my Red Alert newsletter, I've got articles saying that there's a plan that has been advanced by several of the think tanks saying the attention that we've brought, your show has brought, others have brought on the Security and Prosperity Partnership is, you know, the North American Union agenda.
[01:26:15.134 --> 01:26:17.716]  That the exposure has hurt the integration effort.
[01:26:17.716 --> 01:26:19.878]  So they've really changed the name.
[01:26:19.878 --> 01:26:21.259]  North American Leaders Summit.
[01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.141]  They've downgraded the meeting.
[01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:25.363]  It's no longer Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:33.750]  If you look at the website, SPP.gov, they've got a notice on the website that they're in the process of reformatting the site.
[01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:42.734]  Well, Dr. Corsi, let me ask you this.
[01:26:42.734 --> 01:26:44.075]  All under the radar.
[01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:44.855]  All under the radar.
[01:26:44.855 --> 01:26:46.016]  That's my point.
[01:26:46.016 --> 01:26:47.637]  All under the radar.
[01:26:47.637 --> 01:26:49.438]  This seems like to be one of their only tricks.
[01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:50.999]  They've got five or six tricks they do.
[01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:52.740]  I mean, you can count them on both hands.
[01:26:53.964 --> 01:27:00.891]  I mean, take the North American Superhighways, the Trans-Texas Corridors, the Natna Superhighways.
[01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:03.313]  First, they announced it 10 years ago and said it was great.
[01:27:03.313 --> 01:27:04.655]  People said they didn't want it.
[01:27:04.655 --> 01:27:05.696]  They said it didn't exist.
[01:27:05.696 --> 01:27:07.477]  Then they changed the name again.
[01:27:07.477 --> 01:27:12.823]  Then they said they canceled the program, but in the same article announced they were just renaming it.
[01:27:14.668 --> 01:27:17.750]  SPP is now going to change their name.
[01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:18.890]  This is just incredible.
[01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:20.951]  I mean, people are seeing through this.
[01:27:20.951 --> 01:27:29.316]  And Reuters is running a press release now, because there's only things coming out about this meeting in the last hours before the meeting happened.
[01:27:29.316 --> 01:27:36.179]  I mean, I can't see anything on television or any announcements really from the White House that this is a big deal meeting.
[01:27:36.179 --> 01:27:37.800]  It's very low-key.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.882]  But on the agenda is that the Mexican trucks are going to come back into the United States.
[01:27:42.859 --> 01:27:46.261]  I reported on this in Red Alert and at World Net Daily.
[01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:50.384]  No one seems to be... You're covering it, Alex, but very few are.
[01:27:50.384 --> 01:27:54.226]  That there's going to be reintroduced legislation.
[01:27:54.226 --> 01:28:02.371]  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has now gotten it through all the internal Obama Administration departments.
[01:28:02.371 --> 01:28:07.614]  And as you recall, the money was taken out of the Department of Transportation to Democrats.
[01:28:07.614 --> 01:28:10.636]  It was North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan.
[01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:26.911]  And also Peter DeFazio, he was in the House, leading the effort to take out the money from the Department of Transportation budget to discontinue the Bush Administration Mexican Truck Demonstration Project.
[01:28:26.911 --> 01:28:34.214]  Now the legislation is going to say they have new rules, and suddenly the Mexican trucks are going to be safe under the U.S.
[01:28:34.214 --> 01:28:37.815]  Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance standards, which is a joke.
[01:28:38.642 --> 01:28:42.668]  Mexican drugs don't beat standards with brakes or with equipment.
[01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:46.273]  In other capacities, they don't beat hours or time on the road.
[01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:55.137]  Well, regardless, Doctor, as you know, you've been to many of these events and covered them and written a best-selling book about it, The Late Great USA.
[01:28:55.137 --> 01:29:04.565]  Even if they did a great job, which they're not, it's unconstitutional, it's criminal to take our liberty, our freedom, our sovereignty, and give it to these unelected boards.
[01:29:04.565 --> 01:29:13.133]  Reuters is reporting on it, but they're acting like it's just an anti-drug summit, which is what Pasteur, your archenemy, our archenemy, your nemesis,
[01:29:14.854 --> 01:29:27.900]  And the Reuters has put the drug issue right at the top of their press release.
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:32.602]  Mexico's drug war is what this is evidently being billed as being about.
[01:29:32.602 --> 01:29:38.025]  But again, it should be, I believe, the fifth meeting of the Security and Prosperity Partnership Annual Summit.
[01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:39.030]  Amazing.
[01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.891]  Tell us more about it.
[01:29:39.891 --> 01:29:41.112]  You're the expert on this.
[01:29:41.112 --> 01:29:45.555]  When we get back, Dr. Jerome Corsi, then we'll get into the latest birther issue.
[01:29:45.555 --> 01:29:51.018]  Dr. Corsi's been doing in-depth research with the state of Hawaii.
[01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.419]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.419 --> 01:29:54.941]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.941 --> 01:29:57.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:05.643]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:31.300]  We're good.
[01:31:00.305 --> 01:31:01.666]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:03.668]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:31:03.668 --> 01:31:04.649]  Well, you should.
[01:31:04.649 --> 01:31:09.133]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:31:09.133 --> 01:31:09.954]  That's right.
[01:31:09.954 --> 01:31:18.622]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:31:18.622 --> 01:31:19.964]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:31:19.964 --> 01:31:21.125]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:31:21.305 --> 01:31:27.289]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:31:27.289 --> 01:31:34.193]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:31:34.193 --> 01:31:39.376]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:31:39.716 --> 01:31:41.177]  This is real.
[01:31:41.177 --> 01:31:42.218]  Don't miss out.
[01:31:42.218 --> 01:31:50.784]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[01:31:50.784 --> 01:31:53.166]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:31:53.166 --> 01:31:56.849]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:31:56.849 --> 01:31:59.751]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:32:01.024 --> 01:32:08.149]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:24.361]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:32:24.361 --> 01:32:29.485]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:32:29.705 --> 01:32:36.230]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:40.133]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:32:40.133 --> 01:32:42.815]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[01:32:42.815 --> 01:32:48.179]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:32:48.499 --> 01:32:51.160]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.400]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.901]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:32:55.901 --> 01:33:00.242]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:07.343]  We don't need no education.
[01:33:07.343 --> 01:33:13.885]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:33:19.748 --> 01:33:24.673]  Talk sarcasm in the classroom.
[01:33:24.673 --> 01:33:29.477]  Teach to leave their kids alone.
[01:33:41.815 --> 01:33:43.496]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:43.496 --> 01:33:44.297]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:44.297 --> 01:33:45.398]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:45.398 --> 01:33:46.799]  We are here live.
[01:33:46.799 --> 01:33:50.501]  I'm doing an abbreviated Sunday transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:51.442]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:51.442 --> 01:33:55.625]  Dr. Corsi, I want to continue with the SPP North American Union meeting going on.
[01:33:56.553 --> 01:34:09.665]  You know, for years they would deny that even existed, and then you and others, Judicial Watch, sued, got their internal documents, there they were, saying it's North American Union, a global carbon tax, we gotta keep this secret from the public.
[01:34:09.665 --> 01:34:13.488]  I mean, very incriminating, especially the Banff Canada meeting.
[01:34:13.488 --> 01:34:16.431]  And again, your book, Late Great USA, latest edition out.
[01:34:16.431 --> 01:34:20.595]  We carry that, discounted, at Infowars.com, the online video bookstore.
[01:34:21.275 --> 01:34:29.118]  You also are writing on the most up-to-date stuff at WorldNetDaily.com, or WND.com, and also in your newsletter.
[01:34:29.118 --> 01:34:32.019]  Tell us about some of those places we can check out your work.
[01:34:32.019 --> 01:34:34.020]  Well, the newsletter is the most recent.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.241]  It's RedAlert.WND.com.
[01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:38.862]  RedAlert.WND.com.
[01:34:38.862 --> 01:34:42.543]  The subscription newsletter, I'm writing it every week.
[01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:46.325]  There's also a bar on the WorldNetDaily homepage, the gray bar on the left.
[01:34:47.105 --> 01:34:49.446]  It's under $100 for the year, so it's about $2 a week.
[01:34:49.446 --> 01:34:52.468]  You can also subscribe weekly.
[01:34:52.468 --> 01:34:53.989]  Um, and thank you for asking.
[01:34:53.989 --> 01:34:55.530]  Alex, I appreciate it.
[01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:56.290]  I'll tell you better.
[01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.491]  Well, folks, check it out.
[01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:59.492]  What new book are you working on right now?
[01:34:59.492 --> 01:35:00.833]  It'll be out in October.
[01:35:00.833 --> 01:35:02.774]  It's called America for Sale.
[01:35:02.774 --> 01:35:04.135]  I've written it.
[01:35:04.135 --> 01:35:04.956]  It'll be out.
[01:35:04.956 --> 01:35:07.697]  I'm covering globalism, the New World Order.
[01:35:07.697 --> 01:35:09.859]  It's right on the theme you cover, Alex.
[01:35:09.859 --> 01:35:10.779]  I think you're going to find.
[01:35:10.779 --> 01:35:15.622]  Well, come on the show and be with you for a special interview when the book is out in October.
[01:35:16.733 --> 01:35:17.554]  America for sale.
[01:35:32.054 --> 01:35:37.795]  You know, this multi-merger of the Parliaments and the Congresses of the three nations.
[01:35:37.795 --> 01:35:40.016]  Where is their program, as best we can tell?
[01:35:40.016 --> 01:35:42.816]  Are things going well for them?
[01:35:42.816 --> 01:35:46.757]  Or, you know, how is this integration into the world government going?
[01:35:46.757 --> 01:35:53.858]  Well, I think clearly the exposure, Alex, that we've all given to this, you know, your show has been a major influence.
[01:35:53.858 --> 01:35:58.259]  You know, the books I've written that you've referenced, we've all made it clear to the American people
[01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:23.943]  That the Security and Prosperity Partnership is a North American integration effort, and the exposure hurt the ability of these secret working groups to, in private, without the public involvement, without transparency, no public representatives at all, close doors, to set North American administrative rules as a prelude to a European Union-style government and even a new currency like the emerald.
[01:36:23.943 --> 01:36:28.765]  Now, also, I think the recession, which is a failure of the global economy,
[01:36:29.989 --> 01:36:39.138]  It's going to have a very hard time recovering because so many structural unemployment has created so many jobs in the middle class that are simply gone.
[01:36:39.138 --> 01:36:49.429]  Manufacturing jobs that are not going to return because the multinational corporations have found slaves somewhere in the world that can do those jobs cheaper than Americans.
[01:36:49.429 --> 01:36:50.951]  Now, when you put all this together,
[01:36:51.738 --> 01:36:58.584]  The agenda among the globalists is still advancing, and Obama's clearly a globalist.
[01:36:58.584 --> 01:37:03.088]  Remember, Alexi campaigned, President Obama went campaigning.
[01:37:03.088 --> 01:37:08.073]  He had Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan, said he was going to renegotiate NAFTA.
[01:37:08.073 --> 01:37:17.061]  He even fired Austin Gould, his economic advisor, who during the campaign went to Canada and said, wink, wink, that's just a campaign promise.
[01:37:17.682 --> 01:37:26.312]  Well, Austin Goolsbee's back in the White House, he's hired, he's part of the administration with the Council of Economic Advisors, and it was always wink-wink.
[01:37:26.312 --> 01:37:34.963]  President Obama, very quietly, on Sunday, probably the least newsworthy day of the week, is going to go to Mexico and have this big summit.
[01:37:35.529 --> 01:37:38.590]  Why doesn't he do it on a Tuesday or Wednesday, when it's fully covered?
[01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:48.335]  I was about to say, I was about to say that, of course, that usually they act like it's the second coming of Christ, when, you know, he even goes for a hamburger to play golf, especially to a foreign country.
[01:37:48.335 --> 01:37:50.596]  But there's almost no coverage of this.
[01:37:50.596 --> 01:37:58.380]  One Reuters article, some of the stories you've written, this radio show, that is, you know, really a big indicator of what's going on here.
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.561]  But just going back to the psychology of Obama.
[01:38:01.306 --> 01:38:05.978]  How he said he was going to end NAFTA and GATT and now he's fighting to reauthorize it.
[01:38:05.978 --> 01:38:09.086]  How he said he wouldn't push any gun bills and all he's done is introduce them.
[01:38:09.693 --> 01:38:13.877]  How he said he wouldn't hire one lobbyist and now he's hired nothing but lobbyists.
[01:38:13.877 --> 01:38:17.279]  More liberal rules on lobbyists writing bills than Bush had.
[01:38:17.279 --> 01:38:19.601]  Secrecy about who visits the White House.
[01:38:19.601 --> 01:38:23.004]  A new level of Cheney-level secrecy.
[01:38:23.004 --> 01:38:27.268]  I mean, lying about the Patriot Act.
[01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:29.029]  Lying about warrantless wiretapping.
[01:38:29.029 --> 01:38:34.194]  I mean, this guy is just... He makes Bill Clinton look honest!
[01:38:34.194 --> 01:38:37.857]  Well, and he's not ruling from the center as Bill Clinton did.
[01:38:38.699 --> 01:38:41.962]  This was my central argument in the Abomination.
[01:38:41.962 --> 01:38:49.228]  This is a far leftist ideologue who was raised in a Saul Alinsky environment.
[01:38:49.228 --> 01:38:51.110]  Read his own dreams for my father.
[01:38:51.110 --> 01:39:06.543]  He says his intellectual formative years were reading Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, Black Power, Frantz Fanon, the African anti-colonial writer who was a socialist revolutionary.
[01:39:07.253 --> 01:39:09.775]  This is where Barack Obama comes from.
[01:39:09.775 --> 01:39:13.197]  And to imagine that he was going to keep any of these campaign promises.
[01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:22.084]  Only people who have never read Saul Lempke's Rules for Radicals would imagine that Obama was meant anything he was promising during his campaign.
[01:39:22.745 --> 01:39:33.934]  He was saying all of the right things, so people would say, oh, he'll just be another moderate Democrat who will rule from the center, when that couldn't have been less true.
[01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:35.756]  But Dr. Corsi, isn't it more than that?
[01:39:35.756 --> 01:39:37.818]  I mean, isn't that just his left cover?
[01:39:37.818 --> 01:39:41.260]  And I understand he came from that Poverty Pimp Foundation system.
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:44.183]  The foundations create that fake, organic,
[01:39:45.178 --> 01:39:47.759]  Uh, you know, liberal, uh, M.O.
[01:39:47.759 --> 01:39:57.822]  to pimp out and control their local slaves and to use them as political weapons to menace the middle class into submission in the major urban centers.
[01:39:57.822 --> 01:40:06.584]  Uh, I mean, isn't Obama getting four times the money of John McCain, just a total corporate, slick-tongued Harvard, uh, lawyer?
[01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:09.105]  I mean, I know you're from Harvard, too, but I'm not bashing Harvard.
[01:40:09.105 --> 01:40:11.906]  The point is, isn't he just a, just a corporate shill?
[01:40:11.906 --> 01:40:13.286]  I mean, you think he really is a,
[01:40:14.068 --> 01:40:15.249]  Communist?
[01:40:15.249 --> 01:40:19.110]  His top advisors come from Wall Street, from Barack Obama.
[01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:24.672]  If you look at the list, you've got Goldman Sachs, you've got many of the banks, even, that were involved in the bailout.
[01:40:24.672 --> 01:40:30.034]  You've got lawyers from, you know, top law firms in Washington and New York.
[01:40:30.034 --> 01:40:32.915]  Barack Obama drew money just like John McCain did.
[01:40:32.915 --> 01:40:34.416]  They both did.
[01:40:34.416 --> 01:40:39.278]  From virtually the same Wall Street banker-lawyer group.
[01:40:39.278 --> 01:40:41.619]  George Soros also funded John McCain.
[01:40:42.293 --> 01:40:48.075]  I wrote that and documented that going back into World Wide Daily before the campaign.
[01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:49.996]  Sure, so they own both Fighters and the 5-0.
[01:40:49.996 --> 01:40:54.338]  No matter who won, Wall Street and Soros have won.
[01:40:54.338 --> 01:40:55.578]  The globalists won.
[01:40:55.578 --> 01:40:59.640]  But you're saying at his core he is a... He's a leftist.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:02.001]  He's a socialist at his core.
[01:41:02.001 --> 01:41:04.202]  That's what I've always argued.
[01:41:04.202 --> 01:41:10.765]  And when he gets the opportunity to rule the way he wants to rule, he forgets all the campaign promises.
[01:41:12.571 --> 01:41:13.651]  But that's what I'm saying is that
[01:41:36.212 --> 01:41:38.756]  He's got goons everywhere beating people up.
[01:41:38.756 --> 01:41:43.785]  The reports are confirmed out of Missouri, New York, California, Texas.
[01:41:43.785 --> 01:41:48.232]  I mean he really does want an army of Obamanoids out there knocking people in the head.
[01:41:48.232 --> 01:41:49.314]  This guy...
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:53.981]  I mean, I know you and Webster Tarble and many others said he would do this.
[01:41:53.981 --> 01:41:54.702]  Yes.
[01:41:54.702 --> 01:42:09.666]  But to actually see brown shirts in America, to actually see them running around beating everybody up and police on the news saying don't talk bad about Obama or we'll arrest you, do you ever feel like you're going to wake up in a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode, Dr. Tarble?
[01:42:09.666 --> 01:42:14.308]  Sometimes it does feel bad, but you know, I said that the community organizers and
[01:42:14.957 --> 01:42:20.661]  You've got to realize, Alex, that I've been dealing with the leftist community organizers back to the 1960s.
[01:42:20.661 --> 01:42:24.663]  For me, this is four decades of fighting this issue.
[01:42:24.663 --> 01:42:27.685]  But now they're not the hippies out in the street.
[01:42:27.685 --> 01:42:30.547]  So now they're not the hippies out in the street, they're now the police.
[01:42:30.547 --> 01:42:40.813]  They grew up, they put on business suit, they got into the power establishment, and it's okay now for them to take billions of taxpayer money and give it to ACORN.
[01:42:41.516 --> 01:42:46.959]  Billions that make sure that they can still community organized from the far left.
[01:42:46.959 --> 01:43:08.853]  But if anybody, including ordinary citizens, grandparents, show up at these meetings, not organized, not paid for, not professional agitators, then what happens is the Obama people demonize these senior citizens and others attending the town hall meetings, and they send out the SEIU and other left-funded
[01:43:09.358 --> 01:43:09.799]  I don't know.
[01:43:27.285 --> 01:43:29.006]  That's what the left has always done.
[01:43:29.006 --> 01:43:35.671]  The left is... The Obama far-left community organizer is not about free speech.
[01:43:35.671 --> 01:43:39.033]  It's a Chicago big city machine enforcer?
[01:43:39.033 --> 01:43:50.281]  Yes, and with the background of a socialist ideology that if you do not agree with, you're by definition an enemy of the state.
[01:43:50.674 --> 01:43:56.796]  Well, that's what they were saying, is they ran up to this black guy on video and said, how can a black guy be against Obama?
[01:43:56.796 --> 01:44:00.377]  And then called him the N-word and punched him in the nose.
[01:44:00.377 --> 01:44:01.137]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:44:01.137 --> 01:44:14.580]  I mean, they, the whole issue is the race, you know, you read Paul Krugman today at the New York Times, and so the, the middle class people attending these town hall meetings are defined by Paul Krugman as racist.
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.481]  Anybody who objects to Barack Obama is racist.
[01:44:17.363 --> 01:44:26.230]  But yet, if you want to advance that argument, the expectation from the left is that they're going to get 100% of the African-American votes.
[01:44:26.230 --> 01:44:33.556]  And any African-American who dares be conservative and object to Barack Obama is going to get doubly demonized by the left.
[01:44:33.556 --> 01:44:38.360]  Well, I was reading the Post-Dispatch and other articles and made a slight mistake.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:43.184]  They did arrest a reporter who didn't deserve to be arrested, and they did arrest some of the people who were against
[01:44:45.896 --> 01:44:53.218]  against what Obama's doing with health care, but they also did arrest one of the people that did assault the innocent Tea Party person.
[01:44:53.218 --> 01:44:56.419]  So the police did appear to do a better job.
[01:44:56.419 --> 01:44:57.480]  So good for them.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:04.422]  The police are usually, in my experience with the police in America, the police are doing their best to try to preserve order.
[01:45:04.422 --> 01:45:08.383]  The police are trying to maintain a peaceful situation.
[01:45:08.383 --> 01:45:10.384]  The video I saw, even with the FBI,
[01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:21.278]  Protesters causing trouble at a couple of these rallies over the last couple of days, the police have done everything they can just to quiet things down and to be even-handed.
[01:45:21.278 --> 01:45:33.250]  But the police are being put into an untenable situation if the far left is going to call out its thugs to try to disrupt these meetings so that they appear to have been disruptive from the beginning.
[01:45:33.874 --> 01:45:34.254]  They're not.
[01:45:34.254 --> 01:45:35.495]  These are angry people.
[01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:36.675]  That's why they're doing that.
[01:45:36.675 --> 01:45:37.196]  That's right.
[01:45:37.196 --> 01:45:38.576]  In fact, the news... Sure.
[01:45:38.576 --> 01:45:43.979]  When I read the Pittsburgh Post-Dispatch, their own reporter got arrested for no reason.
[01:45:43.979 --> 01:45:47.420]  And then the Post acted like that was a good thing.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:52.042]  And the Post is... is... just incredible.
[01:45:52.042 --> 01:45:54.203]  I mean, it's incredible how they distort.
[01:45:54.203 --> 01:45:56.965]  And meanwhile, I'm sure you've seen all the articles.
[01:45:56.965 --> 01:45:58.265]  We have a CNN piece.
[01:45:58.265 --> 01:46:01.967]  They're saying the Obama Joker picture is racist.
[01:46:02.831 --> 01:46:15.637]  When all it's showing is a psychopathic lying criminal, and the very magazine that showed George Bush as a vampire... Well, they did a Joker picture of George W. Bush, too, and no one on the left objected to that, that I can recall.
[01:46:15.637 --> 01:46:20.960]  But, I mean, is Obama a god, like Hitler or Stalin, where you can't make fun of him?
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:30.965]  Because the Democrats are in the news calling it dangerous, calling it illegal, saying it should be taken down, calling it... This is the totalitarianism of the political left.
[01:46:30.965 --> 01:46:31.785]  It's been this way
[01:46:32.961 --> 01:46:34.962]  Since 1917.
[01:46:34.962 --> 01:46:38.123]  It's been this way since the 1960s.
[01:46:38.123 --> 01:46:42.986]  When you were dealing with SDS, leftist radicals like Bill Ayers.
[01:46:42.986 --> 01:46:45.907]  They never have tolerated on the far left free speech.
[01:46:45.907 --> 01:46:51.949]  If you object to the left, you are by definition a racist, an imperialist, a colonialist.
[01:46:51.949 --> 01:46:53.270]  They give all the other names.
[01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:57.872]  You can't have a position that is tolerated by the left unless you agree with them.
[01:46:58.277 --> 01:47:07.812]  Listen, I've had the anarchists, not all of them, you know, the certain groups that are hired by big foundations, they'll just come over and you could be talking about... you could be talking about...
[01:47:08.826 --> 01:47:15.390]  You know, the sky being blue, and they'll just start poking you, calling you a racist, and it's a religion to them, and they smile.
[01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:16.972]  They know you're not a racist.
[01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:19.893]  They're just using it as their big foundation weapon.
[01:47:19.893 --> 01:47:24.356]  I mean, take Nancy Pelosi saying, you're astroturf racist.
[01:47:24.356 --> 01:47:26.078]  If you're against healthcare, you're a racist.
[01:47:26.078 --> 01:47:28.359]  I mean, it really is comical.
[01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:31.561]  It's like a bunch of parrots just chirping the same word.
[01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:37.025]  It seemed like Nancy Pelosi took her talking points right off of a Daily Cause column and posted it.
[01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:39.832]  I'm looking for the swastika pictures.
[01:47:39.832 --> 01:47:43.955]  I don't see swastika people coming in with swastika pictures.
[01:47:43.955 --> 01:47:46.737]  This is not a far-right protest.
[01:47:46.737 --> 01:47:48.338]  It's a middle American protest.
[01:47:48.338 --> 01:48:01.888]  And from the left, the left tactic has always been, when there's getting a strong uprising from middle America against them, they'll try to make middle America appear as if middle America is violent.
[01:48:01.888 --> 01:48:05.491]  So the attempt has been to get these events to be portrayed as
[01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:18.047]  Not just angry expressions of opinion, but intentionally created disruptive, violent protests from the organized radical right, which could not be farther from the truth.
[01:48:18.047 --> 01:48:26.552]  I mean, the Republican Party right now is so disorganized, I don't know that the Republican Party could organize a Sunday afternoon picnic.
[01:48:26.552 --> 01:48:30.514]  The idea that the Republican Party is driving these protests is not the case at all.
[01:48:31.328 --> 01:48:40.050]  Many of these people who are showing up at these rallies are just as angry at the Republican Party of George Bush as they are at the Democratic Party of Barack Obama.
[01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:44.671]  Well, I just, you know, Dr. Corsi, I just can't believe that I pick up the St.
[01:48:44.671 --> 01:48:57.315]  Louis Post-Dispatch and it says that anti-Obama health care people cause a disturbance and then you watch the videos and it's the Obama people attacking them.
[01:48:57.315 --> 01:48:58.215]  The likelihood is
[01:48:58.914 --> 01:49:05.119]  That the peaceful middle Americans who are at these meetings are going to be blamed for the violence, whether they cause it or not.
[01:49:05.119 --> 01:49:15.828]  And the left, knowing that, just wants to have these events disrupted so the image is created that this is a violent reaction against President Obama.
[01:49:15.828 --> 01:49:19.691]  Which it's not, even if that has to be generated or concocted.
[01:49:19.691 --> 01:49:27.397]  And that's where, you know, I'm concerned to see now the White House, instead of taking the position of defending the right of middle Americans,
[01:49:28.046 --> 01:49:31.788]  The White House ought to be out there saying, we're listening.
[01:49:55.891 --> 01:49:57.692]  I don't mind, by the way, being responsible.
[01:49:57.692 --> 01:50:00.573]  I expect to be held responsible for these issues because I'm the president.
[01:50:24.975 --> 01:50:29.257]  But I don't want the folks who created the mess.
[01:50:29.257 --> 01:50:32.219]  I don't want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking.
[01:50:32.219 --> 01:50:34.860]  I want them just to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:39.142]  We did not come this far by lowering our sights.
[01:50:39.142 --> 01:50:40.302]  We're going to talk about this when we get back.
[01:50:40.302 --> 01:50:42.203]  Final segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:50:42.203 --> 01:50:45.365]  You notice here that
[01:50:47.398 --> 01:50:50.400]  He says anybody that opposes him created the mess.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.563]  He sounds more like Al Sharpton, and pretty soon he's going to start sounding like Reverend Wright if he keeps going this way.
[01:50:56.563 --> 01:50:59.125]  Well, but you notice he's saying, I don't want to hear talk from you.
[01:50:59.125 --> 01:51:01.306]  He says, I don't want to hear your speech.
[01:51:01.306 --> 01:51:02.727]  It is a big idea.
[01:51:02.727 --> 01:51:05.548]  A new world order.
[01:51:05.548 --> 01:51:10.371]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:51:10.371 --> 01:51:13.273]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:13.273 --> 01:51:15.434]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:51:16.044 --> 01:51:19.229]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:26.539]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:35.024]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:35.024 --> 01:51:38.885]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:38.885 --> 01:51:41.427]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:51:41.427 --> 01:51:42.607]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:42.607 --> 01:51:43.388]  They're not after money.
[01:51:43.388 --> 01:51:44.688]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:44.688 --> 01:51:45.669]  They're after power.
[01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:46.809]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:52:59.833 --> 01:53:06.777]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:53:06.777 --> 01:53:09.639]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:53:09.639 --> 01:53:14.281]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:53:14.281 --> 01:53:18.784]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door or safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:53:18.784 --> 01:53:20.685]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:53:20.805 --> 01:53:21.305]  We're good to go.
[01:53:41.477 --> 01:53:43.679]  But I don't want the folks who created the mess
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:09.801]  I don't want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking.
[01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:12.482]  I want them just to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess.
[01:54:12.482 --> 01:54:18.084]  We did not come this far by lowering our sights or scaling back our dreams.
[01:54:18.084 --> 01:54:20.425]  That's not the American way.
[01:54:20.425 --> 01:54:22.986]  It's not about looking backwards, it's about looking forwards.
[01:54:22.986 --> 01:54:27.307]  You know, we haven't even gotten into the whole Berger issue, where I ran with Jerome Corsi, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:54:32.768 --> 01:54:38.713]  But, uh, it's outrageous to hear him say that anybody that opposes anything he's doing, we all cause the mess.
[01:54:38.713 --> 01:54:47.920]  See, that's why the Democrats need the Republicans, and the Republicans need the Democrats to always blame what's happening on the other party when they're all in bed together.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:52.143]  But there's no doubt, Obama is very anti-liberty, anti-freedom.
[01:54:52.993 --> 01:54:57.275]  And, uh, the good news is, Dr. Corsi, I don't see him getting away with any of this.
[01:54:57.275 --> 01:55:06.078]  I think everybody knows he is a con artist, lying scammer, reading off a teleprompter, and I think he's going to be one of the most unpopular presidents ever.
[01:55:06.078 --> 01:55:08.659]  I don't think there's any way he's going to win re-election.
[01:55:08.659 --> 01:55:11.741]  Well, when I wrote the abomination, I compared him to Jimmy Carter.
[01:55:11.741 --> 01:55:13.781]  And I think he's going to do worse than Jimmy Carter.
[01:55:13.781 --> 01:55:19.204]  I don't see him, I don't see President Obama surviving to get into a second term to be re-elected.
[01:55:19.204 --> 01:55:22.465]  I mean, I don't think politically he's going to survive to
[01:55:27.642 --> 01:55:33.027]  Well, I've never seen him look angry, and in these clips, he looks like an egomaniac.
[01:55:33.027 --> 01:55:35.450]  Somebody with an egomaniac doesn't care what people think.
[01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:38.313]  He looks upset in the eyes, which makes him dangerous.
[01:55:38.313 --> 01:55:43.739]  In closing, Doc, you've been talking to Hawaii about the birth certificate copies and all this.
[01:55:43.739 --> 01:55:45.921]  What do you really think is going on with the birth certificate?
[01:55:46.477 --> 01:55:51.681]  I mean, I mean, I mean, isn't there enough issues we can prove that destroy this criminal?
[01:55:51.681 --> 01:55:54.063]  Or, I mean, do you think the birth certificate really has something to it?
[01:55:54.063 --> 01:55:58.046]  Well, I think that the birth certificate, to me, this is the issue.
[01:55:58.046 --> 01:55:58.646]  Why is it?
[01:55:58.646 --> 01:56:00.768]  Let's just assume President Obama is telling the truth.
[01:56:00.768 --> 01:56:02.389]  He's born in Hawaii.
[01:56:02.389 --> 01:56:06.753]  So, why doesn't he just end this entire controversy today?
[01:56:06.753 --> 01:56:11.276]  President Obama, say, okay, you want to see my long-form, original birth certificate?
[01:56:11.276 --> 01:56:12.657]  Here it is.
[01:56:12.657 --> 01:56:13.358]  I'll show it to you.
[01:56:13.358 --> 01:56:15.119]  It's supposed to be a transparent presidency.
[01:56:16.690 --> 01:56:21.959]  President Obama and candidate Obama spent hundreds of thousands of dollars down to the million.
[01:56:21.959 --> 01:56:27.309]  In order to prevent anybody from seeing that document, his first certificate, the original long form one.
[01:56:27.958 --> 01:56:30.619]  As well as dozens of other documents about who he is.
[01:56:30.619 --> 01:56:33.459]  And now you're talking to Hawaii and they're being secretive?
[01:56:33.459 --> 01:56:34.940]  Well, Hawaii won't answer questions.
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:45.202]  Hawaii will not even authenticate that the short form certificate of law at live birth that the campaign and sites like factcheck.org have put out are authentic.
[01:56:45.202 --> 01:56:46.582]  I can't get them to authenticate.
[01:56:46.582 --> 01:56:49.603]  But again, Fact Check is one of their Soros organs, isn't it?
[01:56:49.603 --> 01:56:54.224]  It's an Annenberg organization and it ties back into the left.
[01:56:54.224 --> 01:56:57.505]  Annenberg, again, is an association, is a foundation where
[01:56:58.206 --> 01:56:58.887]  I think?
[01:57:09.741 --> 01:57:11.642]  There's a score of documents.
[01:57:11.642 --> 01:57:15.865]  This is the least vetted president, President Obama, that we've ever had.
[01:57:15.865 --> 01:57:18.286]  What about his passport records?
[01:57:18.286 --> 01:57:20.068]  How about his records in Indonesia?
[01:57:20.068 --> 01:57:21.468]  How about Barry Sitaro?
[01:57:21.468 --> 01:57:25.411]  I mean, he is the only president who had aliases and other names before.
[01:57:25.411 --> 01:57:26.792]  He really is creepy.
[01:57:26.792 --> 01:57:29.614]  I want to see his law firm records.
[01:57:29.614 --> 01:57:31.475]  He's admitted that as a lawyer,
[01:57:32.502 --> 01:57:36.283]  Obama worked with Tony Rescoe, who's now in federal prison.
[01:57:36.283 --> 01:57:42.864]  I'd like to see the hours that he billed and how much work he really did in that law firm for Tony Rescoe.
[01:57:42.864 --> 01:57:45.245]  How about his records at Occidental College?
[01:57:45.245 --> 01:57:47.845]  Did he... He was rooming with Pakistani students.
[01:57:47.845 --> 01:57:49.386]  Usually universities don't put U.S.
[01:57:49.386 --> 01:57:51.766]  students with foreign exchange students.
[01:57:51.766 --> 01:57:54.607]  Did Barack Obama apply as a foreign exchange student?
[01:57:55.376 --> 01:57:57.318]  He traveled to Pakistan with those students.
[01:57:57.318 --> 01:57:59.641]  Did he go on an Indonesian passport?
[01:57:59.641 --> 01:58:01.123]  Did he have an Indonesian passport?
[01:58:01.123 --> 01:58:04.627]  Yeah, we know they've sealed all his records like no president.
[01:58:04.627 --> 01:58:05.388]  Everything's sealed!
[01:58:06.016 --> 01:58:08.098]  They are acting very, very suspicious.
[01:58:08.098 --> 01:58:10.020]  And that's the birth certificate issue.
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:13.424]  Maybe the big secret is... I'm not saying he was born in Kenya.
[01:58:13.424 --> 01:58:14.745]  I'm an investigative reporter.
[01:58:14.745 --> 01:58:16.587]  I can't prove that.
[01:58:16.587 --> 01:58:18.489]  I'm just saying, give us the document.
[01:58:18.489 --> 01:58:19.650]  We want to see the document.
[01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:26.637]  And why does even a birth certificate in the long form have to be a top secret document to steal?
[01:58:28.562 --> 01:58:29.743]  Hold on one second, Undercourse.
[01:58:29.743 --> 01:58:33.065]  I know you've got other stuff to do here in a moment, but we're about to break for one minute.
[01:58:33.065 --> 01:58:35.626]  I wanted to talk to you off-air for just a moment.
[01:58:35.626 --> 01:58:36.767]  So stay with us.
[01:58:36.767 --> 01:58:42.210]  And Bob Chapman's coming up on the economy.
[01:58:42.210 --> 01:58:45.712]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.712 --> 01:58:47.754]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.274 --> 01:58:54.277]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.277 --> 01:58:59.622]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.622 --> 01:59:01.664]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.664 --> 01:59:06.669]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:07.570]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:08.951]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:10.852]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.852 --> 01:59:11.913]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.913 --> 01:59:14.114]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.114 --> 01:59:15.455]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.455 --> 01:59:16.996]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:16.996 --> 01:59:22.260]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.842]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.842 --> 01:59:29.305]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.665 --> 01:59:30.886]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.886 --> 01:59:31.786]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.786 --> 01:59:32.887]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.887 --> 01:59:33.828]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.828 --> 01:59:34.908]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.908 --> 01:59:37.970]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:38.490]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:40.171]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:40.171 --> 01:59:41.172]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.172 --> 01:59:42.353]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.353 --> 01:59:44.194]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.052 --> 02:00:09.877]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.877 --> 02:00:11.458]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.458 --> 02:00:13.040]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:17.204]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.204 --> 02:00:22.129]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:28.195]  Sherry Tinpenny is joining us coming up in the next segment to break down her overview of what's going on with this flu situation.
[02:00:28.195 --> 02:00:29.456]  We know it's staged.
[02:00:30.563 --> 02:00:32.645]  We know this is a staged event.
[02:00:32.645 --> 02:00:36.148]  We know the Army's getting ready to set up martial law checkpoints.
[02:00:36.148 --> 02:00:39.311]  CNN, PrisonPlanet.com, we've got all the reports up there.
[02:00:39.311 --> 02:00:41.973]  And I'm going to blitz through that with her coming up.
[02:00:41.973 --> 02:00:45.096]  But I want to say it again, this is a mission what we do here.
[02:00:45.096 --> 02:00:49.379]  I don't risk my name, my treasure, my life, my family for nothing.
[02:00:49.379 --> 02:00:51.301]  I know we've got to fight bullies.
[02:00:51.301 --> 02:00:56.926]  And I'm asking listeners, whether you listen on AM or FM dial, global shortwave, the internet, the podcast,
[02:00:57.831 --> 02:01:02.615]  However you do it, please tell one person a day, physically about the show.
[02:01:02.615 --> 02:01:07.658]  At work, or on the road, or calling to talk radio.
[02:01:07.658 --> 02:01:11.681]  Not just other Patriot or Liberty programs, but other mainline programs.
[02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:16.044]  We are exploding and reaching millions of people every week now, because you've been doing this.
[02:01:16.044 --> 02:01:19.467]  Let's redouble, and then redouble, and redouble, and redouble.
[02:01:21.235 --> 02:01:24.097]  You'd think I'd do enough in the fight against the New World Order, but no!
[02:01:24.097 --> 02:01:32.124]  I am now at red lights, rolling down my window and saying, tune into this local station, tune into 590 AM, tune into 90.1 here in Austin.
[02:01:32.124 --> 02:01:33.785]  I am now doing it at grocery stores.
[02:01:33.785 --> 02:01:34.666]  I'm now speaking up.
[02:01:35.546 --> 02:01:37.107]  I've never really done this, but a few times.
[02:01:37.107 --> 02:01:39.287]  Now when I fly, I just start talking.
[02:01:39.287 --> 02:01:42.529]  You know, this is a police state, and I don't like the body scanners and this.
[02:01:42.529 --> 02:01:47.910]  Taking our shoes off is to train us to submit, and suddenly the TSA guys come up and say, we're all fans.
[02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:48.991]  We know, Alex.
[02:01:48.991 --> 02:01:49.431]  We know.
[02:01:49.431 --> 02:01:59.435]  See, I'm breaking through the blinders, the comfort zone bubble.
[02:01:59.435 --> 02:02:00.215]  And because
[02:02:02.210 --> 02:02:04.692]  I'm not going down without a fight, folks, and I'm going to fight 110%.
[02:02:04.692 --> 02:02:23.224]  And I just thank God every day that I had good parents that taught me to read history books and taught me about history and that loved me and that, you know, I again, I thought that my parents were just normal and everybody was like my family.
[02:02:23.224 --> 02:02:24.465]  And I didn't know that, uh,
[02:02:26.181 --> 02:02:35.768]  Kind of my whole Puritan family lineage, and I'm not saying I had a perfect family going back through history, but looking back on my forebears and my ancestors, I come from pretty good people.
[02:02:35.768 --> 02:02:40.371]  Pretty good, hard-working people that always stood up to evil over and over again.
[02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:47.696]  And I didn't realize that a lot of people come from scum, they enjoy evil, they enjoy screwing other people, they enjoy being bullies.
[02:02:47.696 --> 02:02:53.941]  And as I grew up, I began to realize that, but I am just so thankful that I woke up to this early.
[02:02:53.941 --> 02:02:55.502]  I'd say when I was about 16 years old,
[02:02:58.015 --> 02:03:00.217]  It wasn't even waking up.
[02:03:00.217 --> 02:03:04.819]  We did an interview with Alan Watt in Canada coming up with the new Obama film.
[02:03:04.819 --> 02:03:12.803]  And he made a point, you know, we asked him when, well, I can't really get into Canada, they had me on a terror list basically, so my team got in and barely.
[02:03:12.803 --> 02:03:15.244]  But we asked him, when did you wake up?
[02:03:15.244 --> 02:03:17.145]  And he said, I was born awake.
[02:03:17.145 --> 02:03:21.688]  Everybody just knew it where he grew up in a bad part of town, in the poor part of town in London.
[02:03:22.725 --> 02:03:28.928]  Everybody knew the system was cheating, and lying, and scamming, and it was a new world order.
[02:03:28.928 --> 02:03:33.810]  And I grew up middle class, but reading history and being informed, everybody, you just know that.
[02:03:33.810 --> 02:03:36.331]  Old timers all just knew this.
[02:03:36.331 --> 02:03:38.932]  So I really was brought up awake.
[02:03:38.932 --> 02:03:43.174]  I just didn't realize that other people weren't awake.
[02:03:43.174 --> 02:03:43.454]  I didn't
[02:03:44.813 --> 02:03:46.874]  And I didn't take seriously the history.
[02:03:46.874 --> 02:03:50.576]  I didn't realize my duty to fight the evil.
[02:03:50.576 --> 02:03:56.759]  But, yeah, no, I was... I wasn't born awake, but I was born into people that were awake.
[02:03:56.759 --> 02:03:58.901]  And not people that were awake and really active.
[02:03:58.901 --> 02:04:04.143]  I mean, you know, my dad's idea of being active was stopping and helping every person he saw change tires.
[02:04:04.143 --> 02:04:05.604]  We'd say, no, don't stop!
[02:04:05.604 --> 02:04:07.025]  We want to go eat!
[02:04:07.025 --> 02:04:08.226]  Or, you know, we're on a road trip.
[02:04:08.226 --> 02:04:11.207]  We want to get to, you know, to the National Park.
[02:04:11.207 --> 02:04:11.507]  Don't!
[02:04:11.507 --> 02:04:12.568]  And he'd pull over and help them.
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:15.442]  And then sometimes they'd be crazy people.
[02:04:15.442 --> 02:04:16.583]  Sometimes they'd be scammers.
[02:04:16.583 --> 02:04:20.527]  Sometimes they'd be... And, you know, society's so corrupt and evil now.
[02:04:20.527 --> 02:04:24.971]  My dad, like 10 years ago, tried to stop somebody and help them, and they tried to jump him and rob him.
[02:04:24.971 --> 02:04:26.773]  It was a scam.
[02:04:26.773 --> 02:04:28.475]  And so, you know, he doesn't do that anymore.
[02:04:30.552 --> 02:04:32.953]  See, evil has a way of taking over.
[02:04:32.953 --> 02:04:36.175]  And then it pushes good people back and makes us kind of give up.
[02:04:36.175 --> 02:04:36.896]  No!
[02:04:36.896 --> 02:04:41.018]  The answer is not pulling your feelers back, but getting more out there.
[02:04:41.018 --> 02:04:50.764]  When evil starts trying to push you around, you gotta... You gotta step in even stronger.
[02:04:50.764 --> 02:04:52.104]  You gotta take the ground.
[02:04:52.104 --> 02:04:53.665]  You gotta hold it.
[02:04:53.665 --> 02:04:54.626]  You gotta occupy it.
[02:05:00.647 --> 02:05:05.950]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:08.031]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:05:08.031 --> 02:05:10.492]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:10.492 --> 02:05:12.774]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:12.774 --> 02:05:14.374]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:14.374 --> 02:05:15.415]  There is a solution.
[02:05:15.655 --> 02:05:24.078]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:06:00.759 --> 02:06:04.983]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:06:04.983 --> 02:06:07.005]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:06:07.005 --> 02:06:15.534]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:21.079]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:06:21.079 --> 02:06:22.701]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:29.443]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:06:29.443 --> 02:06:40.485]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:06:40.485 --> 02:06:41.266]  That's right.
[02:06:41.266 --> 02:06:43.826]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:06:43.826 --> 02:06:45.407]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:06:47.347 --> 02:06:48.008]  We're good to go.
[02:07:00.728 --> 02:07:02.110]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.110 --> 02:07:04.112]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:07:04.112 --> 02:07:05.073]  Well, you should.

[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:39.803]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[02:08:00.274 --> 02:08:06.057]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.057 --> 02:08:08.339]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:14.338 --> 02:08:17.982]  It is Thursday, 30th day of July 2009.
[02:08:17.982 --> 02:08:21.967]  Medical doctor Sherry Tinfenny is going to join us for the balance of the hour.
[02:08:21.967 --> 02:08:31.238]  I will continue discussing the staged flu pandemic, the global United Nations level six, the executive orders after she leaves us in the next hour.
[02:08:31.898 --> 02:08:36.222]  Then it's the anniversary of the murder of the latest anthrax patsy.
[02:08:36.222 --> 02:08:45.732]  We'll do an hour on that and tie it into the flu and the history of staged government bio-attacks like the zoological agricultural staged attack.
[02:08:45.732 --> 02:08:51.217]  The British government admits that they launched the foot and mouth but they say it was an accident.
[02:08:51.217 --> 02:08:55.161]  Showed up in dozens of locations in one day by accident released from port and down.
[02:08:56.263 --> 02:08:59.164]  Military to work with FEMA during swine flu pandemic.
[02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:00.284]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:00.284 --> 02:09:05.926]  According to CNN report, the military will assist civilian authorities in the event of a significant swine flu outbreak.
[02:09:05.926 --> 02:09:08.006]  Coordinating lockdown of cities, you name it.
[02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:09.787]  This is all in the level six.
[02:09:09.787 --> 02:09:12.527]  We're under UN control, under level six.
[02:09:12.527 --> 02:09:13.788]  Here's another report.
[02:09:13.788 --> 02:09:15.888]  CBS News, under executive order 13,375.
[02:09:15.888 --> 02:09:17.148]  Forced inoculations.
[02:09:17.148 --> 02:09:18.229]  Forced quarantining.
[02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.829]  Army lockdowns.
[02:09:24.531 --> 02:09:28.955]  Why did I come out in March 5th on this TV slash radio show?
[02:09:28.955 --> 02:09:31.516]  We now are live at PrisonPlanet.TV by the way.
[02:09:31.516 --> 02:09:36.000]  Sam will cast in the last three hours of the show for those that are listening on radio.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:43.085]  Why did I go on the air and say in the cards I see stage flu pandemic?
[02:09:43.085 --> 02:09:48.790]  Well because I had emergency managers, media people, FBI sources, federal marshal sources,
[02:09:50.017 --> 02:09:59.621]  And then of course all this got confirmed in the next few months, saying they're building mass graves, they're going to local cemeteries in New York, Indiana, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, everywhere!
[02:10:00.365 --> 02:10:04.127]  Getting ready for mass graves, saying there's going to be a flu outbreak in the fall.
[02:10:04.127 --> 02:10:05.648]  It's going to happen.
[02:10:05.648 --> 02:10:06.708]  The army's involved.
[02:10:06.708 --> 02:10:10.811]  They're drilling with local police, practicing bringing in the flu vaccine.
[02:10:10.811 --> 02:10:18.235]  Quote, militia gun owners try to attack and steal the flu vaccine when creating that Christmas toy scenario where everybody's got to have it.
[02:10:18.235 --> 02:10:25.599]  And the militias, who are actually running from the flu vaccine, because they know what's going on, would be killing to get it.
[02:10:25.599 --> 02:10:25.819]  Then,
[02:10:26.912 --> 02:10:28.553]  That was the first secret drill.
[02:10:28.553 --> 02:10:31.015]  Then they start fear-mongering a few deaths in the U.S.
[02:10:31.015 --> 02:10:33.037]  and Mexico.
[02:10:33.037 --> 02:10:36.600]  That's the next fake drill in April.
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.601]  And I said, this is a drill.
[02:10:38.601 --> 02:10:43.946]  But I said, it's scary because they're saying end of the world, millions could die, billions could die potentially.
[02:10:44.744 --> 02:10:50.668]  Baxter was tied in, live bird flu, mixed in with vaccines, homeless people dying, mainstream news.
[02:10:50.668 --> 02:10:53.730]  I said, in the fall, they're gonna launch.
[02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:58.153]  Then Napolitano comes out weeks later and says exactly what I foresaw.
[02:10:58.153 --> 02:10:59.054]  I know them.
[02:10:59.054 --> 02:11:00.455]  I study them.
[02:11:00.455 --> 02:11:05.578]  You study a football team, you watch them for 20 years, you know a coach, you know what they're gonna do.
[02:11:05.578 --> 02:11:06.339]  I know what they're gonna do.
[02:11:07.179 --> 02:11:10.825]  And it's like being in a car with a crazy driver you know is going to wreck.
[02:11:10.825 --> 02:11:12.187]  They're going 100 miles an hour.
[02:11:12.187 --> 02:11:14.350]  You know the road's about to make a turn over the hill.
[02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:16.193]  You're saying, please, please, please.
[02:11:16.193 --> 02:11:22.722]  Now, we don't know exactly what they're planning, but we know it's staged, we know it's bad, and we know it's perfect cover.
[02:11:23.831 --> 02:11:34.398]  For the imploding banks taking over the states, the states imploding, the United States going into global banking receivership to the new Bank of the World that we will pay our carbon taxes to.
[02:11:34.398 --> 02:11:47.245]  Now we told you this ten years ago, it's now all over the news, everything will be okay if you let the Bank of the World carbon tax you and you're all going to have a national ID card that taxes you off of what you eat and what you drink and what you do.
[02:11:47.245 --> 02:11:51.168]  LA Times, New York Times, total micromanagement, total eugenics.
[02:11:51.708 --> 02:12:04.224]  The official White House science czar's own textbook for government, how to poison the water, how to sterilize us, how to destroy our industry, a post-industrial world.
[02:12:04.224 --> 02:12:06.166]  There's no denial of this.
[02:12:07.488 --> 02:12:12.932]  You know, I think God brought this out at this time, the book Ecoscience, to give us one last warning.
[02:12:12.932 --> 02:12:13.853]  No more denial.
[02:12:13.853 --> 02:12:16.035]  It's a compendium of everything we've said.
[02:12:16.035 --> 02:12:22.561]  In their words, admitting word for word what we reverse-engineered and documented they were doing from all the pieces.
[02:12:23.846 --> 02:12:34.923]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is so off the charts what's happening, and this is their perfect cover for flu pandemic, flu freaking out, flu lockdowns, even if it doesn't kill a bunch of people.
[02:12:34.923 --> 02:12:36.705]  If less than 200 died in the U.S.
[02:12:36.705 --> 02:12:39.610]  and less than 2,000 worldwide have died, and those are puff numbers,
[02:12:39.930 --> 02:12:40.831]  We're good to go.
[02:12:57.894 --> 02:13:01.418]  Uh, or will this be the cover for a massive attack?
[02:13:01.418 --> 02:13:07.284]  Have we already been given the binary first, uh, precursor to some... I mean, these people mean business.
[02:13:07.284 --> 02:13:11.528]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny now joins us.
[02:13:11.528 --> 02:13:12.849]  Uh, but I'm telling you, in my gut...
[02:13:13.835 --> 02:13:23.982]  In my intellect, at every level of my mind and research, I have seen this coming since January, February, because of the drilling, the getting ready, the gearing up.
[02:13:23.982 --> 02:13:26.864]  They're gonna use this as their excuse for martial law.
[02:13:26.864 --> 02:13:29.426]  They realize the stage terror isn't working.
[02:13:29.426 --> 02:13:32.588]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is a medical doctor from Cleveland, Ohio.
[02:13:32.588 --> 02:13:36.570]  Her board certification in emergency medicine and osteopathic manual medicine.
[02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:41.714]  And her integrative medical clinic focuses on allergy elimination,
[02:13:42.937 --> 02:13:51.923]  Including treatment of children and asthma and allergies from women's health using bio-identical hormones and breast thermography.
[02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:55.645]  Our clinic has restored the health of patients who have come from 38 states and 8 countries.
[02:13:57.245 --> 02:14:05.511]  She has recently accepted the position of Executive Director of the, and I think she's since then left that in Mexico, but it goes on from there.
[02:14:05.511 --> 02:14:08.573]  She joins us now today.
[02:14:08.573 --> 02:14:13.597]  The bio is too long to go over, and the website is drtenpenny.com.
[02:14:13.597 --> 02:14:18.861]  Doc, I did that five-minute preface to kind of lay the foundation of what I'm seeing.
[02:14:18.861 --> 02:14:23.324]  Tell us what you're seeing and where you think this is going.
[02:14:24.002 --> 02:14:26.785]  You know, Alex, I've listened to that and I've listened to you before.
[02:14:26.785 --> 02:14:33.932]  I've read Prison Planet and a lot of other documents that I have privy to, just like what you do behind the scenes.
[02:14:33.932 --> 02:14:37.415]  And I have to be in agreement with you.
[02:14:37.415 --> 02:14:43.521]  Everything is marching down the path in the same way of just what you just laid out at the top of the hour.
[02:14:43.521 --> 02:14:45.884]  My question is, and I have a question for you about this.
[02:14:46.497 --> 02:14:49.160]  I mean, it seems so focused on the U.S.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:53.484]  There is the same type of implementation being happening in other countries?
[02:14:53.484 --> 02:14:54.425]  Yes, yes.
[02:14:54.425 --> 02:14:58.869]  Every NATO country and Western countries, you know, the master planners at the U.N.
[02:14:58.869 --> 02:15:00.791]  under UNESCO, have written these.
[02:15:00.791 --> 02:15:01.632]  The whole world.
[02:15:02.578 --> 02:15:07.300]  Even Iran is following the World Health Organization level 6 guidelines.
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:20.144]  So even quote enemies are following UN orders and the UN has bragged this is the first global omnibus health system and they're saying this is good for globalism, good for the new world order.
[02:15:20.144 --> 02:15:23.826]  And so yes, they're doing the same thing worldwide.
[02:15:23.826 --> 02:15:27.027]  But you're right that the US seems to be the most intensive
[02:15:27.858 --> 02:15:28.358]  It does.
[02:15:28.358 --> 02:15:33.702]  It seems as though this is absolutely a plot and plan against the American people.
[02:15:33.702 --> 02:15:45.030]  And what is happening out of Washington under the guise of health, which has been happening in the vaccine world for years, is they put up these fancy little pictures with all the smiley little kids and saying, we're going to vaccinate you to keep you healthy.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:16:02.344]  And what I'm hoping is from the things that you're doing and I'm doing and a handful of other of us on radio and television and internet, we're going to get people awake because the only possible way that we have to revolt and stand up against this is a grassroots awakening of people just saying, no, I am not going to do this.
[02:16:02.344 --> 02:16:09.726]  I'm going to band together with people in my community and I am not going to, I'm not going to take this vaccine and I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[02:16:11.687 --> 02:16:12.247]  Absolutely.
[02:16:12.247 --> 02:16:18.388]  Doctor, you were in Mexico when all this was happening down there at a conference.
[02:16:18.388 --> 02:16:20.389]  I mean, let's go over this.
[02:16:20.389 --> 02:16:25.090]  Let's talk about this and discuss what we really know about the virus.
[02:16:25.090 --> 02:16:27.170]  It's incredibly weak.
[02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:36.372]  They're saying it'll mutate into something deadly, but I've talked to other virologists and they've said normally stuff mutates into something less strong or benign.
[02:16:36.372 --> 02:16:41.073]  You've got all these big health advisors in Europe and the United States that are on vaccine maker payroll.
[02:16:41.818 --> 02:16:45.623]  How are they coming out with a test vaccine in only months, not six months?
[02:16:45.623 --> 02:16:48.006]  The cloning technology of the virus?
[02:16:49.176 --> 02:16:57.180]  Uh, and then, openly saying they're getting ready for forced inoculations, telling medical workers they've got to take it first, the Army saying they're standing by.
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:16:58.741]  Dr. Tenpenny, you've got the floor.
[02:16:58.741 --> 02:16:59.641]  Break it down.
[02:16:59.641 --> 02:17:16.430]  Well, I agree with everything you've said, and the scariest part of all of this is that, you know, well, it's all scary, I can't say the scariest, is that as they are manufacturing this vaccine, they don't have to produce and release a package insert of what's exactly in the vaccine until it's been approved for use.
[02:17:17.188 --> 02:17:33.954]  All the scientific research that they have, there's 11 centers, NIH centers around the country that are now holding testing, human experimentation is what I call it, and these people who are rolling up their sleeves and they claim for the sake of science and getting compensation of that, somewhere between $50 and $400.
[02:17:35.915 --> 02:17:40.179]  Um, to get injected with a vaccine that has an unknown substance in it.
[02:17:40.179 --> 02:17:41.920]  There is 11 different sites.
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:44.302]  There are 4 different studies that are going on.
[02:17:44.302 --> 02:17:46.364]  They've started a study in Australia.
[02:17:46.364 --> 02:17:48.206]  They've started it in the U.S.
[02:17:48.206 --> 02:17:50.408]  Yeah, Houston, can't that be the Cedar?
[02:17:50.408 --> 02:17:51.709]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:59.696]  Can't that... I mean, other vaccine trials have actually caused pandemics before, and they're doing... They don't care if Gardasil's killing girls en masse.
[02:17:59.696 --> 02:18:02.218]  They don't care if the bird flu test in Europe killed... They don't care.
[02:18:03.015 --> 02:18:03.575]  They don't care.
[02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:08.538]  And what they're going to do is they're going to watch this for three weeks for side effects.
[02:18:08.538 --> 02:18:18.242]  So if you were in the experiment today, Alex, and you got the first shot, they would follow you for three weeks to see whether or not you developed any sort of side effects.
[02:18:18.242 --> 02:18:21.103]  They would draw your blood to see whether or not you developed an antibody.
[02:18:21.103 --> 02:18:28.987]  And if it was looking positive, like you did low side effects and you had an antibody, the next round of experimentation is on babies.
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:30.360]  I'm good.
[02:18:46.958 --> 02:18:51.403]  Well, it's obviously quackery, so they can say we did test, it's good to take.
[02:18:51.403 --> 02:18:53.265]  It's like they said the anthrax shot was good.
[02:18:53.265 --> 02:18:54.326]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:54.326 --> 02:18:59.612]  They really are not in a position of wanting to do good science, and that's the bottom line here.
[02:18:59.612 --> 02:19:03.757]  Because of the 2006 pandemic laws that are going into effect.
[02:19:04.215 --> 02:19:17.363]  The only way that you can sue, and that you have any compensation whatsoever, is number one, you have to identify willful intent, and you have to get permission from the Secretary of HHS to sue and get compensation.
[02:19:17.363 --> 02:19:29.090]  If they have very little experimentation going on, very little clinical trials, with very short follow-up, how could they, you could, they could say, well gosh, we had no idea that it was going to cause this many problems.
[02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:31.532]  So they could not be accused of willful intent.
[02:19:32.643 --> 02:19:34.924]  Alright, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, I got a million questions here.
[02:19:34.924 --> 02:19:37.105]  I'm chomping at the bit.
[02:19:37.105 --> 02:19:43.129]  They've said other vaccines are safe, like anthrax and smallpox, and admittedly had to withdraw them, it killed so many people.
[02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:44.629]  So they're kind of testing the boundary.
[02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:47.571]  Gardasil's killing people, they won't withdraw it.
[02:19:47.571 --> 02:19:49.532]  The anthrax killed a bunch of people, they did.
[02:19:49.532 --> 02:19:52.453]  The smallpox did, they withdrew it.
[02:19:52.453 --> 02:19:55.335]  We know these flu trials the last year have been killing a lot of people.
[02:19:55.335 --> 02:19:58.016]  Previous to this, they're not withdrawing it now.
[02:19:58.016 --> 02:19:59.117]  They're setting that precedent.
[02:20:00.947 --> 02:20:02.329]  We're good to go.

[02:21:02.588 --> 02:21:04.650]  A new world order.
[02:21:05.382 --> 02:21:10.484]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:21:10.484 --> 02:21:13.105]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:21:13.105 --> 02:21:15.886]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:21:15.886 --> 02:21:19.087]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:19.087 --> 02:21:26.390]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:29.434 --> 02:21:34.878]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:34.878 --> 02:21:38.740]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:41.302]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:21:41.302 --> 02:21:42.463]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:42.463 --> 02:21:43.243]  They're not after money.
[02:21:43.243 --> 02:21:44.544]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:44.544 --> 02:21:45.145]  They're after power.
[02:21:45.145 --> 02:21:46.666]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:21:58.193 --> 02:21:59.314]  You have been warned.
[02:21:59.394 --> 02:22:00.814]  Yeah.
[02:22:00.814 --> 02:22:01.315]  Good day.
[02:22:01.315 --> 02:22:02.935]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.935 --> 02:22:03.215]  August 26, 2009.
[02:22:03.215 --> 02:22:04.335]  Gold opened this morning at $9.4660.
[02:22:04.335 --> 02:22:07.396]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7369, $4.8685 for a half-ounce, or $2.4342 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:22:07.396 --> 02:22:08.157]  That's $9.7369, $4.8685, and $2.4342.
[02:22:20.094 --> 02:22:33.699]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:33.699 --> 02:22:34.939]  Is this capitalism?
[02:22:34.939 --> 02:22:42.542]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:42.542 --> 02:22:43.642]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:43.642 --> 02:22:47.784]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.

[02:22:56.689 --> 02:23:00.331]  That's 800-686-2237.

[02:24:18.155 --> 02:24:22.198]  I don't want to miss the forest for the trees here.
[02:24:22.198 --> 02:24:42.852]  There have been thousands of cases of different vaccines killing people and many times causing pandemics and causing thousands to die of degenerative brain disorders on record like in 76 with the last swine flu that popped up at a military base after an inoculation campaign.
[02:24:43.723 --> 02:24:51.188]  This is a government that's been caught doing chemical and biological testing thousands of times against the American people.
[02:24:51.188 --> 02:24:55.390]  This is a government that gave the Native Americans the smallpox blankets.
[02:24:55.390 --> 02:24:57.612]  But it's not even that information.
[02:24:57.612 --> 02:25:10.920]  It's that this is an unproven, different group, different companies, different vaccines, different trials, running around shooting everybody up for something that killed less than 200 people in the United States.
[02:25:12.256 --> 02:25:15.097]  University of Alabama implements mandatory vaccine program.
[02:25:15.097 --> 02:25:16.697]  That's been announced.
[02:25:16.697 --> 02:25:20.158]  I've got New York newspaper headlines.
[02:25:20.158 --> 02:25:22.479]  This is out of New York business.
[02:25:22.479 --> 02:25:25.460]  New York proposes mandatory vaccinations for health care workers.
[02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:37.923]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin, this is a quick segment, but continuing regardless, you know, they can say under executive orders they can force us to take shots, but then with the media, they're just kind of slowly broaching this to the public.
[02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:51.433]  Yeah, I think that what they're trying to do right now is, at least, you know, Alex, as internet-service-savvy as you are and I am and a lot of your listeners are, there's still a lot of people that aren't.
[02:25:51.433 --> 02:26:03.696]  And that they get their information and their news from Brian Jennings at 6 o'clock or 6.30 and they really think that that is the truth and they really aren't talking about any of this on the 6 o'clock news.
[02:26:03.696 --> 02:26:06.097]  They're barely talking about it on the talking head shows.
[02:26:06.863 --> 02:26:12.569]  So, I think that this is going to come up by surprise to a lot of people.
[02:26:12.569 --> 02:26:15.853]  And that's going to make, and they're going to turn the fear crank machine.
[02:26:15.853 --> 02:26:24.662]  They're going to have more fear going this fall than what they even had back in March and April when they were doing the whole Mexican death tally scare thing.
[02:26:24.662 --> 02:26:26.724]  And then people are going to be uninformed.
[02:26:26.724 --> 02:26:28.145]  They're not going to know what to do.
[02:26:28.145 --> 02:26:29.487]  They're not going to know how to prepare.
[02:26:30.086 --> 02:26:33.028]  And they're just going to run down the street and roll up their sleeves so they get the vaccine and they don't die.
[02:26:33.028 --> 02:26:34.229]  Exactly!
[02:26:34.229 --> 02:26:43.775]  So we're in a race to reach out to the public and go, a couple hundred people die in Mexico City with compromised immune systems living on open-air shacks.
[02:26:43.775 --> 02:26:46.657]  Half the population in New Mexico City does live like that.
[02:26:46.657 --> 02:26:52.180]  Sick people, babies on breathing machines that were already on the edge of death die in the United States.
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:54.822]  Old people who've had five heart surgeries.
[02:26:54.822 --> 02:26:56.283]  I mean, this is clearly a hoax!
[02:26:57.003 --> 02:27:00.426]  What does your gut, as a researcher, as a medical doctor, tell you?
[02:27:00.426 --> 02:27:05.149]  Is this just hype to sell vaccines and have a federal clampdown and get us used to taking U.N.
[02:27:05.149 --> 02:27:07.110]  orders, or is it worse?
[02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:17.478]  I mean, if they almost had a complete lockdown of the world over a couple hundred deaths, what's going to happen when the public gets confused by regular flu deaths in the thousands?
[02:27:17.478 --> 02:27:21.020]  That's a great question, and I don't know that I have any answer to that.
[02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:25.864]  And I think that one of the questions that I've been asked hundreds of times in the last couple of weeks for all of the
[02:27:26.348 --> 02:27:30.830]  The internet and radio and webinar work that I've been doing is, what do we do?
[02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:32.470]  I mean, what can we do?
[02:27:32.470 --> 02:27:35.031]  It's one thing to get all this information.
[02:27:35.031 --> 02:27:37.092]  It's another thing to give people something to do.
[02:27:37.092 --> 02:27:39.373]  So we've set up a website.
[02:27:39.373 --> 02:27:42.534]  It's PandemicFluOnline.com.
[02:27:42.534 --> 02:27:44.975]  PandemicFluOnline.com.
[02:27:44.975 --> 02:27:46.396]  And we've given people tools.
[02:27:46.894 --> 02:27:56.160]  Downloadable PDF files that are flyers and brochures and articles that they can give to their editors.
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:08.969]  We're setting up mini PowerPoint presentations of things that they can take to their local community and get them informed about the truth about the flu shot, that it doesn't work in babies, people with asthma, in adults or the elderly.
[02:28:08.969 --> 02:28:10.050]  It doesn't work in anybody.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:21.890]  And to let them know that there's all the stuff that's inside the vaccines, and to give them information and phone numbers, and telling them to call their senators and representatives, and let them know that we don't want this.
[02:28:21.890 --> 02:28:24.813]  This is not... And what about saying, let us home shield?
[02:28:24.813 --> 02:28:30.418]  If you're going to have the Army lock everything down, don't make us go to some inoculation center.
[02:28:30.418 --> 02:28:31.019]  Exactly.
[02:28:31.019 --> 02:28:36.324]  Don't take all of those things, all that stuff, all those things they're building on a daily basis on that website.
[02:28:37.132 --> 02:28:41.014]  Because you know Alex, I've been saying for years, we've got to get people active.
[02:28:41.014 --> 02:28:42.955]  We've got to get people aware.
[02:28:42.955 --> 02:28:45.576]  But we haven't given them the tools to do that.
[02:28:45.576 --> 02:28:48.718]  And so we're creating tools now so that people can pass these out.
[02:28:48.718 --> 02:28:58.462]  And we're having a tremendous response, where I am here in Cleveland, Ohio, of passing out these brochures, of passing out the flyers to people that had no idea.
[02:28:58.462 --> 02:29:02.304]  And people who said, you know, I've been looking for something like this to pass out to somebody.
[02:29:02.304 --> 02:29:03.465]  Thank you for making this.
[02:29:04.195 --> 02:29:13.561]  So, the more people that we get aware, and the more people that know what's going on, the less that fear-mongering and that fear crank is going to be on the 6 o'clock news.
[02:29:13.561 --> 02:29:17.984]  And we've got, now we've given people something to do, rather than just making them afraid.
[02:29:17.984 --> 02:29:21.486]  And there really isn't, the school's still out on the mandatory vaccination.
[02:29:21.486 --> 02:29:24.248]  I mean, we don't really know what's going to happen with that.
[02:29:24.248 --> 02:29:26.750]  But the only thing we can do right now is to get people aware.
[02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:30.072]  That's right, because the precedent is set.
[02:29:30.072 --> 02:29:31.693]  At schools, there's no law to take
[02:29:32.574 --> 02:29:33.674]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:33.674 --> 02:29:35.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.121 --> 02:30:06.325]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:30:06.325 --> 02:30:10.348]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.348 --> 02:30:16.253]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.253 --> 02:30:21.097]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.317 --> 02:30:22.237]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.237 --> 02:30:27.860]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:28.520]  Number 4.
[02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:31.421]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:30:31.421 --> 02:30:35.083]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:35.083 --> 02:30:35.943]  Number 5.
[02:30:35.943 --> 02:30:39.805]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:39.805 --> 02:30:45.528]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:30:45.528 --> 02:30:48.589]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.

[02:30:58.135 --> 02:31:04.538]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.538 --> 02:31:09.881]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.881 --> 02:31:11.922]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.922 --> 02:31:16.925]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.925 --> 02:31:17.846]  How much do you want?
[02:31:18.086 --> 02:31:19.227]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.227 --> 02:31:21.108]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:21.108 --> 02:31:22.169]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.169 --> 02:31:24.370]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.370 --> 02:31:25.711]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.711 --> 02:31:27.252]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.252 --> 02:31:32.516]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.516 --> 02:31:36.098]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:36.098 --> 02:31:39.561]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.921 --> 02:31:41.142]  How much will you need?
[02:31:41.142 --> 02:31:42.042]  We don't know.
[02:31:42.042 --> 02:31:43.143]  How much do you want?
[02:31:43.143 --> 02:31:44.083]  All you can get.
[02:31:44.083 --> 02:31:45.164]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:45.164 --> 02:31:48.225]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:48.225 --> 02:31:50.407]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:50.407 --> 02:31:51.427]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.572 --> 02:32:04.816]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:32:04.816 --> 02:32:06.818]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:32:06.818 --> 02:32:15.347]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:32:15.347 --> 02:32:20.892]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:32:20.892 --> 02:32:22.514]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:32:22.754 --> 02:32:29.260]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:40.330]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:32:40.330 --> 02:32:41.091]  That's right.
[02:32:41.091 --> 02:32:43.653]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:32:43.653 --> 02:32:45.254]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:32:47.056 --> 02:32:47.176]  6043.
[02:32:47.176 --> 02:32:47.576]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[02:33:21.344 --> 02:33:24.385]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have tracked the history of the globalists.
[02:33:24.385 --> 02:33:29.526]  They funded Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Pol Pot.
[02:33:29.526 --> 02:33:30.426]  They fund everybody.
[02:33:30.426 --> 02:33:32.167]  They are eugenicists.
[02:33:32.167 --> 02:33:37.048]  They are in power because they are the most ruthless, the most wicked, the most cunning.
[02:33:37.048 --> 02:33:41.289]  And good people could beat them if we would just admit evil existed.
[02:33:41.289 --> 02:33:43.890]  If we would just admit these psychopaths are operating.
[02:33:44.841 --> 02:33:48.964]  And I want the illusion shattered for police and military and the general public.
[02:33:48.964 --> 02:33:55.367]  People that serve the system, that think the system's good, that they go, well, I'm a good person, so the system must be good.
[02:33:55.367 --> 02:33:56.648]  No!
[02:33:56.648 --> 02:34:01.271]  No, the system is directed from the top by prime evil.
[02:34:01.271 --> 02:34:07.595]  By total, fundamental, foundational, greed, avarice, and control freak.
[02:34:08.430 --> 02:34:11.911]  I mean, that is the spirit of this selfishness, this wickedness.
[02:34:11.911 --> 02:34:14.212]  And they write textbooks bragging.
[02:34:14.212 --> 02:34:18.613]  They've been caught thousands of times doing unbelievably horrible things to us.
[02:34:18.613 --> 02:34:20.714]  And they say they're doing it.
[02:34:20.714 --> 02:34:23.915]  The British government, the Australian government, the German government.
[02:34:23.915 --> 02:34:25.235]  The communists under the Russians.
[02:34:25.235 --> 02:34:26.916]  The Russians aren't doing it now.
[02:34:26.916 --> 02:34:33.778]  The Russians admit that the government was sterilizing people and poisoning the water and they apologize and pay their people to have children now.
[02:34:33.778 --> 02:34:35.839]  And don't have CPS running around grabbing kids.
[02:34:35.839 --> 02:34:36.999]  I'm not saying Russia's perfect.
[02:34:37.752 --> 02:34:44.578]  It's got a lot of mafia and corruption, but it certainly is different.
[02:34:44.578 --> 02:34:47.400]  Just from, you know, proof is in the pudding.
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:52.484]  And this is real, ladies and gentlemen, and we're all in the boat together.
[02:34:52.484 --> 02:34:56.387]  I'm hoping this is just a beta test for future pandemics.
[02:34:56.387 --> 02:35:03.233]  As I've said, they're going to have more stage releases, training us how to be locked down, training us how to be controlled, because everything's incrementalism with these people.
[02:35:04.122 --> 02:35:06.725]  We're going back to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[02:35:06.725 --> 02:35:08.648]  Doctor, you know, I'm ranting here.
[02:35:08.648 --> 02:35:12.653]  It's just I think about how the smallpox shots killed so many people and they had to stop them.
[02:35:12.653 --> 02:35:18.320]  I think about how the anthrax shots, two separate times, they forced the troops to take them and killed people en masse.
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:19.281]  On record!
[02:35:19.281 --> 02:35:20.363]  And then nobody gets in trouble.
[02:35:20.763 --> 02:35:23.585]  I think about how Baxter gets caught doing all this stuff.
[02:35:23.585 --> 02:35:28.487]  I think about the homeless people trials, lying to them, and the homeless dying in mass.
[02:35:28.487 --> 02:35:34.330]  I mean, one group of homeless that were shot up, what, 23 died in one clinic in Poland?
[02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:39.033]  And then they've set the precedent now where we take the shots and we die, or we
[02:35:40.521 --> 02:35:47.165]  All these people call that gave their daughters shots for Gardasil and they have autoimmune disorders now and are in wheelchairs.
[02:35:47.165 --> 02:35:49.026]  I mean, this is really happening, Doctor!
[02:35:49.026 --> 02:35:51.108]  Yes, yes it is.
[02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:56.471]  And what's really scary to me is what is the adjuvants that they're going to be putting into these shots.
[02:35:56.471 --> 02:36:01.614]  There's no doubt in my mind that the adjuvants are going to be added.
[02:36:01.614 --> 02:36:04.536]  And just to, you know, make sure everybody knows what an adjuvant is.
[02:36:04.536 --> 02:36:07.178]  I mean, we've got a virus which is called antigen.
[02:36:07.628 --> 02:36:11.351]  And then we have a chemical that gets put in it to make the antigen go farther.
[02:36:11.351 --> 02:36:21.699]  So if you've got a quart of the antigen, but what you really need is 10 gallons of antigen, you put these additional adjuvants in there so you can use less of the virus per shot.
[02:36:21.699 --> 02:36:29.806]  The fact that we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying adjuvant from Glasgow SmithKline and from Novartis, we've already purchased it.
[02:36:30.362 --> 02:36:31.925]  We know that they're going to use it.
[02:36:31.925 --> 02:36:43.523]  The part about that that's really bad is that neither one of those, AS03 from GSK and MS59 from Novartis, are FDA approved for flu shots in this country.
[02:36:44.335 --> 02:36:44.675]  I think so.
[02:37:02.773 --> 02:37:03.033]  I don't know.
[02:37:16.619 --> 02:37:34.064]  On record, they've known for 50 plus years that the different accelerants, the different things, these adjuvants that activate the immune system, that that's what is causing the brain swelling, the burning out of the pancreas, the swelling in organs, the autoimmune diseases.
[02:37:34.064 --> 02:37:38.605]  They know, and you're saying this is going to be supercharged with that.
[02:37:38.605 --> 02:37:42.206]  Yeah, it's going to be supercharged because these adjuvants have squalene in them.
[02:37:42.608 --> 02:37:49.115]  And the squealing in experimental animals has caused horrible side effects including debilitating arthritis.
[02:37:49.115 --> 02:38:05.972]  A recent report that came out a couple of days ago said that they're really having trouble with this H1N1 virus that they have because it's not replicating as fast as they would like it to and that the yields are only about 20% of what the normal yield would be for a virus that they're trying to create.
[02:38:06.332 --> 02:38:20.263]  So it's not growing very fast, they can't make very much of it, they only purchased a certain amount of it, so it's all leading to the conclusion, hey government, hey CDC, we need to put the MS-59 and the ASO-3 in there to spread it around so we've got enough for everybody.
[02:38:20.263 --> 02:38:23.085]  Neither one of them have been tested in children.
[02:38:23.085 --> 02:38:25.447]  Neither one of them have been tested in children.
[02:38:25.447 --> 02:38:28.149]  I've also read that a lot of these chemicals they add to
[02:38:32.091 --> 02:38:37.042]  ...elicit the autoimmune response have been associated with later reproductive problems.
[02:38:37.899 --> 02:38:41.962]  And so, of course, they like that because it ends up reducing fertility.
[02:38:41.962 --> 02:38:51.469]  Well, and even the normal regular annual flu shot, by which they're saying that kids who are going to school this fall and have not had a previous flu shot are supposed to get four flu shots before they go.
[02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:52.610]  Oh my God!
[02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:54.191]  I forgot to ask you that.
[02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:56.172]  I'm going to try to shut up here.
[02:38:56.172 --> 02:38:59.455]  But please go through this because you keep... There's thousands of points here.
[02:38:59.455 --> 02:39:00.215]  I have a family.
[02:39:00.215 --> 02:39:00.996]  You have a family.
[02:39:00.996 --> 02:39:06.580]  It's freaking me out as this freight train comes towards us and somehow we've got to get the public to wake up and say no
[02:39:07.754 --> 02:39:32.022]  That's the big issue here, is that they're saying, like a placebo, go get old flu shots that they admit have no connection to this flu, give you no immunity, and people are already lined up at clinics and panicking for three, four months straight, getting all these ridiculous shots, and Dr. Obama says you need to take three shots, now they're saying four shots.
[02:39:32.022 --> 02:39:34.582]  I mean, soon will it be your morning flu shot.
[02:39:34.582 --> 02:39:35.963]  Break that down, doctor.
[02:39:36.343 --> 02:39:46.731]  Well, they're saying that the theory is that in order to develop an adequate immune response, you're supposed to get a vaccine followed up by a second vaccine.
[02:39:46.731 --> 02:39:56.879]  So if you have children who are 8 or 9 or 10 years old who have not previously had a flu shot of any kind, the recommendations that are coming out is that they'll get the regular flu shot,
[02:39:57.304 --> 02:40:01.347]  Three weeks later, they'll get their booster on their regular annual flu shot.
[02:40:01.347 --> 02:40:04.090]  Three weeks later, they'll get their swine flu shot.
[02:40:04.090 --> 02:40:07.713]  And three weeks after that, they'll get their booster of their swine flu shot.
[02:40:07.713 --> 02:40:13.418]  And then we'll see how many kids can actually function in school this year, as if it isn't already bad enough.
[02:40:13.418 --> 02:40:16.080]  And they're recommending that for kids six months of age and older.
[02:40:18.086 --> 02:40:25.433]  So, you know, the adults are supposed to get three flu shots, they're supposed to get their annual seasonal flu shot, a swine flu and a swine flu booster.
[02:40:25.433 --> 02:40:29.377]  But your kids, if they haven't had a previous one, they're supposed to get four.
[02:40:29.377 --> 02:40:39.146]  I just think, you know, it's like, it's almost like there's people, there's this concept that all that's in there is a little dead virus and a little sterile water, and so what good, what harm is it going to cause?
[02:40:39.146 --> 02:40:41.228]  And a little is good, so a whole lot must be better.
[02:40:42.248 --> 02:40:47.070]  And what we're doing is causing a massive amount of problems in children and adults.
[02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:50.251]  And everybody needs to just get informed about this.
[02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:52.852]  Go to PandemicFluOnline.com.
[02:40:52.852 --> 02:40:54.393]  Go to DrTenpenny.com.
[02:40:54.393 --> 02:40:57.474]  Download the information and pass it out to your family and friends.
[02:40:57.474 --> 02:40:58.414]  Take it to your school.
[02:40:58.414 --> 02:40:59.775]  Let the teachers know it.
[02:40:59.775 --> 02:41:02.356]  Let the people in your daycare know it.
[02:41:02.356 --> 02:41:07.618]  Put the principals on notice that you're not going to have that happening to your children and your school system.
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:13.787]  It's the only way that we're going to be able to stop this from all these vaccines happening in schools this year.
[02:41:13.787 --> 02:41:17.932]  And Doc, that's my next two points.
[02:41:17.932 --> 02:41:23.098]  Is A, we had big victories in 2000-2003, 2002-2003, when they tried to order the 14 million first responders to take the smallpox shot.
[02:41:29.338 --> 02:41:32.861]  And said, it's the law, everyone will do it or you'll be fired.
[02:41:32.861 --> 02:41:39.486]  Firemen, police, medical workers, nurses, doctors, city workers, county workers, state workers.
[02:41:39.486 --> 02:41:40.827]  The majority of them said no.
[02:41:40.827 --> 02:41:44.010]  So that program stalled and died.
[02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:47.313]  We've had victories before over this.
[02:41:47.313 --> 02:41:51.876]  But they've been so successful fear-mongering with the pre-flu hype.
[02:41:51.876 --> 02:41:54.158]  They didn't have that with the smallpox.
[02:41:54.158 --> 02:41:57.001]  They just used 9-11 saying we just got hit a year ago.
[02:41:58.703 --> 02:42:01.344]  We're sure Al Qaeda is going to use smallpox.
[02:42:01.344 --> 02:42:02.884]  People didn't buy that.
[02:42:02.884 --> 02:42:07.605]  But people have had the flu and know it really feels bad and know that it can kill you sometimes.
[02:42:07.605 --> 02:42:10.246]  So that's why this is so much more effective.
[02:42:10.246 --> 02:42:11.986]  That's why this fight is so important.
[02:42:11.986 --> 02:42:19.188]  So speak to... Our only recourse, I guess, is to educate, is to warn people, is to spread the word like our lives depend on it.
[02:42:19.748 --> 02:42:27.332]  With the articles at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Global Research has done a huge compendium article that's incredibly good.
[02:42:27.332 --> 02:42:30.854]  We've got linked up on Infowars.com.
[02:42:30.854 --> 02:42:32.875]  So A, educate everybody.
[02:42:32.875 --> 02:42:34.195]  We've got a fighting chance.
[02:42:34.195 --> 02:42:34.215]  B,
[02:42:36.696 --> 02:42:48.746]  I have the Washington Post buried in an article, Paul Watson's doing a story on it, saying, oh yeah, these flu shots have high levels of mercury, they've lied in the past and said they've taken the mercury out, another lie!
[02:42:48.746 --> 02:42:52.889]  So, speak to getting the word out and waking people up, and then the mercury angle!
[02:42:53.689 --> 02:42:58.072]  Well, getting the word out is what I keep telling everybody they have to do.
[02:42:58.072 --> 02:43:00.514]  And everybody says, well, I don't know who I should talk to.
[02:43:00.514 --> 02:43:02.015]  Talk to everybody.
[02:43:02.015 --> 02:43:09.241]  I have a stack of flyers that I carry around with me in my purse and in the back of my car, because I take them everywhere.
[02:43:09.241 --> 02:43:15.185]  And I've gone down the street by where my office is, and I've stopped with these flyers.
[02:43:15.185 --> 02:43:17.127]  It's the truth about the flu shot.
[02:43:17.127 --> 02:43:20.269]  You can get it off of my website, and it's all over the internet.
[02:43:20.609 --> 02:43:23.372]  And I don't even engage with them in conversation.
[02:43:23.372 --> 02:43:30.599]  I just walk in and say, good morning, good afternoon, how are you, here's some information I think you might be interested in looking at, and turn around and walk out.
[02:43:30.599 --> 02:43:33.121]  So you don't have to stand there and debate anybody.
[02:43:33.121 --> 02:43:35.544]  And the worst that's going to happen is nothing.
[02:43:35.544 --> 02:43:36.925]  They throw it in the trash.
[02:43:36.925 --> 02:43:39.688]  But you never know whose hands that might end up in.
[02:43:39.688 --> 02:43:40.929]  That might really make a difference.
[02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.989]  Well said.
[02:43:41.989 --> 02:43:44.310]  I want you to get into the mercury, but before we do that,
[02:44:12.054 --> 02:44:19.348]  Expanding on what you're saying, printing up a nice flyer, using your flyer, printing up Prison Planet articles, Global Research articles, whatever.
[02:44:19.348 --> 02:44:22.054]  There's a lot of good boil downs out there.
[02:44:22.054 --> 02:44:22.835]  Our story about...
[02:44:23.803 --> 02:44:27.284]  You know, the flu, FEMA, martial law, mass graves.
[02:44:27.284 --> 02:44:29.384]  That has a nice boil down of facts.
[02:44:29.384 --> 02:44:32.204]  People are really interested in the flu right now.
[02:44:32.204 --> 02:44:37.205]  They instinctively know something's wrong, something doesn't add up.
[02:44:37.205 --> 02:44:40.486]  They are begging for this information.
[02:44:40.486 --> 02:44:50.668]  Go to Kinko's or FedExo's or whatever it's called now, and for a hundred bucks you could print up five thousand one or two sheets.
[02:44:50.668 --> 02:44:52.488]  For twenty bucks you can print up
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:45:00.391]  You know thousands get it out to people and that's a child a woman a man that isn't going to be getting that
[02:45:01.598 --> 02:45:14.142]  You know, onset of Parkinson's at 25, that onset of these brain disorders, people getting Alzheimer's at 40 now, all tied to the vaccines.
[02:45:14.142 --> 02:45:14.802]  Go ahead.
[02:45:14.802 --> 02:45:18.103]  Yeah, and dementia and all, because that's really what's happening.
[02:45:18.103 --> 02:45:22.244]  We light up the immune systems in the brain and it causes them to deteriorate.
[02:45:22.244 --> 02:45:24.325]  And that's why we're seeing so many young people now.
[02:45:24.985 --> 02:45:36.248]  With ADD, ADHD, all the adults with ADHD, all the things that we can label them with so that we can give them more psychotropic drugs like Effexor and Paxil and all of these things.
[02:45:36.248 --> 02:45:44.390]  I think that, you know, I've said for years, Alex, that I think that the vaccine industry is really the economic loss leader of the entire pharmaceutical industry.
[02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:53.492]  It's, you know, the idea of a loss leader is you, you know, come into my store, I'll give you a free t-shirt, and oh, by the way, while you're here, spend a couple hundred dollars.
[02:45:54.175 --> 02:45:55.596]  Well that's what I was going to say.
[02:45:55.596 --> 02:45:56.617]  They make them approve other drugs.
[02:46:22.538 --> 02:46:26.241]  Even if they approve something bad, down the road the truth comes out.
[02:46:26.241 --> 02:46:29.304]  Vaccines are not held to the same standard.
[02:46:29.304 --> 02:46:38.091]  They can kill whoever they want, hurt whoever they want, because it's proprietary and very secretive what's really in it.
[02:46:38.091 --> 02:46:40.633]  It's the perfect cover for the soft kill.
[02:46:41.391 --> 02:46:44.072]  It's the perfect cover for the sterilization.
[02:46:44.072 --> 02:46:50.534]  The UN's been caught, as you know, adding the female hormone to the tetanus shot that sterilized the women.
[02:46:50.534 --> 02:46:52.394]  Only in a program for women.
[02:46:52.394 --> 02:46:53.894]  It was pushed as feminism.
[02:46:53.894 --> 02:46:55.875]  Oh, we're only helping women.
[02:46:55.875 --> 02:46:58.256]  Because that weapon wouldn't have hurt a man.
[02:46:58.256 --> 02:46:59.936]  It was designed for a woman.
[02:46:59.936 --> 02:47:01.336]  I mean, this is diabolical.
[02:47:01.336 --> 02:47:03.037]  And the way they want to set the precedent
[02:47:04.209 --> 02:47:04.509]  To put
[02:47:20.612 --> 02:47:34.555]  You from cocaine or nicotine or heroin addiction, and it's a live virus that goes in and attacks the receptors in the brain, creating plaques so you can't absorb the drug, which also then blocks your endorphins.
[02:47:34.555 --> 02:47:37.656]  But don't worry, they've got a drug to then treat that.
[02:47:37.656 --> 02:47:48.198]  Can you speak to those classes of things called vaccines that are really nanobot, genetically engineered viral weapons?
[02:47:48.877 --> 02:47:50.637]  Yeah, they are.
[02:47:50.637 --> 02:47:52.678]  You summed it up really well, Alex.
[02:47:52.678 --> 02:47:56.899]  And they are DNA vaccines that are coming down the pike.
[02:47:56.899 --> 02:48:03.100]  Now they're talking about edible vaccines, that there's vaccines that are going to be in potatoes and carrots.
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:08.021]  There's a vaccine that they have considered doing in Africa that is spread by mosquitoes.
[02:48:08.021 --> 02:48:09.481]  That's Bill Gates!
[02:48:09.481 --> 02:48:13.102]  It gets more like a great sci-fi movie all the time.
[02:48:13.761 --> 02:48:17.784]  And it would be really kind of funny if it wasn't so diabolical.
[02:48:17.784 --> 02:48:22.406]  Well, that's Bill Gates, the eugenicist, who now they've total given over $100 billion.
[02:48:22.406 --> 02:48:23.487]  I'm saying $80-something billion.
[02:48:23.487 --> 02:48:24.448]  It's gone up.
[02:48:24.448 --> 02:48:27.630]  Him and Warren Buffett, they're all supporting Planned Parenthood.
[02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:30.011]  Bill Gates' daddy runs Planned Parenthood.
[02:48:30.011 --> 02:48:35.555]  They're openly, and he's like, I want to release mosquitoes to give you an HIV cure.
[02:48:35.555 --> 02:48:39.097]  And, I mean, my God, doctor, this is pretty obvious what's going on.
[02:48:40.443 --> 02:48:52.250]  You would think that by now, Alex, from everything that people have been saying, that there would be nobody left who would believe that vaccines are safe, they protect you, they're harmless, and they're good for you.
[02:48:52.250 --> 02:49:03.917]  But we've got multi-generational, 200 years of multi-generational indoctrination that people really believe that vaccines are good, they really will keep you from getting sick.
[02:49:03.917 --> 02:49:07.499]  And you know the FDA and the government wouldn't ever approve anything that might harm me.
[02:49:08.331 --> 02:49:13.935]  And so the undoing that in people's psyche is taking a long, long time.
[02:49:13.935 --> 02:49:16.757]  But I think that pretty soon we're going to reach the 100th monkey here.
[02:49:16.757 --> 02:49:17.717]  I really do.
[02:49:17.717 --> 02:49:23.721]  And I think that there's going to be a 100th monkey phenomenon where all of a sudden everybody's going to go, holy cow!
[02:49:23.721 --> 02:49:25.482]  And they're all going to wake up at the same time.
[02:49:25.482 --> 02:49:28.945]  And honestly, Alex, I think that's what the government's most fearful of.
[02:49:28.945 --> 02:49:34.408]  Because of radio, because of the internet, because of webinars, because of all of these technologies that we have.
[02:49:35.819 --> 02:49:36.439]  We're good to go.
[02:49:58.229 --> 02:50:07.194]  And we have to do it really quick, because if we don't do it soon, there's going to be so many people awake that are going to revolt that we're not going to be able to be successful, which is what I'm hoping will happen.
[02:50:07.194 --> 02:50:08.934]  They won't be successful.
[02:50:08.934 --> 02:50:11.736]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, you just hit it out of the park right there.
[02:50:11.736 --> 02:50:13.037]  You just said it all.
[02:50:13.037 --> 02:50:14.657]  They are behind schedule.
[02:50:14.657 --> 02:50:15.998]  People are waking up.
[02:50:15.998 --> 02:50:18.739]  They clearly have accelerated every program.
[02:50:18.739 --> 02:50:24.462]  The gun grabbing, the carbon tax, the banking takeover, the open borders, the wars.
[02:50:24.462 --> 02:50:27.644]  I mean, they are... In a panic.
[02:50:30.134 --> 02:50:36.656]  Well, my dad did exterminating in college, something to raise money, and he'd go into the bad part of town to kill roaches.
[02:50:36.656 --> 02:50:37.696]  And he said, it's true.
[02:50:37.696 --> 02:50:41.697]  When you spray roaches with poison, they start fornicating.
[02:50:41.697 --> 02:50:43.437]  And that's kind of what the elites are doing.
[02:50:43.437 --> 02:50:47.898]  They realize that they're losing, and so they're just going wild.
[02:50:47.898 --> 02:50:51.639]  They are really trying to take over right now.
[02:50:51.639 --> 02:50:54.160]  Final segment with our guest.
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:55.480]  Her website's on screen.
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:55.980]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.118 --> 02:51:04.479]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:04.479 --> 02:51:08.400]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:12.121]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:51:12.121 --> 02:51:20.884]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[02:51:21.124 --> 02:51:27.265]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[02:51:27.265 --> 02:51:32.107]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.

[02:51:56.012 --> 02:52:01.713]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[02:52:01.713 --> 02:52:07.754]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.754 --> 02:52:13.616]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:13.616 --> 02:52:19.777]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:20.117 --> 02:52:22.077]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:22.077 --> 02:52:24.538]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:24.538 --> 02:52:37.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:39.401]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.401 --> 02:52:41.261]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.261 --> 02:52:47.502]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.169 --> 02:52:56.434]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.434 --> 02:52:57.995]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:57.995 --> 02:53:01.557]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.557 --> 02:53:03.738]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[02:53:03.738 --> 02:53:10.882]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on Earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[02:53:10.882 --> 02:53:16.726]  SurvivalistSeeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.
[02:53:16.886 --> 02:53:17.146]  I think so.
[02:53:37.319 --> 02:53:41.561]  This competition charges $0.10 to $1.25 per seed for these same heirloom varieties.
[02:53:41.561 --> 02:53:49.246]  But you can now have a head of lettuce, a bundle of carrots, a basket of tomatoes, a giant watermelon, and 16 other varieties for about a penny a seed each!
[02:53:49.246 --> 02:53:50.046]  Be prepared!

[02:54:29.979 --> 02:54:31.280]  By the way, I've gone crazy.
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:36.845]  There's 18 interviews in the new Obama film, and I just sent the guys off to interview Berg.
[02:54:36.845 --> 02:54:38.546]  It'll be a 19th.
[02:54:38.546 --> 02:54:40.808]  We're going to interview Dr. Sherry Tenpenny for the film.
[02:54:40.808 --> 02:54:43.791]  We just agreed to do it, because I'm covering the flu some, but I think
[02:54:44.463 --> 02:54:48.669]  It's more important to even do more in the film on it and just how they stage crises.
[02:54:48.669 --> 02:54:49.370]  So very excited.
[02:54:49.370 --> 02:54:54.877]  You know, I forgot to even toot your horn, doctor, because who I have on is people that have proven to be accurate.
[02:54:54.877 --> 02:55:01.285]  And you wrote a book a few years ago about how they would use a flu as a pretext to take over.
[02:55:01.285 --> 02:55:02.647]  And I've read the book.
[02:55:03.599 --> 02:55:05.442]  It is almost like prophecy.
[02:55:05.442 --> 02:55:08.847]  And you were telling me during the break that sometimes you can't believe you wrote this.
[02:55:08.847 --> 02:55:13.674]  I mean, you know, I have that same feeling when I make these films and project what I think they're going to do.
[02:55:13.674 --> 02:55:16.278]  To be exactly right is really scary.
[02:55:16.815 --> 02:55:23.137]  It is scary, and when I go back and I read it, and I read the chapter about mandatory vaccination, is it possible?
[02:55:23.137 --> 02:55:33.119]  When I read about the last chapter about, you know, tying it all together, how is it that sick birds and sick people and vaccines and quarantines, how does this all come about and come together?
[02:55:33.119 --> 02:55:35.700]  I read it now and I think, I can't believe I wrote this!
[02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:37.260]  This is like prophecy!
[02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:41.621]  I wrote it in 2006, it's called Foul Bird Flu, It's Not What You Think, but it's a
[02:55:41.821 --> 02:55:44.284]  Very much about what's going on with the swine flu right now.
[02:55:44.284 --> 02:55:49.669]  It's exactly the same, and people can get it off of my website at dr10penny.com.
[02:55:49.669 --> 02:55:54.974]  It's actually even on sale right now for $20, so there's no reason everybody shouldn't have it and pass it out to their friends.
[02:55:55.475 --> 02:55:58.256]  Well, I mean, in the book you say, are they mixing it in with the vaccine?
[02:55:58.256 --> 02:56:04.940]  And then we catch Baxter at 18 locations mixing it in with the big vats.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:10.263]  And then, thank God, somebody in the Czech Republic tested it on ferrets and it killed them.
[02:56:10.263 --> 02:56:13.284]  And then, separately, they won't say who the company is.
[02:56:13.284 --> 02:56:17.186]  But it says they had bird flu trials, London Telegraph says, that killed a bunch of people.
[02:56:17.186 --> 02:56:22.069]  But it says it was a pharma company, paid off officials to lie and give it to homeless.
[02:56:23.226 --> 02:56:24.767]  But it doesn't say it's Baxter.
[02:56:24.767 --> 02:56:27.029]  Do you have any intel on who that really is?
[02:56:27.029 --> 02:56:27.890]  No, I don't.
[02:56:27.890 --> 02:56:28.490]  Not right now.
[02:56:28.490 --> 02:56:31.953]  Not off the top of my head, but I'll bet you if we look long enough, we'll find it.
[02:56:31.953 --> 02:56:35.036]  Well, I mean, they arrested all the city officials in just one country.
[02:56:35.036 --> 02:56:37.718]  Why won't they say who the vaccine company is?
[02:56:39.065 --> 02:56:42.087]  Uh, you know, they probably have dirt on everybody.
[02:56:42.087 --> 02:56:44.628]  They probably threatened their children or something.
[02:56:44.628 --> 02:56:47.709]  You know, they're not, again, you know, they've killed off a lot of scientists.
[02:56:47.709 --> 02:56:56.653]  So it wouldn't be, you know, it wouldn't be out of line for them to put somebody on notice that if you talk something not good is going to happen to your family.
[02:56:56.653 --> 02:57:01.316]  Doc, I know you've got to go do an international conference call with some doctors discussing this.
[02:57:01.316 --> 02:57:05.878]  When is a good time for my producer to call you, because I know it's a limited window, to book, send in a crew?
[02:57:06.599 --> 02:57:08.660]  Um, you can call after 3 o'clock today.
[02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:20.008]  The call is for an hour, and I will be after the call today, and I think it would be really exciting to be part of the movement of what you're doing, Alex, because you're really making a difference, and I really want to thank you for all the work that you do.
[02:57:20.008 --> 02:57:20.769]  Well, I want to thank you.
[02:57:20.769 --> 02:57:26.572]  We'll call you at 3 your time in 1 hour, 3 minutes sharp, and we'll set up to send a crew.
[02:57:26.572 --> 02:57:27.773]  I'm almost out of personnel.
[02:57:27.773 --> 02:57:32.857]  I've got only two crews, and one of them's gone, and the other crew just got back from California.
[02:57:32.857 --> 02:57:33.997]  Doctor, we salute you.
[02:57:33.997 --> 02:57:35.498]  We'll talk to you in 1 hour and 2 minutes.
[02:57:36.579 --> 02:57:37.880]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:38.460]  Take care.
[02:57:38.460 --> 02:57:40.121]  Thank you.
[02:57:40.121 --> 02:57:48.705]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a joke, this isn't a game, this is the real deal, and everybody has got to see my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:57:48.705 --> 02:57:56.369]  This is the film that exposes the eugenicists, who they are, how a world government is a means to an end.
[02:57:56.369 --> 02:58:00.131]  It says, for the New World Order, a world government is just the beginning.
[02:58:00.131 --> 02:58:04.593]  Once in place, they will engage their plan to exterminate 80% of the world's population.
[02:58:05.723 --> 02:58:12.307]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly what EcoScience, written by the White House Science Czar, says.
[02:58:12.307 --> 02:58:19.651]  He says, a world government, a planetary regime, so we can sterilize and kill the majority of the population.
[02:58:19.651 --> 02:58:24.534]  Ladies and gentlemen, exactly what this film two and a half years ago says.
[02:58:24.534 --> 02:58:25.275]  Exactly.
[02:58:26.306 --> 02:58:28.328]  I was going off State Department documents, U.N.
[02:58:28.328 --> 02:58:30.670]  documents, where they stay up most of them.
[02:58:30.670 --> 02:58:34.233]  But I mean, this book, the more I read it, I'm almost done.
[02:58:34.233 --> 02:58:35.334]  It's worse than I thought.
[02:58:35.334 --> 02:58:36.776]  It's all real.
[02:58:36.776 --> 02:58:38.197]  It's all true.
[02:58:38.197 --> 02:58:39.018]  Endgame.
[02:58:39.018 --> 02:58:43.041]  Blueprint for global enslavement.

[02:58:50.882 --> 02:58:56.185]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:58:56.185 --> 02:58:58.287]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:58:58.287 --> 02:59:00.728]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:59:00.728 --> 02:59:03.009]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:59:03.009 --> 02:59:04.630]  You don't have to cooperate.

[03:00:04.394 --> 03:00:04.474]  Yeah.
[03:00:14.309 --> 03:00:21.273]  Ladies and gentlemen, syndicated across the United States and simulcasting right now over the web at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:21.273 --> 03:00:35.000]  I'm Alex Jones and for the next few segments we have John Rhys Davies coming on and later we have the director and producer of the film Reclaiming the Blade coming on the radio show as well.
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:40.843]  When the director contacted me and said he liked the radio show and that he'd like to see his film, I was flattered.
[03:00:40.843 --> 03:00:43.184]  As he has to see it, it's really the history of
[03:00:44.065 --> 03:00:59.351]  Swords, uh, you know, the whole culture, chivalry, and then when I saw that John Rhys-Davies was in it, you know, this is the guy, uh, who's, uh, plays one of the main characters in some of the Raiders of the Lost Ark films.
[03:00:59.351 --> 03:01:02.732]  I like the original, uh, and then also, uh, the, uh,
[03:01:03.412 --> 03:01:04.153]  It's my pleasure to join you.
[03:01:27.643 --> 03:01:29.825]  As I said, it's a beautiful evening here in the Isle of Man.
[03:01:29.825 --> 03:01:34.908]  The sun is setting over the Irish Sea, and it's a nice, clear evening.
[03:01:34.908 --> 03:01:41.993]  A bit of cloud in the sky, but it's warm and pleasant and just beautiful.
[03:01:41.993 --> 03:01:43.354]  Well, it's great to have you here.
[03:01:43.354 --> 03:01:51.440]  I mean, you don't really need any introduction, but tell us, how did you get involved in this documentary film, Reclaiming the Blade?
[03:01:52.654 --> 03:02:00.700]  Well, I get sent a number of scripts, some of which are very good, some of which are pretty mediocre.
[03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:03.862]  This one really stuck out like a sore thumb.
[03:02:03.862 --> 03:02:08.446]  When I say a sore thumb, I mean a very golden thumb.
[03:02:08.446 --> 03:02:18.253]  It was on a subject that I'd not seen covered before, and it had a lot of material in it that I thought was unique and fascinating.
[03:02:18.253 --> 03:02:19.454]  Anyone who's interested in the
[03:02:25.213 --> 03:02:26.934]  It's an extraordinary documentary.
[03:02:26.934 --> 03:02:33.696]  The sword is such an elegant symbol of so much, isn't it?
[03:02:33.696 --> 03:02:37.617]  The sword is a symbol of the cross.
[03:02:37.617 --> 03:02:40.738]  The sword is man's means of protecting himself.
[03:02:40.738 --> 03:02:46.820]  The sword is a symbol of justice.
[03:02:46.820 --> 03:02:48.721]  The sword is generally double-edged.
[03:02:58.138 --> 03:03:02.240]  In any civilization.
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:05.381]  I mean, there was a fascinating story the other day.
[03:03:05.381 --> 03:03:17.166]  There's a very great Viking sword maker and he signs some of his pieces.
[03:03:17.166 --> 03:03:22.108]  But some of them are puzzling to archaeologists because there were fragments of them.
[03:03:22.108 --> 03:03:26.030]  And they did some metallurgical analysis and they discovered that
[03:03:27.012 --> 03:03:32.898]  Somebody somewhere had been forging this swordsmith's work.
[03:03:32.898 --> 03:03:41.446]  And they had produced a marvellous cutting edge with the steel that they produce, but it was just too hard.
[03:03:41.446 --> 03:03:50.415]  The real stuff was forged from the right sort of ore, brought all the way from Afghanistan, would you believe.
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:04:02.646]  The local stuff that had been passed off by the swordsmith was indeed very pure iron and very pure steel, but it was fragile.
[03:04:02.646 --> 03:04:17.013]  So imagine you spend a fortune buying this legendary swordsmith's work, and the first time you're in battle and you smite your enemy's sword, your axe shrivels up into a pile of little
[03:04:17.213 --> 03:04:18.233]  I was almost taken away there.
[03:04:18.233 --> 03:04:21.355]  I was imaging all of this and forgot I was on the radio.
[03:04:38.519 --> 03:04:41.044]  It's good stuff.
[03:04:41.044 --> 03:04:45.832]  In a way, technology is always at the cutting edge of a civilization.
[03:04:45.832 --> 03:04:50.780]  And sadly, of course, much of that technology is war-inspired.
[03:04:56.285 --> 03:05:06.494]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:05:06.494 --> 03:05:10.258]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:10.498 --> 03:05:11.198]  Number 2.
[03:05:11.198 --> 03:05:16.401]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.401 --> 03:05:17.042]  It's true.
[03:05:17.042 --> 03:05:21.464]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.464 --> 03:05:22.385]  Number 3.
[03:05:22.385 --> 03:05:28.008]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:05:28.008 --> 03:05:28.689]  Number 4.
[03:05:28.689 --> 03:05:31.590]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:05:31.590 --> 03:05:35.252]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:35.252 --> 03:05:36.113]  Number 5.
[03:05:36.113 --> 03:05:39.715]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:05:39.955 --> 03:05:45.682]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:05:45.682 --> 03:05:50.387]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.387 --> 03:05:52.169]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:52.169 --> 03:05:54.732]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[03:06:00.859 --> 03:06:02.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:04.241]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:06:04.241 --> 03:06:04.861]  Well, you should.
[03:06:04.861 --> 03:06:09.703]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:06:09.703 --> 03:06:10.524]  That's right.
[03:06:10.524 --> 03:06:19.168]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:06:19.168 --> 03:06:20.528]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:06:20.528 --> 03:06:21.669]  Plus, if you act fast.
[03:06:21.889 --> 03:06:27.872]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:06:27.872 --> 03:06:34.756]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:06:34.756 --> 03:06:39.939]  Frontside provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:06:40.279 --> 03:06:41.721]  This is real.
[03:06:41.721 --> 03:06:42.782]  Don't miss out.

[03:08:01.693 --> 03:08:09.779]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.779 --> 03:08:13.401]  Well, he played solemn in the first big mega hit.
[03:08:17.031 --> 03:08:18.512]  We're good to go.
[03:08:41.056 --> 03:08:52.303]  From the Isle of Man, and it's great to have John Rhys-Davies on with us, who needs no introduction, but for folks watching us as we stream over the web, we'll put his picture up on screen.
[03:08:52.303 --> 03:08:54.364]  I've got so many questions.
[03:08:54.364 --> 03:09:07.232]  During the break, I was bringing up the fact that Mr. McNichol told me that this does have somewhat, not even of a political message, but of a liberty message, a freedom message.
[03:09:08.931 --> 03:09:17.118]  You know, with this reclaiming the blade and about how this was something to fight back against corruption, oppression, how that freedom, that skill was lost.
[03:09:17.118 --> 03:09:23.783]  I guess the whole history of the blade and the sword and how important it is, and people fighting for the right to own a sword has been lost.
[03:09:23.783 --> 03:09:28.707]  And I was asking you what your whole view on the world is.
[03:09:28.707 --> 03:09:35.072]  Well, you're right, and Daniel is right.
[03:09:35.072 --> 03:09:37.214]  The sword is a symbol of liberty.
[03:09:38.209 --> 03:09:40.770]  And liberty is something that's very challenged these days.
[03:09:40.770 --> 03:09:45.291]  I mean, there are things that overtly challenge our civilization.
[03:09:45.291 --> 03:10:00.314]  And because we tend to be rather modest, and rather, you know, we don't want to politically upset people needlessly, we tend to stand back a little bit.
[03:10:00.314 --> 03:10:05.995]  But look, Western European Christian civilization is very important.
[03:10:06.792 --> 03:10:18.064]  It has produced art, music, drama, theatre, dance, beyond the imaginings of any other culture.
[03:10:18.064 --> 03:10:29.155]  It stands for the liberty of the individual, the right of the individual to think, and to the extent that he doesn't affect others, practice virtually anything he believes
[03:10:35.961 --> 03:10:42.685]  The right of democracy over theocracy or any other isocracy.
[03:10:42.685 --> 03:10:47.548]  It's about the equality of men before the law.
[03:10:47.548 --> 03:10:52.370]  It's also about the equality of women with men in front of the law.
[03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:55.452]  It doesn't assume that women are third class citizens.
[03:10:55.452 --> 03:10:57.013]  It has abolished slavery.
[03:10:58.303 --> 03:11:02.869]  You must understand, slavery is an issue that particularly resonates with me.
[03:11:02.869 --> 03:11:05.252]  When I was a little boy, my father was a policeman in Africa.
[03:11:05.252 --> 03:11:10.780]  He took me down to the dockside in Dar es Salaam Harbour in 1955 and he said, you see that dhow there?
[03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:13.524]  Twice a year it comes down from Saudi Arabia.
[03:11:13.524 --> 03:11:16.067]  It stops in Aden, comes down the coast, goes
[03:11:20.131 --> 03:11:23.412]  On the way down, it's got machine tools and machine parts.
[03:11:23.412 --> 03:11:27.373]  On the way back up, it's always got two or three little black boys.
[03:11:27.373 --> 03:11:30.535]  And these are slaves going back to Saudi Arabia.
[03:11:30.535 --> 03:11:34.016]  And the United Nations will not allow me to do anything about it.
[03:11:34.016 --> 03:11:37.237]  Saudi Arabia only abolished slavery in 1965.
[03:11:37.237 --> 03:11:45.960]  And there is still slavery present in Saudi Arabia.
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:47.720]  I will wake up.
[03:11:51.260 --> 03:11:59.944]  You know, these are huge, huge gains for mankind that our civilization has made.
[03:11:59.944 --> 03:12:14.371]  And you've got to understand that certain religions, certain faiths, certain things, they have their strengths, but in a way, the way we engage in our civilization and within our faiths is the way that we turn out as people.
[03:12:14.371 --> 03:12:19.974]  And our civilization allows us to become rubbish, or it allows us to do almost anything.
[03:12:21.749 --> 03:12:30.374]  Other religions are more straight-jacket in their intellectual approach to education and theocracy and things like that.
[03:12:30.374 --> 03:12:39.580]  But ours gives us an unassailable liberty, and we must always be prepared to defend it.
[03:12:39.580 --> 03:12:45.583]  You know, I'm proud to belong to Western European Christian civilization.
[03:12:45.583 --> 03:12:51.427]  It's a glorious tradition, and we must speak out firmly and fairly for it.
[03:12:52.093 --> 03:12:54.896]  Well, that's what I was going to ask you.
[03:12:54.896 --> 03:13:07.369]  It's fashionable for 50 years to demonize the West, to attack anything that has to do with Western culture, and act like slavery was invented by the West, when it was actually the West that began to end slavery.
[03:13:07.369 --> 03:13:08.391]  Why do the modern
[03:13:10.112 --> 03:13:18.519]  So many modern thinkers and individuals love to paint the West as the progenitor of slavery, when really it was the West that began to end slavery.
[03:13:18.519 --> 03:13:22.482]  And many forms of slavery, as you said, still go on around the world.
[03:13:22.482 --> 03:13:23.663]  But that's okay.
[03:13:23.663 --> 03:13:27.246]  We only see endless films and productions about how the West is bad.
[03:13:27.246 --> 03:13:28.147]  The West is bad.
[03:13:28.147 --> 03:13:33.471]  And that's because liberty and freedom and the Magna Carta and so much more springs from the West.
[03:13:33.471 --> 03:13:36.774]  It is the enemy of the high-tech technocrats, I believe.
[03:13:40.928 --> 03:13:55.093]  There are a number of reasons why, for some reason, about 20% of the British population, I can't speak for the American population, but about 20% of the British population really hate Britain and all it stands for.
[03:13:55.093 --> 03:14:06.177]  Now these are white liberals, they're often well educated, but they really, they have no real understanding or caring for history.
[03:14:07.534 --> 03:14:07.754]  I don't
[03:14:26.806 --> 03:14:30.688]  Possibly get their hands on from the society that they're in.
[03:14:30.688 --> 03:14:31.968]  I don't know what you do about those 20%.
[03:14:31.968 --> 03:14:38.211]  I think they're just, you know, what do they say, the treason of the clerics.
[03:14:38.211 --> 03:14:39.872]  Why do they seem to always be in control?
[03:14:39.872 --> 03:14:46.215]  We have the same types here who claim they want all this liberty, but really they come to control.
[03:14:46.215 --> 03:14:47.316]  It's past the house here.
[03:14:47.916 --> 03:14:54.721]  To restrict free speech and have speech laws where if something you say hurts someone's feelings, you get arrested.
[03:14:54.721 --> 03:14:57.222]  I mean, how can that be happening in the United States?
[03:14:57.222 --> 03:14:59.164]  How can that be happening in Europe?
[03:14:59.164 --> 03:15:00.445]  How can this be going on?
[03:15:00.445 --> 03:15:06.169]  Well, Europe has a tradition of autocracy and intolerance.
[03:15:06.169 --> 03:15:11.192]  America is still the last best hope of mankind.
[03:15:11.192 --> 03:15:13.173]  And I hope that you will learn from our lessons.
[03:15:13.173 --> 03:15:16.936]  But I mean, I think in Europe, and particularly in my country,
[03:15:18.626 --> 03:15:27.514]  The liberal point of view is absolutely without question in public office.
[03:15:27.514 --> 03:15:31.017]  You dare to raise a question.
[03:15:31.017 --> 03:15:37.202]  Because if you do, you will be literally branded a fascist.
[03:15:37.202 --> 03:15:41.146]  No matter that you sort of say, look, these are the things I believe in, equality, democracy,
[03:15:43.676 --> 03:15:46.399]  It doesn't matter.
[03:15:46.399 --> 03:15:52.004]  There are certain things that are bywords for liberalism.
[03:15:52.004 --> 03:15:54.446]  If you don't endorse them, then really you're a fascist.
[03:15:54.446 --> 03:15:55.267]  So what do we do?
[03:15:55.267 --> 03:16:03.334]  Get outside the comfort zone and stop caring if they brand us and point out they are the ones behaving like fascists with the new global carbon tax?
[03:16:03.334 --> 03:16:07.057]  I don't want to get you involved here in the heresy.
[03:16:07.057 --> 03:16:08.659]  I don't want to get you burned at the stake here.
[03:16:08.659 --> 03:16:09.339]  There it is.
[03:16:13.072 --> 03:16:14.575]  I'm a denier, I should be honest with you.
[03:16:30.920 --> 03:16:35.445]  That's one of the natures of being a dynamic living planet.
[03:16:35.445 --> 03:16:44.734]  I don't suppose the climate's changing too much on Venus right at the moment, you know, because a bit of the sun is melting.
[03:16:44.734 --> 03:16:50.160]  But anyway, that would be one of the real reasons why
[03:16:53.961 --> 03:17:01.952]  The liberals, I'm only using that in the most pejorative way, there is something else called a liberal tradition.
[03:17:01.952 --> 03:17:07.058]  People calling themselves liberals, you would call yourself, or I would call myself a classical liberal.
[03:17:07.058 --> 03:17:09.942]  I want the classical real freedoms, not their fake
[03:17:10.442 --> 03:17:11.102]  I don't know.
[03:17:11.102 --> 03:17:12.563]  I mean, the real reason, the real reason I guess
[03:17:32.984 --> 03:17:42.632]  People like me and people like you have more interesting things to do with our lives than to stand up and engage in political activity.
[03:17:42.632 --> 03:17:50.078]  But our situation is so dire here that I'm actually seriously thinking of standing for the British Parliament in the next election.
[03:17:50.078 --> 03:17:56.603]  Unfortunately, I've not lived my life in that politically correct way that one should if one's going to be a politician.
[03:17:58.753 --> 03:18:07.860]  I have far too many skeletons in my closet and I will be ripped to shreds if I do.
[03:18:07.860 --> 03:18:25.313]  But the fault is ours because we were too busy, too self-important, and too absorbed with the wonderful and myriad things we can do with our lives in this glorious civilization we live in to actually stop the
[03:18:27.413 --> 03:18:29.034]  The cockroaches from running.
[03:18:29.034 --> 03:18:37.081]  And now, I was about to say that we've got to climb in and remove the parasites that are now arming themselves against us.
[03:18:37.081 --> 03:18:37.901]  Oh, that's right.
[03:18:37.901 --> 03:18:39.383]  That's right.
[03:18:39.383 --> 03:18:46.308]  I spoke to a senior civil servant about two years ago, and I said, well, you know, what do you see happening?
[03:18:46.308 --> 03:18:56.416]  He said, well, we will be a small part of the European Union, we will be ruled from Brussels, we will get rid of the monarchy, and we will be a small and peaceful part of Europe.
[03:18:57.102 --> 03:19:05.906]  And I said, well, I mean, didn't you take an oath of allegiance as a part of your thing to serve the Crown in Parliament and things like that?
[03:19:05.906 --> 03:19:12.189]  And he said, well, I mean, I think we can dispose of that into the dustbin of history.
[03:19:12.189 --> 03:19:15.911]  I said, you know, in my eyes, sir, you're just a traitor.
[03:19:15.911 --> 03:19:17.932]  You're just a quisling and a traitor.
[03:19:17.932 --> 03:19:22.234]  And he smiled at me and said, well, fortunately, you can't do anything about it.
[03:19:22.234 --> 03:19:23.275]  Ha ha ha!
[03:19:24.244 --> 03:19:25.285]  Incredible arrogance.
[03:19:25.285 --> 03:19:26.265]  I've run into similar things.
[03:19:26.265 --> 03:19:27.706]  Well, this is an amazing interview, sir.
[03:19:27.706 --> 03:19:31.087]  We're about to break and come back with another segment.
[03:19:31.087 --> 03:19:40.491]  But to continue this, in fact, I would like to get some into the film Reclaiming the Blade, which really does have contained in it a great portion of the spirit of liberty.
[03:19:40.491 --> 03:19:51.296]  And we're just honored that you're spending time with us today here to fight for what's left of Western civilization, which is being pulled down under assault because those very ideals threaten
[03:19:52.441 --> 03:19:59.464]  The parasites that have now infested our society, but I think the sleeping giant that is those that love liberty is beginning to rise.
[03:19:59.464 --> 03:20:01.405]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.405 --> 03:20:02.705]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.705 --> 03:20:08.288]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.288 --> 03:20:13.330]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.330 --> 03:20:13.790]  It's true.
[03:20:13.790 --> 03:20:18.352]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:20:18.892 --> 03:20:24.116]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.116 --> 03:20:26.438]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:20:26.438 --> 03:20:31.242]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.242 --> 03:20:32.363]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.363 --> 03:20:35.425]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:20:35.425 --> 03:20:38.708]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.028 --> 03:20:42.212]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:42.212 --> 03:20:44.434]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:44.434 --> 03:20:47.697]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:47.697 --> 03:20:50.460]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:50.460 --> 03:20:58.088]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:58.088 --> 03:21:00.471]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:21:01.886 --> 03:21:07.911]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.911 --> 03:21:13.796]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:13.796 --> 03:21:20.002]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.302 --> 03:21:22.283]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.283 --> 03:21:24.763]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:21:24.763 --> 03:21:35.667]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:37.944 --> 03:21:39.625]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.625 --> 03:21:41.486]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.486 --> 03:21:48.391]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.391 --> 03:21:56.656]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.656 --> 03:21:58.237]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.237 --> 03:21:59.418]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.806 --> 03:22:04.008]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[03:22:04.008 --> 03:22:06.930]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[03:22:06.930 --> 03:22:15.558]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[03:22:15.558 --> 03:22:19.221]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[03:22:19.221 --> 03:22:23.764]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[03:22:23.764 --> 03:22:25.346]  How much are you willing to lose?
[03:22:25.726 --> 03:22:26.787]  Take action now!
[03:22:26.787 --> 03:22:31.610]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:35.592]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[03:22:35.592 --> 03:22:38.914]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[03:22:38.914 --> 03:22:45.338]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[03:22:45.638 --> 03:22:47.841]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[03:22:47.841 --> 03:22:49.023]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[03:22:49.023 --> 03:22:50.645]  Call me, John Humer, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[03:23:01.107 --> 03:23:11.670]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:13.090]  Garden in a Can!
[03:23:13.090 --> 03:23:17.231]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[03:23:17.231 --> 03:23:19.251]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[03:23:19.251 --> 03:23:21.532]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[03:23:22.012 --> 03:23:31.697]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[03:23:31.697 --> 03:23:33.118]  Garden in a can.
[03:23:33.118 --> 03:23:34.319]  It's that simple.
[03:23:34.319 --> 03:23:35.019]  Fresh.
[03:23:35.019 --> 03:23:35.880]  Healthy.
[03:23:35.880 --> 03:23:36.700]  Easy.
[03:23:36.700 --> 03:23:41.062]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[03:23:41.062 --> 03:23:41.943]  Ready when you are.

[03:24:09.969 --> 03:24:13.434]  John Rhys-Davies, legendary actor, will be with us till 40 after.
[03:24:13.434 --> 03:24:17.760]  Then we're going to get the maker of the film Reclaiming the Blade on with us for Balance of the Time.
[03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:22.287]  I'm sorry we're not covering Michael Jackson and his funeral, but I think there's been enough coverage of that today.
[03:24:24.780 --> 03:24:26.060]  But Mr. Davies, it intrigues me.
[03:24:26.060 --> 03:24:36.364]  We'll talk some in the final segment about the film Reclaiming the Blade about more of your political ideas because I sense that you're almost exploding with the desire to speak up and say no to what's happening.
[03:24:36.364 --> 03:24:43.006]  Are you concerned about the European Union trying to force the Lisbon Treaty on countries that have voted it down time and time again?
[03:24:45.146 --> 03:24:57.072]  The Labour Party said that they wouldn't go along with it without a vote, but now they're covertly using the bureaucracy to bring Britannia under the yoke of Europe.
[03:24:57.072 --> 03:25:00.774]  What are some of your other concerns that would make you run for Parliament?
[03:25:00.774 --> 03:25:03.356]  Well, certainly that would be one.
[03:25:03.356 --> 03:25:04.836]  We were promised a referendum.
[03:25:04.836 --> 03:25:10.879]  We had a referendum many years ago, I think about 1976 or something like that.
[03:25:16.453 --> 03:25:18.576]  To enter the EU.
[03:25:18.576 --> 03:25:20.177]  To enter the common market.
[03:25:20.177 --> 03:25:22.420]  And the common market is what most of us want.
[03:25:22.420 --> 03:25:25.143]  Frankly, it's what most Europeans want.
[03:25:25.143 --> 03:25:31.230]  But not many people, other than the paid bureaucrats, want a close political union.
[03:25:33.310 --> 03:25:38.036]  You know, cooperation between states is admirable and wonderful.
[03:25:38.036 --> 03:25:50.010]  But really, I don't want to make a political statement here and be arrested and summarily extradited to Greece to stand up because it contravenes Greek law.
[03:25:51.786 --> 03:26:14.927]  We are trading our liberties at an alarming rate, and the only reason that this government is still in power is because Brown has been told by the EU, stay there until the Irish can have their third referendum, and this time we'll shake the pips and make it clear that they'll be bankrupt if they don't vote for an EU reunion.
[03:26:14.927 --> 03:26:16.689]  And then, of course, it becomes automatic.
[03:26:19.823 --> 03:26:22.584]  And theoretically irreversible.
[03:26:22.584 --> 03:26:31.147]  And Brown, of course, will end up getting a senior job in the EU.
[03:26:31.147 --> 03:26:35.289]  It is straightforward political corruption.
[03:26:35.289 --> 03:26:40.091]  It's corruption and treason at the highest level.
[03:26:40.091 --> 03:26:44.273]  And of course, the first thing this government did, of course, when they got into power, was to remove
[03:26:46.994 --> 03:26:50.681]  You can no longer hang a man for treason.
[03:26:50.681 --> 03:26:56.030]  Oh no, that's too unkind to him.
[03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:57.693]  Maybe send him to prison for three years.
[03:26:59.437 --> 03:27:13.566]  Well, it is treason to have now Blair about to be EU head for his treason, and they've got millions of surveillance cameras and secret police everywhere, and they're going to have climate cops with climate rationing.
[03:27:13.566 --> 03:27:19.330]  I mean, this is just a way for the government control freaks to literally enslave everybody.
[03:27:19.330 --> 03:27:25.534]  And you look at the Poles, the Brits, the French, the Irish, none of them want this, but it continues to steamroller forward
[03:27:26.502 --> 03:27:32.330]  Just thank God you're speaking up, and I hope many others will start speaking up.
[03:27:32.330 --> 03:27:40.703]  There is a huge groundswell of resentment, and it really only needs a trigger.
[03:27:43.623 --> 03:27:50.507]  For this to become really very unpleasant and very socially explosive and divisive.
[03:27:50.507 --> 03:27:51.447]  Very unpleasant.
[03:27:51.447 --> 03:27:53.088]  I like the way you put that.
[03:27:53.088 --> 03:27:53.769]  Absolutely.
[03:27:53.769 --> 03:27:55.369]  Everybody worldwide wants liberty.
[03:27:55.369 --> 03:27:56.810]  They don't want tyranny.
[03:27:56.810 --> 03:28:01.833]  Speaking of the blade, you know... You see, that's a sad thing.
[03:28:01.833 --> 03:28:03.434]  That's the saddest thing of all.
[03:28:03.434 --> 03:28:05.855]  Not everybody wants freedom.
[03:28:05.855 --> 03:28:06.995]  I guess you're right.
[03:28:06.995 --> 03:28:09.837]  Some people want their decisions made for them.
[03:28:11.365 --> 03:28:13.867]  Well, it seems like I want freedom, so I think everybody else wants it.
[03:28:13.867 --> 03:28:14.507]  But I guess you're right.
[03:28:14.507 --> 03:28:18.010]  A lot of people do want to live under a nanny state control freak system.
[03:28:18.010 --> 03:28:25.596]  But speaking of the blade, as I'm sure you know, in England, they're trying to make you have a license now for a butcher knife, like in China.
[03:28:25.596 --> 03:28:31.080]  And so I guess for people to defend themselves, some people have been using swords and knives in their own homes.
[03:28:31.080 --> 03:28:35.103]  And when they get attacked and defend themselves, the police go persecute them.
[03:28:35.103 --> 03:28:39.987]  Is that because the state wants a monopoly of force and doesn't want citizens defending themselves?
[03:28:41.655 --> 03:28:43.699]  It must be something like that.
[03:28:43.699 --> 03:28:46.165]  I mean, the police...
[03:28:50.037 --> 03:28:52.818]  And we understand that we can't do that.
[03:28:52.818 --> 03:28:54.339]  We don't want to lynch mobs.
[03:28:54.339 --> 03:28:56.520]  Defending yourself?
[03:28:56.520 --> 03:29:01.302]  Well, yes, but defending yourself, you're allowed to use reasonable force.
[03:29:01.302 --> 03:29:15.468]  However, if you happen to have a particularly liberal judge who's a liberal appointee or something like that, he may very well decide that, you know, when you took that big heavy walking stick and
[03:29:16.337 --> 03:29:17.098]  Yes, I think so.
[03:29:36.956 --> 03:29:40.559]  Oh, yes, when you're getting attacked in the middle of the night, you're supposed to control yourself.
[03:29:40.559 --> 03:29:41.119]  Amazing!
[03:29:41.119 --> 03:29:42.901]  And that's what Reclaiming the Blade's all about.
[03:29:42.901 --> 03:29:47.984]  We'll talk about the film in our final segment with our guest, John Rhys-Davies, straight ahead.
[03:29:47.984 --> 03:29:51.607]  We really appreciate him giving us his time in the evening.
[03:29:51.607 --> 03:29:52.988]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.988 --> 03:29:55.510]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.510 --> 03:29:58.212]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.840 --> 03:30:04.843]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:04.843 --> 03:30:10.170]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.170 --> 03:30:12.232]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.232 --> 03:30:17.238]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.238 --> 03:30:18.419]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.419 --> 03:30:19.140]  When do you want it?
[03:30:19.520 --> 03:30:21.401]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.401 --> 03:30:22.482]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.482 --> 03:30:24.683]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.683 --> 03:30:26.024]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.024 --> 03:30:27.544]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.544 --> 03:30:32.807]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:32.807 --> 03:30:36.389]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:39.871]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.211 --> 03:30:41.432]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.432 --> 03:30:42.332]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.332 --> 03:30:43.453]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.453 --> 03:30:44.374]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.374 --> 03:30:45.474]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.474 --> 03:30:48.516]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:48.516 --> 03:30:50.758]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:50.758 --> 03:30:51.738]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:00.874 --> 03:31:06.181]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:31:06.181 --> 03:31:10.727]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:10.727 --> 03:31:12.990]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:12.990 --> 03:31:14.612]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:14.612 --> 03:31:15.654]  There is a solution.
[03:31:15.874 --> 03:31:24.300]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:32:01.172 --> 03:32:05.714]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:32:05.714 --> 03:32:08.275]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:32:08.275 --> 03:32:17.939]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:32:17.939 --> 03:32:24.141]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:32:24.141 --> 03:32:26.843]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:32:26.843 --> 03:32:29.224]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years
[03:32:30.404 --> 03:32:30.724]  I think so.
[03:32:53.070 --> 03:32:54.534]  OwnMyself.com.
[03:32:54.534 --> 03:32:58.325]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:32:58.325 --> 03:33:00.811]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[03:33:04.893 --> 03:33:07.895]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[03:33:07.895 --> 03:33:11.076]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.076 --> 03:33:18.600]  You know, I forgot to tell you that Viggo Mortensen is also in Reclaiming the Blade.
[03:33:30.564 --> 03:33:36.049]  And this is a two-disc special, so before our guests leave you, I'm going to have the director tell you where you can get a copy of it.
[03:33:36.049 --> 03:33:43.096]  Well, ReclaimingTheBlade.com is one place that's going to hit TV and stores very, very soon if it hasn't already hit.
[03:33:43.096 --> 03:33:43.576]  I was lucky.
[03:33:43.576 --> 03:33:49.962]  I got this like two months ago and saw it before anybody else had, so I'm not up to date on where it is and where it's airing, but I know it's going to be on TV.
[03:33:50.723 --> 03:33:52.345]  Already been on a bunch of TV stations.
[03:33:52.345 --> 03:33:56.810]  So we'll find out all those details with the director, Daniel McNichol, here in just a moment.
[03:33:56.810 --> 03:34:07.203]  But I'm telling you, I am blown away by talking to the man who played all these great roles that I was just such a fan of.
[03:34:07.823 --> 03:34:09.303]  That's a very good representation of that, yes.
[03:34:09.303 --> 03:34:11.744]  But you see, Lord of the Rings is very much about that.
[03:34:35.905 --> 03:34:46.632]  It's very much about a challenge coming to your civilization that will either destroy your civilization, or you must rise and stand up and fight for it.
[03:34:46.632 --> 03:34:48.813]  And if you don't, you'll lose your civilization.
[03:34:48.813 --> 03:34:52.595]  And if you do, you might just save it.
[03:34:52.595 --> 03:34:54.376]  Now we've got Gimli on the air with us.
[03:34:54.376 --> 03:35:00.700]  Gimli, what was it like working with Aragorn of Arathorn?
[03:35:00.700 --> 03:35:01.401]  Aragorn?
[03:35:01.401 --> 03:35:02.862]  Oh, he's the best.
[03:35:14.945 --> 03:35:21.988]  Well, it is essentially a dwarf story, you know, about the recovery of the ring, with the help of hobbits and others.
[03:35:21.988 --> 03:35:27.490]  Well, the ring did come from below the ground, and that's the realm of dwarves.
[03:35:27.490 --> 03:35:28.951]  That's right, that's right.
[03:35:28.951 --> 03:35:32.152]  It was our goal originally, I fear.
[03:35:32.152 --> 03:35:35.774]  But you've got to be careful of the concentration of power, you see.
[03:35:36.587 --> 03:35:42.531]  Power does corrupt, and absolute power does corrupt absolutely.
[03:35:42.531 --> 03:35:46.133]  One ring to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them?
[03:35:46.133 --> 03:35:53.077]  One ring to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them.
[03:35:53.077 --> 03:35:57.580]  In the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie.
[03:35:59.222 --> 03:36:01.944]  Oh my god, you know what?
[03:36:01.944 --> 03:36:05.847]  I really want to get you back on sometime because this has been an amazing interview.
[03:36:05.847 --> 03:36:12.712]  You've even got more energy in person and it's just a lot of fun because I'm a big fan of those movies as well.
[03:36:12.712 --> 03:36:15.394]  And then to find out you're a lover of liberty and a patriot.
[03:36:15.394 --> 03:36:20.118]  Before we go to the director, and you've been gracious to stay with us while the director's on with us,
[03:36:20.976 --> 03:36:32.430]  We were kind of ranting during the breaks talking and you were bringing up some of the other tyrannies that Europe and England are coming under that were outraging you and that have the rest of the citizenry outraged.
[03:36:32.430 --> 03:36:37.937]  What are some of the other beefs that you have with what's happening right now in Europe and England?
[03:36:38.669 --> 03:36:48.520]  Well, in Britain in particular, our ex-Chancellor, who is now our Prime Minister, is a man of extraordinary self-delusion.
[03:36:48.520 --> 03:36:55.067]  I mean, he really did believe that his activity saved the world during the banking crisis.
[03:36:57.029 --> 03:37:02.351]  He's confidently saying that he will not cut public services.
[03:37:02.351 --> 03:37:12.777]  At a time when, for instance, 100,000 private sector jobs were lost, he managed to add 30,000 public sector employees.
[03:37:12.777 --> 03:37:17.399]  In the end, you cannot spend your way out of debt.
[03:37:18.331 --> 03:37:25.936]  In the end, everyone in the private sector supports all the people in the public sector.
[03:37:25.936 --> 03:37:31.999]  In the end, government works for us, not for us working for the government.
[03:37:31.999 --> 03:37:43.566]  These are just inalienable truths, but somehow they seem to be forgotten so easily by every damn common political jackass.
[03:37:45.427 --> 03:37:51.569]  No, no, you're right, but it's a vertically integrated economy, and it's the same here in the United States.
[03:37:51.569 --> 03:37:53.029]  Everything's collapsing.
[03:37:53.029 --> 03:38:12.495]  We're losing 640,000 plus jobs a month, and they're expanding the size of government, and they're increasing all the taxes, and the shops are starting to all close, and the government says, we're going to hold you by your legs, like the Sheriff of Nottingham, and shake the shillings out of your pockets.
[03:38:13.941 --> 03:38:16.208]  It's almost like they want us to have a revolution.
[03:38:16.208 --> 03:38:18.735]  It's like they want to force us into confrontation.
[03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:21.342]  Well, I don't think it's that.
[03:38:21.342 --> 03:38:36.914]  There is a belief that if you hold circuses and give bread, and just give and give and give, then you will create an electric that's wholly obligated to you.
[03:38:36.914 --> 03:38:43.819]  Unfortunately, in the end, the buck has to stop somewhere, and the only way out of it is the government will have to start printing paper.
[03:38:45.032 --> 03:38:49.833]  You know, and I have lived in societies where inflation has gone to 3%, 4%, 5% a day.
[03:38:49.833 --> 03:38:51.373]  Imagine having 10 savings, your life savings is $10,000.
[03:38:51.373 --> 03:38:52.273]  It's a good little hunk.
[03:38:52.273 --> 03:38:54.894]  With that $10,000, you can actually do something.
[03:38:54.894 --> 03:38:57.734]  And in the space of one year, that $10,000 isn't worth enough to buy your family a meal.
[03:39:12.648 --> 03:39:15.289]  You imagine how mad you'd be.
[03:39:15.289 --> 03:39:20.551]  And that was Yugoslavia just, what, 15, 18 years ago, 20 years ago.
[03:39:20.551 --> 03:39:28.134]  Look at Zimbabwe, look at other... I mean, look... In fact, all this money they've spent is guaranteed to start coming back in.
[03:39:28.134 --> 03:39:32.836]  We're already seeing inflation in many areas go up, even though housing's going down.
[03:39:32.836 --> 03:39:36.978]  It's kind of a nightmare, stag inflation that's starting to set in.
[03:39:36.978 --> 03:39:38.839]  Yes, indeed.
[03:39:38.839 --> 03:39:41.500]  And the terrible thing is, you see,
[03:39:42.561 --> 03:39:50.915]  In a way, spending your way out of inflation, out of depression, is a theoretically interesting way of doing it.
[03:39:54.127 --> 03:40:07.015]  But you have to really have, you have to really have to have growth in place, or the seeds of growth in place that will match the investment that you're putting into things.
[03:40:07.015 --> 03:40:12.699]  Instead it all goes for bonuses to offshore banks, and the carbon tax is a wet blanket on that economy.
[03:40:12.699 --> 03:40:17.963]  The carbon tax is just a bottle, it's just an extra way of taxing people, that's all.
[03:40:17.963 --> 03:40:22.786]  And I'm sorry if I'm interrupting when you were getting into matching actual development
[03:40:23.346 --> 03:40:25.248]  I guess like monorail trains, better roads.
[03:40:25.248 --> 03:40:31.292]  Instead, more and more just goes for debt, servicing the debt, like we are Zimbabwe, as everything collapses.
[03:40:31.292 --> 03:40:32.754]  I don't know about England.
[03:40:32.754 --> 03:40:36.196]  I was just over there a few years ago, but we have bridges collapsing every week.
[03:40:36.196 --> 03:40:37.417]  The roads are rotting.
[03:40:37.417 --> 03:40:42.681]  I mean, you go to stores now, and then the carpet's peeling up.
[03:40:42.681 --> 03:40:45.143]  Well, we're now paying, I think, more for
[03:40:47.363 --> 03:40:47.583]  Amazing.
[03:40:47.583 --> 03:40:48.125]  Well, John...
[03:40:58.081 --> 03:40:59.382]  John Rhys-Davies is our guest.
[03:40:59.382 --> 03:41:00.563]  He doesn't need any introduction.
[03:41:00.563 --> 03:41:06.366]  You know, Sala from, of course, the writers of The Lost Ark and other Indiana Jones films.
[03:41:06.366 --> 03:41:12.310]  Harrison Ford, who calls a huge star in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and so many other huge films.
[03:41:12.310 --> 03:41:21.216]  Before we get in the remaining minutes with the director into reclaiming the blade, you're just a very interesting man, obviously, but I mean, seriously, you really are.
[03:41:21.216 --> 03:41:22.477]  What are some of your other interests?
[03:41:22.477 --> 03:41:23.998]  What else is on your mind?
[03:41:23.998 --> 03:41:25.419]  What else are you working on right now?
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:35.525]  Well, I just did a little radio thing today, which is why I was a little bit late coming back.
[03:41:35.525 --> 03:41:36.926]  But my private passions?
[03:41:36.926 --> 03:41:40.488]  Well, I have a three-year-old daughter who is the love of my life.
[03:41:40.488 --> 03:41:45.751]  I'm extraordinarily happy at this moment in time.
[03:41:45.751 --> 03:41:50.274]  In my last four and a half years, I've been extremely happy.
[03:41:51.194 --> 03:41:52.355]  I don't know.
[03:42:21.235 --> 03:42:26.305]  I like getting up in the morning and getting my hands dirty.
[03:42:26.305 --> 03:42:27.768]  Or writing or something like that.
[03:42:27.768 --> 03:42:29.833]  And you're also into swords.
[03:42:29.833 --> 03:42:32.097]  I mean, you're somewhat of a swordsman yourself.
[03:42:33.542 --> 03:42:34.323]  I used to be.
[03:42:34.323 --> 03:42:38.746]  Unfortunately, I broke my back and my arm on a film set about six years ago.
[03:42:38.746 --> 03:42:42.489]  Oh, I didn't know that!
[03:42:42.489 --> 03:42:48.594]  I moved from being a fairly hard old man, really, to being an old wimp.
[03:42:48.594 --> 03:42:59.122]  But I have to confess that even before Daniel's thing came, I do sleep with a samurai sword beside my bed.
[03:42:59.122 --> 03:42:59.843]  And it is sharp.
[03:43:03.033 --> 03:43:04.874]  Burglars should be aware of this.
[03:43:04.874 --> 03:43:06.815]  I tend to swing rather heavily.
[03:43:06.815 --> 03:43:12.539]  Just in case we get a visitor.
[03:43:12.539 --> 03:43:13.299]  Incredible.
[03:43:13.299 --> 03:43:14.340]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:43:14.340 --> 03:43:16.662]  Wow, I didn't know you'd broken your back and your arm.
[03:43:16.662 --> 03:43:17.462]  What film was that?
[03:43:17.462 --> 03:43:25.007]  Oh, it was a piece of rubbish really called The Farm Musketeer.
[03:43:25.007 --> 03:43:27.048]  But it had some nice people in it.
[03:43:27.048 --> 03:43:27.729]  Michael York.
[03:43:28.556 --> 03:43:31.817]  The Great Depardieu and a few others.
[03:43:31.817 --> 03:43:32.857]  But you're doing better now.
[03:43:32.857 --> 03:43:35.038]  I mean, you certainly sound good.
[03:43:35.038 --> 03:43:35.778]  I am good.
[03:43:35.778 --> 03:43:41.639]  If it wasn't for that rigid back of mine, I would be in extraordinary good health.
[03:43:41.639 --> 03:43:49.782]  And every time I start feeling poor me, poor me, I suddenly start thinking, you know, you could be a quadriplegic or you could be dead.
[03:43:49.782 --> 03:43:51.202]  Think about that, old man.
[03:43:51.202 --> 03:43:54.923]  And yes, suddenly my aches and pains don't seem to matter.
[03:43:54.923 --> 03:43:55.363]  Incredible.
[03:43:56.007 --> 03:43:57.349]  Yeah.
[03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:59.271]  And you live on the Isle of Man.
[03:43:59.271 --> 03:44:00.051]  Pardon?
[03:44:00.051 --> 03:44:02.494]  You live on the Isle of Man.
[03:44:02.494 --> 03:44:03.435]  Yes, I have a place here.
[03:44:03.435 --> 03:44:05.057]  I've had a place here for about 20 odd years.
[03:44:05.057 --> 03:44:06.719]  More than that.
[03:44:06.719 --> 03:44:08.641]  22 years, I think.
[03:44:08.641 --> 03:44:12.985]  It has been described as 70,000 alcoholics clinging to a rock in the Irish Sea.
[03:44:21.507 --> 03:44:24.733]  If you're a motorbike man, it is heaven itself.
[03:44:24.733 --> 03:44:25.955]  It is Valhalla.
[03:44:25.955 --> 03:44:30.764]  It is where the greatest street racing takes place.
[03:44:31.710 --> 03:44:33.151]  Valhalla.
[03:44:33.151 --> 03:44:35.452]  Yeah, Rick Linklater was over there making a movie about Orson Welles.
[03:44:35.452 --> 03:44:36.693]  He told me it was a really neat place.
[03:44:36.693 --> 03:44:37.973]  I want to visit it sometime.
[03:44:37.973 --> 03:44:39.114]  John Rhys-Davies is our guest.
[03:44:39.114 --> 03:44:43.556]  Let's go to the directory, claimingtheblade.com, and here is the film.
[03:44:43.556 --> 03:44:49.119]  They actually gave me some free copies to give out as prizes.
[03:44:49.119 --> 03:44:56.623]  So I will just say this, that at the end of the show, I am going to give you an email address, and the first ten emails that come in,
[03:44:57.714 --> 03:45:02.215]  Asking for one with your address, you get Reclaiming the Blade.
[03:45:02.215 --> 03:45:18.259]  And I guess we should spend a few minutes with the director himself, Daniel McNichol, talking about what is in this great film that got Viggo in it, and you got John, and you got so many other, the sword master, the top guy in Hollywood who trained all the folks for Star Wars and so many other films.
[03:45:18.259 --> 03:45:22.920]  I mean, this is a who's who, but it's also pro-self-defense, pro-liberty.
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:23.560]  What a message.
[03:45:24.773 --> 03:45:27.756]  Wow, what a conversation you guys have been having.
[03:45:27.756 --> 03:45:31.721]  I feel unworthy to chime in.
[03:45:31.721 --> 03:45:36.706]  You've always got great guests, and Jon's absolutely one of them.
[03:45:36.706 --> 03:45:40.230]  But yeah, the film is out now.
[03:45:40.230 --> 03:45:45.596]  It's going to soon be available at Barnes & Noble, so you can kind of walk in the store
[03:45:46.423 --> 03:45:51.927]  Pick those up in Hastings, a couple other brick-and-mortar type stores, and of course it's on our website.
[03:45:51.927 --> 03:45:57.231]  Apple iTunes is going to soon have it as well for digital downloads and all that good stuff.
[03:45:57.231 --> 03:46:15.964]  But no, it was a lot of fun to make, and working with people like John Rhys-Davies, legendary actors of the screen and stage, it's just, I'm honored to have had the opportunity to work with these guys and just bring the story out there.
[03:46:16.559 --> 03:46:26.947]  Well, I know you've made some other, you know, pretty big films, but, I mean, even for a huge director, or someone who's had a bunch of big films, it's hard to get all these actors and all these... I know.
[03:46:26.947 --> 03:46:29.589]  I've done nothing so far.
[03:46:29.589 --> 03:46:32.070]  This is my first film.
[03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:36.354]  But I've... Well, I mean, I've seen you've been involved in quite a few of the big productions.
[03:46:36.354 --> 03:46:38.215]  I guess this is your first film that you're in.
[03:46:38.215 --> 03:46:39.596]  So that's my question.
[03:46:39.596 --> 03:46:42.238]  How did you get all these great people together?
[03:46:43.664 --> 03:46:45.746]  Well, you know, it starts one at a time.
[03:46:45.746 --> 03:46:52.892]  It always helps to have somebody like John Rhys-Davies early on believing in the script.
[03:46:52.892 --> 03:47:00.098]  His name is not only legendary among the fans, but legendary among other actors and filmmakers.
[03:47:00.098 --> 03:47:02.621]  So, you know, having somebody like him on board
[03:47:02.961 --> 03:47:11.508]  That's right, I should add, it's narrated by John Rhys-Davies, and he's also in the film, and then there's an extra DVD that comes with it, correct?
[03:47:11.508 --> 03:47:18.693]  Yeah, yeah, actually that's where our interview with John is, and of course he narrates the film, so he's performing.
[03:47:18.693 --> 03:47:25.879]  And the other fellows, Viggo and Karl Urban and Bob Anderson, who was Darth Vader, we did interviews with them, of course.
[03:47:25.879 --> 03:47:27.800]  Darth Vader!
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:30.743]  And by the way, I promise you the lightsabers are on the way.
[03:47:31.643 --> 03:47:33.283]  Hey, you don't have to ply me with loot.
[03:47:33.283 --> 03:47:36.484]  I'm just happy to get the lightsabers and have more battles with my kids.
[03:47:36.484 --> 03:47:41.145]  I know the guys there will probably love them and they're just a lot of fun, so.
[03:47:41.145 --> 03:47:45.686]  I tell you, my children murder me every day with those lightsabers, so I'll be glad to get some more.
[03:47:45.686 --> 03:47:51.487]  Going back to John Rhys-Davies, I should have made that point early on because I was aware of it.
[03:47:51.487 --> 03:47:56.888]  You were instrumental in getting this made and were really the first big name to come on board.
[03:47:58.587 --> 03:48:03.031]  Was that because you're just so into the history of the blade and reclaiming it?
[03:48:03.031 --> 03:48:06.134]  I thought it was a very interesting idea.
[03:48:06.134 --> 03:48:21.367]  I'm quite well read, and it's not often that I read a script that actually informs me so much about areas that I had no idea existed.
[03:48:21.367 --> 03:48:23.769]  And I thought it was really
[03:48:25.169 --> 03:48:35.757]  Really deserving of attention, and I'm glad that I was in some very slight way useful in getting the thing made and put together.
[03:48:35.757 --> 03:48:42.403]  But please do not overestimate my powers or contribution.
[03:48:42.403 --> 03:48:44.404]  This is Daniel's project.
[03:48:44.404 --> 03:48:49.428]  It was well-thought, well-sought resource, and well-served.
[03:48:53.558 --> 03:49:04.022]  It's an interesting subject, and no matter how well you know it, there will be detail and information there that makes you go, wow, I never understood that.
[03:49:04.022 --> 03:49:08.324]  Now, that whole area is now illuminated for me.
[03:49:08.324 --> 03:49:18.028]  Well, I was going to agree with you that I'm somewhat well-read about history, just because it's interesting, and about chivalry and different wars that happened in the Middle Ages.
[03:49:18.528 --> 03:49:36.950]  And then even in some of the more modern wars and I learned a lot watching the film and of course the extras that are in it so folks should go to reclaimingtheblade.com and get the film with the extras reclaiming the blade with John Rhys Davies featuring Viggo Mortensen and many many others Bob Anderson and Carl Urban
[03:49:37.450 --> 03:49:43.553]  But in closing, Mr. Davies, I hope that we can sometime off in the future have you back on.
[03:49:43.553 --> 03:49:45.533]  We appreciate you giving us your precious time.
[03:49:45.533 --> 03:49:51.996]  I'm going to come back in the final segment and talk with the director about the film a little bit more.
[03:49:51.996 --> 03:49:56.698]  But I wanted to ask you specifically
[03:49:57.623 --> 03:50:03.988]  About kind of the archetype of Mordor that wants this global domination, this total control over Middle Earth.
[03:50:03.988 --> 03:50:11.394]  Have, in your research, have you ever studied the globalist and the New World Order and this whole technocratic world government that's being set up?
[03:50:11.394 --> 03:50:13.156]  And if so, what's your view on that?
[03:50:16.628 --> 03:50:17.849]  Yes, indeed.
[03:50:17.849 --> 03:50:23.354]  If all our princes were true philosophers, what a wonderful world it would be.
[03:50:23.354 --> 03:50:37.086]  But since they're not, since they're nasty, venal, and corrupt, most of them, and some are just misguided idealists out to do the best thing and making a terrible hash of the whole thing.
[03:50:40.299 --> 03:50:46.263]  In the end, liberty is down to individuals and groups of individuals.
[03:50:46.263 --> 03:50:49.044]  Sometimes it can be expressed as a nation.
[03:50:49.044 --> 03:50:59.570]  The United States is still the most liberally, and I mean that in the finest way, is still the country with the greatest level of liberty and
[03:51:03.075 --> 03:51:07.597]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:51:07.597 --> 03:51:12.679]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:51:12.679 --> 03:51:14.200]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:17.801]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[03:51:17.801 --> 03:51:23.223]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[03:51:23.223 --> 03:51:29.006]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[03:51:29.326 --> 03:51:31.848]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[03:51:31.848 --> 03:51:34.369]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[03:51:34.369 --> 03:51:36.811]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[03:51:36.811 --> 03:51:38.011]  No harsh chemicals.
[03:51:38.011 --> 03:51:39.192]  No animal testing.
[03:51:39.192 --> 03:51:40.513]  I use them and love them.
[03:51:40.513 --> 03:51:42.414]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[03:51:42.414 --> 03:51:43.835]  And I say big time.
[03:51:43.835 --> 03:51:45.536]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:51:45.536 --> 03:51:45.916]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[03:51:55.322 --> 03:52:03.247]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:52:03.247 --> 03:52:09.071]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:09.071 --> 03:52:16.636]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:52:16.636 --> 03:52:22.800]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:25.201]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:25.201 --> 03:52:27.701]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:27.701 --> 03:52:39.285]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:39.285 --> 03:52:40.945]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.945 --> 03:52:42.806]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.806 --> 03:52:49.068]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.709 --> 03:52:57.983]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.983 --> 03:52:59.566]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.566 --> 03:53:00.748]  The people strike back!
[03:53:02.930 --> 03:53:10.154]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[03:53:10.154 --> 03:53:14.096]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[03:53:14.096 --> 03:53:22.420]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[03:53:22.420 --> 03:53:25.321]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[03:53:25.321 --> 03:53:28.103]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[03:53:28.103 --> 03:53:32.305]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[03:53:32.585 --> 03:53:34.206]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[03:53:34.206 --> 03:53:36.288]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:36.288 --> 03:53:39.030]  Here you will find radio-blocking secure sleeves.

[03:53:50.558 --> 03:53:53.020]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:53.020 --> 03:53:55.502]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:55.502 --> 03:53:56.002]  Or call 1-800-610-2770.
[03:53:58.784 --> 03:54:04.327]  1-800-610-2770 for their plan and they want us to feel like we don't have power.
[03:54:04.327 --> 03:54:06.708]  They want us to feel like we can't control our destiny.
[03:54:06.708 --> 03:54:23.818]  But I'm here to tell people if they'll just I mean look at you like you said you've been in a few films worked on some films but this was your first big film your first film period and you went out and got some of the biggest names out there and I've seen the film it's it you know just shot with incredible cinematography uh it's very diverse film
[03:54:24.438 --> 03:54:26.181]  And you just did such a great job.
[03:54:26.181 --> 03:54:31.668]  Another testament to simply taking action instead of talking about it, getting it done.
[03:54:31.668 --> 03:54:33.270]  So your comments on that?
[03:54:33.270 --> 03:54:38.417]  Well, you know, there's an old slogan that the Marines used to say when I was growing up as a kid.
[03:54:38.417 --> 03:54:41.682]  It was part of their advertising and it said, we're looking for a few good men.
[03:54:42.583 --> 03:54:47.166]  And honestly, I think the Marines today are taking whatever they have.
[03:54:47.166 --> 03:54:51.969]  They're kind of going, getting their mitts on anything they can get.
[03:54:51.969 --> 03:54:58.573]  You know, never mind the few good men, but the expression, the slogan is, to me, very interesting.
[03:54:58.573 --> 03:55:04.277]  You know, we're looking for a few good men, and interestingly, in that ad campaign, they used the sword.
[03:55:04.277 --> 03:55:10.121]  You know, I think in the pageantry and the ceremony of the Marines, they actually used the sword.
[03:55:10.621 --> 03:55:11.942]  Well, the establishment knows.
[03:55:11.942 --> 03:55:12.982]  They know the archetype.
[03:55:12.982 --> 03:55:17.625]  They know what it's really about to be alive, and they manipulate that for their own aim.
[03:55:17.625 --> 03:55:31.073]  We have to forget about Barack Obama, George Bush, and Michael Jackson, these fake, demonic, weak things they project on our minds, and we've got to really get back to what it's all about, standing for something and putting your life on the line.
[03:55:31.073 --> 03:55:33.294]  Yeah, the white path is, you know, it's the zombies.
[03:55:33.294 --> 03:55:37.977]  You know, we're looking for men of honor, men of bravery, men of chivalry, and ultimately, men of truth.
[03:55:39.597 --> 03:55:44.580]  Well, I hope people will go and get the film, and I want to thank you for getting Mr. Davies on the show.
[03:55:44.580 --> 03:56:07.914]  You said you were going to do it and set him up for us, and it turns out he's everything you said and more, and I'd love to get Vigo on the radio show, and I just hope folks will go to the website reclaimingtheblade.com to get the film, and I'm going to give an email address out, contest at infowars.com, and the first 10 emails that come in, you will get free mail to you
[03:56:08.875 --> 03:56:12.558]  And this has also been signed, and I can't really read these signatures.
[03:56:12.558 --> 03:56:14.179]  Who signed these, my friend?
[03:56:14.179 --> 03:56:15.840]  That would be myself and the producer.
[03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:17.701]  That would be yourself and the producer.
[03:56:17.701 --> 03:56:18.662]  You can't beat that.
[03:56:18.662 --> 03:56:19.902]  Absolutely free.
[03:56:19.902 --> 03:56:25.526]  First ten that are, well, the first nine, because I'm going to keep an extra one for myself.
[03:56:25.526 --> 03:56:29.989]  But Reclaiming the Blade, ladies and gentlemen, reclaimingtheblade.com.
[03:56:29.989 --> 03:56:32.711]  And is it going to be on television somewhere soon, or is that being worked out?
[03:56:32.711 --> 03:56:34.872]  Yeah, it's being worked out this fall.
[03:56:34.872 --> 03:56:36.373]  Right now, TV is not buying much.
[03:56:36.373 --> 03:56:38.695]  I think maybe you've noticed by turning on the TV this summer.
[03:56:38.895 --> 03:56:40.455]  No, it's totally imploding.
[03:56:40.455 --> 03:56:41.896]  I've actually had them pitch me.
[03:56:41.896 --> 03:56:45.716]  Yeah, but they're hoping it'll pick back up and they're going to start buying stuff in the fall.
[03:56:45.716 --> 03:56:46.737]  They're not buying anything.
[03:56:46.737 --> 03:56:48.037]  It's ridiculous.
[03:56:48.037 --> 03:56:55.638]  So, the History Channel, of course, is an obvious, and the History Channel in Europe and America and Haiti and stuff like that.
[03:56:55.638 --> 03:57:04.060]  We're looking and talking, and Mark Cuban at HDNet and so on and so forth, he was interested in running it on his program.
[03:57:04.060 --> 03:57:07.121]  So, absolutely, we'll have some TV running in the fall.
[03:57:08.141 --> 03:57:09.844]  Alright, but folks shouldn't wait.
[03:57:09.844 --> 03:57:11.506]  They should get it first right now.
[03:57:17.341 --> 03:57:18.182]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[03:57:18.182 --> 03:57:20.043]  The future looks very bright.
[03:57:20.043 --> 03:57:20.383]  Thank you, sir.
[03:57:38.729 --> 03:57:40.429]  I actually covered it too much for my audience.
[03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:41.650]  People are going to complain, I'm sure.
[03:57:41.650 --> 03:57:45.011]  I was making fun of the whole situation and kind of documenting that.
[03:57:45.011 --> 03:57:47.411]  Michael Jackson, oh my God!
[03:57:47.411 --> 03:57:51.792]  That is coming up in the retransmission, One Place, InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[03:57:51.792 --> 03:57:54.213]  One Place, all my sites, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:57:54.213 --> 03:57:57.954]  And I want to put in a plug here at the end of the show.
[03:57:59.033 --> 03:57:59.894]  Please support us.
[03:57:59.894 --> 03:58:03.056]  I get so busy with guests and news and stuff that I don't even plug my own films.
[03:58:03.056 --> 03:58:04.177]  Get the Obama Deception.
[03:58:04.177 --> 03:58:05.157]  Get in game.
[03:58:05.157 --> 03:58:06.218]  Make copies of them.
[03:58:06.218 --> 03:58:07.019]  Air them on AXS TV.
[03:58:07.019 --> 03:58:08.420]  Give them to friends and family.
[03:58:08.420 --> 03:58:09.320]  Have viewing parties.
[03:58:09.320 --> 03:58:10.661]  Get the Obama Deception.
[03:58:10.661 --> 03:58:12.583]  Infowars.com or by calling toll free.
[03:58:13.763 --> 03:58:14.364]  888-253-3139.
[03:58:14.364 --> 03:58:15.064]  888-253-3139.
[03:58:15.064 --> 03:58:22.811]  My crew, myself, all of us are going to be working here around the clock for you.
[03:58:22.811 --> 03:58:27.275]  I'm going to be up here until late tonight working on some other films.
[03:58:27.275 --> 03:58:28.997]  And just thanks for all your support.
[03:58:28.997 --> 03:58:30.138]  It's good to be part of history.
[03:58:30.138 --> 03:58:31.799]  It's good to be standing up to tyranny.
[03:58:31.799 --> 03:58:37.064]  Whether we win this or not, nobody can say we didn't go down without a fight.
[03:58:37.064 --> 03:58:38.365]  Your transmission starts now.
[03:58:38.365 --> 03:58:38.986]  God bless you all.
