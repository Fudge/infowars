[01:39.720 --> 01:48.240]  take this shot what do we do hmm I've got an idea we'll set up mass vaccination centers outside of

[01:54.120 --> 02:01.840]  unwittingly and take this shot those are the plans that's what's been written about in main line

[02:09.960 --> 02:14.960]  to this weekend last weekend there was a huge conference and the week before that and I must
[02:14.960 --> 02:21.480]  have read on the Sunday show about 20 separate local articles about oh we're running a drill at
[02:21.480 --> 02:27.320]  the school oh we're running a drill at the church oh we're integrating all forms of government
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.520]  together with the federales that's right we're going after your local governments they even go

[02:37.360 --> 02:44.560]  affairs oh it's WHO level six level six a pandemic it can't get any higher that's what I need to get
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.320]  across the people people could be dying in the streets of Ebola and it doesn't go higher than
[02:50.320 --> 02:58.160]  WHO which is UN World Health Organization level six for the piggy flu and again we know it's not
[02:58.160 --> 03:05.800]  pig flu it's three separate types of flu it's human flu pig flu and bird flu two strains of h1n1

[08:35.680 --> 08:41.120]  this is a three spot shot flu it's not just one wave they're already making it clear there's going
[08:41.120 --> 08:46.240]  to be three waves and they kind of have to make it that way because after the initial inoculations
[08:46.240 --> 08:50.880]  that's when you're actually going to see people get sick after the kids take it and they inject
[08:50.880 --> 08:58.560]  them with you know live bird flu live h1n1 which is the pig flu virus just like they did in the
[08:58.560 --> 09:04.240]  Czech republic and 13 other countries in february remember baxter international sends out quote
[09:04.240 --> 09:12.000]  unquote mixing agents now mixing agents and they shoot up a ferret the ferret doesn't make it folks

[09:24.000 --> 09:32.320]  and silence silence then literally less than a month later the pig flu shows up and remember
[09:32.320 --> 09:36.000]  it came from mexico at first and then it's not from mexico it's from mexico and then it's not
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.400]  from mexico and we've got all these pigs with it wait we can't show you any pigs that actually
[09:40.400 --> 09:47.440]  have it and then the first pig that they find is in canada in canada folks and how do they explain
[09:47.440 --> 09:52.880]  that they go well that pig in canada he'd been handled by a mexican migrant worker they don't
[09:52.880 --> 09:59.120]  name the mexican migrant worker they have no evidence whatsoever they just said it and they
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.400]  hyped up all these deaths in the united states from pig flu when you looked at the initial deaths
[10:04.400 --> 10:09.040]  that they were reporting none of them were from the pig flu virus okay let's go through the first
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.840]  one first one a two month old boy or i'm sorry two year old boy who had chronic illnesses
[10:15.840 --> 10:20.320]  since he was two months old okay in and out of hospitals all over in mexico he crosses the texas
[10:20.320 --> 10:27.520]  border he doesn't make it pig flu killed him total lie total propaganda next person who dies
[10:27.520 --> 10:33.840]  from the pig flu somebody who was in the hospital because she was pregnant since april since mid
[10:33.840 --> 10:40.240]  april had all these other chronic illnesses the baby makes it she doesn't pig flu the next person
[10:40.240 --> 10:47.760]  who dies from pig flu is a principal out in new york city who had gout and a ton of health issues
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.840]  no he didn't die from gout or his other health issues his other respiratory illnesses no
[10:51.840 --> 10:58.080]  pig flu so i just i have to go through this because this is not a deadly virus listen let's
[10:58.080 --> 11:03.440]  say you do get infected with this swine flu oh no the swine flu i'm sorry you might have some
[11:03.440 --> 11:08.960]  sniffles you might need some chicken noodle soup a couple glasses of uh swept ginger ale maybe a
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.720]  little ibuprofen for the pain that's about it no one's going to die from this thing okay but
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.720]  that doesn't stop them from having these conferences and going over mass fatality management
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.920]  planning let me repeat that for you mass fatality management planning if you're not on prism planet
[11:25.920 --> 11:31.600]  dot tv right now you really need to be so what is this top leaders and key decision makers of
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.400]  major companies representing a broad range of industries will meet with distinguished scientists
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.320]  public health officials law enforcers first responders and other experts to discuss pandemic
[11:40.320 --> 11:47.600]  prevention preparedness response and recovery and this is the first international swine flu summit
[11:47.600 --> 11:55.680]  who's behind it who is behind it actually ha ha ha ha whl un controlled propaganda the united
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.120]  nations coordinator for avian and human influenza alex therman of the world health organization
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.200]  was the person who headed this up with uh dr winning zang all right what will the topics include
[12:07.840 --> 12:15.200]  right at the top of the list numero uno mass fatality management planning what does that
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.480]  mean that means that you get sick you die we got to find a way to get rid of your body
[12:20.480 --> 12:28.240]  okay you're nothing you get no funeral you get no hurrah you are part of the problem you need to be
[12:28.240 --> 12:33.840]  burned up and forgotten about that's what this is mass fatality management planning
[12:33.840 --> 12:39.040]  and then another one is national pandemic influenza medical countermeasures now under
[12:39.040 --> 12:42.880]  the uh concurrent breakout session of the mass fatality management planning they have
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.240]  have develop and implementing training and exercise programs you have to make the people
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.240]  more docile you have to get them acclimated you have to get them used to seeing all these
[12:52.240 --> 12:57.120]  dead bodies of their friends their family their coworkers their neighbors do you understand
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.520]  you have to make them aware people are going to die and you've got to help direct fatality
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.000]  management tactical operations what are we going to do with these dead bodies we got to
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.320]  ship them somewhere we got to burn them somewhere maybe these mobile incinerators they're making
[13:12.320 --> 13:17.520]  will help out activate fatality management operations so in other words we're going to
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.280]  need the national garden ball we might need local police involved we might we might need
[13:21.840 --> 13:29.600]  the un and nato involved after all this is an international issue folks they've openly stated
[13:29.600 --> 13:42.160]  4.9 billion vaccinations 4.9 billion vaccinations for a populace of 6 billion people not many are
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.040]  going to slip through the cracks okay they are they are actually passing legislation see
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.960]  they know there's no law they know international law even though they've declared wh o level six
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.600]  okay and you have no individual human rights under this okay i don't have the document off
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.840]  hand but i know it's somewhere here it is the checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness
[14:03.840 --> 14:13.280]  planning and in it it openly states in subsection 1.5.1 that they will quarantine you that they
[14:13.280 --> 14:21.120]  will make makeshift vaccination centers out of other buildings that you have no individual human
[14:21.120 --> 14:25.600]  rights that they are suspended now you say well we're not under international law well
[14:25.600 --> 14:29.760]  some people would argue that we are especially the globalists and the elite and people like
[14:29.760 --> 14:35.760]  barack obama and his administration but they got another one for you you see if you don't want to
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.480]  go by international law there's an executive order they can call out 13 375 all of a sudden one
[14:40.480 --> 14:47.840]  year in prison 250 g's that's right one year in prison fine $250,000 for not taking this wine
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.200]  flu shot what this is for is intimidation they're intimidating you into doing just take the shot
[14:53.200 --> 14:59.440]  guys listen you take the shot no big deal no prison sentence no fine just do it it's no big
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.400]  deal now they're trying to do it on local levels where they're going state to state to state and
[15:04.400 --> 15:10.080]  saying that they can find people a thousand dollars a day so again they try to do it at the
[15:10.080 --> 15:14.480]  state level they are doing at the federal level and then the international level they keep climbing
[15:14.480 --> 15:19.440]  the ladder but they really reverse climbing it see they they institute the top the top down
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.360]  mentality where they say look at this authority look at this authority look at this authority
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.160]  and if that authority doesn't work they fall back on other authority all right let me uh let me
[15:28.160 --> 15:35.280]  continue with this document they have to conduct morgue operations and manage anti-mortem data now
[15:35.280 --> 15:42.160]  here's here's the next section of this uh conference psychological issues what are we going to do
[15:42.160 --> 15:49.040]  with people who are unwilling to follow government orders what are we going to do to the people that
[15:49.040 --> 15:52.560]  don't want to be rounded up what are we going to do to the people that don't want to be quarantined
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.160]  what are we going to do with the people that won't let their children go to school when they
[15:56.160 --> 16:01.120]  become mass vaccination centers what do we do with those people well we enact the continuity of
[16:01.120 --> 16:06.960]  government program continuity government what's that that sounds like a big operation jason
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.760]  well actually folks it's the shadow government that's right the shadow government is not just in
[16:11.760 --> 16:17.120]  james bond movies it's not just an action thrillers it actually exists it's been around for a while now
[16:18.240 --> 16:25.200]  its government name is the continuity of government program c o g and you know we're
[16:25.200 --> 16:30.160]  going to have peter dale scott up in texas sometime next month he's going to be interviewed
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.160]  for my film invisible empire again we're going to play the trailer for that later but we're
[16:34.160 --> 16:40.640]  going to be discussing the shadow government and c o g c o g was in place on 9 11 folks we're not
[16:40.640 --> 16:46.320]  that far away from the anniversary i just want you to know there were drills using c o g operations
[16:46.320 --> 16:52.880]  before the attacks and then c o g was mysteriously on the scene of the pentagon as it got struck and
[16:52.880 --> 17:00.160]  mysteriously another plane that looked government that looked c o g was on the scene of new york
[17:00.160 --> 17:06.000]  before the second plane struck the world trade center very odd part of global guardian this mass
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.600]  armageddon drill okay so anyway here we go continuity of government operations when h1 and
[17:11.600 --> 17:16.320]  one flu pandemic unfold in the next two or three successive waves of our calendar year remember
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.040]  two or three successive years how do we institute this program and how do we get the public to go
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.480]  along with it so uh what are we going to do with the first responders in the fire department well
[17:26.480 --> 17:32.560]  we're going to figure out how they can effectively undertake mass vaccinations and enforce quarantines
[17:32.560 --> 17:39.600]  you see enforce quarantines that's why in paris main they have these drills with the national guard
[17:40.240 --> 17:48.080]  dressed up in full riot gear like a police state okay they're not wearing listen in the national
[17:48.080 --> 17:57.280]  guards there no reason for them to be in bulletproof vests in big um you know face helmets in a body
[17:57.280 --> 18:02.400]  armor batons no they're the national guard they should be in regular military uniforms no these
[18:02.400 --> 18:09.600]  are militarized police uniforms ending posi commentators all right they're softening you up with the
[18:09.600 --> 18:14.800]  national guard but they're openly stating and by they i mean the pentagon that 400 000 troops

[26:00.400 --> 26:04.880]  force is supposed to drop from this i mean that should tell you that they are getting ready
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.520]  for mass quarantines for mass vaccinations even though they've said it it's all over the washington
[26:09.520 --> 26:14.720]  post it's in the you know the washington times the new york times the new york post the chicago
[26:14.720 --> 26:19.520]  tribune uh... in fact i think i have the boston globe in front of me right here where they say
[26:19.520 --> 26:25.840]  they're going to pay people fifty bucks a piece to take the shot i can't make this stuff up
[26:25.840 --> 26:32.720]  residents can get fifty dollars for a swine flu shot okay but on the other side we're going to
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.320]  do some video action we're going to show you tim geithner talking about how we just can't
[26:36.320 --> 26:42.000]  audit the fed just cannot defend doesn't matter if there was a huge victory yesterday in new york
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.280]  okay a new york judge finally stepped up to the plate swung at the ball and hit a double
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.560]  he did not get out of the park yet because there is an appellate court and i'm sure
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.280]  that the fed even though they lost they're going to you know claim they need an appeal
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.480]  basically he wrote a forty seven page letter saying look these guys have to report who they're
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.840]  given the money to they have to report on these loans we need transparency but that's the last
[27:05.840 --> 27:10.000]  thing they want that's why barack obama stands up there in grandstands and says you know
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.320]  ben bernackie has studied the great depression so much we are honored to have him as a fed chairman
[27:16.320 --> 27:23.840]  we have we i nominate him again so bernackie so well studied on this economic collapse that
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.360]  happened in the late 20s and early 30s that he knows how to make it even more gradual here at
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.040]  home now that's what that's about it's about gutting this economy one more time let's gut it
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.080]  let's take it apart and put it back together in our own little new world order image and that's
[27:40.080 --> 27:44.560]  what this is anyway we're going to play geithner for about five minutes on the next segment we're
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.080]  going to play the invisible empire trailer we're also going to come up and show you um
[27:48.880 --> 27:55.520]  exclusive footage of jesse ventura and alex jones discussing the new true tv show that jesse is
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.600]  doing i think it's called conspiracy theory tentatively we'll see what happens with it but
[27:59.600 --> 28:06.000]  let's let's continue with this document we need to train our workers to screen for symptoms and
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.520]  know what to do when workers fall ill i mean the guy next to you starts coughing we may need to call
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.720]  in the national guard there's a little sniffles easy he's got a little runny nose could be the
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.960]  swine flu we better call the officials that that man needs to be quarantined and the thing is that
[28:20.960 --> 28:25.280]  they're doing the same thing in schools okay here it is right here concurrent breakout session
[28:25.280 --> 28:31.120]  number 12 school and university pandemic planning they are going to train teachers to screen for
[28:31.120 --> 28:37.360]  symptoms and know what to do when students teachers fall ill look don't get too excited don't get too

[28:43.920 --> 28:49.440]  to go to the office you step outside you tell the authorities what's happening all of a sudden they
[28:49.440 --> 28:56.800]  can transport ill students transport ill students and they also talk about the bus routes here
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.200]  to get the general populace that's why the school systems are good because they can use the bus
[29:01.200 --> 29:06.000]  routes to ship people into the school systems for mass vaccinations whether they're children or not
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.400]  remember they expect to get all the parents but how do you get the people that don't have kids
[29:10.400 --> 29:17.600]  how do you get that 18 to 30 crowd you force them to go effectively transform school facilities into
[29:17.600 --> 29:23.440]  shelters see there might be a quarantine center right at the school see they'll be the main part
[29:23.440 --> 29:28.560]  where everybody's being vaccinated and where people are learning and then they'll take oh
[29:28.560 --> 29:31.840]  you know it's decent weather out here we'll take them out to the soccer field or we'll take them

[33:19.280 --> 33:24.640]  ado let's just cut to this geithner clip where he just blailing says we can't audit the fed you
[33:24.640 --> 33:31.520]  can't know what we're doing this is our country this isn't yours america hit it and then uh
[33:31.520 --> 33:37.280]  members of the community voted on those questions i'm gonna ask you the top 10 first one came from
[33:37.280 --> 33:43.600]  borez uh b o r e z these people don't always use their uh real names but that's his dig name
[33:43.600 --> 33:51.040]  1 134 digs why has the federal reserve bank never been audited you know the the fed actually
[33:51.040 --> 33:57.040]  is subject to very comprehensive comprehensive oversight by the congress by a series of external
[33:57.040 --> 34:02.960]  auditors and it does play this very important role in the system and that requires that congress
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.760]  has the ability to do a very careful review of how it conducts its operations but very important
[34:07.760 --> 34:14.160]  as i'm sure people understand that you want to keep politics out of monetary policy and uh
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.280]  there are good reasons for that you know we went through centuries of financial crisis
[34:19.280 --> 34:24.880]  in the united states at least two before the fed was established those crises were produced in part
[34:24.880 --> 34:28.560]  by the fact that we didn't have a central bank that had independence ability to deal with these
[34:28.560 --> 34:33.360]  kind of things and you need to keep those kind of things away from you know political influence
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.000]  that can compromise the effectiveness of policy but as this shows there clearly is a group of people
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.240]  out there that feels very passionately about this uh the third question on the list was 712 digs
[34:44.240 --> 34:50.000]  was from moto bike man who said what is your position on ron paul's house resolution 1207
[34:50.560 --> 34:57.760]  which as i understand it calls for a comprehensive audit of the fed why does this persist uh if as
[34:57.760 --> 35:03.120]  you say the fed is already fully audited well the fed fed is dramatically more transparent than it
[35:03.120 --> 35:08.880]  was is subject to very comprehensive oversight in audits but there are certain things about what
[35:08.880 --> 35:13.680]  the fed does that again you need to make sure that you preserve as independent political influence
[35:13.680 --> 35:18.640]  and that line is an and a line that we don't want to cross and i think that even even the sponsor
[35:18.640 --> 35:24.560]  of that bill recognizes how important it is to us to have the fed independent of politics and i'm
[35:24.560 --> 35:29.040]  sure many of the people concerned about the federal and system will understand that it would be
[35:29.040 --> 35:36.080]  problematic for the country if you let politicians come in and shape conduct and monitor policy in
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.480]  the country you don't want to cross the line but do that does this kind of concern indicate that
[35:40.480 --> 35:45.440]  maybe the line needs to be moved that maybe the fed needs to be more transparent than it's been in
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.080]  the past yeah i think it's very important and i think this chairman has been uh has gone a long
[35:50.080 --> 35:55.440]  way to open up the workings of the fed so that people can assess them and remember what the fed
[35:55.440 --> 36:02.320]  does every day people can see and they make their judgment about whether having the right impact in
[36:02.320 --> 36:08.000]  terms of making sure we're sustaining growth with low inflation that those actions uh you know are
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.160]  subject to the tests of the market public opinion really every day every hour you can see people
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.640]  can judge for themselves whether the fed is doing what it's supposed to do under the laws of the land
[36:16.640 --> 36:21.760]  well some of them clearly don't like what they see uh the ninth question on the list was from
[36:21.760 --> 36:29.040]  zwendkas uh 357 digs uh he he wrote uh you are a member of the federal reserve i think he meant
[36:29.040 --> 36:34.720]  you were a member of the federal reserve a group that so thoroughly mismanaged our monetary policy
[36:34.720 --> 36:39.200]  that they helped create a massive housing all right let's cut the clip right there i mean this is
[36:39.200 --> 36:49.920]  equivalent to somebody standing over a lifeless bloody body with the dagger in hand blood all over
[36:49.920 --> 36:56.080]  his shirt all over his pants and we don't need to investigate we're very transparent we're very
[36:56.080 --> 37:00.640]  transparent we are trans that is the new word we're very transparent we won't tell you what
[37:00.640 --> 37:06.080]  banks got the money how much money we're printing who our buddies are who our cronies are how the
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.840]  system works i'll just sit here and lie to you and tell you congress has oversight meanwhile ron paul
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.960]  is part of the congress folks for the really small minded you know individuals out there that just
[37:16.960 --> 37:21.360]  kind of came across this program have no idea what's going on in the real world let me explain how
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.920]  this works this guy tells you congress already has oversight congress does not they should
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.280]  this is a private institution they'll tell you it's a quasi government institution please i mean
[37:33.280 --> 37:39.040]  this guy just stood up there and said we had centuries of economic misfortune and disaster
[37:39.040 --> 37:44.080]  before the federal reserve no the federal reserve came in after the bankers promulgated
[37:44.080 --> 37:50.240]  crises to consolidate power and now they are consolidating it further then he goes on to lie
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.040]  to you and tell you that congress already has oversight but we don't want to make it political
[37:55.040 --> 38:01.040]  you don't want to make it political you are our monetary system of course that's political you
[38:01.040 --> 38:07.440]  are political by default what you don't want to do is tell us where the money went because then it
[38:07.440 --> 38:13.920]  does become more transparent to the american public that you are dirty dirty criminals
[38:14.800 --> 38:21.520]  cutthroat psychopaths who work for offshore banks that's the reality mr. geithner and he'll
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.200]  sit there and smile and it's very easy for him to do that with a one-on-one pushover put me in a
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.920]  room with geithner put me in a room with geithner with a hundred people that recently lost their
[38:31.920 --> 38:39.440]  homes and jobs and i guarantee he won't be snickering and smirking so much all right folks uh
[38:39.440 --> 38:45.680]  from that video to the next i want to uh queue up uh my invisible empire trailer i've been working
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.680]  real hard on this film i continue to work hard by the way everybody's freaking out about the winter
[38:49.680 --> 38:55.120]  2010 date that means february 2010 i originally was going to release this on christmas eve
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.880]  i didn't get the graphics guy in here until about two weeks ago really want to polish this
[39:00.880 --> 39:05.840]  movie up really want to give it a look really want to make this the definitive movie on global
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.400]  government and the new world order and that's why we're calling it invisible empire a new world order
[39:10.400 --> 39:16.400]  defined and uh yes some of the clips have been seen before but i'm pretty sure no one's ever heard
[39:16.400 --> 39:22.240]  the uh i mean they've they've seen the quote by fdr about the new world order and uh this is not new
[39:22.240 --> 39:27.600]  in order uh in in the monument but never has the speech been out there i dug that up uh some of the
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.880]  zibignu uh brzezinski clips look brand new to me i haven't seen them anywhere on youtube uh let me
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.640]  try to think what else is in there that's brand new the george bush disorder comment that comes
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.360]  from a whole speech out at maxwell air force base which was his commencement address on the new
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.840]  world order there's a lot of clips that are going to be in the film from that uh i mean in this film
[39:45.840 --> 39:50.640]  i've got john carrey saying new world order hans blick saying new world order the ceo of google
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.920]  saying new world order cornell west saying new world order again and again and again these
[39:55.920 --> 40:01.600]  political figures of power are using this term so what is this term why are they using it why
[40:01.600 --> 40:08.160]  does it seem to progress throughout history and why does it always seem to be promoted by madmen
[40:08.160 --> 40:24.080]  hellbent on world domination here it is the trailer for invisible empire
[40:25.920 --> 40:33.840]  nazi forces seek to establish systems of government based on the regimentation of all
[40:33.840 --> 40:43.360]  human beings by a handful of individual rulers will see power by force the very word secrecy
[40:43.360 --> 40:52.320]  is repugnant in a free and open society and the hope that each of us has to build a new world order
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.840]  a new world order is coming into being but it looks less and less like the world order that
[40:57.840 --> 41:05.520]  mr kissinger had constructed in his own mind and we are as a people inherently and historically
[41:06.160 --> 41:12.800]  opposed to secret societies the secret oaths and the secret proceedings what is the bohemian
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.920]  grove well it's a kind of summer camp for the powerful among its members political figures
[41:17.920 --> 41:24.080]  like gerald ford president reagan vice president bush richard nixon is a bohemian each year guests
[41:24.080 --> 41:29.440]  like henry kissinger or spignew brzezinski address members on their areas of expertise
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.080]  be opposed to child for these people because you have served on the board of the council
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.320]  inform relations you started help start the trilateral commission and you've been to the
[41:38.320 --> 41:45.600]  builder burger groups for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
[41:46.720 --> 41:51.840]  i don't believe in this notion of some sort of secret societies controlling people
[41:51.840 --> 41:59.440]  but of course in any political system there are sort of over the table and under the table
[41:59.440 --> 42:07.440]  arrangements it is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the
[42:07.440 --> 42:13.840]  building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine by the military industrial complex
[42:14.640 --> 42:20.720]  its preparations are concealed not published its mistakes are buried not headlined
[42:20.720 --> 42:30.480]  it's dissenters are silenced not praised we can find meaning and reward by serving some
[42:30.480 --> 42:37.760]  higher purpose than ourselves a shining purpose the illumination of a thousand points of light
[42:38.960 --> 42:44.080]  no expenditure is questioned no rumor is printed no secret is revealed
[42:44.080 --> 42:51.280]  we have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations
[42:51.840 --> 42:59.440]  a new world order the quest for the new world order is in part a challenge to keep the dangers
[42:59.440 --> 43:05.360]  of disorder at bay we were interested today to hear the more than a hundred law enforcement
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.560]  officials in mexico are having microchips implanted in their arms the chips allow a person to be
[43:10.560 --> 43:14.960]  scanned sort of like a cereal box at the supermarket checkout i think the most important thing is for
[43:14.960 --> 43:23.520]  barack obama i think its task will be to develop an overall strategy for america in this period
[43:23.520 --> 43:29.440]  when really a new world order can be created i think the new world order is emerging and with
[43:29.440 --> 43:36.560]  it the foundations of a new and progressive era of international cooperation but the burdens of
[43:36.560 --> 43:44.240]  global citizenship continue to bind us together in this new century americans and europeans alike
[43:44.240 --> 43:52.080]  will be required to do more not less partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice
[43:53.360 --> 44:04.880]  yes these men and their hypnotized followers call this a new order it is not new and it is not
[44:04.880 --> 44:20.800]  order i am asking your help and the tremendous task of informing and alerting the american people
[44:22.000 --> 44:28.480]  coming to the info war in 2010 february it is my latest and greatest and really my dream project
[44:28.480 --> 44:33.680]  something that i've been you know really working on for the past three or four years wanting to do
[44:33.680 --> 44:38.560]  this picture just doing the research grabbing the video and now it's coming into culmination and
[44:38.560 --> 44:45.360]  i really hope this is what breaks the term new world order into the mainstream without this kind of
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.240]  you know oh no it's a conspiracy theory oh he's a tinfoil hat wear i really hope this does for
[44:52.240 --> 44:59.280]  nine eleven truth what loose changer out for for the realization of what is happening in this country
[44:59.280 --> 45:04.080]  is happening in the world the way that loose change you know brought nine eleven truth into
[45:04.080 --> 45:09.120]  the mainstream i'm hoping this does the same for global governments global global governments and
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.560]  the new world order i want to thank another one of our sponsors front site dot com that's
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.720]  w w dot front site dot com have you ever heard of the millionaire patriot doctor anaxias piazza the
[45:20.720 --> 45:25.280]  founder of the front site firearms training institute is offering a free handgun and five days of
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.320]  firearms training to my listeners look you want to learn how to use a firearm you want to learn
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.680]  how to defend yourself front site dot com can help they are the best out there they're one of our
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.880]  great sponsors front site dot com all right what i got left in this segment i'm going to play some
[45:40.880 --> 45:47.760]  of this jesse ventura and alex jones conversation uh basically alex went down there in light of
[45:47.760 --> 45:52.960]  this new television show conspiracy theory on true tv and they had a little chat skin hutch
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.880]  so uh let's hit the clip well i'm here with jesse ventura and we just had an interview for
[45:58.880 --> 46:04.080]  his upcoming television program conspiracy theory governor it's good to be here with you great alex
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.320]  always nice to see you never hung out with in california tell us about the tv show well it's
[46:08.320 --> 46:12.800]  a tv show it's going to be on the true network and we're going to deal with conspiracies and we're
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.880]  going to deal with all sides of them and it's going to be multiple different ones that we'll
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.040]  deal with and i think people are going to find it not only enlightening but entertaining at the
[46:21.040 --> 46:26.080]  same time what does you think of our little discussion about population reduction well
[46:26.080 --> 46:31.360]  it's kind of stunning when i talk to you about it it uh is the kind of thing when it's told to you
[46:31.360 --> 46:38.000]  you're not sure if you can believe it or not because it's so outrageous and outlandish in its concept
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.360]  but that's you can't imagine that things like that can occur in our lives but the more i'm doing
[46:43.360 --> 46:48.560]  conspiracy theory the more i'm learning about different conspiracies out there beyond of course
[46:48.560 --> 46:54.240]  just the assassination of john f kennedy and things of that nature but it's pretty enlightening and
[46:54.240 --> 46:59.920]  pretty shocking when you do learn about them well i'm glad that your show is someone of an
[46:59.920 --> 47:06.640]  investigation of these ideas and because a lot of it out there for my research is baloney or part
[47:06.640 --> 47:11.360]  of its wrong part of its right more often not that's the case i'm just seeking for the truth and
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.360]  trying to find out historically what's happened what's happening currently and what's coming up
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.680]  in the future but i will tell you on the subject of eugenics on the subject of world population
[47:19.680 --> 47:24.480]  reduction uh it's part of the public record it's just not popularly known that's what's so exciting
[47:24.480 --> 47:28.800]  about uh you doing this tv show tell us about some of the other topics that are going to be covered
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.560]  and when it's going to be erin well we don't know exactly yet and you know the other topics i i don't
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.680]  know if i want to be at liberty right now to say any of them you know it's double top secret probation
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.960]  yep it's double secret probation just like animal house at this point in time but you know that alex
[47:44.960 --> 47:49.760]  you'll be a part of the shows and we've talked to some very interesting people on a lot of very
[47:49.760 --> 47:54.960]  interesting subjects and i'll just leave it at that for right now tentatively it should be out i'm
[47:54.960 --> 47:59.600]  guessing around november or around christmas time we should hit the air somewhere in that general
[47:59.600 --> 48:05.040]  vicinity island but it's been in the news that you are tackling 9 11 oh it has okay yeah well that
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.560]  would be one of them 9 11 is one because you know we all know that there's these conspiracy theories
[48:10.560 --> 48:16.800]  about 9 11 and uh our mainstream media won't cover any of this stuff so they leave it to me so i have
[48:16.800 --> 48:22.000]  a job now that's another question we haven't really seen any big national tv shows look at this i think
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.120]  you're going to be one of the first that is going to objectively do it hopefully and hopefully that'll
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.440]  get us some ratings and hopefully we'll be bought up and we'll be on another season what's all part
[48:31.440 --> 48:36.720]  of what you do in this particular business and alex for me it's a case they won't let me retire
[48:37.360 --> 48:43.360]  i want to retire i want to go surfing but yet this is so intriguing to me i'm i'm holding off my
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.600]  retirement till we get this project done how did you get into this governor because i remember
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.920]  about three and a half years ago i first met you in san antonio interview i gave you my film
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.440]  terror storm you do a little bit about belphatonkin and some issues but it seems like more and more
[48:57.440 --> 49:02.560]  you're writing a book i heard on the subject you come on my show i mean it seems like jessy ventura
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.520]  is uh well here's the problem alex i now live half the year down in mexico well i don't watch tv
[49:09.520 --> 49:16.080]  in mexico when i'm down there for the six months i read and so i go out i get books on interesting
[49:16.080 --> 49:22.000]  topics i like to study history and i like to study real things i don't like to particularly read
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.480]  novels because that's simply someone else's imagination writing a story in a book well i
[49:28.480 --> 49:34.160]  have my own imagination i don't need anybody else's generally so i like to read history and i like to
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.080]  read controversial history and so really this is blossom because of my time in mexico i mean i
[49:40.080 --> 49:46.400]  remember three years ago i actually read 17 books in one winter down there alex that's more books than
[49:46.400 --> 49:52.560]  i read in my entire school career you know so it's reading and it's doing that and this show
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.960]  was i i'm the creator of it basically i took it with my people and we sold it and the true network
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.200]  bought it and they found it interesting enough and here we are governor doing the research for
[50:03.200 --> 50:06.320]  this television show and now that you're really immersed in this and reading all these books when
[50:06.320 --> 50:11.680]  you're down in mexico part of the year surfing uh what do you think of the new world order itself
[50:11.680 --> 50:16.640]  the move towards world government or are you not even convinced of that well i you know
[50:19.040 --> 50:25.120]  i guess i'm 50 50 right now you know as i look at it because i don't want to believe it and that's
[50:25.120 --> 50:31.680]  probably what holds me back on it but i'm certainly seeing enough indication that it could be true
[50:32.400 --> 50:37.280]  absolutely because they're always talking about mexico and the united states and canada
[50:37.280 --> 50:43.280]  ending up like europe and there's things done politically that seem to take us in that direction
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.840]  all right so i think it's gonna be back after this it's the alex joneshaw and jason vermess
[50:47.840 --> 50:53.040]  sitting in artificial life will be created within months that's the big story over at the daily mail

[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:24.560]  of what the people want and what's constitutional then all support for these crooks will collapse

[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:51.840]  they're beating up people with the police that are now against obama care on video and then
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:56.640]  arresting those they beat up we got the lawyer coming on later one of our listeners they contacted
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:12:00.400]  us we have the video this is happening everywhere and he's going to cover of course the birth
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:04.560]  certificate what he really thinks is going on there dr coursey it's great having you on with
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:12.640]  us i like it's great to be back thank you you bet uh out of the gates uh let's get into what's
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:18.320]  happening with demonstrations everywhere truly spontaneous i've had neighbors and friends that
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:23.280]  went to him with the loy dogged last weekend at the randall's grocery store i didn't even know about
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:28.400]  it till i saw the video i talked to my neighbor talked to one of my dad's employees who was there
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:34.160]  the most of these are democrats because you only send letters out to them they're mad and the media
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:40.560]  is trying to spin it saying it's staged uh what do you make of this well first of all the the people
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:46.000]  who are showing up at the town hall meeting are average americans they're middle class americans
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.080]  who are upset predominantly about the health care they're very concerned that the takeover of the
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:59.280]  health care system is going to give them poorer health care cost more taxes than a seniors
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:03.840]  are very concerned it's going to end up being rationing of health care to seniors all dashill
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:08.720]  said that in his book it's in the bill and this is nothing but eugenics i mean even fox news has
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:13.360]  said it's eugenics the doctor they had on i mean i mean this is the government running your health
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:18.240]  care i can't think of anything worse with these control freaks well i don't think people want a
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.840]  28-year-old bureaucrat making decisions on what health care they can get especially seniors that
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:29.440]  it's the history of countries that have had government blood health care is that health care
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:35.040]  is going to be rationed and it's been pretty clearly stated i think in the whole intention
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.760]  of this bill that there's no way people can be provided this universal health care unless there
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:46.080]  is rationing obama said it now to get back to the issue what we're finding is world
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:53.840]  and daily and i'm continuing to get emails through the day various seiyu union employee
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:59.520]  attending these rallies i guess a series of rallies last night were attended and the seiyu
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.720]  attendees appeared to be the ones causing the disruption and the protest they were the ones
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:11.120]  pushing and shouting and shouting and screaming in fact there's one video i've been i've gotten
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:17.680]  the chose one of the seiyu anti protesters being arrested by the police for disrupting
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:24.960]  causing disruption on the scene so there's pushback here from the white house also paul
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:31.760]  got crookman's article in the new york times today which i thought was particularly offensive
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:39.840]  to the protesters saying that this was just white angry racist redneck republican no no
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:45.520]  my listener is black his lawyers contacted us there's video they run up and beat him and say
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:51.120]  how can an n word be at a meeting against obama and punch him in the nose in fact i've seen
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:56.000]  that video on the internet that's now playing on the internet yeah we have it on info wars.com go
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:03.840]  ahead okay and so you know the if the white house is taking the position that any and this is what
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:10.160]  i wrote an obama nation it's been going on since the campaign anyone who politically objects to
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:16.560]  a position taken by president obama or candidate obama is by definition called a racist by their
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:23.600]  supporter so and now with the white house putting up this feed the other site to to turn your neighbors
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:31.200]  in report people who don't agree with president obama this flag at white house dot gov and
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:38.080]  president obama had a clear opportunity he could have said to dancy polosi could demonizing the town
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:45.680]  all protesters by saying people showing up with signs and swastikas and portraying them as if this
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:54.000]  is a right-wing organized effort to object to obama by a small group it's not the case
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:03.920]  this is a very broad-based reaction and if you take a look honestly at the numbers the president
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:11.120]  poll numbers are plummeting he's now down to about 50 percent and those are lower in some polls love
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:17.920]  seeing as low as 45 in some of your right rasmussen and gallop he's at 50 the quinty ampak university
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:23.600]  just came out they are about about 50 percent that was this week i think that was reported yesterday
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:31.360]  by fox and the dropping which is dramatic i mean the approval rating was about 63 percent
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:37.120]  when president obama was inaugurated in january now this is a this is a more precipitous drop
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:43.920]  than even jimmy carter jimmy carter was in the august before he hit under 60 and now
[1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:49.920]  president obama is risking getting under 50 in august so this is first year in office so this is
[1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:56.800]  dramatic polarizing and president obama is ending up being not the uniting president he came on
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:01.680]  saying he was going to be but probably one of the most divisive presidents we've ever had
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:09.280]  and i think the attempt by the white house to demonize those middle class americans who show
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:15.440]  up at town hall meetings to express their grievances with a health care plan if they're
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.160]  going to be demonized by the white house i'm wondering why president obama's numbers are
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:27.840]  as high as 50 because they're going to drop by the way at prism planet dot tv i'm playing the video
[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:36.080]  of a black man being attacked for being against the health care this is the democracy of obama
[1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:40.960]  and let's remember it was st louis where they had the prosecutors and the sheriff in the county
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:46.960]  announced on tv themselves that they would arrest people that they deemed were being dishonest
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:51.440]  about obama that of course would be a civil matter obama thinks you're lying about him he has to sue
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:57.760]  you but no the police said they'd be judged jury and executioner and this is shocking video of the
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:03.120]  of the union thugs attacking people and what's even more shocking is then the police arrest one of
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:10.400]  the reporters who is covering it uh... and it appears to then persecute some of the people
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:15.120]  that are being attacked uh... dr corcy well the irony here is that you know
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:22.000]  a president obama is supposed to be he he portrays himself as the community organizer in chief
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.960]  i mean all the film is about him that you know film maturing into office all the stories about
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:37.200]  his community organizing efforts in chicago uh... and then obama was working in sol and sol linsky
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:42.080]  organization which is about his radical to the left socialist organization as you could get
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:49.200]  yeah his rules for radicals is is uh... dedicated to lucifer correct it dedicated to lucifer
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:54.640]  who's all that he calls the first radical and among the rules you know it's basically the advice
[1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:59.840]  from sol linsky is cut your hair put on a business suit act like you're going to be a moderate get
[1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:05.520]  elected and then when you get elected break all your campaign promises because you only said those
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:12.400]  on a mackey valley in principle that people believe what seems to be the case so it seemed to be
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:17.120]  moderate then when you get it off as redistribute wealth and put central government control over
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:23.440]  the economy and as i wrote in the abomination that's how obama was trained now that community
[1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:30.480]  organizing or acorn or sd i u of the obama administration which is extremely far left
[1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:36.640]  that's all fine but if middle americans speak up at town hall meeting then they've got to be
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:43.280]  demonized by the way houses if they were you know right wing organized red deck dot c thug which is
[1:19:43.280 --> 1:19:49.440]  ridiculous well they also mix the term not seeing with redneck and rural and white as if
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:55.440]  being redneck or white's a bad thing exactly because they're mixing all these terms together
[1:19:55.440 --> 1:20:01.280]  to demonize middle americans who are just gonna break down can stay with us before you throw away

[1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:14.800]  how is the establishment going to counter this i mean
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:19.760]  do you think obama will stage a crisis or something i don't see any other way
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:24.960]  he is falling faster than any other president he's lower than bush was at this time lower than
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:30.800]  jimmy carter the bigger they are the harder they fall the hoax that is obama is deflating
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:37.280]  monstrously fast what do you see them doing well they're going to do immediately is on sunday he's
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:42.960]  headed to mexico we've got the uh... another meeting which should be the security and prosperity
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:49.040]  partnership meeting if they've renamed these meetings now alex as you know they're calling it
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:56.000]  the north american leaders summit and they reported a world that daily and also my red alert newsletter
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:01.760]  i've got articles saying that there's a plan that has been advanced by several of the think tanks
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:08.800]  saying uh... the attention that we brought your show is brought others abroad on the security
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:16.560]  and prosperity partnership is you know the north american union agenda that the exposure has hurt
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:21.360]  the integration effort so they really change the name of the american leaders summit they've
[1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:26.160]  downgraded the meeting is no longer security and prosperity partnership if you look at the
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:33.360]  website spp.gov they've got a notice on the website that they're in the process of reformatting the
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:38.480]  site so they can do a public relations makeover the department of commerce the security and
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:44.320]  prosperity partnership website well dr corcy let me ask you this all into the radar all over the
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:48.960]  radar that's what i mean that's my point all under the radar this seems like to be one of their only
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:54.400]  tricks they've got five or six tricks they do you can count them on both hands uh... they always

[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:40.080]  this is a big deal meeting it's very low-key but on the agenda is that the mexican trucks are
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:45.200]  going to come back into the united states i've reported on this in red alert in a world that
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:51.920]  daily uh... no one seems to be you're covering it alex but very few are that there's going to be

[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:32.400]  conference spinning it secret meeting meeting behind closed doors uh they've set up you know this
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:38.880]  multi merger of the parliaments and the congresses of the three nations uh where is their program
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:45.200]  as best we can tell are things going well for them uh or uh you know how is this integration
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:50.080]  into the world government going well i think clearly the exposure uh alex that we've all
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:55.120]  given to this you know your show has been a major influence as you know the books i've written
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:00.320]  a good reference we've all made it clear to the american people that the security and prosperity
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:06.640]  partnership is a north american integration effort and the exposure hurt the ability of the secret
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:12.720]  working group to in private without the public involvement without transparency no public
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:19.840]  representatives at all closed doors to set north american administrative rules as a prelude to a
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:24.880]  european union style government and even a new currency like the america now also i think the
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:31.440]  recession which is a a failure of the global economy and it's going to have a very hard time
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:37.840]  recovering because so many structural unemployment has created so many jobs in the middle class
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:43.680]  that are simply gone manufacturing jobs that are not going to return because the multi national
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:48.480]  corporations have found slaves somewhere in the world that could do those jobs chiefers of america
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:56.640]  now when you put all this together the agenda among the globalist is still advancing and
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:02.320]  obama is clearly a globalist remember alexie campaign president obama was campaigning
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:10.320]  in pennsylvania and ohio michigan said he was going to renegotiate after he even fired austin
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:15.680]  ghouls be his economic advisor who during the campaign went to canada and said wink wink that's
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:21.600]  just a campaign promise well austin ghouls be back in the white house he's hired he's part of the
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:26.560]  administration with the council of economic advisors that it was always wink wink president
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:33.520]  obama very quietly on sunday now probably the least newsworthy day in the week is going to go to
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:38.720]  mexico and have this big summit why doesn't he do it on a tuesday or wednesday when i was about to
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:42.960]  say i was about to say dr corsey usually they act like it's the second coming of christ
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:48.160]  when you know he even goes for a hamburger to play golf or to especially to a foreign country
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:53.120]  but there's almost no coverage of this one reuters article some of the stories you've written this
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:59.280]  radio show uh that is really a big indicator of what's going on here but just going back to the
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:05.360]  psychology of obama how he said he was going to end after and get and now he's fighting to reauthorize
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:10.320]  it how he said he wouldn't push any gun bills all he's done is introduce him how he said he wouldn't
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:15.360]  hire one lobbyist and now he's hired nothing but lobbyists more liberal rules on lobbyist
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:21.200]  writing bills and bush had secrecy about who visits the white house a new level of cheney level
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:29.280]  secrecy uh i mean uh lying about the patriot act uh saying lying about warrantless wiretapping i mean
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:36.560]  this guy is just he makes bill clinton look honest well and he's not ruling from the center as
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:42.400]  bill clinton did uh this is a this was my central argument in the abomination this is a
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:50.560]  far leftist ideologue who was raised in a sol alinsky environment read his own dreams for my
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:58.560]  father he says his intellectual formative years were reading balkamak stokely karmichael black power
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:06.960]  friends the non the you know the the african anti-colonial writer who was a socialist revolutionary
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:12.000]  but this is where brock obama comes from and i imagine that he was going to keep any of these
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:18.080]  campaign promises only people who'd never read sol alinsky's rules for radicals would imagine that
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:23.840]  obama was meant anything he was promising during his campaign he was saying all of the
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:30.800]  right thing so people would say oh he'll just be another ponderic democrat will rule from the
[1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:36.000]  center when that couldn't have been less true but dr corsey isn't it more than that i mean isn't
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.200]  that just his left cover and i understand he came from that poverty pimp foundation system the
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:49.920]  foundations create that fake organic uh you know liberal uh m o to pimp out and control their local
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:55.520]  slaves and to use them as political weapons to menace the middle class and to submission
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:40:02.240]  in the major urban centers i mean isn't obama getting four times the money of john mccain just a
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:08.000]  total corporate slick tongue harvard uh lawyer i mean i know you're from harvard too but i'm not
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.280]  bashing harvard the point is isn't he just a just a corporate shell i mean you think he really is a
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:20.000]  communist uh his top advisors come from wall street for brock obama look at the list you've
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.720]  got goldman sacks you've got many of the banks even that we're involved in the bailout you've
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:31.200]  got lawyers from you know top law firms in washington and out new york brock obama drew
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:37.200]  money just like john mccain did they both did but virtually the same wall street banker
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:44.880]  lawyer group uh george soros also funded john mccain i wrote that and uh the document of that
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:49.680]  going back into a world that daily before the campaign sure so they own both fighters in the
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:56.960]  five no matter one wall street and soros and one the globalist one what you're saying at his core
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:04.800]  he is a he's elected he's a socialist and in core that's what i've always argued he and when you when
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:10.720]  he gets the opportunity to rule the way he wants to rule he forget all the campaign promises
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:16.880]  now it's full steam ahead with the mexican truck they come across the border he flies down to
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:23.840]  mexico on a stealth agenda on sunday to hold what should be a security and prosperity partnership
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:29.040]  meeting they haven't taken the website down yet spp.gov in the department of commerce but
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:33.760]  they're announcing they're redoing at a complete public relations takeover but that's what i'm
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:40.960]  saying is that he's got goons everywhere beating people up the reports are confirmed out of missouri
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:47.120]  new york california texas i mean he really does want an army of obama noids out there knocking
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:53.840]  people in the head this guy i mean i know you and websher tabla many others said he would do this
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:42:01.120]  yeah but to actually see brown shirts in america to actually see them running around beating everybody
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.240]  up and police on the news saying don't talk about about obama or will arrest you do you ever feel
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:10.800]  like you're going to wake up in a twilight zone or outer limits episode dr sometimes it does feel
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:16.480]  that but you know i i said that the community organizers and you've got to realize alex i've
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:23.120]  been dealing with the leftist community organizers back to the 1960s for me this is four decades of
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:28.640]  fighting this issue but now they're not the hippies on the street so so now they're not the hippies out
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:34.720]  the street they're now the police they grew up they put on business suit they got into the power
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:40.720]  establishment and it's okay now for them to take billions of taxpayer money and give it to acorn
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:47.680]  billions and make sure that they can still community organize from the far left but if anybody
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:54.000]  including ordinary citizens grandparents show up at these meetings not organized not paid for
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:02.320]  not professional agitators then what happens is the obama people demonize these senior citizens
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:09.120]  and others attending the town hall meetings and they send out the sdiu and other left funded
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:14.880]  community organizing groups or unions or obama supporters of one kind or another to harass
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:21.920]  beat up and cause trouble disrupt the ability of ordinary middle americans middle americans middle
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:28.000]  class americans to go to these town halls and express the grievances if that's what the left
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:35.440]  has always done the left is the obama far left community organizer is not about free speech
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:45.200]  it's a chicago big city machine enforcer yes and with the background of a socialist ideology
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:51.360]  that if you do not agree with your by definition an enemy of the state well that's what they were
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:56.080]  saying is they ran up to this black guy on video and said how can a black guy be against
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:01.600]  obama and then called him the n-word and punched him in the nose well that's the thing i mean they
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:08.640]  the whole issue is the the race you know uh you've read paul krugman today at your time so
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:13.520]  the the middle class people attending these town hall meetings are defined by paul krugman as
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:19.360]  racist anybody who objects to bronco bomb is racist but yet if you know you want to advance that
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:24.320]  argument the expectation from the left is that they're going to get a hundred percent of the
[1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:30.560]  african-american vote and any african-american who dares be conservative and object to bronco
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:36.400]  bomb is going to get doubly demonized by the left well you know i was reading the post dispatch
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:40.320]  in other articles and made a slight mistake they did arrest a reporter who didn't deserve to be
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:47.200]  arrested and they did arrest some of the people who were against against what obama is doing with
[1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:52.720]  health care but they also did arrest one of the people that did assault the innocent tea party
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:59.600]  person so the police did appear to a better job so so so good for them the police are usually i mean
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:04.000]  my experience with the police in america is the police are doing their best to try to preserve
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:10.640]  order the police are trying to maintain a peaceful situation so the video is i saw even with the fdi
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.240]  protesters causing trouble at a couple of these rallies over the last couple of days
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:20.480]  the police have done everything they can just to quiet things down and to be even handed
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.560]  but the police are being put into an untenable situation if the far left is going to call out
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:32.560]  its thugs to try to disrupt these meetings so that they appear to have been disruptive from
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:37.120]  the beginning they're not these are angry people that's why they're doing that that's right in
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:42.720]  fact the news or when i read the pittsburgh post dispatch their own reporter got arrested for no
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:52.160]  reason and then the post acted like that was a good thing and the post is is just incredible i mean
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:57.120]  it's incredible how they distort and and meanwhile i'm sure you've seen all the articles we have a
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:04.720]  CNN piece they're saying the obama joker picture is racist when all it's showing is a psychopathic
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:10.800]  lying criminal and the very magazine that showed george bush is a vampire well they did they did
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:15.120]  a joker picture of george of your bush too and no one in the left objected to that that i can
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:21.200]  recall but i mean is obama a god like hitler or stalin where you can't make fun of him because the
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:26.880]  democrats are in the news calling it dangerous calling an illegal saying it should be taken down
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:34.000]  calling it this is the totalitarianism of the political left it's been this way since 1917
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:41.680]  it's been this way since the 1960s when you were dealing with sbs leftist radicals like bill ayer
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:47.600]  uh... they never have tolerated on the far left free speech if you object to the left
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:53.360]  you are by definition a racist an imperialist a colonialist they give all the other name you
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:59.040]  can't have a position that is tolerated by the left unless you agree with them listen i've had
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:03.360]  the anarchist not all of them you know the certain groups that are hired by big foundations
[1:47:03.360 --> 1:47:07.760]  they'll just come over and you could be talking about you could be talking about
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:12.720]  you know the sky being blue and they'll just start poking you calling you a racist
[1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:16.800]  and it's a religion to them and they smile they know you're not a racist
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:22.320]  they're just using it as their big foundation weapon they call i mean take nancy polosi saying
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:28.320]  you're astroturf racist if you're against health carrier a racist i mean it really is comical it's
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:33.520]  like a bunch of parrots was chirping the same word it came like nancy polosi took her talking
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:39.680]  points right off of a daily cause column and posting i'm looking for the swastika pictures
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:46.080]  i don't see swastika people coming in with swastika picture uh... this is not a far right
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:52.320]  protest it's a middle american protest and from the left the left tactic has always been when
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:58.960]  there's getting a strong uprising from middle america against them they'll try to make middle
[1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:04.160]  america appear as if middle america is violent so the attempt has been to get these these events
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:11.360]  to be portrayed as not just angry expressions of opinion but intentionally created disruptive
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:17.200]  violent protests from the organized radical right which could not be farther from the truth
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:23.120]  i mean the republican party right now is so disorganized i don't know the republican party
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:28.720]  could organize a sunday afternoon picnic the idea that the republican party is driving these
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:33.360]  protests is not the case at all many of these people who are showing up at these rallies
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:38.800]  are just as angry as the as the republican party at george bush as they are the democratic party
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:44.560]  of bronco bomba well i just you know dr corsey i just can't believe that i pick up the same
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:52.320]  loose post dispatch and it says that anti-obama health care people cause a disturbance and then
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:58.160]  you watch the videos and it's the obama people attacking them the likelihood is
[1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:02.640]  that the peaceful middle americans who are at these meetings are going to be blamed for the
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:08.640]  violence whether they cause it or not and the left knowing that just wants to have these
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:15.680]  events disrupted so the images created that this is a violent reaction against president obama
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:21.680]  which is not even if that has to be generated or concocted and that's where you know i'm concerned
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:27.920]  to see now the white house instead of taking the position of defending the right of middle americans
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:36.160]  to speak out of coaching the senators and having meetings at axle rod out of the deputy chief of
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:42.080]  staff at the white house give talking points to the senators going home saying if you get
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:47.760]  punched back at the touch of these meetings we'll punch back twice as hard these are aggressive
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:54.000]  far left techniques that don't bear with free speech the white house ought to be out there saying
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:00.080]  we're listening instead of you know instead instead he's saying get out of my way here is
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:05.520]  president here is president barack obama here's the video and audio so we've got we've got some
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:14.160]  work to do i don't mind by the way being responsible i expect to be held responsible for these
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:29.600]  issues because i'm the president but i don't want the folks who created the mess i don't want the
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:33.840]  folks who created the mess do a lot of talking i want them just to get out of the way so we can

[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:58.400]  and i remember right if he's going this way well but you notice he's saying i don't want to hear

[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:37.520]  but uh it's outrageous to hear him say that anybody that opposes anything he's doing we all
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:41.920]  cause the mess see that's why the democrats need the republicans and the republicans need the
[1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:46.640]  democrats to always blame what's happening on the other party when they're all in bed together
[1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:54.880]  but there's no doubt obama is very anti-liberty anti-freedom and uh the good news is dr corasy
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:55:00.560]  i don't see him getting away with any of this i think everybody knows he is a con artist lying
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:05.280]  scammer reading off a teleprompter and i think he's going to be one of the most unpopular president
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.680]  sever i don't think there's any way he's going to win reelection when i wrote the abomination
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:14.320]  i compared him to jimmy carter and i think he's going to do worse than jimmy carter i don't see
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.600]  him i don't see president obama surviving to get into a second term to be reelected i mean i don't
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:25.040]  think politically he's going to survive to have the ratings he's going to need to get
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:28.960]  reelected to a second term i think he's a one-term president well i've never seen him look angry
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:34.880]  and in these clips he looks like an egomaniac somebody with an egomaniac doesn't care what people
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:40.320]  think he looks upset in the eyes so which makes him dangerous in closing doc you've been talking
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:44.960]  to hawaii about the birth certificate copies and all this what do you really think's going on with
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:50.240]  the birth certificate i mean i mean i mean isn't there enough issues we can prove that destroy
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:54.400]  this criminal uh or i mean do you think the birth certificate really has something to it well i think
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:59.920]  this is the birth certificate to me this is the issue uh why is it that's just so president obama
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:06.560]  is telling the truth he's born in hawaii so why doesn't he just end this entire controversy today
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:11.600]  president obama say okay you want to see my long form original birth certificate here it is
[1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:17.600]  i'll show it to you it's supposed to be a transparent presidency instead president obama
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:22.640]  candidate obama that hundreds of thousands of dollars down to the million in order to prevent
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:28.160]  anybody from seeing that document it's birth certificate the original long form one as well
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:32.320]  as dozens of other documents about who he is and now you're talking to hawaii and they're being
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:38.480]  secretive well hawaii won't answer questions why will not even authenticate that the short form
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:44.160]  certificate of law at live birth at the campaign and sites like fact check dot org put out are
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:49.200]  authentic i can't get them to authenticate but again fact check is one of their soros organs
[1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:55.840]  isn't it annenberg organization and it ties back into the left uh annenberg again is association
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:02.640]  as it is a foundation where uh then prior to being senator obama when he was community organizer
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:08.800]  obama bill ayer both worked i showed that in the obama nation but by pointing out alexa this
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.480]  there's a scope there's a score a document this is the least benefit president president obama
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:19.760]  that we've ever had what about his passport record how about his records in indonesia
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:25.280]  did he have a very sataro i mean he is the only president who had aliases and other names before
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:33.200]  he really is creepy i want to see his law firm record he's admitted that as a lawyer obama worked
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:38.800]  with tony resko who's now in federal prison i'd like to see the hours that he filled and how much
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:45.120]  work he really did in that law firm for tony resko how about his records at occidental college
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:49.920]  did he was rooming with pakistani students usually universities don't put u.s students with
[1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:56.480]  foreign exchange students did bronco obama apply as a foreign exchange student he traveled to pakistan
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:01.200]  with those students did he go into the indonesian passport did he have an indonesian passport yeah
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:06.640]  we know they've sealed all his records like no president everything's sealed they are acting
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:11.760]  very very suspicious and that's the birth certificate issue maybe the big secret is i'm not saying he
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:17.840]  was born in kenya i i'm an investigative recorder i can't prove that i'm just saying give us the
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:23.440]  documents we want to see the document and what why does even a birth certificate of long form

[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:10.480]  and i'm going to fight 110 and i just thank god every day that i had good parents that
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:15.760]  taught me to read history books and taught me about history and that loved me and that you
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:23.680]  know i again i thought that my parents were just normal and everybody was like my family
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:30.320]  and i didn't know that kind of my whole puritan family lineage and i'm not saying i had a perfect
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.400]  family going back through history but looking back on my forebears my ancestors i come from
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:40.160]  pretty good people pretty good hardworking people that always stood up to evil over and over again
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:45.040]  and i didn't realize that a lot of people come from scum they enjoy evil they enjoy screwing
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:50.480]  other people they enjoy being bullies and as i grew up i began to realize that but i am just so
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:58.720]  thankful that i woke up to this early i'd say when i was about 16 years old it wasn't even
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:03.040]  waking up we did an interview with alan watt in canada coming up the new obama film
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:09.200]  and he made a point you know we asked him when well i can't really get into canada they had me
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:15.200]  on a terror less basically so my team got in and barely but um we asked him when did you wake up and
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:20.640]  he said i was born awake everybody just knew it where he grew up in a bad part of town in the poor
[2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:26.000]  part of town in london everybody knew the system was cheating you and lying and scamming and it
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:32.240]  was a new world order and i grew up middle class but reading history and being informed
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:38.720]  everybody you just know that old timers all just knew this so i really was brought up awake
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:46.320]  i just didn't realize that other people weren't awake i didn't and i didn't take seriously the
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:54.000]  history i didn't realize my duty to fight the evil but yeah no i was i wasn't born awake but i was
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:59.360]  born into people that were awake and not people that were awake and really active i mean you know
[2:03:59.360 --> 2:04:05.040]  my dad's idea being active was stopping and helping every person he saw change tires we'd say no don't
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:10.640]  stop we want to go eat or you know we're on a road trip we want to get to you know to the national
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:15.760]  park don't he'd pull over and help him and then sometimes they'd be crazy people sometimes they'd
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:21.680]  be scammers sometimes they'd be and you know society's so corrupt and evil now my dad like
[2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:25.280]  ten years ago tried to stop somebody and help him and they tried to jump him and rob him it was a
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:33.120]  scam and so you know he doesn't do that anymore see evil has a way of taking over and then it
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:39.040]  pushes good people back and makes us kind of give up no the answer is not pulling your feelers back
[2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:45.760]  but getting more out there when evil starts trying to push you around you gotta you know you gotta
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:54.400]  step in even stronger you gotta take the ground you gotta hold it you gotta occupy

[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:32.080]  they realize the stage terror isn't working dr sherry ten penny is a medical doctor from cleveland

[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:15.040]  the bio is too long to go over and uh the website is dr ten penny dot com doc i did that five minute
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:22.000]  preface to kind of lay the foundation of what i'm seeing tell us what you're seeing uh and and
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.640]  where you think this is going you know alex i listened to that and i've listened to you before
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:31.600]  i've read your i've read prison planet and a lot of other documents that i have privy to just like
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:37.920]  what you do behind the scenes and i have to be in agreement with you it's it's the everything is
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:42.480]  marching down the path in the same way of just what you just laid out at the top of the hour
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:48.400]  my question is and i i have a question for you about this is i mean it seems so focused on the
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:54.240]  u.s there is the same type of implementation being happening in other countries yes yes
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:59.840]  every nato country and western countries you know the master planners at the un under unesco
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:05.920]  have written these the whole world uh even iran is following the world health organization level
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:13.120]  six guidelines so even quote enemies are following un orders and the un has bragged this is the first
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:18.880]  global omnibus health system and they're saying this is good for globalism good for the new world
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:25.600]  order and so yes they're doing the same thing worldwide well but you're right that the u.s
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:32.000]  seems to be the most intensive it it does it seems so this is absolutely a plot and plan against the
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.200]  of the american people and what is happening is out of washington under the guise of health which
[2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:41.760]  has been happening in the vaccine world for years is that they put up these fancy little pictures
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:45.600]  with all the smiley little kids and saying we're going to vaccinate you to keep you healthy and
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:50.800]  what i'm hoping is from the things that you're doing and i'm doing and a handful of other us on
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:55.120]  radio and television and internet we're going to get people awake because the only possible way
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:16:00.240]  that we have to revolt and stand up against this is a grassroots awakening of people just
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:04.560]  saying no i am not going to do this i'm going to band together with people in my community
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:09.680]  and i am not going to i'm not going to take this vaccine and i'm not going to take this anymore
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:15.360]  absolutely doctor you were in mexico and all this was happening down there at a conference
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:23.120]  i mean i mean let's go over this let's talk about this and and and discuss what we really
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:28.960]  know about the virus it's incredibly weak they're saying it'll mutate into something deadly but i've
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:33.440]  talked to other virologists and they've said normally stuff mutates into something less strong
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:39.680]  or benign you've got all these big health advisors in europe and the united states that are on
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:45.440]  vaccine maker payroll how are they coming out with a test vaccine in only months not six months
[2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:52.160]  the cloning technology of the of the virus and then openly saying they're getting ready for forced
[2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:56.480]  inoculations telling medical workers they've got to take it first the army saying they're
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:01.440]  standing by dr tim penny you've got the floor break it down well i agree with everything you've said
[2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:07.040]  and the scariest part of all of this is that you know that well it's all scary i can't say the
[2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:12.240]  scariest is that as they are manufacturing this vaccine they don't have to produce and release
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:17.360]  a package insert of what's exactly in the vaccine until it's been approved for use so all the
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:22.320]  scientific research that they have there's 11 centers n i h centers around the country that are
[2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:28.080]  now holding testing experiment human experimentation is what i call it and these people who are
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:32.800]  are rolling up their sleeves and they claim for the sake of clients and getting in compensation
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:38.880]  of that somewhere between 50 and 400 dollars to get injected with a vaccine that has an unknown
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:44.560]  substance in it there is 11 different sites there are four different studies that are going on they
[2:17:44.560 --> 2:17:50.400]  they started a study in australia they started it in the u.s. yeah houston can't that be the cedar i'm
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:56.320]  sorry to interrupt can't that i mean other vaccine trials have actually caused pandemics before
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:00.640]  and they're doing they don't care of garter cells killing girls in mass they don't care of the bird
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:04.880]  flu test in europe they don't care they don't care and what they're going to do is they're
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:09.520]  going to watch this for three weeks for side effects so if you get so if you were in the if
[2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:14.160]  you were in the experiment today alex and you got the first first shot they would follow you for
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:19.040]  three weeks to see whether or not you developed any sort of side effects they would draw your blood
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:24.240]  to see whether or not you developed an antibody and if it was looking positive like you did you
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:30.640]  low side effects and you had an antibody the next round of experimentation is on babies so and they're
[2:18:30.640 --> 2:18:35.360]  using two different dosages of two different vaccines from three different companies so how
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:41.280]  are they ever going to pull that data and crunch it i mean real life scientists that have that do real
[2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:46.160]  good research are probably like pulling their hair out right now of thinking how can they possibly
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:51.120]  be doing this well it's obviously clackery so they can say we did test it's good to take
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:55.920]  because like they said the anthrax shot was good sorry go ahead they really are not in a position
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:02.320]  of wanting to do good side so that's the bottom line here because of the of the 2006 pandemic
[2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:07.600]  laws that are going into effect the only way that you can sue and that you have any compensation
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:13.440]  whatsoever is number one you have to you have to identify willful intent and you have to get
[2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:19.520]  permission from the secretary of hhs pursuing a compensation if they have very little experimentation
[2:19:19.520 --> 2:19:25.040]  going on very little clinical trials with very short follow-up um how could they you could they
[2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:29.440]  could say well gosh we had no idea that it was going to cause this many problems so they could
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:34.880]  not be accused of willful intent all right dr. sherry timpani i got a million questions here i'm
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:40.800]  chopping at the bed they've said other vaccines are safe like anthrax and smallpox and admittedly
[2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:44.800]  had to withdraw them it killed so many people so they're kind of testing the boundary regardless
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:49.520]  of those killing people they won't withdraw it the anthrax killed a bunch of people they did the
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:54.800]  smallpox did they withdrew it we know these flu trials the last year have been killing a lot of
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:02.240]  people previous to this they're not withdrawing it now they're setting that precedent ejc.com

[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:24.240]  i don't want to miss the forest for the trees here there have been thousands of cases of
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:34.000]  different vaccines killing people and many times causing pandemics and causing thousands to die of
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  degenerative brain disorders on record like in 76 with the last swine flu that popped up at a
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:45.760]  military base after an inoculation campaign this is a government that's been caught doing chemical
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:52.160]  and biological testing thousands of times against the american people this is a government that gave
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:58.880]  the native americans the smallpox blankets but it's not even that information it's that this is
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:05.120]  an unproven different group different companies different vaccines different trials running around
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:10.880]  shooting everybody up for something that killed less than 200 people in the united states
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:18.000]  university of alabama implements mandatory vaccine program that's been announced i've got new york
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:24.160]  newspaper headlines this is out of new york business new york proposes mandatory vaccinations
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:30.080]  for healthcare workers dr sherry tenpenny this is a quick segment but continuing regardless you
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:34.480]  know they could say under executive orders they can force us to take shots but then with the media
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:40.720]  they're just kind of slowly broaching this to the public yeah i think that what they're trying to do
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:47.760]  right now is at least you know alex is as as as internet service savvy as you are and i am and a
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:52.960]  lot of your listeners are there's still a lot of people that aren't and that they get their information
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:59.440]  and their news from brian jennings at six o'clock or 6 30 and they really think that that is the
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:04.160]  truth and they really aren't talking about any of this on the six o'clock news they're barely
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:09.680]  talking about it on the talking head shows so i think that they're this is going to come up by
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:14.560]  surprise to a lot of people and that's going to make every and they're going to turn the
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:19.040]  fear crank machine they're going to have more fear going this fall than what they even had
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:25.200]  back in march and april when they were doing the whole mexican death tally scare thing and then
[2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:28.720]  people are going to be uninformed they're not going to know what to do they're not going to know
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.480]  how to prepare and they're just going to run down the street and roll up their sleeves so they get
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:39.200]  this back exactly so we're in a race to reach out to the public and go a couple hundred people
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:43.920]  die in mexico city with compromised immune systems living on open air shacks half the
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:48.720]  population in mexico city does live like that sick people babies on breathing machines that
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:53.520]  were already on the edge of death die in the united states old people who've had five heart
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:59.840]  surgeries i mean this is clearly a hoax what is your gut as a researcher as a medical doctor
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:04.400]  tell you is this just hype to sell vaccines and have a federal clamp down and get us used to
[2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:10.000]  taking u n orders or is it worse i mean if they almost had a complete lockdown of the world over
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:15.360]  a couple hundred deaths what's going to happen when the public gets confused by regular flu deaths
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:21.120]  in the thousands that's a great question and i don't know that i have any answer to that and i
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:24.960]  think that one of the questions that i've been asked hundreds of times in the last couple of
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:30.480]  weeks for all of the the internet and radio and webinar work that i've been doing is what do we
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:35.920]  do i mean what can we do it's one thing to get all this information it's another thing to give
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:42.960]  people something to do so we've set up a web a website it's pandemic flu online dot com pandemic
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:50.000]  flu online dot com and we've given people tools downloadable pdf files that are flyers and and
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  brochures and articles that they can give to the their letter editors of the letter to the editors
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:00.560]  we're setting up powerpoint mini powerpoint presentations of things that they can take to
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:05.680]  their local community and get them informed about the truth about the flu shot that it doesn't work
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:11.120]  in babies people with asthma and adults or the elderly it doesn't work in anybody and to let them
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:16.720]  know that there's all the stuff that's inside the vaccines and to give them information and phone
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:20.960]  numbers and telling them to call their senators and representatives and let them know that we
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:25.520]  don't want this this is not and what about saying let us home shield if you're going to have the army
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:32.000]  lock everything down don't make us go to some inoculation center exactly don't take all of those
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:37.280]  things all that stuff that all those things are building on a daily basis on that website so because
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:41.440]  you know alex i've been saying for years we've got to get people active we've got it we've got to get
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:47.520]  people aware but we haven't given them the tools to do that and so we're creating tools now so that
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:52.000]  people can pass these out and we're having a tremendous response where i am here in cleveland
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:58.320]  ohio that passing out these brochures of passing out the the flyers the people that had no idea
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:02.240]  and people who said you know i've been looking for something like this to pass out to somebody
[2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:07.040]  thank you for making this so the more people that we get aware and the more people that know
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:12.320]  what's going on the less that fear mongering and that fear crank is going to be on the six o'clock
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:18.160]  news and we've got now we've given people something to do rather than just making them afraid and there
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:22.880]  really is the school still out on the mandatory vaccination i mean we don't really know what's
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:27.280]  going to happen with that but the only thing we can do right now is to get people aware that's
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:33.040]  right because the precedent is set at schools there's no law to take all these different
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:39.680]  shots they lie and say oh you got to take it it's the law and then they kick you out for truancy when
[2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:45.520]  you violate the policy it's a policy like we have a policy against chewing gum so they're
[2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:53.440]  going to try to hit our kids first dr sherry jen penny stay with us we're on the march the empires

[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:13.120]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:18.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:30:18.160 --> 2:30:23.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:28.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:32.320]  four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator
[2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:41.680]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:46.720]  generators offered by solutions from science a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information

[2:33:21.200 --> 2:33:26.080]  ladies and gentlemen we have cracked the history of the globalists they funded lennon stalin
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:33.520]  now hitler poll pot they fund everybody they are eugenicists they are empowered because they are the
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:39.200]  most ruthless the most wicked the most cunning and good people could beat them if we would just
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:45.760]  admit evil existed if we would just admit these psychopaths are operating and i want the illusion
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:50.960]  shattered for police and military and the general public people that serve the system that think the
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:57.520]  system's good that they go i'm a good person so the system must be good no no the system is
[2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:07.280]  directed from the top by prime evil by total fundamental foundational greed avarice and control
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:13.120]  freak i mean that is the spirit of this selfishness this this wickedness and they write textbooks
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:18.960]  bragging they've been caught thousands of times doing unbelievably horrible things to us and they
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:23.760]  say they're doing it the british government the australian government the german government
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:27.920]  the communists under the russians the russians aren't doing it now the russians admit that the
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:32.160]  government was sterilizing people and poisoning the water and they apologize and pay their people
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:36.560]  to have children now and don't have cps running around grabbing kids i'm not saying russia's
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:45.200]  perfect it's it's got a lot of mafia and corruption but uh it certainly is different just from the
[2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:51.040]  proof is in the pudding and this is real ladies and gentlemen and we're all in the boat together
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:57.280]  i'm hoping this is just a beta test for future pandemics as i said they're going to have more
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:01.840]  stage releases training us how to be locked down training us how to be controlled because everything
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:07.760]  is incrementalism with these people and going back to dr sherry tim penny doctor you know i'm
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:11.760]  ranting here it's just i think about how the smallpox shots killed so many people and they had
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:16.400]  to stop them i think about how the anthrac shots two separate times they forced the troops to take
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:22.240]  them and kill people in mass on record and then nobody gets in trouble i think about how baxter
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:26.880]  gets caught doing all this stuff i think about the homeless people trials lying to them and the
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:33.120]  homeless dying in mass i mean one group of homeless that were shot up what 23 died in one clinic in
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:40.800]  poland and then they've set the precedent now where we take the shots and we die or we all these
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:45.280]  people call that gave their daughters shots for garter sill and they have autoimmune disorders
[2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:51.840]  down or in wheelchairs i mean this is really happening doctor yes it is and what's really
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:56.880]  scary to me is what is the adjuvant that they're going to be putting into the shot and there's no
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:03.360]  doubt in my mind that the adjuvants are going to be added and just to you know make sure everybody
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:08.480]  knows what an adjuvant is and we've got virus which is called antigen and then we have a chemical
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:13.360]  that gets put in it to make the antigen go farther so if you've got a quart of the antigen but what
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:18.960]  you really need is 10 gallons of antigen you put these additional adjuvants in there so you can
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:24.960]  use less of the virus per shot the fact that we spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:30.720]  adjuvant from glass coppers misclined and from Novartis we've already purchased it we know that
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:36.080]  they're going to use it the second the part about that that's really really bad is that neither one
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:43.520]  of those aso 3 from gsk and ms 59 from Novartis our fda approved for flu shots in this country
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:47.680]  but they're going to end they're they're going to use it and they're going to say use it by two
[2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:52.080]  means when they're going to say we're not going to have enough virus vaccine ready by the time we
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:55.440]  want to start this flu shot so we're going to start putting some adjuvant in we're going to
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:37:01.120]  declare that it's okay for use under the federal powers act the fda can make that happen and fast
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:04.960]  track it so we'll put it in the vaccine and then give them total liability protection that's already
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:08.640]  been done and for those that don't know you're a medical doctor but i've had other medical doctors
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:17.440]  on neurologist all these experts i've even had brain surgeons on neurologist and on record they've
[2:37:17.440 --> 2:37:23.440]  known for 50 plus years that the different accelerants the different things that these
[2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:28.720]  adjuvants that activate the immune system that that's what is causing the brain swelling the
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:35.280]  burning out of the pancreas the swelling in organs the autoimmune diseases they know and
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:40.080]  you're saying this is going to be supercharged with that yeah it's going to be supercharged with
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:44.560]  because these adjuvants we have squalene in them and the squalene in experiment of animals has
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:50.320]  caused has caused horrible side effects including debilitating arthritis the recent report that
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:55.120]  came out a couple of days ago said that they really have in trouble with this h1n1 virus that they
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:38:00.000]  have because it's not replicating as fast as they would like it to and that they yield they're only
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:06.480]  about 20 percent of what the normal yield would be for a virus that they're trying to create so it's
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:11.120]  not growing very fast they can't make very much of it they only purchase the certain amount of it
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:17.200]  so it's all leading to the conclusion hey government hey cdc we need to put the ms 59 and the aso 3
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:22.000]  and they're just spread it around so we've got enough for everybody well doctor i've also read
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:26.720]  studies neither one of them have been tested in children either one of the tested in children
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:33.760]  i've also read that a lot of these uh chemicals they add to elicit the autoimmune response
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:39.440]  have been associated with later reproductive problems and so of course they like that because
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:44.880]  it ends up uh reducing fertility well and even the normal regular annual flu shot by which they're
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:49.280]  saying that kids who who are going to school this fall and if they're not had a previous flu shot
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:54.320]  are supposed to get four flu shots before they go oh my god i forgot to ask you that let me i'm
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:58.320]  going to try to shut up here but but please go through this because you keep there's thousands
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:03.280]  of points here i have a family you have a family it's freaking me out as this freight train comes
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:08.720]  towards this and somehow we've got to get the public to wake up and say no that's the big issue
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:15.120]  here is that they're saying like a placebo go get old flu shots that they admit have no connection
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  to this flu give you no immunity and people are already lined up at clinics and panicking for three
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:28.960]  four months straight getting all these ridiculous shots uh and obama said dr obama says you need
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.840]  to take three shots now they're saying four shots i mean soon will it be your morning
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:39.360]  flu shot break that down doctor well they're saying that in order that the theory is that in
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:45.360]  order to develop an adequate immune response you're supposed to get a and a vaccine followed up by a
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:50.800]  second vaccine so if you have children who are eight or nine or ten years old who have not previously
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:56.240]  had a flu shot of any kind the recommendations that are coming out is that they'll get the regular
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:01.440]  flu shot three weeks later they'll get their booster on their regular annual flu shot three
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:06.000]  weeks later they'll get their swine flu shot and three weeks after that they'll get their booster
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:11.280]  of their swine flu shot and then we'll see how many kids can actually function in school this year
[2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:15.760]  as if it isn't already bad enough and they're recommending that for kids six months of age and
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:21.920]  older so you know the the adults are supposed to get three flu shots they're supposed to get their
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:26.880]  annual seasonal flu shot a swine flu and a swine flu booster but your kids if they haven't had a
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:32.160]  previous one they're supposed to get four I just think you know it's like it's almost like there's
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:36.800]  people there's this concept that all that's in there is a little dead virus and a little sterile
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:40.880]  water and so what good what harm is it going to cause and a little is good so a whole lot must be
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:47.440]  better and what we're doing is causing a massive amount of problems and in children and adults and
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:52.960]  everybody needs to just get informed about this go to pandemic flu online dot com go to
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:57.840]  dr10penny.com download the information and pass it out to your family and friends take it to your
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:02.560]  school let the teachers know it let the people in the in your daycare know it let the put the
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:06.880]  principles on notice that you're not going to have that happening to your children in your
[2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:11.840]  school system it's the only way that we're going to be able to stop this from all these vaccines
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:19.680]  happening in schools this year and doc that's my next two points is a we had big victories in
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:27.920]  2000 2003 2002 2003 when they tried to order the 14 million first responders to take the smallpox
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:34.640]  shot and said it's the law everyone will do it or you'll be fired firemen police medical workers
[2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:40.640]  nurses doctors city workers county workers state workers the majority of them said no
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:47.760]  so that program stalled and died we've had victories before over this but they've been
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:54.000]  so successful fear mongering with the pre flu hype they didn't have that with the smallpox
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:01.200]  they just use 9 11 saying we just got hit a year ago we're sure al qaeda is going to use smallpox
[2:42:01.200 --> 2:42:05.920]  people didn't buy that but people have had the flu and know it really feels bad and know it that
[2:42:05.920 --> 2:42:11.440]  it can kill you sometimes so that's why this is so much more effective that's why this fight is so
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:17.520]  important so speak to our only recourse i guess is to educate is to warn people is to spread the
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:22.800]  word like our lives depend on it with the articles and info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:28.480]  global research has done a huge compendium article that's incredibly good we've got linked up on info
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:37.840]  wars dot com so a educate everybody we've got a fighting chance b i have the washington post
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:42.960]  buried in an article paul watson's doing a story on it saying oh yeah these flu shots have high
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:49.120]  levels of mercury they've lied in the past and said they've taken the mercury out another lie so
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:54.400]  speak to getting the word out and waking people up and then the mercury angle well getting the
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:59.280]  word out is is is what i keep telling everybody they have to do and everybody says well i i don't
[2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:05.680]  know who i should talk to talk to everybody i have a stack of liars that i carry around with me and
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:10.800]  my person in the back of my car because i take them into everywhere i say here that and i've
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:15.440]  gone down the street by where my office is and i've stopped with with me with these fires it's
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:20.400]  the truth about the flu shot and you can get it off of my website and it's all over the internet
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:25.360]  and i don't even engage it with them in conversation i just walk in and say good morning good afternoon
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.360]  how are you here's some information i think you might be have been interested in looking at and
[2:43:29.360 --> 2:43:34.160]  turn around and walk out so you don't have to they stand there and debate anybody just and the worst
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:38.560]  that's going to happen is nothing they throw it in the trash but you never know whose hands that
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:43.280]  might end up in that might really make a difference your police department your first responders your
[2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:47.840]  sheriff all these people need to know that you don't want this and that they may not even know
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:52.240]  what's going to be injected into their body and once they know it they might say well you know
[2:43:52.240 --> 2:43:57.920]  what i don't want this either and suddenly you've got an entire community that's going to to rally
[2:43:57.920 --> 2:44:02.880]  around so when the FEMA trucks come driving down your street and to look for people who have a
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:08.480]  bit vaccinated you've got a community that's going to bond together and and reserve well said i want
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:14.480]  you to get into the mercury but before we do that expanding on what you're saying printing up a nice
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:19.360]  flyer using your flyer printing up prison planet articles global research articles whatever there's
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:27.120]  a lot of good boil downs out there our story about FEMA you know the flu FEMA martial law mass graves
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:32.240]  that has a nice boil down effects people are really interested in the flu right now they
[2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:39.120]  instinctively know something's wrong something doesn't add up uh they are begging for this
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:46.240]  information go to kinko's or fed exos or whatever it's called now and and for a hundred bucks you
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:54.640]  could print up five thousand one or two sheets for twenty bucks you can print up you know thousands
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:45:01.760]  get it out to people and that's a child a woman a man that isn't going to be getting that you know
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:11.120]  onset of uh Parkinson's at 25 that onset of uh these uh the brain disorders people getting
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:16.640]  Alzheimer's at 40 now all tied to the vaccines go ahead yeah and dementia and all because that's
[2:45:16.640 --> 2:45:21.280]  really what's happening we we light up the immune system within the brain and it causes them to
[2:45:21.280 --> 2:45:26.880]  deteriorate and that's why we're seeing so many young people now with add adhd you know all the
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:32.160]  adults with adhd all the things that we can label them with so that we can give them more um
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:37.200]  psychotropic drugs like effects are impactful and all of these things i think that you know i've said
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:41.760]  for years alex that i think that the vaccine industry is really the economic loss leader of
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:48.240]  the entire pharmaceutical industry it's you know you the the idea that of a loss leader is you
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:52.480]  you know come into my store i'll give you a free t-shirt and oh by the way while you're here spend
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:57.200]  a couple hundred dollars so the economic loss leader of being vaccines is i'll give you this
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:00.800]  shot doesn't really cost me a whole lot of money even though it is a ten billion dollar
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:05.520]  year industry but i it's that's a pit that's compared to other things i'll give you this
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:09.440]  shot under the umbrella of keeping you healthy we got to keep these kids from getting sick
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:13.520]  and oh by the way i'll make hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:16.880]  and all the drugs they need to sell you down the line after you're sick from from what we've
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:20.720]  given you through these shots well that's what i was going to say they make them approve other
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:27.520]  drugs even if they approve something bad down the road the truth comes out vaccines are not held
[2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:32.240]  to the same standard they can kill whoever they want hurt whoever they want
[2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:39.440]  because it's proprietary and very secretive what's really in it it's the perfect cover
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:46.240]  for the soft kill it's the perfect cover for the sterilization the u n's been caught as you know
[2:46:46.240 --> 2:46:52.160]  adding the female hormone to the tetanus shot that sterilize the women only in a program for women
[2:46:52.160 --> 2:46:57.440]  that was pushed as feminism over only helping women and because that weapon wouldn't have
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:02.240]  hurt a man it was designed for a woman i mean this is diabolical and the way they want to set
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:09.120]  the precedent to put in our body what they want when they want you know about all these new live
[2:47:09.120 --> 2:47:14.800]  viral vaccines that are really live action genetic engineer operations i've had top
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:23.280]  genetic engineers on with the quote vaccine that cures you from cocaine or nicotine or heroin
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:29.680]  addiction and it's a live virus that goes in and attacks the receptors in the brain creating
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:35.280]  plaques so you can't absorb the drug which also then blocks your endorphins but don't worry they've
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:42.160]  got a drug to then treat that can you speak to those classes of things called vaccines that are
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:51.200]  really nanobot you know genetically engineered viral weapons yeah they are that's really you
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:57.200]  summed it up really well alexa and they are dna the vaccines that are coming down the pike and
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:02.080]  now they're talking about edible vaccines that there's vaccines that are going to be a potatoes
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:06.640]  and carrots there's a vaccine that they have considered doing in africa that is spread by
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:13.600]  mosquitoes i mean it gets that's bill gates it gets more like a great b sci-fi movie all the time
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:19.840]  and it would be really kind of funny if it wasn't so diabolical well that's bill gates the eugenicist
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:24.240]  who now they've total given over a hundred billion i'm saying eighty something billion it's gone up
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:28.800]  him and warren buffet they're all supporting planned parenthood bill gates his daddy runs
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:34.480]  planned parenthood they're openly and he's like i want to release mosquitoes to give you an hiv cure
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:39.040]  and and i mean my god doctor this is pretty obvious what's going on
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:43.920]  you would think that right now alex from everything that people have been saying
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:50.240]  that there would be nobody left who would believe that vaccines are are safe they protect you
[2:48:50.240 --> 2:48:57.120]  they're harmless and they're good for you but we've got multi-generational 200 years of multi-generational
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:02.960]  indoctrination that people really believe that vaccines are good they really will keep you from
[2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:07.520]  getting sick and you know the fda and the government wouldn't ever approve anything that might harm me
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:14.640]  and so the undoing that in people's psyche is taking a long long time but i think that pretty
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:18.480]  soon we're going to reach the hundredth monkey here i really do and i think that there's going
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:23.520]  to be a hundredth monkey phenomenon when i agree all of a sudden everybody's going to go holy cow
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:27.120]  and they're all going to wake up at the same time and honestly alex i think that's what the
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:32.240]  government's most fearful of because of radio because of the internet because of webinars because
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:37.760]  of all of these technologies that we have we have an exponential waking up curve that's happening
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:42.080]  unlike anything that you and i have seen in the last five to seven years it's happening really
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:47.680]  fast and so there's this race to the finish line of like holy cow we can't control all those people
[2:49:47.680 --> 2:49:53.680]  we can't keep them in the dark if suddenly they're all awake we have to suddenly ramp up the the
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:58.800]  200 the 400 year pathway that they've had in terms of taking over the world and we have to do it
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:02.560]  really quick because if we don't do it soon there's going to be so many people awake that
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:06.400]  are going to revolt that we're not going to be able to be successful which is what i'm hoping
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:11.280]  will happen they won't be successful dr sherry tin penny you just headed out of the park right
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:16.400]  there you just said it all they are behind schedule people are waking up they clearly
[2:50:16.400 --> 2:50:23.040]  have accelerated every program the gun grabbing the carbon tax the banking takeover the open
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:31.360]  borders the wars yeah i mean they are in a panic in a bit of a panic well my dad did
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:36.480]  exterminating in college some raised money and he'd go into the bad part of town to kill roaches
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:42.000]  and he said it's true when you spray roaches with poison they start fornicating and that's
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:47.760]  kind of what the elites are doing they realize that they're losing and so they're just going wild

[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:33.360]  it's gonna keep you by the way i'm gone crazy there's 18 interviews in the new obama film
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:39.840]  and i just sent the guys off to interview burg there'll be a 19th we're gonna interview dr
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:43.680]  sherry tim penny for the film we just agreed to do it because i'm covering the flu some but i think
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:48.480]  it's more important even do more in the film on it and and just how they stage crises
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:53.040]  so very excited you know i forgot to even chew your horn doctor because who i have on
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:57.680]  is people that have proven to be accurate and you wrote a book a few years ago about
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:04.320]  how they would use a flu as a pretext to take over and i've read the book it is almost like
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:08.720]  prophecy and you were telling me during the break that sometimes you can't believe you wrote this
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:12.800]  and you know i have that same feeling when i make these films and project what i think they're
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:19.200]  going to do to be exactly right is really scary it is scary and when i go back and i read it and
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:24.560]  i read the chapter about mandatory vaccination is it possible when i read about the last chapter
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:30.000]  about you know tying it all together how is it that sick birds and sick people and vaccines and
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:34.160]  and quarantines how does this all come about and come together i read it now and i think
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:39.920]  i can't believe i wrote this this was like prophecy i wrote it in 2006 it's called foul bird
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:44.000]  flu it's not what you think but it's very much about what's going on with the swine flu right
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:49.440]  now it's exactly the same and people can get it off of my website it's at dr tenpenney.com
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:53.760]  it's actually even on sale right now for 20 bucks so there's no reason everybody shouldn't have it
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:55:57.600]  and pass it out to their friends well i mean in the book you say are they mixing it in with the
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:56:05.120]  vaccine and then we catch baxter at 18 locations mixing it in with the with the big vats and then
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:10.960]  thank god somebody in the check republic tested it on ferrets and it killed them and then separately
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:15.920]  they won't say who the company is but it says they had bird flu trials london telegraph says
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:20.880]  that killed a bunch of people but it says it was a pharma company paid off officials to lie
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:26.880]  and give it to homeless but it doesn't say it's baxter do you have any intel on who that really is
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:31.760]  no i don't not right now at the top of my head but i'll bet you if we look long enough we'll find it
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:36.320]  well i mean they arrested all the city officials in just one country why won't they say who
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:42.160]  who the vaccine company is uh you know there's they probably have dirt on everybody they've
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:46.160]  probably threatened their children or something you know they're not again you know they've killed
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:50.960]  off a lot of scientists so it wouldn't be you know it wouldn't be out of line for them to to put

[3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:50.720]  it's really the history of swords uh you know the whole culture chivalry and then when i saw
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:56.640]  that john reese davies was in it you know this is the guy uh who's uh plays one of the main characters
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:03.520]  in some of the writers the lost art films i like the original uh and then also uh the uh one where
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:08.080]  they're looking for the holy grail he's gimley my favorite character in lord of the rings and

[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:18.480]  man or my friend rick linklater just finished shooting a film about orson wells a few months
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:21.840]  ago i've never been to the isle of man but i'm told it's very interesting and it's just great to
[3:01:21.840 --> 3:01:28.160]  have mr davies on with us thank you sir for joining us it's my pleasure to join you as i said it's a
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:32.560]  beautiful evening here in the isle of man the sun is setting over the irish sea and it's uh
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:40.800]  it's a nice clear evening a little cloud in the sky but it's warm and pleasant and uh just beautiful
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:46.720]  well it's great to have you here i mean you don't really need any introduction but but tell us how
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:55.200]  did you get involved in this uh documentary film reclaiming the blade well i get sent a number
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:02.080]  of scripts some of which are very good some of which are pretty mediocre this one really stuck
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:10.560]  out like a sore thumb i mean a very golden thumb it was on a subject that i've not seen covered
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:18.720]  before and it had a lot of material in it that i thought was unique and fascinating anyone who's
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:26.080]  interested in in the uh in in in history at all will be interested in this extraordinary
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:34.800]  documentary um the sword is such an elegant symbol of so much isn't it uh the sword uh
[3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:42.560]  uh is a symbol of the cross the sword is man's means of protecting himself the sword is uh
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:51.760]  it's a symbol of justice uh if the sword is generally double edged um the sword may
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:03:03.200]  it would be the state of the art of metallurgy in in in any uh its civilization i mean there was
[3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:12.240]  a fascinating story the other day uh there's a very great um uh Viking sword maker and he
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:19.920]  suddenly he signed some of his thesis um but some of them were puzzling to archaeologists because
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:26.000]  there were fragments of them and they did some metallurgical analysis and they discovered that
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:35.600]  somebody somewhere had been forging this swordsmith's work and they had produced a marvelous cutting
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:43.280]  edge with their with the the steel that they produced but it was just too hard the real stuff
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:49.920]  was forged from from from um the ripe sort of ore brought all the way from Afghanistan would you
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:59.360]  believe the local stuff uh that had been passed off by the swordsmith was indeed very pure iron
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:07.760]  and very pure steel but it was fragile so imagine you spend a fortune buying this legendary sword
[3:04:07.760 --> 3:04:15.360]  smith's work and the first time you're in battle and you smite your enemy's sword your axe shrivels
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:22.880]  up into a pile of little shards and you think oh dear and the other guy looked at you and smiled
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:34.560]  and comes towards you man i was almost taken away there i was i i was imaging all of this and
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:44.560]  forgot i was on the radio it's great stuff um in a way technology is always at the cutting edge of

[3:08:28.800 --> 3:08:34.560]  the blade reclaiming the blade dot com and we have a daniel mcnickel coming on uh a little
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:42.560]  bit later to join both of us here in the shower uh he joins us of course uh from the isle of man
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:48.160]  and it's a great to have john reese davies on with us who needs no introduction but for folks
[3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:53.360]  watching us as we stream over the web will put his picture up on screen i've got so many questions
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:59.600]  uh during the uh break i was bringing up the fact that mr mcnickel told me
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:06.320]  that that this does have somewhat not even of a political message but of a liberty message a
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:12.160]  freedom message uh you know with this reclaiming the blade and about how this was something to
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:17.840]  fight back against corruption oppression how that freedom that skill was lost i guess the
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:21.840]  whole history of the blade and the sword and how important it is and people fighting for the right
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:27.360]  to own a sword has been lost and i was asking you what your whole view on the on the world is
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:39.040]  well uh and daniel is right the sword is a symbol of liberty and liberty is something
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:44.160]  that's very challenged these days i mean there are things that overtly challenge our civilization
[3:09:44.160 --> 3:09:54.240]  and because we tend to be rather modest um and rather uh we don't want to politically upset
[3:09:54.240 --> 3:10:02.640]  people aren't needlessly um or we tend to to stand back a little bit but look western european
[3:10:02.640 --> 3:10:13.120]  christian civilization is very important it has produced art music drama theater dance
[3:10:13.120 --> 3:10:21.840]  arts beyond the imagining of any other culture it stands for uh the liberty of the individual
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:26.560]  the right of the individual to think and to the extent that he doesn't affect others
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:34.720]  practice virtually anything he believes it's it celebrates democracy it celebrates the the the
[3:10:34.720 --> 3:10:44.400]  the the the right of democracy over theocracy or any other uh isocracy it it it's about the equality
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:52.080]  of men in before the law it's also about the equality of women with men in front of the law
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:58.480]  it doesn't assume that women are third class citizens it has abolished slavery and you must
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:03.040]  understand i this slavery is an issue that particularly resonates with me when i was a
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:08.000]  little boy my father was a policeman in africa he took me down to the dock site in doris alarm harbour
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:14.240]  in 1955 he said you see that dial there twice a year it comes down from saudi arabia it stops in
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:20.640]  aid and comes down the coast goes here goes to bayre in portuguese it wasn't me on the way down
[3:11:20.640 --> 3:11:25.840]  it's got machine tools and machine parts on the way back up it's always got two or three little
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:31.920]  black boys and these are slaves going back to saudi arabia and the united nations will not allow
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:42.320]  me to do anything about it saudi arabia arabia only abolished slavery in 1965 um you know he did
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:49.520]  and there's still slavery president salvage saudi arabia i will i will wait up um but here
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:58.560]  you know these are huge huge gains for mankind that our civilization has made
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:05.200]  and and you've got to understand that the certain religions certain faith certain things they have
[3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:11.440]  their strengths but in a way the way we engage in our civilization and within our faith is the
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:19.040]  way that we turn out as people and our civilization allows us to become rubbish or it allows us to
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:26.320]  do almost anything other religions are more straight jacket in their intellectual approach
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:34.160]  to education and theocracy and things like that but ours gives us an unassailable liberty and we
[3:12:34.160 --> 3:12:43.760]  must always be prepared to defend it um you know i'm proud to belong to western european christian
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:51.200]  civilization it's a it's a glorious tradition and and and and we must speak out firmly and fairly for
[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:58.080]  it well that's what i was going to ask you it it's fashionable for 50 years to demonize the west
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:02.720]  to attack anything that has to do with western culture and act like slavery was invented by the
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:11.040]  west when it was actually the west that began to end slavery why do the modern uh so many modern
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:16.720]  thinkers individuals love to paint the west as the progenitor of slavery when really it was the west
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:22.480]  that began to end slavery and many forms of slavery as you said still go on around the world but but
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:28.080]  that's okay we only see endless films and productions about how the west is bad the west is bad and
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:33.440]  that's because liberty and freedom and the magna carta and so much more springs from the west it
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:42.960]  is the enemy of the high-tech technocrats i believe well uh there are a number of reasons why uh for
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:48.160]  some reason about 20 percent of the british population i can't speak for the american population
[3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:54.480]  but from about 20 percent of the british population population really hate britain and all it stands
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:14:02.880]  for now these are white liberals they're often well educated but they really they haven't they
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:08.960]  have no real understanding or caring for history and they would obliterate history if they could
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:18.880]  they would forget about magna carta the bill of rights you know and and they would they would say
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:25.200]  that they embrace a greater freedom but in fact when they're in government what they do is subtract
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:30.720]  all the freedoms that they can possibly get their hands on from the society that they're in i don't
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:36.320]  know what you do about those 20 i think they're just uh you know what do they say the treason of
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:42.480]  aesthetics uh what why do they seem to always be in control we have the same types here uh who
[3:14:42.480 --> 3:14:47.040]  claim they want all this liberty but really they come to control like they're it's past the house
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:53.680]  here to restrict free speech and have speech laws where if something you say hurts someone's feelings
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:58.480]  you get arrested i mean how can that be happening in the united states how can that be happening
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:05.840]  in europe how can this be going on well europe has a tradition of autocracy and intolerance
[3:15:05.840 --> 3:15:12.960]  america is still the last best hope of mankind um and i hope that you will learn from our lessons
[3:15:12.960 --> 3:15:21.840]  but i mean i think in in in europe and particularly in my country uh the the the liberal point of view
[3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:31.120]  is is absolutely without question in in public office you dare not raise a question um because
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:38.480]  if you do you will be literally branded a fascist um no no matter that you sort of say well look
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:43.440]  these are the things i believe in equality democracy these are the things but that doesn't
[3:15:43.440 --> 3:15:51.280]  matter and there are certain there are certain things that are that are by words for for for
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:55.840]  liberalism if you don't endorse them then really you're a fascist so what do we do get outside the
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:00.320]  comfort zone and stop caring if they brand us and point out they are the ones behaving like
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:06.880]  fascists with the new global carbon tax i don't want to get you involved here in in the heresy
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:10.720]  i don't want to get you burned at the stake here there it is there is you're a fascist you see
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:16.960]  because you you are i i detect from your tone that you are a global warming skeptic
[3:16:17.600 --> 3:16:23.520]  denier i should be honest or is it a climate change skeptic because i think the i think the
[3:16:23.520 --> 3:16:29.840]  thing has moved on slightly from global warming now to climate change um yes well it is true
[3:16:29.840 --> 3:16:34.880]  climate changes that's one of the nature all the nature of being a sort of dynamic living
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:39.920]  planet you know i mean i don't suppose the climate's changing too much on venus right at the moment
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:47.760]  you know because a bit the day of the sun is melting um but anyway uh that would be one of the
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:58.080]  real reason why the the the the liberals i i'm only using that in the most pejorative way
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:03.760]  um there is a something else called a liberal tradition for people calling themselves liberals
[3:17:03.760 --> 3:17:08.320]  you would call yourself or i would call myself a classical liberal i want the classical real
[3:17:08.320 --> 3:17:13.120]  freedoms not their fake straightjacket and and and you're being careful not to commit
[3:17:13.120 --> 3:17:17.440]  thought crime because you some european countries do want to arrest people don't listen it's
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:21.760]  they're now teaching that summer is abnormal and some kids don't think you're supposed to
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:26.240]  have seasons like you said it's first it's global warming now it's climate change but but but go
[3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:32.880]  ahead sir no no i i mean the real reason the real reason they're getting away with it is that people
[3:17:32.880 --> 3:17:39.680]  like me and people like you have more interested things to do with our lives than to stand up and
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:45.680]  and engage in political activity um but our situation is so dire here that i'm actually seriously
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:51.680]  thinking of of standing for the british parliament of the next election unfortunately i've not lived
[3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:56.560]  my life you know in in that politically correct way the one should one's going to be a politician
[3:17:57.360 --> 3:18:04.880]  um and uh you know i i have far too many scarecrows and skeletons rather in my in my closet and i
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:14.400]  will be ripped to shreds if i do but you know the fault is ours because we were too busy too
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:20.720]  self-important and too absorbed with the wonderful and immediate things that we can do with her
[3:18:20.720 --> 3:18:28.560]  with our lives in this glorious civilization we live in to actually stop the the cockroaches from
[3:18:28.560 --> 3:18:35.040]  running and now i was about to say that we've got to climb in and remove the parasites that are now
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:41.440]  arming themselves against us oh that's right that's right i spoke to a senior civil servant about
[3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:47.920]  two years ago and i said well you know what what do you see happening you said well we will be a small
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:53.840]  part of the european union we will be ruled from brussels uh we will get rid of the monarchy and
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:19:00.560]  we will be a small and peaceful part of europe and i said well i mean didn't you take an oath of
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:05.920]  allegiance as a part of your thing to to serve the crown in parliament and things like that he
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:11.120]  said well i mean i think i think we can we all we can dispose of that into the dustbin of history
[3:19:11.120 --> 3:19:17.680]  uh i said you know in my eyes sir you're just a traitor you're just a quizzing and a traitor
[3:19:17.680 --> 3:19:22.160]  and you smiled at me and said well fortunately you can't do anything about it
[3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:28.080]  incredible arrogance i've run into similar things this is an amazing interview sir we're about to
[3:19:28.080 --> 3:19:33.120]  break and come back with another sub segment but but to continue this in fact i would like to
[3:19:33.120 --> 3:19:38.480]  get summoned to the film reclaiming the blade which really does have contained in it a great
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:42.720]  portion of the spirit of liberty and we're just honored that you're spending time with us today
[3:19:42.720 --> 3:19:48.400]  here to fight for what's left of uh the western civilization which is being pulled down under
[3:19:48.400 --> 3:19:55.280]  assault because those very ideals threaten the parasites that are now infested in our society but
[3:19:56.080 --> 3:20:00.080]  i think the sleeping giant that is those that love liberty is beginning to rise stay with us
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:06.320]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:10.880]  storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds
[3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:15.040]  could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[3:20:15.040 --> 3:20:19.600]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[3:20:19.600 --> 3:20:24.880]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:30.480]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:35.520]  family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:40.640]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:46.320]  seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at eight seven seven three
[3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:53.920]  two seven zero three six five that's eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five remember
[3:20:53.920 --> 3:20:59.520]  in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival

[3:21:06.720 --> 3:21:12.560]  spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us

[3:24:09.760 --> 3:24:14.800]  John Reese Davies legendary actor will be with us till 40 after that we're going to get the maker
[3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:19.040]  of the film reclaiming the blade almost for balance of the time sorry we're not covering
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:22.240]  michael jackson in his funeral but i think there's been enough coverage of that today
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:28.080]  but but mr. Davies it intrigues me we'll talk some in the final segment about the film reclaiming
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:33.600]  the blade about more of your political ideas because i sense that you're almost exploding with
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:37.760]  the desire to speak up and say no to what's happening are you concerned about the european
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:43.280]  union trying to force the lisbon treaty on countries that have voted it down time and time again
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:50.320]  and and and the the labor party said that they wouldn't go along with it without a vote but now
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:57.200]  they're covertly using the bureaucracy to bring uh Britannia under the yoke of europe or what are
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:02.640]  some of your other concerns that would make you run for parliament well certainly that would be one
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:10.640]  we were promised a referendum we we we we had a referendum many years ago and i think by 1976
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:21.040]  something like that um to uh uh to to enter the EU to enter the common market and a common market
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:26.880]  is what most of us want frankly it's what most europeans want but not many people other than the
[3:25:26.880 --> 3:25:36.480]  paid bureaucrats want a close political union uh you know cooperation between states is is admirable
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:43.760]  and wonderful but really i don't want to make a political statement here and and and be arrested
[3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:52.320]  and summarily uh extradited to Greece to stand up because it contravenes greek law uh we are
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:58.640]  trading our liberties at an alarming rate and the only reason that this government is still in power
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:05.760]  is because brown has been told by the EU stay there until the irish can have their third referendum
[3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:11.680]  and this time will make them will shake the pips and make it clear that they'll be bankrupt if they
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:21.440]  don't vote for an EU reunion and then of course it becomes automatic um and theoretically irreversible
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:32.400]  and brown of course will end up um getting a senior job in in the EU um it is straightforward
[3:26:32.400 --> 3:26:40.480]  political corruption it's corruption and treason at the at the highest level and of course the
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:45.360]  first thing this government did of course when they got into power was to remove the penalties
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:52.240]  for treason you can no longer hang a man for treason um oh no no no that's too that's too
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:27:00.560]  unkind to him um maybe maybe send him to prison for three years if he has to well well it is treason
[3:27:00.560 --> 3:27:07.840]  to have now Blair about to be EU head for his treason and they've got millions of surveillance
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:13.440]  cameras and secret police everywhere and they're gonna have climate cops with climate rationing
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:19.120]  and this is just a way for the government control freaks to literally enslave everybody
[3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:24.080]  and you look at the polls the brettz the french the irish none of them want this but it continues
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:29.200]  to steamroller forward uh just thank god you're speaking up and i hope any others will start speaking
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:40.560]  up there is a huge there is a huge ground swell of resentment um and it really only needs um a figure
[3:27:41.360 --> 3:27:49.360]  um for for this to to become really very unpleasant and very socially explosive and
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:55.360]  divisive very unpleasant i like the way you put that absolutely everybody worldwide wants liberty
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:28:00.400]  they don't want tyranny speaking of the blade you know that's not you see that's a sad thing
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:06.880]  that's that's the saddest thing of all not everybody wants freedom i guess you're right
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:12.960]  some people want their decisions make made for them well it seems like i want freedom so i think
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:16.960]  everybody else wants it but i guess you're right a lot of people do want to live under a nanny state
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:21.680]  control freak system but speaking of the blade as i'm sure you know in england they're trying to
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:27.040]  make you have a license now for a butcher knife like in china and so i guess for people to defend
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:31.440]  themselves some people have been using swords and knives in their own homes and when they get
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:36.160]  attacked and defend themselves the police go persecute them is that because the state wants
[3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:42.800]  a monopoly of force and doesn't want citizens defending themselves it must be something like
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:49.680]  that i mean the police are very conscious of of people taking the law into their whole own hands
[3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:54.800]  and and we understand that that you we can't do that we don't want to lynch mobs i think that
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:29:01.680]  sending yourself well yes but defending yourself um you're allowed to use reasonable force however
[3:29:01.680 --> 3:29:07.680]  if you haven't have a particularly liberal judge who's a liberal appointee or something like that
[3:29:07.680 --> 3:29:15.280]  he may well he very well decide that uh you know when you when you took that big heavy walking stick
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:22.640]  and club this loud to death with one hefty blow that you were in fact infringing his right right
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:26.160]  the fact that he had no right to be in your bedroom at two o'clock in the morning when you
[3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:31.920]  and your child were and and and wife was sleeping in the house it's got nothing to do with it you
[3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:37.200]  know you you shouldn't really have done that you should have used a more reasonable force oh yes
[3:29:37.200 --> 3:29:40.400]  when you're getting attacked on the middle of the night you're supposed to control yourself
[3:29:40.400 --> 3:29:44.480]  amazing and that's what reclaiming the blades all about we'll talk about the film in our final

[3:32:14.800 --> 3:32:19.680]  he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are always in danger of losing your
[3:32:19.680 --> 3:32:25.360]  job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business since you are the boss
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:31.920]  nobody can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning
[3:32:31.920 --> 3:32:37.680]  other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others MZ wants to

[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:33.600]  is also in burn burn reclaiming the blade and this is a two-disc special so before our guests
[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:36.400]  leave you i'm going to have the director tell you where you get a copy of it while reclaiming
[3:33:36.400 --> 3:33:42.240]  the blade.com is one place that's going to hit tv and stores uh very very soon if it hasn't already
[3:33:42.240 --> 3:33:46.800]  hit i was lucky i got this like two months ago and saw it before anybody else had and so i'm not
[3:33:46.800 --> 3:33:50.800]  up to date on where it is and where it's airing but i know it's going to be on tv or has already
[3:33:50.800 --> 3:33:55.200]  been on a bunch of tv stations so we'll so we'll find out all those details with the director
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:01.680]  daniel mcnickle here in just a moment but i'm telling you i am blown away by talking to uh you
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:07.120]  know the man who played all these great roles uh that i was uh just you know such a fan of
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:12.720]  as a kid but even modern day i love lord of the rings i'm always i'm always talking about washington
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:18.800]  dc and you know the these major capitals is mordor and the all-seeing eye of sauron looking down
[3:34:18.800 --> 3:34:24.960]  on its and uh john riz davies is of course uh gemily well i have to run all the way to isengard
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:30.720]  and i'm probably torturing him doing his lines so that's a very good representation of him here
[3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:38.240]  today but you see lord of the rings is very much about that it's very much about a challenge coming
[3:34:38.240 --> 3:34:44.800]  to your civilization that will either destroy your civilization or you must rise and stand up
[3:34:44.800 --> 3:34:50.640]  and fight for it and if you don't you'll lose your civilization and if you do you might just
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:57.920]  defeat it now we've got gemily on the air with us gemily what was it like working with uh aragorn
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:06.640]  of erithorn uh i don't know where he's he's he's the best i mean i don't know he's just about
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:12.800]  the best they were on a grand bunch assisting me in the recovery of that ring i must say they
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:18.080]  all did them they all did very well but it is essentially a dwarf story you know about the
[3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:24.320]  recovery of the ring with the help of hobbits and others yes well the ring did come from below the
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:30.480]  ground and that's the that's the realm of dwarves that's right that's right it was our goal originally
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:37.920]  i fear but you've got to be careful of the concentration of power you see power does corrupt
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:44.560]  and and and absolute power does corrupt absolutely one ring to rule them all and in the darkness
[3:35:44.560 --> 3:36:02.160]  bind them in the land of mordor where the shadows lie oh my god you know what there i really want
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:07.120]  to get you back on sometime because this has been an amazing interview you're even got more energy
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:12.800]  in person and it's just a a lot of fun because i'm a big fan of those movies as well and then
[3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:18.160]  to find out you're a lover of liberty and a patriot before we go to the director and you've
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:22.320]  been gracious to stay with us while the director's on with us we were kind of ranting during the
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:27.360]  breaks talking and you were bringing up some of the other tyrannies that europe and england
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:32.720]  are coming under that were outraging you and then have the rest of the citizenry outrage what are
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:37.600]  what are some of the other beefs that you have uh with what's happening right now in europe and
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:45.120]  england well in britain in particular uh our our chancellor who is a man of our ex chancellor who's
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:50.080]  in our prime minister is a man of extraordinary self-illusion i mean he really did believe that
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:58.800]  his activity saved the world during the banking crisis um he is confidently saying that you know
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:07.840]  he will not cut public services uh you know at a time when for instance 100 000 uh private sector
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:16.160]  jobs were lost he managed to add 30 000 public sector employees in the end you cannot spend your
[3:37:16.160 --> 3:37:25.120]  way out of debt in the end everyone in the private sector supports all the people in the public sector
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:32.480]  in the end government works for us not for us working for the government these are just
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:42.640]  inalienable truths but somehow they seem to be forgotten so easily by every damn common political
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:49.760]  jack sorry no you're right but it's a it's a vertically integrated economy and it's same
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:55.920]  in here in the united states everything's collapsing we're losing 640 plus thousand jobs a month and
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:38:02.640]  they're expanding the size of government and they're increasing all the taxes and the shops are
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:07.520]  starting to all close and the government says we're gonna hold you by your legs and like the
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:14.960]  sheriff of nottingham and shake the shillings out of your pockets i mean it's almost like they want
[3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:20.240]  us to have a revolution it's like they want to force us into confrontation well i don't think
[3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:27.200]  it's bad if there is a belief that if you give if you give if you hold circuses and give bread
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:34.080]  and just give and give and give then you will create an an electric that's that's
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:40.160]  wholly obligated to you um unfortunately in the end the buck has to stop somewhere and the only
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:46.640]  way out of it is with government will have to start printing paper you know and and i have
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:53.360]  lived in it in societies where inflation has gone to three percent four percent five percent a day
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:59.920]  imagine having ten saving to save up your life savings is ten thousand dollars it's it's a it's
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:05.920]  a good little hunk with ten that ten thousand dollars you can actually do something and in the
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:11.520]  space of one year that ten thousand dollars isn't worth enough to buy your family a meal
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:20.480]  you imagine how mad you'd be and that was Yugoslavia uh just 15 18 years ago 20 years ago
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:27.120]  i look at zimbabwe look at other i mean look in fact all this money they've spent is guaranteed
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:31.600]  to start coming back in we're already seeing inflation and mirroring areas go up even though
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:38.640]  housing is going down it's kind of a nightmare stag inflation it's starting to set in yes indeed
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:46.880]  and and the damnable thing is you see in a way spending your way out of inflation out of depression
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:56.320]  is is a theoretically interesting way of doing it um but you have to really have you have to
[3:39:56.320 --> 3:40:02.960]  really have to have growth in place over the seeds of growth in place that will will match the
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:09.280]  investment um that you're putting into things you just instead it all goes for bonuses to offshore
[3:40:09.280 --> 3:40:14.480]  banks and the carbon taxes are wet blanket on that economy the carbon tax is just a little
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:18.800]  throttle it's just it's just an extra way of taxing people that's all and i'm sorry for interrupting
[3:40:18.800 --> 3:40:24.160]  when you were getting into no no no it's matching matching actual development i guess like monorail
[3:40:24.160 --> 3:40:29.360]  trains better roads instead more and more just goes for debt servicing the debt like we are
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:33.680]  zimbabwe is everything collapses i don't know about england i was just over there a few years ago
[3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:39.440]  but we have bridges collapsing every week the roads are rotting i mean you go to stores now
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:46.480]  and then the carpets peeling up well we're now paying i think more for our to serve with our
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:51.680]  debt than we spend on defense and i've got an idea it must be rapidly approaching what we spend on
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:59.360]  i mean on on on education amazing well john it is terrifying john reese davies is our guest he
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:04.480]  doesn't need any introduction you know salah from of course uh the writers the law stark and other
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:10.720]  indiana jones films the harrison four to call a huge star uh in the lore of the rings trilogy
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:15.200]  and so many other huge films before we get in the remaining minutes with the director
[3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:20.400]  into reclaiming the blade you're just a very interesting man obviously but i mean seriously
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:24.400]  really are what are some of your other interests what else is on your mind uh what else are you
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:32.720]  working on right now um well um i i just did a little radio uh thing today um which is why
[3:41:32.720 --> 3:41:38.640]  i was a little bit late going back um but but my private passions well i have a three-year-old
[3:41:38.640 --> 3:41:45.120]  daughter who is the love of my life i'm extraordinarily happy uh at this this moment
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:53.280]  in time in my life last four four and a half years uh have been extremely happy i i i play with cars
[3:41:53.280 --> 3:41:58.720]  i have a disgraceful collection of wonderful cars that i really should sit down but it's rather
[3:41:58.720 --> 3:42:05.200]  like sort of working you know it it and i don't want to use the word mocking me but it's a sort of
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:09.600]  Sophie's choice that you have to make when you try to get rid of one i mean you can't possibly
[3:42:09.600 --> 3:42:16.080]  let that one go because well you know all that one all that so you end up keeping the ball really um
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:24.400]  but i like engineering um i i like i like getting up in the morning and getting my hands dirty
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:31.040]  um all writing or something like that um and you're also into swords you i mean you're someone
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:37.600]  of a swordsman yourself i used to be unfortunately i broke my back and my arm on a on a film set
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:45.040]  about six years ago and oh i didn't know that i i i i i i i i i i moved from being a fairly hard
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:53.760]  old man really to being an old whip um but i have to confess that even before um uh daniel's
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:59.760]  thinking i do sleep with the family i thought beside my bed um and it is sharp
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:08.880]  um uh burglars should be aware of this i i i tend to swing rather heavily um just in case we get
[3:43:08.880 --> 3:43:15.760]  a piece of that incredible absolutely incredible so well i didn't know you'd broken your back in
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:23.680]  your arm what film was that oh it's a piece of rubbish really called um uh the thumb musketeer
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:31.600]  uh but it had some nice people to do to michael yorkan the great deputy and uh a few others
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:36.320]  but you're doing better now i mean you certainly sound good i am good if it wasn't for that
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:42.960]  Richard back of mine i would be in extraordinary good health um and every time i felt feeling
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:48.560]  for me for me i suddenly felt thinking you know you could be a quadriplegic or you could be dead
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:54.080]  uh think about that old man and yes suddenly my aches and pains don't seem to matter
[3:43:54.800 --> 3:44:03.280]  incredible um i live on the isle of man you live on the isle of man i i i yes i have a place here
[3:44:03.280 --> 3:44:09.360]  i've had a place here for about 20 odd years more than 22 years i think it's um it has been
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:18.960]  described as 70 000 alcoholics clinging to a rock in the irish but it is a little bit better than that
[3:44:18.960 --> 3:44:25.840]  oh my god all right let's uh if you're a motorbike man it is it is it is heaven itself it is valhalla
[3:44:25.840 --> 3:44:33.920]  it is where where the greatest street racing or it takes place valhalla yeah rick linklater was
[3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:37.120]  over there making a movie about orson welles he told me it was really neat place i want to visit
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:42.400]  at some time john reis davies is our guest let's go to the director reclaimingtheblade.com
[3:44:42.400 --> 3:44:49.280]  and here is the film they actually gave me some uh free copies to to give out his prizes uh so i
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:55.120]  will just say this that at the end of the show i am going to give you an email address and the first
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:45:02.720]  10 emails that come in asking for one with your address you get reclaiming the blade uh and i i
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:07.360]  guess we should spend a few minutes with the director himself uh daniel mcnickle talking about
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:12.880]  what is in this great film that got v go in it and you got john and you got so many other of the
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:17.600]  sword master the top guy in hollywood who trained all the folks for star wars and so many other
[3:45:17.600 --> 3:45:23.520]  films i mean this is a who's who but it's also pro self-defense pro liberty what a message
[3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:31.360]  wow what a conversation you guys have been having i uh i feel unworthy to chime in uh
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:38.720]  you've always got great guests so um and uh john's absolutely one of them um but yeah the the film
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:44.480]  is is out now it's it's available uh going to be soon be available at barns and obel so you can
[3:45:44.480 --> 3:45:49.440]  kind of walk in the store and pick those up and hastings a couple other brick and mortar type
[3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:54.960]  stores and of course it's on our website and uh apple itunes is going to soon have it as well
[3:45:54.960 --> 3:46:01.440]  for digital downloads and all that good stuff but um but no it was a lot of fun to make and and um you
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:07.520]  know working with people like jonary stavey's legendary actors of uh of the screen and stage
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:14.560]  it's just i'm honored you know to uh to to have had the opportunity to work with uh these guys
[3:46:14.560 --> 3:46:19.200]  and just bring this story out there well i know you've made some other you know uh pretty big films
[3:46:19.200 --> 3:46:24.240]  but i mean even for a huge director or somebody's that i had a you know a bunch of big films it's
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:29.840]  hard to get all these actors and all these i've done nothing uh it's so far this is this is uh
[3:46:29.840 --> 3:46:35.520]  this is my first film uh but uh but i've not seen you've been involved in you know in quite a
[3:46:35.520 --> 3:46:39.440]  big production i guess this is your first film that you're sure so so so that's my question
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:46.080]  how did you get all these great people together well you know it starts one at a time and um
[3:46:46.080 --> 3:46:51.120]  you know it it always helps to have somebody like like jonary stavey's early on uh believing in the
[3:46:51.120 --> 3:46:57.920]  script and and uh his name is is is you know not only legendary among the fans but legendary among
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:03.280]  other actors and and filmmakers so you know having having somebody like him on board uh that's right
[3:47:03.280 --> 3:47:08.320]  i should add it's narrated by jonary stavey's right and he's also in the film and and then
[3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:13.440]  there's a extra dvd that comes with it correct yeah yeah actually that's where our interview with
[3:47:13.440 --> 3:47:20.000]  with john is and and of course he narrates the film so he's uh performing and the other fellows
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:25.760]  vego and carl urban and bob anderson who was dark vader we did interviews with them of course so
[3:47:25.760 --> 3:47:32.160]  john vader and by the way i promise you the lightsabers are on the way so hey you don't have to
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:35.840]  play me with loot i'm just happy to get the lightsabers there for battles with my kids
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:39.680]  i do have five for your kids but i know the guys they'll probably love them and they're just a
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:44.560]  lot of fun so i tell you my children murder me every day with those lightsabers so i'll be glad
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:50.240]  to get some more going back to jonary stavey's you know i should have made that point early on
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:55.360]  because i was aware of it you were instrumental in in getting this made and we're really the
[3:47:55.360 --> 3:48:01.040]  first big name to come on board uh was that because you're just so into the history of the
[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:08.320]  blade and and and reclaiming it i thought it was a very interesting idea i was uh i
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:16.240]  i i'm quite well read and it's not often that i read a script that actually informs me so much
[3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:23.680]  about areas that i had no idea existed um and and i thought that the i thought it was really
[3:48:25.040 --> 3:48:31.600]  really deserving of attention and i'm glad that i was in some very slight way um
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:39.120]  um useful in in in getting the thing made and put together but please do not overestimate
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:46.960]  my powers or or or contribution this is daniel's project it was well thought well saw a resource
[3:48:48.320 --> 3:48:54.640]  and well serviced he's on a grand job and it's a it's an interesting it's an interesting subject
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:49:01.200]  and no matter how well you know it um there will be there'll be detail and information there
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:07.920]  that makes you go wow i never understood that now that whole area is now illuminated for me
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:13.120]  i'm gonna agree with you that that that i'm somewhat well read about history just because it's
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:18.320]  interesting and about chivalry and and you know different wars that happen in the middle ages
[3:49:18.320 --> 3:49:23.280]  and then even in some of the more modern wars and i learned a lot watching the film and of course
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:28.400]  the extras that are in it so folks should go to reclaimingtheblade.com and get the film with
[3:49:28.400 --> 3:49:34.640]  the extras reclaiming the blade with john risa davies featuring a vego mortison and many many
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:41.440]  others bob anderson and carl urban but but in closing mr davies i hope that we can sometime
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:45.840]  off in the future have you back on we appreciate you giving us your precious time i'm gonna come
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:50.800]  back in the final segment and talk with the director about the film a little bit more
[3:49:50.800 --> 3:49:59.920]  uh but uh i wanted to ask you specifically about kind of the art type of mordor that
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:05.280]  wants this global domination this total control over middle earth have in your research have you
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.160]  ever studied the globalist in the new world order and this whole technocratic world government
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:19.040]  that's being set up and if so what's your view on that well uh yes indeed if if all our princes
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:24.960]  were true philosophers what a wonderful world it would be uh but since they're not since they're
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:33.280]  nasty venal and corrupt most of them uh and some are just misguided idealists how to do the best
[3:50:33.280 --> 3:50:42.800]  thing and making a terrible hash of the whole thing uh in the end liberty is down to individuals
[3:50:42.800 --> 3:50:50.160]  and and and groups of individuals sometimes it can be expressed as a nation the united states is
[3:50:50.160 --> 3:50:57.840]  still the most liberally um and i mean that in the finest way it is still the country with with
[3:50:57.840 --> 3:51:05.200]  the greatest level of of liberty and and and are you fed up with all the side effects of

[3:54:03.760 --> 3:54:07.600]  have power they want us to feel like we can't control our destiny but i'm here to tell people
[3:54:07.600 --> 3:54:11.200]  if they'll just i mean look at you like you said you've been in a few films worked on some films
[3:54:11.200 --> 3:54:16.080]  but this was your first big film your first film period and you went out and got some of the biggest
[3:54:16.080 --> 3:54:22.400]  names out there and i've seen the film it's it you know just shot with incredible cinematography
[3:54:22.400 --> 3:54:28.880]  it's very diverse film and you just did such a great job another testament to simply taking
[3:54:28.880 --> 3:54:33.920]  action instead of talking about it getting it done so your comments on that well you know there's
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:38.640]  there's an old slogan that the marines used to say when i was growing up as a kid it was part
[3:54:38.640 --> 3:54:44.160]  of their advertising and it said we're looking for a few good men and honestly i think the marines
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:50.480]  today are are taking whatever they they're kind of going getting their mitts on anything they can
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:57.920]  get uh you know never mind the few good men but but the expression or the slogan is is to me uh very
[3:54:57.920 --> 3:55:02.880]  interesting you know we're looking for a few good men and interestingly in in that ad campaign they
[3:55:02.880 --> 3:55:08.640]  used the sword you know i think in the pageantry in the ceremony of the marines they actually use
[3:55:08.640 --> 3:55:14.160]  uh the sword well the establishment knows they know the archetype they know what it's really
[3:55:14.160 --> 3:55:19.040]  about to be alive and they manipulate that for their own aim we have to forget about
[3:55:19.600 --> 3:55:24.640]  marocco obama george bush and michael jackson these fake demonic weak things they project on
[3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:29.200]  our minds and we've got to really get back to what it's all about standing for something
[3:55:29.200 --> 3:55:33.520]  and putting your life on the line yeah the right path is is you know it's a zombies you know we're
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:40.080]  looking for men of honor men of bravery men are shivery and ultimately men of truth well i hope
[3:55:40.080 --> 3:55:44.880]  people will go and get the film and i want to thank you for getting mr davies on the show you
[3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:49.200]  said you were gonna do it set him up for us and turns out he's everything you said more and i'd
