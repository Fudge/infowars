[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:38.080]  Texas Alex Jones the Christian science monitor came out and said is Obama an
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.720]  imperial president is he becoming a dictator and of course that is stating
[00:43.720 --> 00:48.840]  the obvious in the form of a question and then they go on to say well but the
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.440]  Democrats want him to push even more so that makes it kind of okay it's what
[00:54.440 --> 01:01.120]  he's got to do a man's got to do what a man's got to do and then senator Ted
[01:01.120 --> 01:08.320]  Cruz went on Face the Nation and it's the job of the squirrely reporter on
[01:08.320 --> 01:16.280]  there Emperor Palpatine that was interviewing Ted Cruz to act like it's
[01:16.280 --> 01:26.520]  bizarre and weird to criticize Obama and then it's Ted Cruz who's hurting the
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.000]  economy because he shut the government down for a couple days trying to have a
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  debate about the fact that we're gonna go completely bankrupt but remember
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.080]  Obama came out and said oh no raising with that ceiling does not raise the
[01:37.080 --> 01:41.840]  debt that's a quote by the way and if you have your doctor you can keep your
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.880]  doctor but it got worse you wonder why no one in the controlled media will
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.320]  criticize Obama that is a dictator for all intents and purposes on a scale of
[01:52.320 --> 01:57.120]  one to ten he's becoming a seven and they pretty much always go to a ten from
[01:57.120 --> 02:01.720]  that point I think that's what I'm trying to get out here is the bottom has
[02:01.720 --> 02:07.480]  fallen out and people are about to find out what dictatorship means it means
[02:07.480 --> 02:10.680]  special interests that run the government literally can do anything they
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.080]  want and they will they will historically and stability will go
[02:15.080 --> 02:18.440]  completely out the window even if you don't care about morality or liberty or
[02:18.440 --> 02:21.800]  freedom or you think the general public's dumb and doesn't deserve it hey
[02:21.800 --> 02:25.920]  it doesn't matter those checks and balances protect everybody and every
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.600]  time you end up getting a tyranny stuff gets real nasty real quick even for the
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.880]  people that serve the system they tend to go in and out of favor like changing
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.960]  styles and fads and purges become basically like holiday events so
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.440]  Christian science monitor says his Barack Obama an imperial president
[02:44.440 --> 02:48.920]  president Obama's use of executive action to get around congressional gridlock
[02:48.920 --> 02:54.440]  is unparalleled in modern times some scholars say some scholars say no it's
[02:54.440 --> 02:58.600]  it's unparalleled that like it's some academic thing they're discussing but
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.760]  the article continues liberal activists they're not liberals they're
[03:04.760 --> 03:09.200]  authoritarians but members of the authoritarian criminal group taking over
[03:09.200 --> 03:12.200]  that's what it should say that was being honest but members of the criminal
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.280]  group posing as liberals taking over says that the Fuhrer is not doing enough
[03:16.280 --> 03:20.680]  that that should be translated but is Barack Obama an imperial president
[03:20.680 --> 03:26.400]  again did Hitler have a small mustache under his nose president Obama's use of
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.040]  executive action to get around congressional gridlock see how that spins
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.600]  it oh it's getting around the problems is unparalleled in modern times some
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.960]  scholars say but to liberal activists he's not going far enough should read
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.440]  president Obama cements the presidency is a dictatorial position his use of
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.160]  executive actions across the board is completing America's journey into total
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.440]  tyranny and many of his supporters want him to seize full control and arrest
[03:56.440 --> 04:00.800]  their political enemies that should be the headline and of course that is now
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.360]  happening with the next to Susan governor McDonald and others and I saw
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.520]  a sniveling establishment publications making fun of me over the weekend that I
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.120]  dared point out that the stuff that the the next to Susan others are alleged to
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.360]  have done is the equivalent of having a crooked toenail while the judge sitting
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.800]  over you Eric Holder is chopping up children with a meat cleaver I mean
[04:25.800 --> 04:29.520]  these people cannot sit in judgment they are frauds clearly selectively
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.040]  enforcing even if they're guilty which it looks like they're not they both led
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.720]  not guilty and you're gonna see more of this you're gonna see a lot more of this

[04:48.000 --> 04:51.840]  censored clip you wonder why no media will cover the dictatorship situation
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.480]  Ted Cruz talked about it on Face the Nation and it got censored but not
[04:56.480 --> 05:02.200]  before it streamed out on the web the facts are in the studies are legion
[05:02.200 --> 05:06.360]  sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are

[08:58.600 --> 09:04.680]  stabilization of Fukushima that just illustrates how serious the situation is
[09:04.680 --> 09:12.520]  and then we have Mr. O'Keefe joining us from Project Veritas they are amongst the
[09:12.520 --> 09:16.160]  people being subpoenaed and basically prepared to be indicted looks like to me
[09:16.160 --> 09:25.400]  by the gangster that runs New York State Mr. Cuomo who said last week gun owners
[09:25.400 --> 09:30.000]  and pro-lifers are quote not welcome in New York we don't have those type of
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.080]  people here an open tyrant bully saying you know we want your tax money but keep
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.280]  your mouth shut they only make announcements like that before open
[09:39.280 --> 09:45.800]  persecution he is a bully thug and must be met head on it's like Bloomberg is
[09:45.800 --> 09:51.040]  saying it'll be national suicide if we don't have open borders and that
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.640]  America's immigration is insane we have the most open borders get ready for this
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.400]  in the world according to every study that's out there look it up it is easier
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.200]  to get into the United States and look it wouldn't be an issue if the immigrants
[10:04.200 --> 10:08.120]  came here and weren't organized into socialist brigades to vote for gun
[10:08.120 --> 10:13.880]  control and socialism and total tyranny and Senator Sessions is pointing out
[10:13.880 --> 10:20.000]  studies in an article today that drives down wages no kidding that's why we've
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.840]  got the working class now on average on food stamps while working two jobs just
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.240]  where the government wants you working 12 hours a day and having to be on food
[10:29.240 --> 10:35.880]  stamps and your health prices double tripling quadrupling and now you've
[10:35.880 --> 10:39.200]  got to go out and get it you can't just go to the hospital the emergency room
[10:39.200 --> 10:42.560]  when you're in emergency like you could before I mean this is incredible this is
[10:42.560 --> 10:45.600]  the death of this country and watch they're probably gonna pass the end of
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.400]  the borders Obama's already doing it with executive action and just remember
[10:50.400 --> 10:53.240]  as things get worse and worse and you're gonna look up in 10 years we're gonna
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.080]  look like Mexico City there's gonna be nowhere to run and the elite are all
[10:57.080 --> 11:01.400]  gonna be living off in Switzerland who has total control over their borders just
[11:01.400 --> 11:09.320]  remember what you asked for because you know Elysium you know Matt Damon I mean
[11:09.320 --> 11:12.760]  it's a mean if you don't let the 50 billion people onto the space station
[11:12.760 --> 11:18.760]  that can hold a hundred thousand you know if you don't let 500 people in the
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.840]  lifeboat that holds 20 I mean we've got to sink the whole boat we don't want to
[11:23.840 --> 11:27.040]  actually try to build up the third world no no no let's keep them in squalor and
[11:27.040 --> 11:31.600]  then export the poverty the corruption the tyranny here and that's what's
[11:31.600 --> 11:38.320]  happening it's economic weapon of warfare and a cultural weapon and in a
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.760]  world where people love fads and the surface and feeling like their winners
[11:42.760 --> 11:50.800]  when they're actually losers this will be the final blow to the ongoing
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.480]  degradation of this country I mean we're not even a nation we're part of the
[11:54.480 --> 12:02.480]  North American Union with wide open borders and a president that will
[12:02.480 --> 12:07.480]  legalize by fiat whoever he wants I mean that is simply sensational hey maybe I
[12:07.480 --> 12:10.120]  can run to Venezuela oh I'm sorry financial times of London
[12:10.120 --> 12:15.760]  Venezuela grapples with 56% inflation oh it's great to be under a communist
[12:15.760 --> 12:21.120]  system oh communism doesn't exist I'm sorry socialists even though they say
[12:21.120 --> 12:27.640]  they're communist that's the kind of news I've got here but first off let me
[12:27.640 --> 12:36.200]  just go over some of the news that is obviously coming up they're moving in
[12:36.200 --> 12:43.640]  Europe to ban cars from entire regions and saying it's under a gender 21 and a
[12:43.640 --> 12:53.600]  UN treaty and that is mainstream news from CNBC many children unable to be
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.400]  included in parents Obamacare family plans after they were kicked off so see
[12:57.400 --> 13:02.760]  not only does it not cover pre-existing conditions it kicks you off when you have
[13:02.760 --> 13:06.640]  health care and of course less than a third of people in California have
[13:06.640 --> 13:09.880]  actually gotten back on their plans that were kicked off that was all just more
[13:09.880 --> 13:17.200]  lies more fake hope by Obama so that no political action can form these are
[13:17.200 --> 13:24.440]  basic military tactics folks when the NDAA in 2011 the National Defense
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.360]  Authorization Act had the endopathy common Tata Senate had open setups for
[13:29.360 --> 13:33.800]  quote civilian inmate labor camps these are real terms search them you'll be on
[13:33.800 --> 13:42.160]  the army dot mill it's not a game here and if you looked at the NDAA the
[13:42.160 --> 13:45.320]  National Defense Authorization Act it was a lot of opposition to it so Obama
[13:45.320 --> 13:48.880]  said hey don't worry about that I'm not gonna sign it and even criticize
[13:48.880 --> 13:53.120]  senator Dodd saying how dare you have these provisions got God actually mad
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.600]  got up and huffed and puffed on the floor the Senate floor and I played the
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.840]  clip here and said how dare you here is the letter from you Obama three months
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.560]  ago asking me to keep this confidential got to find that clip and play it again
[14:07.560 --> 14:13.000]  but so amazing that you actually wrote these provisions you a constitutional
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.280]  lawyer and then you blame me when I have been part of some lee loyal and then you
[14:19.280 --> 14:25.080]  blame me that's how evil these people are ladies and gentlemen and then Obama
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.240]  said well I'm still not gonna sign it so it wouldn't have opposition so it would
[14:28.240 --> 14:35.880]  go to his desk and he signed it on the last day of 2011 in the evening of
[14:35.880 --> 14:42.320]  December 31st that's how the Federal Reserve Act 100 years ago got passed as
[14:42.320 --> 14:48.360]  well by three senators this is how they do this stuff in the dead of night and
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.400]  that's what they do and all these are the fronts oh I'm gonna get you that free
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.120]  healthcare oh I'm sorry it kicked you off your plan and doubled your price I'm
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.640]  gonna I'm gonna be a dictator I'm gonna fix that people like all right be a
[14:59.640 --> 15:04.480]  dictator get it done yeah it's those Republicans in the in the house they
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.200]  won't just let it work right that's why it happened they've got a pass bill
[15:09.200 --> 15:15.360]  folks fully in Obama's hands and then this leads me to the big issue before I
[15:15.360 --> 15:20.800]  get into all the other news this really is a giant mega issue this is so
[15:20.800 --> 15:26.160]  incredible just to see it all out in the open here's the Associated Press
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.680]  just they're just nonchalantly reporting this like it's completely normal and
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.840]  kosher and okay White House warns Obama could go around Congress on our
[15:34.840 --> 15:40.040]  sovereignty and our borders bringing in groups that will then be given
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.680]  driver's license to vote so you guessed it use the voting as the bill of rights
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.800]  isn't there to protect us anymore it was the referee to literally enslave
[15:48.800 --> 15:55.920]  everyone this this is the breaking of the public by design only a fool in the
[15:55.920 --> 15:58.800]  establishment want to get rid of checks and balances here's another one
[15:58.800 --> 16:08.520]  Obama to assert unilateral agenda isn't that a nice way of saying it in the
[16:08.520 --> 16:13.480]  Washington Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal they've all got the
[16:13.480 --> 16:16.400]  same headlines it's the Wall Street Journal Obama to assert unilateral
[16:16.400 --> 16:21.640]  agenda present to seek to you state of the union address to shift showering
[16:21.640 --> 16:27.120]  view of leadership yeah con him one more time lie to him one more time the
[16:27.120 --> 16:31.320]  plans almost in place here's Bloomberg Obama's plan to use executive action
[16:31.320 --> 16:37.040]  triggers criticism oh my gosh how evil that Mitch McConnell than others would
[16:37.040 --> 16:42.840]  dare criticize the year of action boy does that sound fascist and here's the
[16:42.840 --> 16:48.600]  Christian Science Monitor you read this and and the whole article basically in
[16:48.600 --> 16:53.000]  a smarmy way endorses it and legitimizes it and here's the key point
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.560]  we've gotten to when he starts to act as an open dictator and there's no real
[16:58.560 --> 17:02.880]  criticism and senator Ted Cruz gets censored when he's on face the nation
[17:02.880 --> 17:06.800]  but they still streamed it out live but then when they aired it they they cut
[17:06.800 --> 17:12.440]  it it's delayed by an hour even more on the west coast so Cruz was able to get
[17:12.440 --> 17:16.080]  the raw feed he's smart enough to have a staffer's there he got it and they cut

[17:46.360 --> 17:49.800]  say hey we're going bankrupt maybe we should debate increasing and spending

[19:12.560 --> 19:16.800]  undocumented immigrants in this country the young South Korean man yelled as
[19:16.800 --> 19:20.520]  president Obama during a speech on immigration reform last November in
[19:20.520 --> 19:24.640]  San Francisco waving away security guards mr. Obama turned to address mr. Hong
[19:24.640 --> 19:31.080]  himself undocumented actually I don't the president said and that's why we're
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.560]  there remember how he kept saying for years I'm sorry I can't fix everything
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.560]  if I was a dictator I could remember that and then now it's like oh they begged

[25:04.000 --> 25:09.600]  the felony well at the same time arresting Dinesh to Suza even if he's
[25:09.600 --> 25:18.520]  guilty and he's pled not guilty for doing something literally one ten thousandth
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.360]  Obama has raised hundreds of millions illegally openly on record and not gotten
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.640]  in trouble and then Dinesh to Suza gives $20,000 to a good friend running for
[25:28.640 --> 25:34.080]  the Senate and does it through bundling something Democrats do openly I mean the
[25:34.080 --> 25:44.120]  project Veritas has endless videos endless videos and he's coming on in the
[25:44.120 --> 25:49.200]  third hour today with new ones with the blue state project that's trying to turn
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.000]  Texas into a socialist stronghold and they get in there in these meetings and
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.680]  openly talk about crimes they're committing an election fraud and getting
[25:57.680 --> 26:03.360]  illegals to vote and getting government payoffs and no one gets in trouble no one
[26:03.360 --> 26:08.440]  gets in trouble and then they go out and they selectively enforce and then Ted
[26:08.440 --> 26:18.680]  Cruz the senator goes on face the nation and the job of the face the nation host
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.640]  Bob Schaefer is a sitter and like a con artist laugh and act like Cruz is
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.560]  ridiculous and that he Schaefer has the moral authority when he's saying outrageous
[26:28.560 --> 26:33.200]  things like how dare you say we shouldn't raise the debt again raising the
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.560]  debt doesn't raise the debt you're the bad one that said Obamacare was a bad
[26:37.560 --> 26:46.160]  deal boy are you discredited this is the tactic oh look at Ted Cruz look at look
[26:46.160 --> 26:49.960]  at Muhammad Ali and the thriller in Manila when he won he's discredited he
[26:49.960 --> 26:56.320]  won it'd be like whoever wins the Super Bowl coming up saying oh they're
[26:56.320 --> 26:59.760]  discredited they won the Super Bowl everything he said about it was true
[26:59.760 --> 27:07.240]  I mean they play these games where these mental midgets because you got the
[27:07.240 --> 27:09.640]  general public doesn't even watch the news doesn't even know what planet they're
[27:09.640 --> 27:13.120]  on literally has no idea up from down just believes everything they're told
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.880]  brain damage watching television all day drooling acting trendy then you've got
[27:17.880 --> 27:22.200]  the kind of news outlet type people that think their newshounds and think they
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.560]  know how things work Democrat types they watch face the nation and sit there in
[27:27.560 --> 27:32.800]  their couches laughing with Bob Schaefer and actually haha he said Obamacare was
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.320]  bad keeping the whole con going when we all know Obamacare is wonderful well
[27:38.320 --> 27:44.600]  the story is up on info wars.com very important I had the guys post the
[27:44.600 --> 27:48.720]  newsbusters video it's also up on drudgerport.com CBS caught censoring
[27:48.720 --> 27:56.480]  Ted Cruz over Obama's abuse of power and the actual newsbusters headline is
[27:56.480 --> 28:00.720]  face the nation edits out Senator Cruz condemning Obama's abuse of power and
[28:00.720 --> 28:05.040]  you can see both the edited clip the unedited clip they streamed the real
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.800]  clip but then aired later the edited one and edited this out because no one's
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.680]  allowed to talk about how Obama is basically becoming a dictator here it is
[28:13.680 --> 28:19.560]  well look my focus is on the challenges facing this country right now it's on
[28:19.560 --> 28:23.800]  the Senate my focus for example is on the abuse of power from the president
[28:23.800 --> 28:28.840]  let's take something like the IRS scandal so do I take that as a yes or a
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.920]  no or still well what you can take that as is that my focus is standing and
[28:34.920 --> 28:38.400]  fighting right now in the Senate to bring back jobs and economic growth
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.280]  economic growth is my number one priority and let me tell you something
[28:42.280 --> 28:46.840]  that deeply concerns me it's the abuse of power from this administration we've
[28:46.840 --> 28:52.280]  seen multiple filmmakers prosecuted and the government's gone after them what
[28:52.280 --> 28:57.000]  whether it was the poor fellow that did the film that the president blamed
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.760]  Benghazi and the terrorist attack on turned out that wasn't the reason for
[29:00.760 --> 29:04.320]  the attack but the administration went and put that poor fellow in jail on
[29:04.320 --> 29:09.200]  unrelated charges or just this week it's been broken that Dinesh de Souza who
[29:09.200 --> 29:13.120]  did a very big movie criticizing the president is now being prosecuted by
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.160]  this administration senator can you imagine the reaction if the Bush
[29:17.160 --> 29:21.520]  administration had went gone and prosecuted Michael Moore and Alec
[29:21.520 --> 29:25.000]  Baldwin and Sean I would have said against that trouble everyone that this
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.400]  administration yes uses government power and the IRS in particular to target
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.760]  their enemies and and you're talking in a few minutes to Chuck Schumer we're

[34:19.720 --> 34:25.640]  system and skim off the top because the skim off of a healthy somewhat free
[34:25.640 --> 34:34.880]  system is hundreds of times thicker than all the cream that is in a tyranny but
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.720]  they don't care they want the full control and they will wreck everything to
[34:38.720 --> 34:48.160]  get it and they hate anyone who is not controlled by them I mean I start
[34:48.160 --> 34:53.640]  thinking about the lies Obama gets away with and then you wonder why he's able
[34:53.640 --> 35:01.440]  to do that it's because no one in the dinosaur media will report on the fact
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.640]  that he's acting as a dictator or if they do they say well there's been some
[35:05.640 --> 35:08.840]  gridlock and the president's acting unilaterally but he's not doing enough
[35:08.840 --> 35:14.800]  giving them cover and that's what they're there for to create a false reality to
[35:14.800 --> 35:24.000]  insert us into a three-dimensional fraud where they laugh at Ted Cruz during a
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.960]  full interview I was watching it this morning and say you know you're the guy
[35:27.960 --> 35:31.080]  that criticized Obamacare you're the guy that you know tried to shut down the
[35:31.080 --> 35:34.160]  government tried to shut down the government they simply said we've got
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.880]  to make some cuts across the board defense you name it as Senator Paul said
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.920]  or this country is going under in fact it's already too late and I think that's
[35:44.920 --> 35:49.560]  the attitude of the establishment who's directed us to this point is just go all
[35:49.560 --> 35:51.760]  the way
[35:52.960 --> 35:59.680]  and they're going to act as the saviors again while all of this implodes and
[35:59.680 --> 36:03.320]  I'm not trying to be negative here this is just the facts and the more we can
[36:03.320 --> 36:08.760]  discuss the facts the better but I want to play the censored Ted Cruz comments
[36:08.760 --> 36:13.200]  again because it's only a minute and a half long this was censored by CBS but
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.120]  they did stream it as the interview happened on the web but aired it on
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.200]  television later an hour later edited and then hours after that on the West
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.560]  Coast edited more and I've seen this many times where I'll go on some national
[36:28.560 --> 36:32.720]  show live and airs on the East Coast in the Midwest central and then it doesn't
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.240]  air or I'm cut out when by the time it hits the West Coast and that's why the
[36:37.240 --> 36:42.360]  West Coast is in its own world of Justin Bieber and La La Land but here is the
[36:42.360 --> 36:48.920]  censored clip that says it all well look my focus is on the challenges facing
[36:48.920 --> 36:53.240]  this country right now it's on the Senate my focus for example is on the abuse of
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.880]  power from the president let's take something like the IRS scandal so do I
[36:57.880 --> 37:03.760]  take that as a yes or a no or still well what you can take that as is that my
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.200]  focus is standing and fighting right now in the Senate to bring back jobs and
[37:08.200 --> 37:12.280]  economic growth economic growth is my number one priority and let me tell
[37:12.280 --> 37:16.440]  you something that deeply concerns me it's the abuse of power from this
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.360]  administration we've seen multiple filmmakers prosecuted and the
[37:21.360 --> 37:25.880]  government's gone after them what whether it was the poor fellow that did
[37:25.880 --> 37:29.840]  the film that the president blamed Benghazi and the terrorist attack on
[37:29.840 --> 37:33.120]  turned out that wasn't the reason for the attack but the administration went
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.080]  and put that poor fellow in jail on unrelated charges or just this week
[37:37.080 --> 37:41.440]  it's been broken that Dinesh DeSousa who did a very big movie criticizing the
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.400]  president is now being prosecuted by this administration senator can you
[37:45.400 --> 37:50.160]  imagine the reaction if the Bush administration had went gone and
[37:50.160 --> 37:54.080]  prosecuted Michael Moore and Alec Baldwin and Sean Penn senator it should
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.240]  trouble everyone that this administration uses government power and the IRS in
[37:59.240 --> 38:03.360]  particular to target their enemies and and you're talking in a few minutes to
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.400]  Chuck Schumer we're going to leave this for another day thank you so much for
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.080]  joining us and we'll talk to you again we'll be back in a minute thank you Bob
[38:13.800 --> 38:18.280]  there there's no doubt I love how he just talks over him of course so what did
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.680]  Schaefer do he just edited it out for broadcast it doesn't matter Schaefer
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.040]  you're dwindling audience he's like you're dwindling life force so I hope
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.160]  your sellout to the establishment has been worth it because you will always
[38:30.160 --> 38:38.040]  be on the side of the traders and the big issue here is that I told former
[38:38.040 --> 38:42.880]  congressman Bob Barr who's set to get back in the Congress last Thursday six
[38:42.880 --> 38:47.040]  hours before the Dinesh DeSousa news broke I said I think they're gonna start
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.160]  purging people and using this Justice Department to do it I mean why not they've
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.280]  gotten away with everything Obama is now saying he's a dictator basically I mean
[38:57.280 --> 39:02.880]  what do you think the next step is folks this goes in progression so we know the
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.880]  next level and the establishment is getting all this ready because they are
[39:08.880 --> 39:15.360]  preparing to absolutely implode the currencies start huge wars you name it
[39:15.360 --> 39:21.040]  there are times in histories where all Hades breaks loose and across the board
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.920]  historians political scientists are saying this is one of those times but
[39:25.920 --> 39:30.480]  everyone's so scared that they're creeping around just like with Hitler or
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.200]  Lenin or Stalin or Mao and not opposing these people up front and they're
[39:35.200 --> 39:39.240]  going to take over and they're going to take your bank accounts and they're
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.280]  going to take your pension funds and they're going to make wealthy people be
[39:43.280 --> 39:50.120]  folks that make the equivalent $20,000 a year you're going to be poor when
[39:50.120 --> 39:55.280]  they're done with you that's the plan that's very very frustrating I want to
[39:55.280 --> 40:00.560]  play the trailer for Dinesh DeSousa's America that they've emergency released
[40:00.560 --> 40:06.000]  you know I ended up releasing the Obama deception a week early because the FBI
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.080]  showed up here asking about it I said what is this in relation to well we're
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.440]  just asking about it and I mean that shows you how they're scared of
[40:16.440 --> 40:22.000]  resistance they're scared of Ted Cruz going on TV and saying why did you
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.480]  arrest for a year on trumped-up charges the guy that made the Mohammed film to
[40:27.480 --> 40:32.640]  try to blame him for Benghazi and nothing to do with it why why have you
[40:32.640 --> 40:38.160]  arrested Dinesh DeSousa I mean here's the deal let's say Dinesh DeSousa went
[40:38.160 --> 40:42.200]  out and got five friends to give you know the maximum couple thousand dollars
[40:42.200 --> 40:46.480]  or whatever and then he gave his maximum amount the maximum there was like 5,000
[40:46.480 --> 40:53.720]  you should be 3,000 and it turns out they've been investigating him for a
[40:53.720 --> 40:59.840]  year and everybody should be wow this looks like a witch hunt we need to
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.960]  investigate this this you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry there's
[41:03.960 --> 41:07.240]  maximums in law folks if you have a corrupt attorney general with Solandra
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.880]  or Salindra and all the other scams and Fast and Furious and Benghazi and the
[41:11.880 --> 41:16.920]  list goes on and on and the NSA and all the incredible campaign finance fraud
[41:16.920 --> 41:23.440]  the likes of which the world's never seen Obama I guess can pardon himself
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.600]  later or pardon others when he leaves office but the Justice Department will
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.280]  not investigate him the Republican blue blood leadership is part of the same
[41:30.280 --> 41:33.960]  trader group and so they're not going to go after Obama when he leaves they'll
[41:33.960 --> 41:39.880]  fight a rearguard action for him but you look at a third of Obama's money coming
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.400]  from foreign donors openly and him funding foreign fundraisers with
[41:43.400 --> 41:50.160]  foreigners giving checks and putting but bags of cash in buckets on TV they
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.440]  don't even hide it and then Dinesh D'Souza one of his best friends he went
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.560]  to college with and edited a newspaper with that college he gives her $20,000
[41:58.560 --> 42:05.760]  and I mean on its face if Michael Moore who I don't like would have been
[42:05.760 --> 42:10.280]  indicted and by the way he gives money the Democrats that should be looked at
[42:10.280 --> 42:14.040]  not to indict him but just to guarantee others bundling going on with him as
[42:14.040 --> 42:16.200]  well and the guy's got six armed bodyguards we doesn't want you to own
[42:16.200 --> 42:20.200]  guns I mean he's a hypocrite he's not a liberal folks he's a gangster who wants
[42:20.200 --> 42:23.400]  his slaves disarmed he's a fellow traveler these guys sit around as
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.280]  gangsters I've been around them I know folks that are around them I've been at
[42:27.280 --> 42:31.240]  the highest levels of corporate meetings Hollywood meetings that I've fallen
[42:31.240 --> 42:37.360]  into over the years all part of my quest I always just fall into this stuff and
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.200]  get a chance to see things other people haven't seen they're gangsters they're
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.360]  not liberals they're not conservatives they're thug crooks Michael Moore is a
[42:46.360 --> 42:51.080]  crook he wants organized government to take my guns he wants to disarm me
[42:51.080 --> 42:56.160]  that's criminal robbery of my rights you know it came out of yet all those
[42:56.160 --> 43:00.360]  stocks and Halliburton and defense companies and he knew it while he's
[43:00.360 --> 43:05.000]  criticizing the wars he's a complete hypocrite
[43:05.400 --> 43:08.760]  well you don't think I didn't know how to make money in prison stocks 10 years
[43:08.760 --> 43:12.440]  ago or any of these stocks we've had guests on telling you what stocks are
[43:12.440 --> 43:16.840]  good to be a part of I won't be part of it because I don't want that bad bad bad
[43:16.840 --> 43:23.440]  mojo is the Japanese would call it horror the point is I don't want to
[43:23.440 --> 43:30.240]  consciously do bad things I do enough bad stuff without you unconsciously but
[43:30.240 --> 43:33.600]  we've got Michael Moore and all the rest these people getting away with bloody
[43:33.600 --> 43:41.040]  murder and can you imagine if Bush if Bush's Justice Department had had
[43:41.040 --> 43:46.240]  arrested him and then arrested a Republican governor and then been going
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.640]  after O'Keeffe
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.920]  O'Keeffe of the project Veritas names O'Keeffe that's joining us he's now
[43:57.920 --> 44:04.720]  getting subpoenaed and the US attorney also the state attorney he's got quotes
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.560]  on the site are just saying incredibly mean things about him openly
[44:09.560 --> 44:12.080]  prejudicing themselves I mean they don't care that when everybody know
[44:12.080 --> 44:16.760]  they're gangsters with three-piece suits with government helicopters they're the
[44:16.760 --> 44:21.920]  mafia with helicopters and SWAT teams it's not a pretty picture there's only
[44:21.920 --> 44:25.680]  one thing the mafia recognizes and that's getting punched right back in the
[44:25.680 --> 44:31.400]  nose there are a lot of good people living in New York state but I mean that
[44:31.400 --> 44:35.080]  was pure gangster last week when he said you're not welcome here you need to
[44:35.080 --> 44:41.320]  leave if you're pro-life or pro-god that was the quote
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.240]  there's no room for you in this state he concluded New Yorkers aren't like that
[44:47.240 --> 44:56.680]  see he defines that's his that's his tolerance that's his liberalness is to
[44:56.680 --> 45:01.400]  say you'll do whatever I say and they'll go on MSNBC and say your kids
[45:01.400 --> 45:04.720]  belong to the state and they'll go on CNN and say we're gonna do forced
[45:04.720 --> 45:08.720]  inoculations and they'll go on the CNN and say Obama's a dictator it's good for
[45:08.720 --> 45:15.040]  you and then those of us that warned about this oh we're the cooks look Alex
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.920]  said they'd have bullets billions of bullets and drones and checkpoints and
[45:17.920 --> 45:23.320]  it's all happening he's just credited and they're literally just there to make
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.960]  it look like like con artist that everything's fine with the general
[45:26.960 --> 45:35.640]  public that everything's okay it's all business as usual I'm gonna tell the
[45:35.640 --> 45:39.520]  Republican leadership something right now and you're not stupid and I know
[45:39.520 --> 45:42.600]  you're all blackmailed and intimidated but you're obviously the party that's
[45:42.600 --> 45:46.600]  gonna be phased out I want to explain something to you you cannot make a deal
[45:46.600 --> 45:52.200]  with the New World Order they are going to root all of you guys out and I
[45:52.200 --> 45:55.880]  guarantee you if they fully take over you're gonna be exiled or put in
[45:55.880 --> 46:02.640]  prison or killed and and people like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul who I know well and
[46:02.640 --> 46:08.280]  many others behind the scenes and on the air care about their grandchildren care
[46:08.280 --> 46:14.680]  about their children and realize you cannot make a deal with El Diablo you
[46:14.680 --> 46:22.320]  cannot make a deal with it and it's just mind-blowing I mean I mean I've got the
[46:22.320 --> 46:26.440]  news here that we're gonna cover a ban on automobiles major cities consider
[46:26.440 --> 46:36.720]  going Carlos CNBC under UN regulations I told you that's the plan and they're
[46:36.720 --> 46:43.720]  gonna put taxes on travel that are so cost prohibitive that no one but people
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.920]  worth tens of millions of dollars will be able to travel this is total
[46:47.920 --> 46:51.560]  utilism where you'll never leave your village and where your village is
[46:51.560 --> 46:57.600]  globally run I mean this is serfdom this is slavery let's pull up the
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.200]  definition of serfdom if we can indentured serfdom where you never left
[47:02.200 --> 47:06.000]  your land and you were controlled via debt and that's what the globalists said
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.800]  they wanted a club of Rome in the 60s and CFR documents in the 80s and you
[47:10.800 --> 47:16.080]  read all this and they're doing everything they said they do our whole
[47:16.080 --> 47:19.280]  destiny our whole society hijacked we're gonna go break and come back with the
[47:19.280 --> 47:24.000]  Dinesh this is a trailer you know I've gotten so busy that and so obsessed with
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.560]  Obama deception to it really is a great film that I basically a few months ago
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.360]  just pause working on it but I really need to get that out as an act of
[47:32.360 --> 47:38.960]  resistance and I mean I was trying to go with the sub name Obama deception you
[47:38.960 --> 47:45.760]  know something about stopping the dictator stopping the rise of the
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.960]  dictator or America's last chance I mean that's what the film's about predicting
[47:50.960 --> 47:54.240]  he would do all this and now I've got to go back and change it because it's all
[47:54.240 --> 47:59.360]  happened it's happening faster than I could put it out that's the problem and
[47:59.360 --> 48:06.000]  it's just so painful and that's why even a big national libertarian and
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.040]  Republican host attacked me out of professional jealousy I am not gonna
[48:14.040 --> 48:17.160]  respond and actually a lot of them stopped attacking me since I don't
[48:17.160 --> 48:21.200]  respond back actually said some good things and then that's a good thing
[48:21.200 --> 48:27.280]  because folks we don't hang together listen if somebody arrest Michael Savage
[48:27.280 --> 48:30.600]  which he hadn't said bad things about me he said nice things but I would support
[48:30.600 --> 48:35.880]  him even though I'll agree with about 95% of what he says very honorable very
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.400]  smart guy if somebody they try to set up Glenn Beck or come after him I would
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.080]  stand for him or Matt Drudge or World Net Daily or any of these groups or
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.880]  individuals I mean it's basic common sense we hang together or we hang
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.520]  separate and it is true that the Republicans have been controlled at the
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.520]  top but their ideology at least on paper the Republican Party platform of
[48:56.520 --> 48:59.760]  Texas sounds like it was written by the John Birch Society because it basically
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.760]  was we have the answers to turn this around that's why they're scared of Ted
[49:04.760 --> 49:08.840]  Cruz that's why they want to censoring that's why they want to censor me that's
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.360]  why they assassinate my character but I just say to all the people that work for
[49:12.360 --> 49:16.520]  the system and the rest of you come on you really don't want this to happen you
[49:16.520 --> 49:19.360]  don't want to be delusional and imagine that you're part of the power structure
[49:19.360 --> 49:23.080]  and everything's gonna be okay and if you just laugh at us and everything will
[49:23.080 --> 49:27.560]  turn out and you'll be with the power structure that's not how this works you
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.320]  should be gravely concerned great just by the
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.320]  depressionary factors we're seeing happen we better all come together around
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.320]  due process and call for four of the charges to be dropped on Dinesh Ysouza
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.360]  hands down you cannot have this corrupt Justice Department that is the dirtiest
[49:44.360 --> 49:48.280]  in US history undoubtedly prosecuting their political enemies trying to stop
[49:48.280 --> 49:53.160]  as soon as it's moving in the middle of shooting coming out July 4th now let me
[49:53.160 --> 49:58.200]  announce to everybody just briefly here that I get so busy I skip network breaks
[49:58.200 --> 50:01.640]  I don't plug the products that how we find ourselves if you want to stand with
[50:01.640 --> 50:05.560]  us and buy your war bonds in the battle for the republic in this information war

[54:57.720 --> 55:00.680]  but it's so important here's a huge story i'm going to cover after our guest leaves the bottom of
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.920]  the next hour soros activists take over ukrainian government buildings they're going to do it here

[55:29.080 --> 55:35.640]  that is just a sum of the news but let's go out to break with denisha susan now a political prisoner
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.520]  uh trying to stop the production of his film america coming out july 4th to try to bring
[55:40.520 --> 55:45.320]  immigrants together to love liberty and the bill of rights not the race pimping of the kukluk's
[55:45.320 --> 56:00.600]  klan uh democratic party here it is the film america is a patriotic film of being released
[56:00.600 --> 56:08.360]  in time for the fourth of july and yet it's not a rah rah patriotism that's uncritically
[56:08.360 --> 56:19.160]  celebrates america rather it's the patriotism that was referred to by edmund burk when he said to
[56:19.160 --> 56:26.680]  love our country our country should be lovely and what burk is saying is that true patriotism is
[56:26.680 --> 56:35.320]  loving your country not just because it's yours but because it's good now there is developed on
[56:35.320 --> 56:41.400]  the left and this has started in the 60s but it's now become very mainstream it's the presumption
[56:41.400 --> 56:48.760]  of leftist politics democratic progressive politics it's also the presumption of the stuff that's
[56:48.760 --> 56:54.680]  taught in schools and colleges all around the country the basic idea is that america is a
[56:54.680 --> 57:08.440]  society that is based on theft america is a society based on stealing and plunder this is the defining
[57:08.440 --> 57:15.240]  feature of american history we stole the country from the indians it was their land and the white
[57:15.240 --> 57:21.560]  man took it by force we stole the labor of the african americans to build the country at least
[57:21.560 --> 57:30.440]  a south we stole half of mexico in the mexican war that american foreign policy today is based on
[57:30.440 --> 57:37.160]  plunder why are we in the middle east obviously to take their oil we don't intervene in places
[57:37.160 --> 57:44.120]  like haydy because they don't have any oil and capitalism america's economic system the free
[57:44.120 --> 57:55.080]  market system is a form of theft robbing people of what obama calls their fair share
[57:55.800 --> 58:02.600]  now this idea that america is based on theft is never effectively answered
[58:05.320 --> 58:12.760]  and in fact many of its premises seem undeniable didn't we in fact take the country from the indians
[58:12.760 --> 58:19.320]  didn't we in fact steal the labor of the blacks and so on so in this film america
[58:19.320 --> 58:26.120]  i want to take this progressive leftist critique head on i want it to be articulated by its best
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.120]  folks all right we're gonna go back to effectively i'm gonna play the rest of when we come back in

[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:45.240]  venezia susan is film america coming out and and and look look the reason they hyped that america
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.680]  is evil and everything is bad is so that the socialists run by foreign banks who are actually
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:56.520]  conquering the world running giant slave camps worldwide fox com slave factories they just want
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.560]  to point at some evils of the past but then projected on to everyone who's alive today
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.280]  to give them the moral high ground i don't know what discus is going to do in his film
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.640]  funny enough i actually tackle all of this uh in obama deception too with the obama phone lady
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:19.640]  everybody uh but but this really is the ideology this this really is the mindset this this
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:28.360]  this really is how these people operate and it's it's it's it's extremely extremely frustrating
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.840]  that uh the globalists are carrying out all these crimes worldwide funding al-qaeda murder
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.960]  christians all over africa all over the middle east again al gore on the board of apple with
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.000]  the fox com the worst factories in the world suicide nets forced abortions forced drugging
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.920]  but it's like oh but they have the moral high ground because they stand for the americans
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:58.200]  well i happen to be native american in fact quite a bit on my dad's side uh camanchi uh
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:05.720]  Cherokee you name it i mean my dad didn't go when he was a little kid to the uh tourist trap
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.640]  deals where you go see them you know the natives doing their rituals and stuff i mean he went to
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.960]  the real deals and danced around the campfires and stuff the whole point is is that i happen to
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.200]  know what happened with the natives i happen to know the whole history of the battles back and forth
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.480]  and that hollywood always portrayed western activities in arizona in places the real battles
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.880]  were in the east and the midwest and it was all just tribalism and i know that american ideas
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:35.000]  though never fully realized are a threat to the globalist due process private property the family
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:42.360]  they want you to be in a democratic party cuckluck's clan gang the democratic party by the 60s
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:47.880]  eisenhower destroyed them with the civil rights act the party of lincoln this is a fact marlitha
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.800]  king was a republican on record no one knows that's how dumb the public is to total hoax that the
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:03:00.280]  grand dragon you know congressman bird and senator bird all of them lbj famously quotes saying you
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.680]  know i gotta do something to keep control of these n words you know we're gonna get welfare on them
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.640]  and run their lives we're gonna put them in a prison you know i'm not i'm not about to have those
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:16.920]  n words vote in republican the democrats flipped over in the 60s in the mid 60s and i'm not even
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.680]  a republican because they've sold out in her bat as well but i mean the public is so ignorant i'm
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:29.720]  sick of it they say the n r a is the clan now when the n r a was founded to help black people
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.600]  that's how butt backwards everything is we're here to expose the hoax here's the rest of his
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:43.240]  trailer here it is and in fact many of its premises seem undeniable didn't we in fact take
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:50.040]  the country from the indians didn't we in fact steal the labor of the blacks and so on so in
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:57.480]  this film america i want to take this progressive leftist critique head on i want it to be articulated
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:02.520]  by its best spokesman and then i want to effectively answer and debunk it
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.280]  that's the central ideological question answered in the film america
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:21.480]  and i know where the film is going to go it's just going to say we're not perfect but we've
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.800]  been better than others and they're trying to replace some of the old tyrannies with new high
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:33.480]  tech ones and i mean who can deny we're being conquered by the globalists they're the new empire
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.040]  and they want us all fighting about wars of a hundred two hundred years ago and again the public
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.880]  doesn't even know that martin Luther king was a republican that eisenhower got the civil rights
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.880]  act passed with the republicans the democrats trying to block it the republicans sent troops
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.880]  in to integrate the schools you've got the party the klu Klux Klan race baiting race division politics
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.200]  ruining this country by design and they're about to bring in 30 million illegals to vote to take
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:04.200]  our guns and they're going to do it in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple

[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:33.080]  com us navy sailors sue japan for lying about fukushima radiation and it has now come out
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.000]  that they were testing them and as the levels went up they stopped the testing and of course
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.840]  this has come out in the japanese news that they lied to the whole world and would just
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:48.680]  say the detectors weren't working in fukushima prefecture or that state and surrounding areas
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.680]  and now they've been doing the same thing here in the united states with increased radiation
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:59.400]  levels we sent our reporters out for a week on the west coast finding as high as 14 times and
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.640]  10 times and seven times and nine times all up and down the southern central and northern
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:13.000]  coast of california and origan that is big news and the news admitted we were right but said
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.240]  you know it was still a conspiracy theory to think it was bad so the radiation is up but
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.360]  they're not going to discuss why and a lot of its toxic waste dumping over the years the navy did
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.960]  and it's fukushima in fact will you guys print me this it was a study out marine biologists last
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:33.000]  week that the seals are dying on the west coast in alaska from the radiation and they've been
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.480]  testing them because it bio accumulates the fish they eat it builds up this is a very very serious
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.120]  situation here it is university of alaska scientists fukushima radiation maybe making
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:51.240]  alaskan seals sick with huge bloody rottles in them and radiation sickness evidence so we're
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.200]  like seals folks things bio accumulate in us we're at the top of the food chain and we're joined
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:02.840]  until the bottom of the hour by attorney paul garner and lieutenant steve simons uh who was out on
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:08.200]  one of those ships that gave aid when everybody else ran and so they can also break down what he
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.240]  saw what unfolded but this is a big deal because just like the deadly dust on 9 11 which we know
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.880]  they knew about they lied and said it was safe to breathe i know a lot of firefighters and police
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:24.040]  have spoken with in new york it benefits for who are now dead and it took them nine years to finally
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:30.360]  get some coverage medical coverage this is how evil the government is the new york post called
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.640]  them ambulance chasers i mean i've been there when the cops and firemen are literally coughing
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.520]  blood up in our own oxygen machines and can't even go on stage turning blue and then they die
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:47.720]  and they're all well we only say cops and firemen are heroes when the government wants to use them
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.920]  for some event or navy sailors or marines or army but when it comes to actually backing them up
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.000]  they call them ambulance chasers so we're joined by paul garner uh the attorney and
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.080]  lieutenant steve simons from the navy uh gentlemen you've got the floor tell us what you
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.960]  witnessed when you were there lieutenant simons and what's unfolded now and what's happened to the
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:14.040]  71 at least 71 sailors many of them in their 20s reporting radiation sickness
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:21.080]  uh filing suit against tokyo electric tell us what's going on well first thank you for having
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:29.960]  on the show um you know it's it's tragic actually of what's been going on with everybody who's now
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:36.600]  suffering is this steve is this steve or is this uh paul this is steve okay so this is the navy man
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:45.080]  okay go ahead sir this paul this is paul and i'm starting to interrupt steve uh and your question
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:54.360]  but i just want to say to you alex jones that you are a true tomodachi to our first responders
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:03.080]  and all 70 000 participants in operation tomodachi thank you for bringing awareness
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:10.840]  to this situation to your listeners i hope it stays on the front burner go on steve
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.600]  oh i just want to add something i listened to your what you said before uh you might want to
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:26.920]  check out a paper that was written uh almost a year ago uh came out of honolulu hawai
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:35.320]  um university of hawaii a valuation of radiation doses and associates associated risk
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:43.400]  from the fukushima nuclear accident to marine biota and human consumers of seafood and this is
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:53.000]  by nicolas fischer brawling siler i'll send you the link but uh this is uh of grave concern
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.800]  and should be to every inhabit well exactly that's why we've got you on and i'm no hero doing this
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.520]  you're just doing your duty as well if they don't care about sailors counselors they don't care
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:11.400]  about anybody i mean we've got to start worrying about these reactors yeah and and alex for god
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:17.480]  sakes send the ambulance at least and we'll chase after the ambulance you know what i mean but
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:23.640]  they didn't even send the ambulance to help these poor people these victims and they instead
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:33.240]  the dod just canceled the tomodachi registry it'll be a year this february uh first that they
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:40.120]  decided to throw in the towel on that uh claiming that uh it's all low dose and i'll speak with
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.840]  you further about that later but i really want you to hear from steve okay absolutely tell us
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:51.480]  what you witnessed what you did uh in the operation trying to help the japanese well you know
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.720]  everybody everybody's job was different as far as who did what who worked where you know my my
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.240]  position while i was out there i was actually an administrative officer for the air wing the carrier
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.200]  air wing that was embarked on the reagan for that particular deployment so it was a scheduled
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:14.360]  deployment we were already out on deployment and we were actually heading to participate within
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:19.960]  in an exercise and we actually got diverted from the exercise got diverted up north to go
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:26.920]  participate and of course help out the citizens of japan following that 9.0 earthquake and tsunami
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:33.880]  that ravaged their shore so so you were there super early how long after fukushima reactors
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:41.160]  blew up a few days into it were were you on site uh the earthquake and tsunami hit on the
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.280]  if i remember correctly on the 11th of march and if i remember right we arrived on the 12th of march
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:54.600]  wow and because the reactors didn't go right away that is simply amazing five hours i forgive me
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:01.800]  for interrupting but former prime minister nato kahn revealed to the japanese foreign press corps
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.800]  that the meltdown of reactor number one occurred five hours after the earthquake he measured from
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:16.520]  the earthquake at 2 46 p.m local time yes and the tsunami happened about 45 minutes later
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:22.200]  but they knew that they were in a loka they knew that they had lost a cruise they knew that they're
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:28.600]  heading to a meltdown and they had a meltdown five hours later before these first responders
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:34.040]  showed on the scene and then it kept going on for days and then the big mox three blew up
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.560]  that was the one that shot the mushroom cloud in the air so far amazing yeah and they were
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:47.880]  cooked for five hours in low what what is claimed by those in charge as being a low dose and you
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.280]  can get as much by eating a banana or from just uh you know taking a plane ride or something that's
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.640]  right tell us to tell us the long and short of it i mean you guys uh you know these sailors
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.360]  everybody tried to help with the machine you got radiated and the big crux here as i was reading the
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:10.040]  news is that then your radiation levels were going up so they stopped testing you tell folks what
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:18.280]  happened um well the the story that they've been peddling or that's been pedaled for the past
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:23.880]  three years is that there were that there is no threat to the radiation levels that were
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:30.200]  that anybody was exposed to and that you can actually get more radiation exposure from one
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:39.640]  month's worth of rocks on a soil or a transcontinental flight so that now today you know it doesn't
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.960]  it doesn't sit well i can say at least for me it doesn't sit well it doesn't it's not that easy to
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:50.040]  push that i believe button uh because of the measures some of the measures that were taken
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:55.400]  why while the ship was out there sure i mean well they admit this is much worse than Chernobyl
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.520]  and it's ongoing so so what did you do in the mission how close did you get and then when
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:08.280]  did you guys start to feel sick uh well we were if i remember correctly you know i wasn't my job
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:14.120]  person you know i'm not a navigator or anything like that all i can go is you know what we were
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:21.400]  told so at one point we were within pretty close proximity to the plant and as paul mentioned
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:28.280]  sitting for five hours we actually sailed into the nuclear plume and was in the plume for a little
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:35.080]  over five hours so they and then another on the subsequent time we actually had to secure the
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.280]  water system because we actually sucked up the contaminants into the water system of the ship
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.880]  and everybody who knows something about the ship that's how that's how we get our drinkable water
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:53.800]  our potable water everything we use from showers water faucets soda machines water for cooking
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:00.360]  it's all coming from sea water and what is the point in your missions of of sailing through the
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:08.360]  plume that you know that's a very valid question um you know that's definitely a question that i
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.720]  don't have an answer to you know i'm not sure sure and and so you guys are suing saying you've
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:22.360]  got radiation sickness when did you start to see the symptoms uh well it was november of 2011
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:28.920]  after i had returned you know apparently i was having some issues on the ship and i really didn't
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.560]  think much about it as far as gi type issues and i didn't really think anything about it
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:43.960]  but november of 2011 i started feeling uh feeling ill at waste time i was actually driving into
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.720]  arlington heading to work i was driving down route 50 and i actually blacked out and drove my
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:57.400]  truck up on a curb so after that it was um back and forth to the doctor test after test couldn't
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:04.840]  figure anything out started running fevers i was running fevers for three months solid
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:12.200]  as high as 102.9 um in and out of the hospital three different times for admittance into the
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:20.600]  hospital uh lymph nodes start swelling dealing with severe night sweats lost 20 to 25 pounds
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:28.280]  completely unexpectedly wiping hair off my body as i showered and then during the second hospitalization
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:35.080]  i was actually standing up and my legs just buckled and then now i started and then from
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:42.760]  there it started dealing with muscle weakness progressing up and now it's uh taken a point
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:48.600]  where it now affects my the signals between the brain and the bladder and i have to catheterize
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.800]  every four hours now good lord classic radiation you know your descendant classic radiation sickness
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.280]  symptoms and of course japanese children are dropping dead everywhere people having heart
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:04.600]  failure their teeth are falling out same same type stuff you've been going through with the
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.440]  bleeding and the and the uh not having control of the bladder and of course the response is
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:17.960]  that nothing's going on correct as of right now there's there's been no doctors able to well i don't
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.760]  want to say able to but at least willing to make the connection in fact i've actually had
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.760]  the first time i was hospitalized i actually brought it up to the intern and the intern's
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:33.080]  response to me was well if this was radiation you would have seen symptoms long before this
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.280]  my response back to him was i'm no doctor but you need to go back to med school because you're an
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:44.120]  idiot well let's talk to your lawyer paul garner real quick i do see that congress the navy times
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:50.280]  is reporting is is investigating so sailor's exposure to fukushima radiation uh but i mean
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.520]  you know my whole point is anybody in the military or the police for that matter should understand
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.840]  that when stuff melts down out of hand almost every time they deny people were exposed just
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:08.280]  like the nerve gas in the first gulf war 24 000 chemical detectors went off and they still just
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.400]  said no nothing happened even though it killed large numbers of people years later and it's been
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.200]  and has now been confirmed uh talking to your attorney paul garner why do you think they have
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:23.000]  this attitude i mean clearly your client and others on the ship and ships are are showing
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.600]  classic forms of radiation sickness what's been the train of events the last three years they
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:36.760]  can you hear me yes sir uh they control the uh the ballgame they control the media they control
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:44.760]  the misinformation that's disseminated from day one from fukushima gate if if you were at the nuclear
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:52.760]  power plant on day one march 11 2011 and you were in charge of the power plants and having
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:59.320]  to deal with the meltdown of reactor number one number two number three and the potential
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.160]  to have to say hey we have to walk away from this because you'll have to evacuate tokyo japan
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:12.440]  so here here's the dynamic the guy who was in charge is now dead from cancer their own guy
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:18.840]  so i don't care what nuke abbey their present prime minister may be pushing to the world no one
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:24.280]  has gotten sick from fukushima no one ever will well just take a look at the guy who was in charge
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:30.840]  of uh you know your uh uh tepco your tokyo electric power company you're a big shareholder your
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:38.520]  number one shareholder in it now the guy's dead from cancer hello so they're in control alex
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:47.080]  they don't have uh we don't have info wars uh at our disposal on mass media if mass media paid
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:53.720]  attention to this like i did after it first happened and stayed on it like they should have
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:01.960]  but they're captured they're all captured by the nuclear industry from the top down from your commander
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:10.520]  in chief right on through to the head of the nuclear regulatory commission it's all money
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:15.480]  make that's right that's right their propaganda is so good the course the ronald reagan's nuclear
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.240]  powered last time i checked and you know i've always been a pro nuclear power guy because
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.480]  i mean i believe we need energy the problem is none of them work these things right they build
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:31.000]  them on fault lines when they blow up they don't even seem to care they're not even trying to fix it
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.800]  there's just this attitude that they're in control of the bs machine so they can lie to
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.640]  themselves and everybody else but they're not in control of the reactors you know the laws of physics
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:47.720]  will not respond to tepco's bull so where is the lawsuit going and how do we support you guys okay
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:54.040]  here's where it's going we're refiling before february 6th is the deadline that judge janice
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:25:02.920]  samartino afforded us to file our second amended complaint in federal court in san diego we had
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:11.480]  51 victims we expect to double that figure of record and and we've been contacted by probably a
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:21.240]  quarter of a million um well 250 uh a quarter of a 250 victims but there were as you mentioned
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:27.560]  at the top of the program thousands involved in this now there's a latency period as we know but
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.720]  we have filed on behalf of all john and jane does who participated in operation tomodachi
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.920]  to preserve their rights so that they can file a claim in the future when something arises
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:48.280]  with steve we know what happened with several others unfortunately it's the same scenario
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:56.040]  or beyond uh constantly bleeding from your butt or from a gynecologically and you're a young person
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:05.320]  and not at 21 you lose a one of your testicles so we we're going to push this forward as you
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:11.800]  mentioned congress is going to get a report back from the undersecretary of state in charge of this
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:17.800]  by april 15th but we're not waiting for them because where have they been and by the way folks
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.400]  for those that don't know radiation attacks fast-growing cells show your gums your intestinal
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.760]  lining and uh sailors across the board that were part of the operation have been reporting
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.600]  bleeding from their rear ends so just understand this is not a game that means you've got serious
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.640]  radiation sickness and what makes me mad is they didn't tell people take iodine from what i read
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:46.280]  perhaps the sailor can correct me uh but why not tell them to take iodine why not tell them now
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.800]  that there's things like prussian blue and things that could help strip this out of your body or
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:57.880]  chelation i mean why were you told any of this lieutenant Simmons they don't want to admit
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.760]  that there's a problem it's denial it's denial no i know it's like telling the first responders
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.840]  don't wear respirators the air is fine on world trade center i mean it's beyond just not carrying
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.480]  and covering up they actively don't want you to get any aid or protect yourself have you saying go
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.760]  down a thousand feet in the water you don't need a mask or a tank you don't need air down there i mean
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:22.520]  it's it's just go back to that briefly so so they never told you to protect yourself from radiation
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:31.080]  you had a wonderful uh you had i'm sorry i just want to i just want to say this to alex glint
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:37.880]  tropes your uh guy who you had on the other day glint tropes who got measured for cesium he's got
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:44.200]  cesium in his body how much cesium do you think steve simons has in his body well you must be a
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.720]  listener yeah we have one of our crew on who had his blood tested because he moved from california
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.200]  because he was sick he had very high levels of cesium that they said was from pukashima
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:58.120]  in the major medical report from a major medical lab in chicago where his blood was sent and uh
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.400]  exactly we need to get the test of your whole crew uh it's just amazing so so to be clear
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:09.400]  lieutenant steve simons who was on the ronald reagan aiding uh through the plume right there at
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:15.880]  pukashima uh you guys were you were miles away and responded when the tsunami hit and then came in
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:23.400]  tell us about i was reading that you guys were told that there was increased radiation but then
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.840]  when it started going up and up and up they said don't worry about it and stop testing uh honestly
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:35.320]  that is that's new information to me um that is not information that i was purviewed to i should
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.200]  say sure sure what about iodine they tell you to take potassium iodine the only individuals
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:45.320]  that uh were taking potassium iodine were those directly involved with flight ops those going
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.760]  ashore and potentially some of those that were uh working on the deck but that was it the rest of
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:57.400]  the crew nothing so you're talking a crew of about 5500 people and a small amount of them were working
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.240]  on the deck or actually going ashore and by the way you're you're living in and around a nuclear
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:07.880]  reactor on the ship because i'm that's a nuclear powered carrier right correct okay so did they
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:13.640]  not have enough potassium iodate or iodine for you or what happened um quite sure they had plenty
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:20.040]  um however you know they're going off of misinformation coming being fed to them from
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:26.200]  japan and from tokyo electric so when tokyo electric and japan gives the false sense of
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.920]  security that everything is everything is fine and you guys are safe to operate in such the
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:35.480]  military bought that you stay there i want to do five more minutes with you guys and and have some
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:40.120]  closing comments but but talk about what did fukushima look like blowing up what what was it
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.760]  like did you see this tsunami come in before i mean what was it like you're an eyewitness to
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:51.080]  so much of this it's amazing what's in it steve simons and his lawyer are with us we're on the march
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.440]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.160]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care

[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:12.440]  several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:17.080]  this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:23.480]  take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born by patriot supply has never taken a loan
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:29.400]  or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard

[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:27.720]  scan over probably 300 400 articles a day and i have so much back knowledge from interviewing
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:35.800]  just thousands of guests radiologists scientists members of congress uh historians it's uh it's
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:41.320]  like i've been in college for 18 years being on radio so i'm not the smartest guy around but i have
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:47.720]  a large general knowledge like some good old boy you know next door who's an expert on baseball and
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.120]  he can tell you everything about every baseball made in the last 100 years people can get really
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:58.120]  informed on certain subjects like the law spend decades studying it you you get smarter than
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:07.640]  the average bear when it comes to the law but i know this we have a lot of nuclear and atomic
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:16.120]  disasters going on uh radiation is really really bad news we've got a bunch of aging 35 40 year
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.840]  old reactors they're supposed to be shut down and i feel pretty stupid that you know if you go
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:26.520]  back 15 years ago i was pro nuclear power on air because if they actually ran them correctly
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.320]  and actually warned people when there were occasional problems you could argue we ran out
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.960]  of fossil fuels we're going to do you'll freeze the death of the winter it's a very powerful
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:46.200]  form of energy the problem is is that look if there's a disaster and i've interviewed don darling
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:53.160]  the head of veterans for peace here in town uh himself a famous navy captain and was a captain
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:35:00.040]  of submarines uh nuclear rescue teams you name it nuclear submarines and they he was he's radiated
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.480]  he's had all this happening i've talked to don and years we ought to hold him see how he's doing
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.480]  so he's real sick when i talked to him on air a few years ago and they ordered them to turn a
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.800]  reactor off and turn it on they said well and they were all engineers he was an engineer
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.320]  and they said we're not supposed to do that's going to radiate us and they said that's an order
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:20.440]  captain so they turned it off and then turned it back on and released a bunch of radiation just
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:25.960]  literally to test it on the submarine and don's told that story on air before so it's this attitude
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:34.920]  of the bosses up on top that see sailors and marines and army people as animals
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:41.000]  and the giant history of secret testing i remember being a child watching some documentary film i
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.760]  forget what it was it was at the movie theater of my dad and it was about atomic soldiers or part of
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:52.600]  it was and it showed them having the soldiers sit back a mile away from an atomic blast and then
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:58.200]  march into the glowing glowing crater and it was a death sentence for him you know it took him decades
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:03.560]  to die but it killed him autumn had their teeth and stuff fall out you know right away and blood
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.080]  come out of their orifices and had deformed kids and the rest of it but and i said dad
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:14.280]  why is that he said you know i asked people when i was working at md anderson why that it's
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.840]  not at md anderson but so many other places the government did that and he said because humans
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.200]  are cheaper than monkeys he said why don't we just use monkeys
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:31.000]  and they said well humans are cheaper than monkeys so that's the attitude and look i don't
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.640]  want to do testing on monkeys either i have empathy what you'll do to a little animal is
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.720]  due to somebody else but it's like everybody cares about the animals but not the people it's just
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.280]  another story oh the sailors got radiated and they're bleeding out their hind ends and
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  you know their teeth are falling out and their hair is falling out and yeah there's 14 fold
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:53.480]  radiation increase in san francisco on the beach i mean big deal let's not even investigate that
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:37:00.840]  and there's this attitude that you've got like three heads or something if you care so i care
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:09.880]  about this because it shows the mindset of the establishment it shows that
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.680]  that the sky's the limit more and more and they've got these pilots people on the flight deck i mean
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:20.280]  this is coming out in the news and no one will give them treatment no one will pay for it at
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.480]  least the new york post to us critical of earlier they reported on this guys closing comments uh
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:32.040]  attorney paul garner and lieutenant steve simons i mean how's your radiation sickness now has it
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.440]  gotten better or worse you got to catheterize yourself what's happened to your buddies how
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:43.240]  many people have joined the suit um well for me the latest thing obviously is now that i have to
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:50.920]  catheterize every four hours um i'm also wheelchair 100 wheelchair dependent to god i've lost my
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:59.080]  mobility there and you know it's just i take one day at a time and you know up until until recently
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.920]  you know i really haven't talked to anybody else who has been dealing with any sort of ailment
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:11.480]  at least where i'm located there's one individual that i've come across who's also dealing with
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.360]  some some issues of his own as well and then you know of course there are the other individuals
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.880]  all all the other individuals that have come forward to paul yeah well rg reports 71 sailors
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:28.040]  many of their 20s uh are filing in the lawsuit uh that your lawyer's heading up is that correct paul
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:39.800]  more more hello uh yes sir uh i'm i'm i'm just thinking about the situation any other points
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:47.800]  i'm the situation is this um we we've barely scratched the tip of the iceberg you're so
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.640]  right in your analysis they sent the reagan up to bremerton for a year and a half to try to
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:59.560]  take out the radiation from a lot of components they shipped it all over to hanford to bury it
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:05.960]  over there they sent the reagan back to corano then when somebody says hey you shouldn't have little
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.080]  school kids going on for field trips on the ray and there's probably radiation on it
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  they determine oh we'll send it back to japan we can cook it some more so uh what i would suggest to
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:30.200]  you is this um have your listeners consider a study that was done uh back in 2003 past exposure to
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:36.600]  densely ionizing radiation leaves a unique permanent signature in the genome and that was
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.800]  david j bretner out of you probably know him out of colander university yes the center for
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.320]  radiological research they teamed up with the russians and they studied all the people from
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:54.520]  chernobyl and they actually isolate down to the chromosome level what damage was done
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:01.800]  uh by radiation as opposed to other environmental hazards that we all confront so this is going
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:10.680]  to burst their Fukushima gate balloon because once the people in the know step forward and say no
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:20.840]  enough for this bs this causes unique permanent damage to our genomes we're talking about survival
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:27.800]  as a race okay we're talking about survival of the west coast of california and beyond
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:36.200]  just wait until the people up in malibu have all that radioactive debris land on their shores this
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:44.600]  year and they start the phone's ringing off the hook at barber boxers office and uh you know uh
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:51.080]  congressman down here and everyone oh what are you doing to do about this now well it really
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.720]  worries me that the establishment can care less about anything but partying all the time
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:01.320]  with their underage pages i mean it is frightening to know the type of weapons these these people
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:07.000]  have because the honorable folks are the low level military and police and the general public
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.240]  compared to the people running things i guess historically we've got a bunch of caligulas and
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:18.680]  neroes and uh on on on power trips you know i just i empathize with with what's going on with you
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:26.520]  lieutenant steve simons and i hope you get better i mean has the has the va told you about any
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:32.280]  treatments that can try to get the radioactive isotopes out of your body or have those already
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:39.400]  broken down i mean what's your prognosis scheme that's what they are and they got to be compensated
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:46.360]  let me just tell you this okay and i'll shut up mangano and sherman doctors joe mangano the
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:53.080]  nuclear project and janette sherman underscore how small amounts of anthropogenic radiation
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:59.960]  are lethal and crippling over the short in intermediate term human immune systems cannot
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:10.920]  thrive with permanently damaged thyroid function you take it from here tomodachi now that's well
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:17.000]  said go ahead but answer your question has the va mentioned anything about it in fact nobody has
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.960]  nobody's even due to the fact that nobody's acknowledged that radiation has had anything
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:28.840]  to do with my failing health nobody's even talking about potential treatments or anything of that
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:35.400]  nature in you know in fact i've actually had aside from the intern who gave me his comment about
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:41.720]  if it was radiation i would have seen symptoms long before i did i've actually had no kidding a
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:51.000]  doctor say well maybe you're better off not knowing what this is so at what point at what

[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:13.640]  their rationalization but in the final equation they're just a bunch of mismanaging bumbling boobs

[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.760]  god speed will continue to follow your case because we're all being affected by this in a
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:55.800]  lesser way unfortunately um i wish none of us were being affected by it including yourself
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:03.560]  uh it's it's you know my my cousin was born with holes in his heart right after my uncle got back
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:08.280]  from vietnam he got married had a child and child died when he was about a year and a half old
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:17.160]  his name was flint uh and and they told him they told him that it was agent orange
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.080]  and then of course he had a bunch of other children that were fine after that because they
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:25.800]  they say it precipitates out and affects you for a few years and of course that's on record but
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:30.280]  they tried to cover that up for decades and then of course uh when they looked at my uncle's heart
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.160]  and lungs and stuff uh he had a lesion on his heart and things from a heart attack and they said we
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:42.920]  see these or it's like heart attack like in pilots from vietnam who got a lot of agent orange on them
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.840]  uh and uh you know we see this and guys they're even really healthy like him and that's just an
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:57.400]  example of how i've had two people in my family die or be contributed to monsanto which owns the
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.120]  agent orange i mean it's like you people never stop i mean you're assaulting us but it's done
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:09.240]  with stuff that kills us decades later or we have a deformed kid it's like philugia and the marines
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:15.400]  have a five-fold increase in deformed babies they have a 14 to 18 fold depending on the year increase
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:21.720]  for the iraqis in philugia a four-fold increase across iraq belgrade has a four-fold increase
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.840]  where the us and nato use du on civilian targets
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.280]  i mean it's crazy it's like it's space aliens really run the government and they want to live
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.480]  in a radioactive environment or something i mean you i mean you try to think of logic i don't really
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:41.720]  believe that i'm saying hypothetically as a as a way to understand it i i i want to believe there's
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:51.960]  some reason no the establishment just doesn't care while they lecture us all day long about how we
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:56.040]  got to get rid of our cars because they're going to hurt the earth and we've got to pay a carbon
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:00.840]  tax and we've got to restrict this and restrict that and oh you can't wash your car in your own
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:06.760]  yard because the soap run awful hurt the they are obsessed with everything they can tax us on and
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.640]  track us on but all the real stuff they're doing it on purpose they're doing it on purpose on record
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:17.400]  on santo all the big gmo companies and i'm sick of it i'm sick of being assaulted by you people
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:23.960]  i'm tired of it and exactly what that lawyer is a good lawyer all the studies he was mentioning
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:32.120]  we've covered the pentagon mit all of them they all know they wouldn't let them use du until 1990
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:38.600]  they had it in the 50s stock piled in eastern europe western europe border in case the 10 to
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:44.040]  1 superiority tanks of the russians came in they were then going to serve up once a nuclear war
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:51.720]  already started du is a secret weapon to be fired from high caliber rifles and small anti-tank
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:48:01.080]  artillery that three man teams could carry and a symbol to take out the tanks but it was only
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:08.200]  to be used in just a red level nuclear war emergency 10 to 1 now the establishment said 1990
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:15.560]  use it again it isn't just about the poisoning it's about why is the establishment doing this
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:23.080]  i mean look at look at steve jobs you know you're dying young look at all this this is not good
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:27.480]  but by the way i'm going to do a plug here and then come back and cover the move to ban cars
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:32.840]  have major cities car free msnbc is reporting it like it's wonderful edwards note and tells german
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.600]  tv the nsa is involved in industrial espionage and ever heard that before 16 years ago here
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.840]  i was told by an nsa whistleblower by another nsa whistleblower and by at least three telecom
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.840]  whistleblowers because there's more and more of them came to me i got more and more and they were
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:55.000]  smart rodeos car shows i did a i did a remote at a golf course and a guy showed up and gave me info
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:02.440]  and i mean these were all like engineers with the pocket protectors but good engineers high level
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.600]  engineers you know getting into their Mercedes and Cadillacs and driving off and then they all
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.400]  told me the same thing they said it's economic data to predict the future and control the world
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.520]  and i've been saying that for 16 years people think i'm crazy now it's all being announced
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.080]  this is a big deal folks you can in free will if you can predict the future because then you can
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:27.080]  put stimuli in to manipulate and it gives you a targeting system on the mind with your stimuli
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:32.680]  to learn how to guide the brain it's mind control so don't be mad at the public that are mind control
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.920]  listen if you're in the navy or if you were around Fukushima or you're on the west coast
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.640]  you're insane if you're not getting the gourmet salts that have the good iodine in them but
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:46.840]  that is bound iodine is still not the proprietary nascent iodine that we sell and we sell stuff
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:52.120]  that we use i discovered this doing research for myself and my family and i tried a bunch of them
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:56.840]  and couldn't take them it gave me stomach aches i found this brand that no one even knew about 20
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:02.200]  something years proprietary national academy of sciences and basically bought them out or
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:08.280]  we're the distributor of it and it is half the price double the strength of many leading competitors
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:14.520]  its survival shield we did get a lot more of it in but quite frankly it's a small laboratory
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:21.480]  and it's completely organic the corn based glycerin out of germany very hard to get organic
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:27.080]  corn but it is amazing and when you purchase it it helps funder operation info wars life

[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:19.720]  he's gotten subpoenaed by the degenerate governor of new york state hey guys will you give me that
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:25.400]  article with the qualmo last week saying if you're a pro live for a gun owner you're not welcome
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:31.560]  i mean that is so authoritarian and now they're going after project veritas by the way o'keith's
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:37.880]  been arrested before they're exposing senator landry uh i mean you do regular journalism you
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:42.440]  get arrested in this country and this is part of a major pattern of persecution that i predicted
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:48.920]  would accelerate last uh thursday with bob bar hours before the desuza thing came out and and
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:55.080]  there's not a backlash to this if they get away with it katie bar the door that's how dictators
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.600]  do it they they test like a parrot will reach out and put its beak on a perch to see if it'll hold
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:07.640]  them and you know senator cruz i just i can't believe i didn't trust cruz at first because
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.520]  i didn't really know him and he just kind of came out of nowhere in texas government
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:19.480]  we interviewed him once uh we should probably try to get him on but the point is is that he's
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:27.160]  totally proven himself to be absolutely incredible i just admire senator cruz so much bottom line
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:36.360]  he got on schaefer's show on face the nation and said we have a dangerous power grab by obama
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.480]  they're arresting members of the press this is concern everyone you got the irs persecuting
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:47.320]  people this is tyranny obama's dangerous and schaefer laughed at him and then cuts the feed
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:53.400]  well it went out on the internet went out on the internet but it did not go out on television
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.200]  they cut a minute and 30 seconds of it we have that up on info wars dot com right now
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:02.760]  because listen they can't allow this out because if it gets out there
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.160]  they're going to go down now you got to stay to the union tomorrow
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:12.200]  you know i may even do a live broadcast tomorrow when the nightly news ends what

[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:24.360]  pipe it in there and just do a special live report tomorrow now shifting gears here folks
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.320]  this is an article out of c nbc and they're reporting it like again it's no big deal they're
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:35.000]  just acclimating Germany is the most far along with the gina 21 in the world from what i've seen
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:40.840]  the worst city in the u.s would be san francisco new york and then austin for it and and it's
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:48.520]  official un treaty where basically all cars will be barred from the city you've got to use their
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:54.200]  mass transit as a system of control but it doesn't mean that then that'll cut back on oil prices
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:57:00.280]  you'll pay even more because it's all about gouging you for more all about living in a 250
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:04.440]  square foot apartment that's the global model not having single family dwellings i've got a
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.080]  feminist up on info wars dot com a news article saying women that are that have children and
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:14.840]  their homemakers are disgusting and shameful you're like man that's really hateful they're
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:20.280]  there these are not liberals these are conquerors they're going to put us out in the barn you got
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:28.520]  to break up the family to do that c nbc a ban on autos major cities consider going carless
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.320]  germany home of high speed autobahn is perhaps one of the few countries that has had an intense
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:39.000]  love affair with an automobile as the u s but in an effort to go green the country's second largest
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.600]  city is studying ways to eliminate cars by 2034 they'll do it a lot quicker than that the northern
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:49.640]  city of hamburgers laid out an initial concept named green network plan that would expand public
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.480]  transport and add more routes for pedestrians and bicyclists the most controversial aspect the
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:57.720]  plan calls for steady phase out of automobiles in the center of the city over the next two decades
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:06.840]  and folks this is a hot topic it says among urban planners especially in europe and other
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:12.840]  industrialized countries this is deindustrialization and that's the plan so told you that was coming
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.200]  and you don't understand they're not making 250 square foot apartments available they're

[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:09.560]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:16.520]  encourage salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:22.600]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been

[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:29.480]  be he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:39.960]  by the way i've been talking to news media people and other activists who have been
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:47.720]  criticizing with tsa and they say that they're given uh pre-check passes without even having
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:54.280]  to go through the tsa more and more and that's being done to basically have activists back off
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.920]  and that's an example of how when you complain and you don't submit you get left alone but when
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:06.440]  you submit the bureaucrats will actually nail you to the wall and after a decade of criticizing
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.880]  with tsa the last four years intensely since the general groping began uh there's been a revolution
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:16.920]  of awakening to this on capitol hill you name it the other problem is though they're data mining
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.560]  before you get to the airport showing that you're not connected any terrorist when when they try to
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:26.760]  clamp down on political groups domestically they can easily then list that as a reason that precludes
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:33.240]  you from flying as the irs proposed last year a bill not letting you leave the country if the irs
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:38.600]  has even opened an investigation on you well everybody's had the irs open investigations on
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:46.600]  them if you've ever run a business this is scary prominent anti tsa activist receives pre-check pass
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:54.200]  without applying agency giving critics a free security theater pass question mark an engineer
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:59.720]  who notoriously exposed tsa body scanners yeah he's been on our show has fundamentally flawed
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.760]  has been handed a lifetime pre-check pass meaning he may never have to walk through a scanner or
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:11.080]  undergo pat downs again prompting questions well i want one but see then that's wrong folks the
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:16.040]  general public the sheep still go through it my dad went through back from europe and they didn't
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:22.280]  check him prompting questions over whether the agency is attempting to sweeten its staunchest
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:29.880]  critics to his surprise uh john corbett who runs the popular blog tsa out of our pants let's get
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:35.080]  him back on received the pre-check pass on a flight from nasa to miami international last week
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:40.920]  corbett who also became the first person in america to sue the tsa over the constitutionality
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:45.800]  of the agency yes see they don't want him to get more stuff to sue him with body scanners and pat downs
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:51.720]  did not even apply for a pre-check pass of course i would say the tsa does know he's not a terrorist
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.680]  i mean that's for sure i think the old days used to be able to dress nice and it was like fun to
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:02.280]  fly and you get on the plane and go places which will allow him to skip standard security lines
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:06.760]  and procedures when boarding flights within the united states that's right the guy who sues
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:11.800]  probably humiliates and fights the tsa before congress now has a tsa pre-check corbett writes
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:16.360]  on his blog i want to get him on tomorrow if we can gentlemen he's a frequent guest of ours i mean
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:23.560]  look look look how do you handle a bully how do you handle a bully i remember so many times and i was
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:31.000]  like six grades seventh grade eighth grade ninth grade you name it the bullying would say i'm going

[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:42.280]  face took them swing i'd pop them right in the nose and then of course and their older brother
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:48.760]  would want to take a swing and you know sometimes i'd go to the hospital sometimes they'd you know
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.680]  go into the ward for the rest of their life of tubes up their nose i mean you know that's how

[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:44.920]  that's like saying obama can legally snort cocaine in the winehouse oval offices he's known to do
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.200]  and bill clinton can rape women i mean i'm just sick of these criminals these are criminal minds

[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:58.280]  catching it on tape and there was only an ethics commission meeting and then the head of the

[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:36.120]  is the open purge and an estus isa who came out with a film that isn't like the kukluks clan
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:42.840]  democratic party creating division race politics but but creating unity around bill of rights
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.880]  constitution due process and private property something george soros who gets most his money

[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:11.320]  which is an absolute primer to understand how to take down the globalist breakthrough if you
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:16.760]  want to be a citizen journalist and have international effect he brought down akron you got to say who
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:20.840]  was the detonator on the bomb that brought down that criminal organization now they've been exposing

[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:32.280]  get your social security numbers he has been arrested before and and they've tried to charge him for
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:39.080]  exposing corrupt senators like landrub but he's beaten them but now they're getting bold and
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.720]  qualmo is subpoenaing him and i wanted to before we got into his new battleground texas stuff where
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.480]  they openly are registering illegals to vote and saying it where they're openly teaching them how
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.640]  to commit fraud where they're openly making fun of people in wheelchairs i mean i've been around
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:59.400]  democrats folks i used to go to pro-life rallies and demonstrations and things when i had the time
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.800]  and you know i've told the stories i've had black folks on like reverend children's they'll say no the
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:09.480]  part for the course of black democrats is we don't kill these nappy head black people that's the quote
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:13.400]  you're like a democratic party man you're like don't kill the black people we need to get rid of
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:18.920]  these black people more from me i mean that's a quote you're like what the these people are nut jobs
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:24.040]  i'm telling you it's a criminal group and then you got a bunch of well-meaning liberals who really
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.200]  think the democrats are the nice guys on social issues who support them and i'm not saying the
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:33.960]  republican leadership's good either but the virulent cancer is the democrats they are a disease and
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:39.160]  their imaginative bush had had michael more arrested claiming he gave 20 000 dollars a political
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.800]  candidate in bundling obama's gotten a third of his money from foreign offshore groups
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.440]  completely illegally look at this attorney general all the crimes he's committed and folks if they
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:56.200]  get away with denistra susan and governor mcdonald and with james o kief you better believe matt drudge
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:04.360]  and elks jones and glenn beck and joseph farah are next believe me believe me i don't like to talk
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:07.320]  about the stuff i've gone through over the years because i don't want to intimidate people for the
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:14.520]  enemy but look look they've left me alone because they understand i'll get really aggressive and i
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:19.880]  know how to bring these people down so they're criminal cowards they they operate in big groups
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:24.200]  but they're using the justice department with the most criminal attorney general in history
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:28.840]  undoubtedly a fast and furious you name it to literally bring this country down so i want to
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:35.160]  get into the incredible new battleground video he's got up at project veritas.com we're going to
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:39.880]  play the audio and video here for radio listeners tv listeners but i wanted to just bring this up to
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:46.360]  you and get your take on this clear selective enforcement purge both men saying not guilty
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:49.800]  and the fact that they're subpoenaing you and the sharks are now circling you buddy
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:56.920]  yeah elks this is something i've had to contend with for a couple years um you know they're they're
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:02.360]  targeting journalists in this country and they've been targeting it we've spoken before about how
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:09.240]  i've been subpoenaed i've been audited last year i was audited by the irs i have a small charity
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:15.000]  we have we have an office in west chester new york and now governor kwomo uh issued a subpoena to
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.680]  us yesterday where they're talking about commanding me to appear and give every single financial
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:25.720]  transaction over the last three years of an organization that makes less than a million
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.880]  dollars a year they're demanding general ledgers journals cashbooks and payroll records and
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:34.600]  everything else and because i'm a journalist i have undercover journalists working for me
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:40.520]  you know the state of new york has a history of leaking people's information to the press oh yeah
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:46.280]  they publish uh concealed uh permanent holders names in the paper they did that there was also
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:51.400]  an incident that happened with the tax office a couple years ago where they leaked information to
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.440]  the press um five new york state department of taxation and finance employees say their tax returns
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:01.880]  were unlawfully audited and leaked to the new york post in louisiana my information was leaked
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:07.080]  to the press the u.s attorneys resigned to disgrace this is not this is all public information
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:12.760]  um but when i'm afraid of if they're obviously targeting me it's obviously political and um
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:16.920]  you know they're subpoenaing me and i i think it's a disgrace not just that they're doing it but
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:21.640]  the journalists in this country don't care uh they're not interested in in fact they
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:26.760]  not that they just don't care and have no instinct for freedom uh they are now and
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:32.840]  slate and others making fun of us and worried about desuza and making jokes about you and i
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:38.920]  uh we're being attacked for being real journalists on the cutting edge of liberty i mean if they
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:45.000]  arrested michael more like this i wouldn't put up with it no it's it's um it's it's unbelievable
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  i don't know i don't know how to what to put it i mean it's it's desuza they're they're
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  inducting desuza they're inducting mcdonnell and for me it's not even an indictment but
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:58.600]  there is no concern from that like we the columbia journalism review or the new york times they just
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:04.280]  they like the fact that people are being targeted by the government they like that because it's people
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:09.560]  that they don't agree with and i think it's gotten really bad it's going to get worse and and um i
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:12.680]  think they're going to it's not just going to be something against me it's going to affect a lot
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:16.600]  more people as you pointed out uh pretty soon they're going to be going after people like glen
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:19.480]  back they're going to be going after those days but they think they can come after me because
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:24.920]  i'm small and because i have a small charity and i'm tax exempt but sooner or later they're
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:30.200]  going to come after big people too and by the way you've been thrown in jail before exposing
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:35.880]  their shenanigans yeah they actually a federal judge a judge a judge um uh named stanley duvall
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.920]  in louisiana for the fifth circuit uh was the federal judge he called me basically insinuated
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:47.080]  that i was a terrorist for walking into a federal building with a camera that's why i was a terrorist
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:51.960]  and then the magistrate judge destroyed the videotape that i took from inside that federal
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:57.240]  building and the press just went went along for the ride and this is what i read about breakthrough
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:02.200]  it's this this crazy story about everything that has happened to me and like you pointed out alex
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:07.000]  i walk a fine line because i on one hand i want to tell americans sort of what i've been through on
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.880]  the other hand i don't want to scare them because this stuff is really really scary but it's also
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.360]  very true well let me tell you if you don't know there's a tyranny folks go out and fight it you'll
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:20.040]  find out real quick now usually they end up running from you in fear but if you get really
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.680]  effective i mean how many billions did their crime machine lose when you brought down acorn
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:31.400]  uh well they were allocated to receive as much as five billion dollars in the um in the stimulus
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:39.000]  package um funny thing is this guy wade wade rathke who was behind you know acorn because
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.880]  of our battleground texas story that we released last week rathke said to the austin statesman
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.840]  on the front page on sunday he said we've been having weekly meetings we've been instructing

[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:41.240]  this is serious and we're going back to james oh keeps a project veritas you got cut off there but
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:46.120]  yeah the democrats are openly in the paper bragging about how they're going around with
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:50.120]  battleground texas telling him what to say and what not to say and for those that don't know
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.840]  we're going to play a two minute clip of wendy davis the abortion queen and all the rest of it but
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:59.800]  please continue so i'm just saying that you know the impact you know that the bad news is
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:03.880]  they're going to come after us they're going to put us in jail and they're going to indict us
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:09.160]  intimidate us and most importantly deter people from recruiting from i'm i recruit citizen journalists
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:13.560]  we have dozens of people across the country they want to stop my volunteers from getting involved
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.320]  because they want to make an example out of me so the good news is that front page of the austin
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.720]  states me yesterday there's an article say james oh keeps targets battleground texas and you have
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:29.480]  wade rathke who founded acorn and now represents local 100 there in texas saying that he's having
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:35.560]  weekly meetings with his organizers putting out instructions on how to identify possible oh keeps
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:41.240]  associates and reporters in their offices so they're on the lookout for us in fact one quote from
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:46.120]  this article uh this is on the front page of the austin statesman says that battleground texas has
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:51.400]  sought to keep 10 000 volunteers from saying or doing anything fraudulent that might play into my
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:56.680]  hands as a direct quote so these people are on the lookout for our undercover cameras that's how
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:00.760]  you know we're making an impact and by the way it's not playing into someone's hands when you go
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:06.440]  into acorn office after acorn office and say here's my underage prostitute i'm going to ship in
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:12.600]  child prostitutes and i want the democrats to help me run the scam oh yes in my experience street
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:18.440]  level democrats are hoods thugs scammers they're allowed to engage in every crime every welfare
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:25.240]  crime you can imagine but if a libertarian or a patriot has a literal crooked toenail we go to
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:30.680]  jail the way these laws are written it is it is almost impossible to follow all the stinking laws
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:36.280]  the way they can interpret them this is so huge but then you look you are the answer i've been doing
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:40.920]  this 18 years you've been doing this i don't know six seven years if people will emulate what you put
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:45.560]  in your book breakthrough which is available in infowarstore.com if they will take that and do that
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:52.280]  and their area on issues and use youtube and other platforms the system is sensationally corrupt
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:57.560]  and if we just go point cameras at them and ask them questions they will expose themselves
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.880]  all that evil men in tyranny to flourish is that good men do nothing tell folks about
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:06.840]  wendy davis and some of the other big stuff you've got breaking james o' keith so yeah in the in the
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:11.240]  past week there's a whole bunch of scandal in texas about some comments directed at the attorney
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:16.920]  general there regarding um i guess he's in a wheelchair therefore people are making comments
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:22.200]  about how he can't stand with wendy etc etc so we have all this material on battleground battleground
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.560]  texas is a political action committee in the state of texas that raises it raises tens of
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.600]  millions of dollars from national democratic money to try to flip texas into a democratic state
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:39.240]  they're doing that by dispatching roughly 10 000 people in the state to register voters and and
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:45.640]  sometimes commit fraud so we caught some of their volunteers on tape disparaging disabled people
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:51.640]  talking about how greg abbott is in a wheelchair we want to stand with wendy first of all he's
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:55.320]  in a wheelchair and they're making all these comments about disabled people in this video
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:00.280]  and it's and it's actually put wendy davis on defense she had to comment on friday that these
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:06.520]  comments were were abhorrent and and like you said we don't need to advocate anything here we're not
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:11.160]  picking sides what we are doing is exposing the reality of of who these people are how they think
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:17.400]  and how they view uh about people in the state of texas you're absolutely right but the fact
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.440]  that they're coming after us and the republican leadership's trying to purge the tea party out
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:27.960]  of their ranks and trying to purge ted cruz and people shows that we're gaining ground and that
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:34.840]  we can win if we just continue to fight i think we have to expose reality i mean we i mean it's
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:40.680]  amazing how much we accomplish at project veritas all we do is catch things on tape and i think if
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:47.880]  we just did this more often um if we got all of them on tape it would pretty much stop all the
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:51.880]  fraud it's certainly deterring the fraud they're admitting in this article here that that they're
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:56.360]  on the lookout for undercover reporters they're stopping the fraud and i debated not releasing
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.960]  this video last week i thought about waiting um but um because it was in the news and because i
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:05.720]  wanted to stop the fraud before it happened at the end of this video if you look at the end of our
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.320]  youtube video there's a clip where one of the deputy voter registrars her name is lisa wortham
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:17.880]  she's an attorney in dalis and she is an official uh in she in texas you have to be officially

[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:24.280]  let me tell you this is a war against a bunch of social engineering criminals that are
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:32.360]  the polar opposites of a liberal like thomas jefferson they are authoritarian gangster thugs
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:38.520]  and again the democratic party was the party that could close klan this is on record they couldn't
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:43.400]  beat the republicans and isonhower with the civil rights act they literally flipped back then to
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:51.160]  race politics with uh quote minorities and still the old south as a strategic operation
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:58.280]  and they've taken over and they invoke racism the public has no idea martin luther king was a
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:03.720]  republican they have no idea the nra was founded to give blacks guns who were newly freed they get
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:08.920]  on the news and say it is part of the clan and again the republican party's been taken over by
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:14.920]  the globalist they're afraid of the tea party taking it back but the democrats just look do you
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:18.840]  like obama ripping you off and conning it we're going back to james o keith to play this clip
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:25.320]  and get some final comments from him but look at drudge report dot com right now it's got a link
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.280]  there in the middle christian singer walks out after satanic performance you click on that
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:36.360]  it's a info wars dot com article christian singer walks out on grammy's after satanic
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:42.520]  performances i watched some of these before the show today and it was literal satan worship
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:48.280]  fire death look at my twitter account he's got a still image of like just incredibly horrible stuff
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:56.760]  other singers were there uh wallowing around and and and and and and doing sex rituals and
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:02.680]  then having gay people being married on tv this is what happened when roam was about to collapse
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:08.680]  and they go what you don't like gay people look no i don't i don't even think about stuff like that
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:15.000]  that's not what it's about it's about the the mental illness of the ruling class that are
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:19.240]  in to corruption into bad things before we get back into wendy davis and other big stories
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:24.600]  you're working on james o keith literally the model of resistance small guerrilla teams of
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:29.800]  journalists just going out and exposing the incredible corruption let me let me ask you this
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:36.600]  question uh who do you think the democrats really are and what is their in game and how can they be
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:42.520]  stopped are they just too criminally powerful and too cunningly evil to be stopped well we've
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.960]  we've demonstrated with our reporting of the impact that we can have most i just said you before the
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:53.320]  break the front page austin statesman is reporting that wade raffi the founder of acorn who's also
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.960]  managing the local 100 chapters there throughout texas he's actually spending the majority of his
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:03.160]  time training his people how to avoid being caught on my cameras which is unbelievable it's
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:07.880]  remarkable how much of an impact our little non-profits having compared to say the republican
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:13.000]  party or the political action committees across the country i mean we are quite literally putting
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.560]  them in a state of fear and paralysis the texas tribune today has an article it's called inside
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:23.320]  the o'keith battleground texas war i mean i'm just i'm just one citizen with a couple reporters
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:29.960]  with cameras and i'm going against an organization with 10 000 you are a knight to you literally
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:35.000]  taking the field against the scum and that's what's so frustrating if people would just do what you
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:41.720]  do and what i've done and just go out there and engage them it is so easy people are very afraid
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:47.240]  alex and the number one thing that i've discovered is that people are hopeless and afraid and these
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:54.440]  are good god you know fearing patriotic americans come up to me and they're so scared of what might
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:37:00.120]  happen to them and my message to them is look i mean yes you're gonna have to make some type of
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:04.760]  personal sacrifice you're gonna have to put yourself on the line but my message is you can
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:09.080]  break through it i mean you can you can succeed you can make an impact you can survive the other
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:14.680]  attacks i think we just need to come together and you asked me what you know can can they be stopped
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:20.280]  i mean i think reality is going to stop them i think the truth is going to you know i have faith
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:23.560]  in people if they're given facts about the country they live in they're going to make the right
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:27.480]  decisions the problem is people are not educated because they don't really know what's going on
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:33.480]  no i totally agree with you and hollywood is putting out the psychological bilge as a
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:38.760]  disabling mental virus because if you are virtuous and i'm not saying i'm perfect but
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:43.160]  somewhat virtuous you don't like corruption you don't like thugs you don't like bullies you
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:49.720]  don't like fraud you're discerning reality rules your life and you just absolutely
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:57.560]  will reject the collectivist dependency squalor that these people create and that's why
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:01.240]  they're trying to sexualize five-year-olds that's why they're having satanic rituals
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:07.240]  at the super bowl and at the grammy's that's why they're doing this is to screw us up now
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:11.080]  shifting years back into this clip we're gonna play this two-minute clip that you were just
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:16.280]  mentioning that's up on your website if folks want to watch the whole thing project veritas.com
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:23.960]  that again has them on the defense and now in battleground texas soviet town texas they're
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:29.880]  unable to engage in their normal kleptocratic activities because you've gotten them off balance
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:35.880]  now they're unable to carry out their normal chicago mafia takeover that's exactly right they're
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:41.640]  they're deterred from doing the type of thing i mean the direct quote here is that they were talking
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:47.720]  about how uh quote battleground has sought to keep 10 000 volunteers from saying or doing
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.040]  anything that might play into our hands as you pointed out that's a strange way of putting it's
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:58.280]  like hey you can commit the fraud but just don't get caught committing the fraud and that's exactly
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:02.440]  well from my opinion that's that's that's fine i mean if they don't want to get caught committing
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:06.680]  the fraud means they're not going to be able to commit any fraud meanwhile i've studied uh campaign
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:11.240]  finance i ran for the state house for two weeks until the lawyers explained there's no way to
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.280]  follow the law perfectly and the establishment fat cats can do whatever they want that's one way
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:21.880]  they control congress but if you ever get off the reservation they will indict you and and it just
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:26.760]  comes down to this we fight fair while they're registering illegals while they're getting
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:33.480]  foreign donors the next to susan is facing years in jail for bundling something that that's questionable
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:38.280]  if it even is illegal same thing with the governor they're acting like i'm not even a fan of chris christy
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:41.880]  but they're acting like this bridge thing is bigger than watergate when meanwhile we've got
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:49.000]  been gauzy and we've got uh fast and furious and salandra and all this stuff i mean it's incredible
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.480]  what do you make and then i want to play this clip of obama openly acting like a dictator now
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:40:00.600]  well i'll tell you what you know going i mean it's it's it's disgusting i'm gonna have two points
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:05.240]  number one um i think it's not our war is not just against these government institutions these
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:10.440]  attorney generals in the white house it's also against the journalists who support them because
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:16.040]  if you're any self-respecting dignified human being and a journalist you would be outraged you
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:20.840]  would drop everything you're doing to protect your profession and these journalists are disgusting
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:25.560]  they're a disgrace uh in in i'm being targeted by the state of new york right now and this new
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:31.160]  york state thing i mean elliot broody got a slap on the wrist for stealing 250 million dollars in
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:36.120]  new york state pension funds they're coming after my less than a million dollar c3 charity and
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.560]  auditing every statement going back three years it's it's just it's unknowing i don't have any
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:46.680]  words to describe it and i have been through uh situations where i have been put in federal
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:50.920]  prison i'm a journalist and i was put in federal prison for being present in a federal building
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:56.920]  with a camera and unless we can get our our media institutions to to be outraged unless we can
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:03.160]  somehow provoke the press and get some type of ink nationally um we're in trouble and and that's
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.560]  where i'm trying to outrage people here that's why i use the tactics that i use sure well michael
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:13.640]  hastings before he died said look obama is evil worse than bush we've got to organize the press
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:19.080]  together they're waging war on us we've got to wage war on them they are so scared of the moral
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:24.680]  authority forget left right it's right and wrong coming together and defending the first amendment
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:30.200]  i mean i i mean look how they're arresting journalists in china or in russia i'm against
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:38.840]  that now what's happening here and it's and the democrats sites are laughing at us and the commenters
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:44.200]  are like good we're going to arrest you all and it's like these people i guarantee are wimps number
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.440]  one i mean they've never sat there and really arrested somebody they've never falsely charged
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:53.000]  someone most of these people they've never probably been in like a serious situation and they're
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:58.520]  sitting back playing the part of like gestapo gangsters literally not understanding they're
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:04.200]  destroying their own future well i think i think the way to do it is not talk about um uh policy
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:07.880]  or economics these people don't care about that type of thing that because they're fascists so the
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:12.520]  way to do it is to talk about you know it feels like this is what i say to people on the left i
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:17.080]  said you know it feels like that a federal judge destroy your evidence to have the attorney general
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.800]  come after your journalists and try to leak that information to the press and in new york do you
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.240]  know it feels like to you know be in a wheelchair and be called cripple because that's what these
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:30.120]  people are saying and i think if you take it from that perspective the emotions and connect with
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:35.560]  people like this this wendy davis clip where she makes fun of uh handicapped people that's how we
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:40.680]  can cross over and i think that's the way to go and i have to talk about tax policy and and the
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:45.320]  like but to appeal to people's emotions i agree i agree and in their common sense and their sense
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:50.040]  of morality i saw a quote was that yesterday or today was it the u.s attorney or state attorney
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:56.760]  saying horrible things about you what was that quote uh uh well the state the attorney general
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.440]  of of new york andrew Cuomo is issuing me a subpoena but um i've dealt with so many of the
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:07.000]  attorney generals i lose track what which did you say i just saw the quote was calling a bunch of
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.160]  names and stuff is totally prejudicing themselves i think it was the attorney general in new york
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:17.080]  yeah Cuomo and his department of labor is is going after me and i we use undercover reporters
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:21.320]  they want the names of the people and every i'm happy to comply with any audit i went through
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:25.560]  an audit last year with the irs i was found to be completely compliant but you know how these
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:31.880]  people are they can manufacture scandal by by just creating obfuscation about your finances
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:37.000]  so we're you know i'm i'm doing the best i can um but i mean here's the deal they're trying to not
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.760]  let libertarian constitutionalists real conservatives organize and raise money and they always demonize
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:47.640]  me because i sell products to fund ourselves how do people think this goes you know george soros is
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:53.000]  spending billions to try to overthrow eastern europe yeah i mean look at the ukraine right now
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:57.400]  george soros is trying to fund you know groups of these stabilize this country because they know
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:02.040]  we're on the edge of revolution they want to make it a connie rev revolution we have got to stand
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:08.040]  behind project veritas people got to get your book breakthrough they've got to emulate what you've done
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:12.920]  even if it's going to city council and asking questions starting a blog you never know folks
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:18.840]  as millions of us start targeting them as real press we will fill the vacuum that the dinosaur
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:24.680]  media hasn't filled and james look at the dinosaur media already dying msnbc lost half its viewers
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:30.120]  two years ago they lost half of their viewers again soon they'll have no viewers so really
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:35.560]  they're they are becoming extinct and i think their offensive attacks and their attempt to get
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:41.560]  everything done now is a desperate attempt by the establishment there's a time alex when people
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:46.280]  would view someone like me and say well he's being he's being subpoena and indicted he must be some
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:52.040]  type of crazy but in fact now 90 percent of people actually uh can read between the lines and realize
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:57.080]  it's almost all political at this point or anytime someone gets indicted who's in politics it's almost
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:02.840]  always a political we live in a i mean i'm an enemy of the state we live in strange times
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:07.240]  where they're using political prosecution that's i am not exaggerating it's a politically motivated
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:11.880]  prosecution process now where people who they disagree with journalists they don't like they
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:16.440]  try to put them in jail they're trying to put a top fox news reporter in jail because he talked to
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:21.880]  one of the state department people on record about north korea and is north korea really capable
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:26.200]  of launching an attack that's what a journalist is supposed to do but that's why the debate about
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:31.320]  what is journalism and who is a journalist is central just like with the abortion debate what
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:36.040]  is a human life or when to begin that's all central this is what you heard diane feinstein she will
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:41.400]  judge she will judge who a journalist is now she gets her bill passed and they'll strip everyone
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:45.320]  else let's play this clip get a final comment on anything else and then let you go i know you've
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:50.760]  got stuff to do a project veritas james o'keith here is the latest video making national news
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:59.480]  with the with the globalist tart wendy davis uh the abortion queen uh making jokes about uh the
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:04.760]  attorney general who by the way is fighting carbon taxes fighting the shutdown of our power plants
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:09.880]  fighting agenda 21 i know people that know him personally he's a really good guy and that's why
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:18.840]  they hate him here it is battleground texas a group that is formed to turn texas blue
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:24.120]  a group of obama campaign alumni formed battleground texas with the thought that if they can turn
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:29.000]  texas blue nationally republicans will struggle to win presidential elections
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:38.680]  this is uh will davis with battleground texas there is an enthusiasm level which i was just
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.680]  unprepared for i'm really wondering how this is going to work out since he's in a wheelchair
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:49.960]  and most the slogans are stand with wendy
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:57.400]  that's in our subconscious now so i think to me from a psychological point of view how it's
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:03.640]  gonna play out and here you all are 11 months before the campaign election day to work on
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:11.000]  our behalf and you are the secret weapon you are the secret weapon yeah elections are on
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:17.480]  someone that she's too stupid to be governor yeah battleground had to tell her that you know
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:28.760]  we're gonna support you and we have to convince her what i think is amazing is he's in a wheelchair
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:38.600]  but he has no sympathy for anyone or anyone he may have a personality disorder first of all
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:44.840]  not good looking he didn't speak very well he didn't have a good personality and he said we would be
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:53.640]  here's battleground texas today have you all heard about you i'm getting new people registered
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:59.880]  making sure that people know exactly how to vote have you registered to vote for wendy no just uh
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:04.680]  in general you got a wendy davis sticker right by it i do i'm not registering to vote for her
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:12.120]  my husband is not politically active we had received absentee forms and i just
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:18.200]  found his name on one i mean is that okay i don't think that's legal but i'll i'll do like
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:30.120]  lisa did i didn't hear you say that and again think about how these these idiots that were
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:34.520]  supporters of obama that doesn't mean support even romney it's that's how it's rigged they
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:40.280]  have all been conned by obama he's libed to him on every front and they still don't care and you
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:46.520]  look in their eyes they are the dumbest stupidest people but then they're always led by these these
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:53.000]  these these weak but also evil control freaks uh that the you know that really do want to take
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.480]  over society james oh keith any other comments about the work you've got going on or things that

[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:31.000]  the stock markets the globalist control unlimited fiat currency through derivatives and other
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:36.920]  manipulations before they would just do for every dollar in the bank or every pound in the bank you
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:41.480]  you could loan out 10 and the globalists took over the world with that now it's just unlimited so
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:47.160]  they don't care if they shut everything down in fact they want to do that and if people start
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:54.600]  valuing a good economy again and start thinking of themselves as empowered individuals that are
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:56:01.080]  actually affecting the system and not just jellyfish that just receive propaganda we will turn the
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:07.560]  tide who are the globalist upset with who is the Atlantic council and the cfr upset with empowered

[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.880]  recipient of it hey you in you don't get the diplomatic community to commit crimes don't
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:30.760]  you get it they're all exempt from what they do to us that is the ultimate form of discrimination
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:39.320]  but oh they're busy like oh gay oh black oh to try to divert off into the stuff that's a nonissue
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:46.520]  now it's a nonissue because they don't want to discuss the other issues the Ku Klux Klan
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:53.320]  lost in the 60s so they flipped the script and that's why you look at msnbc it sounds like a
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:57:01.080]  clan rally but it's against white people and gun ownership and libertarianism it's sick big city
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:05.000]  politics where they divide the cities up and play groups off against each other that's what they
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:09.640]  base the society off of look at this article out of cnet news man runs into burning home to save
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.760]  his xbox a canvas man cannot bear the idea of being without his favorite gaming device so he risked
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:21.320]  his life to save the xbox abc 15 reported could have been killed ran into it in front of witnesses
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:29.480]  and uh it's just amazing but uh uh they'll probably say he's a hero on the news or something
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:33.880]  but if he'd have run in for his child well he'd have been tasered like happened a month or so
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:39.000]  ago the guy ran into get his child and firefighters told the police now he shouldn't go in there
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:45.880]  so they uh they tasered him you know how about you just let him go in nope you couldn't stop him
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:49.880]  he wants to risk his life let him do it no no no there's only one thing that's illegal in this
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.000]  world now that's being honorable standing up to bullies in england if you fight back against a
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:01.960]  mugger they will put you in prison for decades the muggers get nothing when gypsy steal people's
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:08.440]  motorhomes travel trailers they get to keep them and it's politically incorrect to not say no gypsies
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:15.800]  deserve your motorhome understand that because it's a criminal government ladies and gentlemen and
[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:21.800]  they don't want you to be able to stand up so being a man is the ultimate crime being a good
[02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:26.280]  woman's being ultimate crime being honorable is the ultimate crime running into a burning building
