[00:00.000 --> 00:07.920]  you have the power humanity has the power we have the power do you want to
[00:07.920 --> 00:16.000]  fight you better believe you got one rallying patriots worldwide in defense
[00:16.000 --> 00:25.160]  of human liberty it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen I am back in the saddle
[00:25.160 --> 00:29.600]  back in the Central Texas Command Center back in the crow's nest in the
[00:29.600 --> 00:38.640]  cockpit and I am ready wow the Supreme Court ruled that Obama can't keep
[00:38.640 --> 00:41.720]  bringing illegals in and violating the law so he came out and said I don't care
[00:41.720 --> 00:45.640]  what they say I'm gonna continue it but it gets worse it's mainstream news that
[00:45.640 --> 00:50.000]  the UN is actually running the program we already told you that but it's now in
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.320]  mainstream news mainstream TV is reporting it let's go to this report
[00:54.320 --> 00:58.000]  though on the British exit and how big this really is for everybody out there
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.440]  this is a devastating victory for humanity I'm telling you we are
[01:01.440 --> 01:05.800]  turning the tide we've not completely won yet but this is a massive event here's
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.960]  John bound report the New World Order is getting its butt kicked at a high noon
[01:09.960 --> 01:14.840]  thankfully the highly suspicious demise of Supreme Court Justice Antonin
[01:14.840 --> 01:20.080]  Scalia has for the time being not benefactor in the Supreme Court's decision
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.120]  on Obama's dangerously lawless immigration policy as Obama pushes the
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.800]  country to the brink of anarchy of course it didn't take long for the Obama
[01:29.800 --> 01:34.200]  administration to thumb its nose at the deadlocked judicial branch and the will
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.160]  of the American people deferred action policy that has been in place for the
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.880]  last four years is not affected by this rule enforcement priorities developed by
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.520]  my administration are not affected by this ruling this means that the people
[01:48.520 --> 01:55.400]  who might have benefited from the expanded deferred action policies long-term
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.520]  residents raising children who are Americans or legal residents they will
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.480]  remain low priorities for enforcement but like a castle made of sand the
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.320]  fragile globalist secret world government has been dealt a strong blow by
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.240]  the waves of consciousness inevitably finding a way to the shore of a free
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.880]  world Adon Salazar writes Nigel Farage the leader of the UK's independence
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.440]  party which played a huge part in mobilizing UK citizens behind the
[02:24.440 --> 02:28.760]  Brexit speculated the momentum behind the results could usher in a Trump
[02:28.760 --> 02:33.720]  presidency with the Brexit debacle landing in the laps of the self-serving
[02:33.720 --> 02:38.840]  arrogant Bilderberg scum a propulsion of liberty is accelerating and the
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.880]  globalists know it brace yourself for planetary turbulence the New World
[02:43.880 --> 02:48.560]  Order will either go quietly in the night as they wisely should or their
[02:48.560 --> 02:53.960]  maniacal desperation to rule the world will result in more false flags and
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.840]  order out of chaos ultimately winding its way down the path toward a very
[02:58.840 --> 03:03.800]  public downfall people have been asking how will the Brexit affect the United
[03:03.800 --> 03:08.200]  States will it impact the stock market the Federal Reserve's interest rate
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.400]  global diplomatic relations these questions are all based on a ruinous
[03:13.400 --> 03:18.280]  stagnant counterfeit system devouring the sovereignty of nations that must be
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.880]  finally recognized and dismantled presidential candidate Donald Trump
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.040]  congratulated the UK for voting to assert its independence from the EU and
[03:27.040 --> 03:30.400]  encouraged the American people in November to also assert their
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.960]  independence from the global elite you know I said this was going to happen and
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.600]  I think that it's a great thing and we will see but I think it's gonna be a
[03:38.600 --> 03:44.480]  great thing and he was basically they took back their country that's a great
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.960]  thing following the British vote to exit the EU Trump said the election results
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.640]  marked a shift toward more nationalistic tendencies the Trump campaign said in a
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.360]  statement come November the American people will have the chance to re-
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.440]  declare their independence Americans will have a chance to vote for trade
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.960]  immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first they will have the
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.320]  chance to reject today's rule by the global elite and to embrace real change
[04:11.320 --> 04:16.280]  that delivers a government of buy-in for the people Trump continued I hope
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.800]  America is watching it will soon be time to believe in America again as info
[04:21.800 --> 04:27.080]  wars has reported countless times the idea for the European Union globalist
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.080]  superstate came directly out of discussions held at the secretive
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.360]  Bilderberg group conference in 1955 at which European politicians considered
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.680]  the necessity to bring German people into a common European market as quickly
[04:40.680 --> 04:45.960]  as possible the lunacy of the global elite can't survive once their dark
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.800]  secrets are completely exposed Thomas Jefferson once said nothing can stop the
[04:51.800 --> 04:56.240]  man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goals and nothing on earth
[04:56.240 --> 05:00.720]  can help the man with the wrong not a group you develop living defense for us

[05:04.800 --> 05:09.240]  waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.360]  make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my
[05:13.360 --> 05:18.360]  system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything

[05:34.280 --> 05:38.920]  clove bud the organic wormwood I recommend doing a parasite plans at
[05:38.920 --> 05:42.040]  least twice a year all right well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm
[05:42.040 --> 05:45.160]  going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense info

[07:15.880 --> 07:22.280]  wars.com forward slash show because there's a war on for your mind those of
[07:22.280 --> 07:25.880]  you that are awake those of you that know what's happening you can see that
[07:25.880 --> 07:29.520]  the fight against globalism the fight against world government has now been
[07:29.520 --> 07:33.960]  drug out in the open and the forces of human liberty and self-determination and
[07:33.960 --> 07:38.800]  sovereignty of the individual and the nation state of the man and the woman
[07:38.800 --> 07:44.520]  are now becoming central they've denied this globalist program is going on
[07:44.520 --> 07:48.400]  forever because if you deny reality and people live in a fantasy land well then
[07:48.400 --> 07:53.080]  you're never threatened as an elite but we in the liberty movement worldwide the
[07:53.080 --> 07:58.920]  pro human pro Renaissance true liberal movement that Thomas Jefferson is the
[07:58.920 --> 08:05.080]  greatest example of are beginning to win the info war on every front the
[08:05.080 --> 08:09.040]  globalist still have the centralized control but they've robbed it fraudulently
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.080]  they have gotten into control by deceit and it is illegitimate it is fraud it
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.360]  is no and void we're on the March the global technotronic
[08:18.360 --> 08:26.120]  technocracy is on the run obviously the Brexit took place Thursday in the
[08:26.120 --> 08:30.280]  spite massive election fraud with people's votes being reversed and
[08:30.280 --> 08:36.680]  harassment and and demonization campaigns England voted to get out of the
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.640]  European Union because it maintained some of its sovereignty when it entered
[08:41.640 --> 08:49.600]  the UK but now Scotland is threatening to try to block that vote along with
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.000]  Northern Ireland but shows why it's not good to ever wave your rights into a
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.880]  larger so-called Union but this is a devastating victory the fight's not over
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.600]  but once you admit there's a world government once you admit the EU is a
[09:05.600 --> 09:10.200]  central hub of that once the statements of the former head of the EU Herman
[09:10.200 --> 09:13.240]  von Rumpen and others about we're establishing world government through
[09:13.240 --> 09:17.000]  the EU merging with the American Union and the Asian Union I mean these are
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.120]  real video clips that I have in my film the Obama deception that I have in my
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.120]  film fall the Republic I mean I have scores of these clips of a British
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.520]  prime ministers and US senators and German chancellors saying we're
[09:31.520 --> 09:35.480]  establishing a private global corporate government with world taxes through the
[09:35.480 --> 09:39.920]  EU it is the model of it we're going to get rid of our borders and we're going
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.200]  to merge with the Middle East and merge with Africa that's what the EU is doing
[09:44.200 --> 09:49.680]  now outside of law once that debate is forced out in the open there's no
[09:49.680 --> 09:54.760]  reversing it oh the Federal Reserve's not private it's federal well everybody
[09:54.760 --> 10:00.080]  now knows it really is private and it was a giant scam in national polls 95
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.680]  percent in Gallup wanted audited we've gone from one person 20 years ago in
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.760]  Congress sponsoring the bill to it passing the house and narrowly being
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.400]  blocked in the Senate oh but they called us tinfoil hat people well that gets a
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.680]  little old just like we told people 20 years ago there was a plan to phase out
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.400]  the gas tax and give you a tax by the mile with a tracker box in your car
[10:26.400 --> 10:33.240]  that's now being implemented in more than 16 states next year exactly as we
[10:33.240 --> 10:37.520]  said it would be because we were reading the MIT reports we were reading the big
[10:37.520 --> 10:43.040]  UN plans we were reading the big consortium meeting documents on air and
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.360]  now on the West Coast Oregon launching program to tax drivers by the mile and
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.040]  I have the Washington Post here East Coast states want to tax drivers travel
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.600]  not their gas and track everywhere you go and what you do and of course they've
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.200]  already done this in areas of Europe on average they double the cost of travel
[11:00.200 --> 11:07.400]  turning your car into a taxi but I digress they want to keep us from ever
[11:07.400 --> 11:12.360]  having a debate about what's really going on it's like the TPP the Trans
[11:12.360 --> 11:17.960]  Pacific Partnerships been negotiated for seven years in secret Congress wasn't
[11:17.960 --> 11:23.040]  even allowed to read it in full wars and drudge and other Patriot sites like
[11:23.040 --> 11:26.480]  WorldNet Daily made a big deal about it the last few years and so in the last
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.400]  six months Congress was allowed to go in and read one page at a time but not
[11:31.400 --> 11:37.680]  telling anyone what was in it how how could Congress even under pressure be
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.280]  only allowed to look at it one page at a time when it was over 12,000 pages
[11:42.280 --> 11:44.400]  long
[11:44.800 --> 11:51.560]  well how does the EU appoint leaders in places like Greece and Italy and now they
[11:51.560 --> 11:55.600]  want to do it in Spain they want to do it they appoint the leaders and it's
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.240]  always a former head of Goldman Sachs isn't that funny and Goldman Sachs is
[12:01.240 --> 12:04.800]  at the heart of funding a world government project this is a Goldman
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.000]  Sachs JP Morgan project more than anything else it's planetary corporate rule
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.120]  and they want to just keep us in the point of always debating with the
[12:14.120 --> 12:20.360]  New Yorker magazine and raw story and more than 50 other articles I saw in the
[12:20.360 --> 12:23.080]  last two days didn't even have time to read them all only read five or six
[12:23.080 --> 12:30.680]  attacking yours truly saying I'm insane and Donald Trump's insane when he says
[12:30.680 --> 12:37.560]  that the British exit vote is a blow to globalism a blow to world government a
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.200]  blow to unelected bureaucracy and they quote us and make fun of it and then
[12:42.200 --> 12:49.920]  twist quotes and things I've said to make it look like I'm saying crazy things
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.920]  but that doesn't work because even the Associated Press has the headline that
[12:54.920 --> 12:59.440]  the British exit empowers Trump is a sign of populism and a blow to global
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.000]  government even George Soros came out and said that it's it's crazy it's like
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.640]  if I say the sky is blue play you video of it being blue and they say no you're
[13:09.640 --> 13:12.880]  crazy you're conspiracy theorist this is a so-called intellectual elite
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.920]  arrogantly running a giant gas lighting operation that's a CIA psychology term
[13:18.920 --> 13:25.600]  where the most famous example is a film based on a play where this guy beats the
[13:25.600 --> 13:28.840]  daylights out of his wife breaks her nose knocks her you know
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.880]  cheekbones in and when she's bleeding he looks at her and says you're insane I
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.720]  didn't hit you and even when she's got witnesses he says he didn't do it and
[13:36.720 --> 13:40.480]  acts super confident and she's so overwhelmed she thinks okay maybe she
[13:40.480 --> 13:45.160]  did it to herself this is the highly suggestible dumb down population but
[13:45.160 --> 13:52.760]  even a dumb down sleeping population at a certain point starts to wake up so this
[13:52.760 --> 13:58.920]  is such an exciting time to be alive because mainstream media has a 6% trust
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.240]  right now in Gallup polls and in a people's so what are they gonna do what
[14:04.240 --> 14:07.520]  are they gonna do as they try to announce world government and global
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.440]  carbon taxes and taxing you by the mile and smart meters taxing you in your
[14:11.440 --> 14:14.640]  house and tracking everything you do and admitting they're doing it to you and
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.560]  Zuckerberg I forgot Zuckerberg was in the New York Times guys type it in I'm
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.160]  into cover this Friday and didn't Zuckerberg covers up his webcam camera
[14:24.160 --> 14:31.080]  and you should too oh my gosh 21 years after I said cover up cameras that were
[14:31.080 --> 14:36.760]  starting to come in standard on some apples I said it'll soon be ubiquitous
[14:36.760 --> 14:40.040]  and they're gonna watch you with them and tax you with them a few years after I
[14:40.040 --> 14:42.840]  warned of that because an NSA insider warned me and said they're already doing
[14:42.840 --> 14:50.760]  it Google patented it and announced in 2003 that they were gonna start watching
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.720]  and listening to you and sending it through third-party aggregators for
[14:54.720 --> 15:01.360]  corporate data mining oh but do I get an award for telling you first no no no
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.320]  I'm the cook but Zuckerberg covers his up and says you should too and the FBI
[15:07.320 --> 15:12.400]  director came out two months ago and said you should cover up your webcam
[15:12.400 --> 15:18.960]  because it's not just corporations breaking in but what about your smartphone
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.000]  can somebody bring me a quote smartphone in an a a a a Apple phone so I
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  don't bring mine with me very often I don't have mine it's a limited weapon
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.120]  system I only use upload videos as a shelf-based computer I know it's got
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.800]  globalist tech and tracking no one's telling you though there's a built-in
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.600]  camera on this and by federal law it's not allowed to be turned off even when
[15:40.600 --> 15:46.360]  your cameras off even when your phone is physically turned off under the 1996

[20:28.720 --> 20:33.160]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central we're here weekdays I
[20:33.160 --> 20:38.520]  return live Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Central thank you so much for joining us coming
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.000]  up in the next segment I'm gonna get back into the British exit this death
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.800]  blow to the EU which is a key world government project this is such a huge
[20:46.800 --> 20:50.400]  victory but also want to break down on the globalist you're going to strike
[20:50.400 --> 20:55.200]  back I predicted this on Thursday and Friday they are now doing exactly as I
[20:55.200 --> 20:59.000]  predicted it's not hard to understand them though they've done this to countless
[20:59.000 --> 21:07.440]  other nations and regions it's very very formulaic but speaking of that the UN
[21:07.440 --> 21:15.240]  program that we see taking place in Europe the United States is funded and
[21:15.240 --> 21:19.240]  pushed by the big central banks that want to have cheap labor and want to
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.720]  basically play different nation states and populations off against each other
[21:22.720 --> 21:29.800]  it's classic divide and conquer that's no secret but if you look at the UN
[21:29.800 --> 21:40.120]  migrant borders council and the holiday they've created world refugee day that
[21:40.120 --> 21:45.080]  they just celebrated last week this is where the globalist weaponized third
[21:45.080 --> 21:48.960]  world populations from the Middle East and bring them into Europe from Latin
[21:48.960 --> 21:53.000]  America and Asia and bring them into the United States and then organize them
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.760]  into internal political groups which are then given welfare at levels even
[21:58.760 --> 22:05.280]  higher than US Social Security recipients 17,000 plus dollars a year in
[22:05.280 --> 22:12.360]  basic benefits to leverage out the domestic population this is classical
[22:12.360 --> 22:20.520]  tyranny classical subterfuge over the top treason now we've been pointing out
[22:20.520 --> 22:26.840]  that the last three years Obama went from very lax enforcement of illegals
[22:26.840 --> 22:30.720]  including illegals that have felony backgrounds and convictions aggravated
[22:30.720 --> 22:36.600]  felons rapist he arsonist bank robbers you name it and went to total catch and
[22:36.600 --> 22:41.800]  release about four years ago and he didn't get in trouble for that so then
[22:41.800 --> 22:46.720]  Obama went to the mother of all tyrannies the illegals get into the
[22:46.720 --> 22:53.080]  US on trains and on buses Mexico lets them in from South America and Central
[22:53.080 --> 22:58.200]  America but doesn't let them stay there and once they get into the country
[22:58.200 --> 23:03.520]  buses are waiting at every major town and city from California to Texas and
[23:03.520 --> 23:09.160]  all in between Arizona New Mexico Nevada you name it and they bust them to
[23:09.160 --> 23:15.080]  Democratic Party facilities to public schools to Catholic churches where they
[23:15.080 --> 23:20.520]  are then put on welfare and given stipends and then part of that money is
[23:20.520 --> 23:25.760]  donated back to the Democrats you cannot make this up now we broke this two
[23:25.760 --> 23:30.360]  years ago the border patrol called us ice called us we said well thank you
[23:30.360 --> 23:34.680]  for giving this is this inside info they said listen mr. Jones we gave this to
[23:34.680 --> 23:38.960]  Fox News we gave us the New York Times before you none of them will report
[23:38.960 --> 23:44.200]  we drove down but on Salazar Jacare Jackson Kit Daniels Joe Biggs and met
[23:44.200 --> 23:49.800]  and did the interviews with the border patrol agents faces blurt out and their
[23:49.800 --> 23:54.640]  voices scrambled and then we went to where they said go and there were
[23:54.640 --> 24:00.720]  dozens of buses four times a day pulling up in McAllen Texas it's a small
[24:00.720 --> 24:08.160]  town and the emergency manager told us yo yo we bring them in the border
[24:08.160 --> 24:11.520]  patrol gives them vouchers of money we put them on Greyhound buses and send
[24:11.520 --> 24:18.880]  them to wherever they want to go no one covered this but Fox a little bit
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.760]  because the border patrol union head was on and said we complete the smuggling
[24:22.760 --> 24:26.520]  process we've warned people no one will tell the public we get threatened with
[24:26.520 --> 24:32.480]  our jobs if we tell you so Jacare Jackson went down and got the report now
[24:32.480 --> 24:38.400]  all these years later two years later this was two Junes ago here is KRGV this
[24:38.400 --> 24:41.800]  is so amazing I'm not gonna play the whole report here you can see it in
[24:41.800 --> 24:48.080]  fours.com but they report on it like it's no big deal they're oh the UN more
[24:48.080 --> 24:52.720]  Central Americans headed to the US that's what Obama admitted last week the
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.920]  State Department has videos that we played here admitting that they get
[24:56.920 --> 25:00.720]  their orders from the UN remember what Obama said I'm allowed to go into Syria
[25:00.720 --> 25:04.640]  I'm allowed to go into Libya because I have a UN authorization and I have NATO
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.480]  authorization and generals and others went before Congress and Congress
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.840]  senators said you get your authority from Congress from us they go no we get
[25:12.840 --> 25:18.440]  it from NATO in the UN just like Merkel says she gets it from the UN they're
[25:18.440 --> 25:21.320]  like it's illegal for you to bring these people in here unvetted she goes well I
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.800]  have the UN I have the EU I have NATO we're already in this global government
[25:26.800 --> 25:32.920]  so they have KRGV TV in McAllen Texas and they report like it's oh just helping
[25:32.920 --> 25:39.280]  the locals helping the citizens helping everyone you'd never know they say all
[25:39.280 --> 25:42.000]  their immigrants yeah they came here illegally but we're just helping them
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.440]  and we're loving and and we get them on the buses no discussion of where they
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.080]  go what they do it's just oh the UN gives the order see they don't announce it
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.240]  like red dawn the UN is invading we're under UN control martial law it's just
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.280]  Germany and these other countries are under a civil emergency and Greece gets
[25:58.280 --> 26:01.680]  its presidents appointed now and so does Italy and yeah we're gonna bring in
[26:01.680 --> 26:04.800]  five million people from jihad nations and if you criticize it we're gonna
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.360]  arrest you yeah there's no more free speech yeah see that's just all the UN
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.440]  says get ready for record numbers because they're running the program at the
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.080]  refugee centers making a deal with Mexico to allow them in but they don't get to
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.240]  stay in Mexico they come here the Mexico came out last week and said we're
[26:22.240 --> 26:25.720]  about to go bankrupt we got to stop this we got too many Latin Americans pouring
[26:25.720 --> 26:31.400]  in our borders collapsing oh I'm so sorry you're getting paid billions by the
[26:31.400 --> 26:35.600]  globalist to allow this to happen through US taxpayer money Mexico is paid
[26:35.600 --> 26:42.040]  five billion a year to allow this to happen look that up now now now how do I
[26:42.040 --> 26:45.480]  communicate with the average dumbed-down American who just sees a newscast it's
[26:45.480 --> 26:51.560]  like oh we're helping people the UN said to oh the UN suing Sheriff Arpaio
[26:51.560 --> 26:56.120]  because he arrest he legals he how evil he arrest he legals that commit crimes
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.880]  how horrible so we're gonna go to break it on but first I want to play part of
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.800]  Jacari Jackson's report two years ago here's the article upon info wars.com
[27:06.800 --> 27:12.440]  we've reposted it flashback Obama admin bussing legals deep in the US in 2014
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.640]  info wars broke how Obama admin was bringing any legals via bus and to see
[27:17.640 --> 27:22.720]  how controlled it is no one picked it up six months later the New York Times in
[27:22.720 --> 27:26.960]  one little blurb admitted they come in and then Obama has them shipped to other
[27:26.960 --> 27:32.720]  areas and released here's another one here's the original article June 18 2014
[27:32.720 --> 27:40.040]  caught red-handed border patrol paying to ship illegals deep in to the United
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.240]  States exclusive federal government works to keep illegals inside US while
[27:44.240 --> 27:48.280]  passing the cost on the American taxpayers and now the TB is pouring in
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.280]  the diseases we've got to pay for that but let's go out to break with a clip of
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.800]  jacari talking to the emergency manager head who's admitting it all what
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.360]  happened today in particular is that the border patrol dropped off some they
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.160]  call them detainees but obviously they're not detained after they drop them off
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.040]  and normally they have tickets or a range transportation to go somewhere in
[28:11.040 --> 28:15.640]  the interior well today apparently for some logistical reasons some of them
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.400]  didn't have transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow right
[28:20.400 --> 28:26.520]  and so we're having to find places to shelter for tonight so we access some
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.320]  resources that we have so why is the border patrol bringing them here they're
[28:32.320 --> 28:35.640]  not bringing them here they're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.280]  where the border patrol understands that they have transportation I'll stop right
[28:40.280 --> 28:43.520]  there they give them vouchers watch the whole report and then the city gets to
[28:43.520 --> 28:47.320]  pay for it all the taxpayers because after all that's our job right we pay for
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.800]  everything for everybody we're evil and racist if we don't we'll be back on the
[28:50.800 --> 28:58.200]  other side I'm Alex Jones to the full video and info wars dot com jump eggs
[28:58.200 --> 29:02.280]  here with info wars dot com today Donald Trump made an announcement on his

[29:38.160 --> 29:42.520]  November the American people will have the chance to redeclare their

[33:38.960 --> 33:48.040]  Nigel Farage in their victory speech on Friday after the UK voted to leave the
[33:48.040 --> 33:55.920]  European Union and understand this is on record the UK never voted to enter it a
[33:55.920 --> 34:02.280]  be even 10 years ago if you talked about the EU having governmental powers they
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.080]  called you a conspiracy theorist I remember being on air 20 years ago
[34:07.080 --> 34:11.320]  talking about the EU on air and they would have articles saying it didn't
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.360]  exist and conspiracy theorists were talking about it this is the magnitude
[34:16.360 --> 34:22.440]  of the hoaxing just like the Federal Reserve is federal and don't believe the
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.440]  conspiracy theorist when its charter is public it is a private consortium of
[34:26.440 --> 34:32.720]  private banks it has private shareholders now everyone knows that that's admitted
[34:32.720 --> 34:35.000]  even by the Federal Reserve once they couldn't cover it up they want to of
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.120]  course we're independent that means we're private you can't I mean I could
[34:38.120 --> 34:41.200]  buy it but I can play Alan Greenspan for you saying it on Lair News Hour if you
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.040]  want 10 years ago want me to think of all the thousands of articles and in
[34:47.040 --> 34:53.600]  headlines the Federal Reserve is federal yeah and so is you know federal
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.520]  credit union and so is federal ammunition and so is federal air conditioning
[34:57.520 --> 35:05.680]  bull bull bull there's the headline yeah the Federal Reserve mentions 12 banks
[35:05.680 --> 35:11.000]  are private not government entities that's in response to lawsuits all right
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.280]  let's just stop right there that's from 2011 but imagine we go down and show
[35:17.280 --> 35:22.960]  buses lined up just like 12 up in a time or more loaded four times a day with
[35:22.960 --> 35:26.680]  the illegals from all over the world and the media is like they're just children
[35:26.680 --> 35:30.920]  we're just helping children then it came out 17 percent were children had
[35:30.920 --> 35:34.480]  nothing to do with it was their whole families they're like that's okay why do
[35:34.480 --> 35:37.480]  you hate children everything's a lie everything's a gimmick everything's a
[35:37.480 --> 35:44.440]  well he's just helping children no outside of law Obama just started saying
[35:44.440 --> 35:49.520]  come here it's free it's open just like Von Rumpia the head of the EU did six
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.160]  years ago and Merkel and Haland all the leaders of these countries transferring
[35:55.160 --> 36:00.000]  their power to the EU said to a bunch of Muslim radical nations come in come in
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.600]  everything's free and they showed up five million of them they just called
[36:03.600 --> 36:07.880]  them Syrian refugees the vast majority aren't from Syria they're invaders of
[36:07.880 --> 36:16.200]  Syria and that's all come out too so here is how they propagandizes when they
[36:16.200 --> 36:20.200]  announced the UN's running this and the UN controls this oh it's just charity oh
[36:20.200 --> 36:28.320]  they're just here and then we just put them on the buses and they just go
[36:28.320 --> 36:33.800]  somewhere and we don't test them for TB or the bubonic plague or all these
[36:33.800 --> 36:39.000]  hundreds of different ailments and parasites which they admit the news I've
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.640]  got the stacks here 22% of refugees have TB drug resistant here it is you know
[36:44.640 --> 36:48.960]  just TB cases exploding across the country six new diseases that weren't
[36:48.960 --> 36:52.440]  even in the US or now here they just take the kids put them in school next to
[36:52.440 --> 36:59.720]  your kids Anderson high where I went to school has 200 plus Syrian refugees and
[36:59.720 --> 37:06.480]  no testing was done that's one school in Austin we called a bunch of schools
[37:06.480 --> 37:09.880]  it's thousands in the high schools alone my god who knows the numbers of the
[37:09.880 --> 37:12.760]  adults and they tell us not even a thousand have come into Texas in the
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.880]  last year I can call three or four high schools it's over a thousand we have no
[37:17.880 --> 37:20.760]  idea how many are being brought in from Mexico China
[37:20.760 --> 37:29.560]  Syria Iraq Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia won't take one of these people this is a
[37:29.560 --> 37:33.760]  joke to bankrupt the country this is war against the nation but by the time it
[37:33.760 --> 37:39.600]  hits KRGV television it's he's a firefighter and a patriot he's here
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.960]  helping good people it's like well I just feel good helping people because they
[37:42.960 --> 37:46.760]  tell him hey they're refugees hey hey we're helping them hey they get here we
[37:46.760 --> 37:52.160]  just ship them somewhere but when you come across the border on come the
[37:52.160 --> 37:58.640]  gloves that's ABC news reporting it let here let's play a short clip of this and
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.600]  then I want to get to Nigel Farage here it is happening right now the United
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.800]  Nations says there are more Central Americans headed to the Valley where they
[38:07.800 --> 38:13.680]  cross the border illegally now let's back up because we did a report this
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.840]  week where we play the State Department UN refugee liaison at the UN saying we
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.160]  get the authority to bring these people in because the UN they run the program
[38:22.160 --> 38:28.440]  just like in Europe so see the UN's running this you get used to all the UN
[38:28.440 --> 38:32.920]  suing over over a sheriff arresting an illegal for drunk driving all the UN
[38:32.920 --> 38:36.000]  setting up strong cities to tell our police departments how to operate I
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.480]  mean this is all really going on
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.960]  Loretta Lynch remember three months ago met with the UN and announced billions
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.000]  in federal funding to set up UN offices in every major city to watch our police
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.360]  because we've got strong cities you think having some communists community
[38:54.360 --> 38:57.880]  organizer Obama running around stirring stuff up's bad wait till the UN's
[38:57.880 --> 39:04.000]  involved and now it is with their refugee program that the founder of the EU the
[39:04.000 --> 39:11.800]  founder the founder has now moved down from the top position to be the head of
[39:11.800 --> 39:18.160]  the refugee program oh Peter Sutherland let's finish the report here it is
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.680]  happening right now the United Nations says there are more Central Americans
[39:22.680 --> 39:26.320]  headed to the Valley where they cross the border illegally the channel fires
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.640]  Christian von pricing joins us with more on conditions forcing them to flee and
[39:30.640 --> 39:36.520]  what you want to do is back it up 10 seconds please the UN that forced them
[39:36.520 --> 39:40.760]  to the communism the socialism the UN corrupt programs that run most these
[39:40.760 --> 39:45.040]  countries the IMF World Bank collapsing them creating the Arab Spring on record
[39:45.040 --> 39:48.800]  the West funded that putting jihadis in control of countries that are our allies
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.360]  and stable were Christians and Jews and Muslims lived in peace together from
[39:52.360 --> 39:56.760]  Egypt to Libya to Syria bring them all here and then oh they're gonna save us
[39:56.760 --> 40:01.000]  from the problem the exact same program they're running in Europe my gut tells
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.840]  me it's probably a million Muslim refugees I really look at the numbers
[40:03.840 --> 40:08.240]  of all the cities if my high school got 230 plus and I called other high schools
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.640]  they were getting 150 270 every high school and then I called elementary's
[40:12.640 --> 40:15.280]  they're getting them but wouldn't say the numbers it's on their websites at
[40:15.280 --> 40:20.040]  Anderson High because they're begging for help who knows the true numbers
[40:20.040 --> 40:24.920]  they're here illegally they're from the EU but the UN says it's okay because
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.160]  they're fleeing something they're playing the UN here it is
[40:28.160 --> 40:31.560]  Americans headed to the valley where they cross the border illegally the

[47:30.480 --> 47:37.600]  I know fear of letting these people win and being a slave folks think I'm
[47:37.600 --> 47:40.560]  fearless because I get in their face and then and don't care if they come after

[48:27.880 --> 48:32.720]  trendy 20 years after I told you they were doing it they know they've lost
[48:32.720 --> 48:38.760]  they know you're aware of it so now they want to act like they're with us but I
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.520]  only know the fear of these tyrants winning and actually dominating
[48:43.520 --> 48:48.680]  humanity and in species death because I have the race consciousness of humanity
[48:48.680 --> 48:54.120]  like everybody else does but mine is very active and I'm very upset I'm not
[48:54.120 --> 48:57.320]  worried about my own personal death I'm worried about the death of my children
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.440]  their cultural death your children's cultural death our future because
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.200]  everybody was betting on us before I'm betting on everybody else going forward
[49:05.200 --> 49:10.920]  sure eternal life is genetic and the globalists know that and are destroying
[49:10.920 --> 49:15.080]  our genetics and merging us with machines and playing God and saying we're
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.520]  ugly and bad and fallen and that they are gonna be gods we're in a science
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.040]  fiction dystopic movie okay and so of course I'm excited when I talk about it
[49:24.040 --> 49:29.160]  I've read probably 30 books they've written hundreds of white papers thousands
[49:29.160 --> 49:36.680]  of statements admitting this is their worldview and their cosmology and I'm
[49:36.680 --> 49:40.800]  just an average fighting Texan telling you right now I'm not signing on to this
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.440]  crap and I cannot tell you because I'm a journalist how many times off record they
[49:46.440 --> 49:50.360]  say hey you get it of course you understand it you should join us the
[49:50.360 --> 49:53.920]  general public is profane they're ugly they're fallen they're gonna tear you
[49:53.920 --> 49:57.840]  apart they don't want to be free and it's true about 80% of people want to be
[49:57.840 --> 50:02.640]  slaves on average but 20 maybe 30% don't want to be slaves and I'm not gonna
[50:02.640 --> 50:08.360]  just shine on to evil plus the globalist helped dumb people down to control
[50:08.360 --> 50:14.040]  them it'd be one thing if they were this stupid on accident you sit there
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.800]  with these formulaic systems of bull and I and I and I watch it unfold and I'm
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.880]  not gonna sign on to screwing people over because that goes against my basic
[50:24.880 --> 50:32.440]  programming I do have free will but my my basic innate humanity
[50:32.440 --> 50:41.480]  screwing somebody over who hasn't done something to me is like screwing myself
[50:41.480 --> 50:48.400]  it's like cheating myself because I have basic civilization programming and all
[50:48.400 --> 50:51.760]  these cheaters and scammers that live in civilization and act like they're
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.240]  building it because they've hijacked it as they run it down they're the cancer
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.480]  folks they're the problem by the way many people think screwing someone over
[51:01.480 --> 51:04.520]  gets them ahead it's like Jay-Z I have an article here tricked a bunch of his
[51:04.520 --> 51:12.160]  fans that's another one of these people I've got so many of these articles you
[51:12.160 --> 51:17.840]  too as for years runs these scams on iTunes other platforms when you go try
[51:17.840 --> 51:21.520]  to boot it up it loads it on and charges you and even after they get caught
[51:21.520 --> 51:24.680]  doing it they don't care they've expanded it to other platforms like
[51:24.680 --> 51:28.480]  Spotify now you're like oh why do you care about that its point is it's just
[51:28.480 --> 51:33.160]  ridiculous they're robbing millions of people we can't even stop them we can't
[51:33.160 --> 51:38.320]  even organize to stop that stupid little bastard with red sunglasses who
[51:38.320 --> 51:43.640]  rips off all the people for billions and doesn't give even hardly 1% to the
[51:43.640 --> 51:47.360]  starving Africans he claims he's helping
[51:48.680 --> 51:54.640]  there's a special place in hell for these people and I don't care if it's Jay-Z
[51:54.640 --> 52:02.040]  or Kanye West or Bono or any of them I'm sick of them look at Kanye West trick
[52:02.040 --> 52:09.720]  fans into subscribing to title lawsuit claims well of course they do I mean
[52:09.720 --> 52:13.560]  it's all about send me 25 million I'm going broke when he wasn't going broke
[52:13.560 --> 52:18.720]  it's all about pimping his fans getting it over on them that's what a man does
[52:18.720 --> 52:23.560]  no a man-built civilization and technology and advances people and
[52:23.560 --> 52:27.960]  produces art and literature and culture and lifts everything up and is strong
[52:27.960 --> 52:34.600]  they don't sit there and feed on the weak you stupid slave master he's just
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.680]  like the black Africans who sold their own people into slavery he's a slave
[52:39.680 --> 52:45.240]  master he's a pimp selling them there at the dock and so is all the rest of
[52:45.240 --> 52:52.400]  these people like Madonna and Bono and all the rest of them speaking of funding

[55:47.320 --> 55:52.840]  since 2004 to present you can see it exploding in the last year since we
[55:52.840 --> 55:57.240]  introduced Hillary for prison and they go on and even mainstream articles to
[55:57.240 --> 56:02.560]  admit we have some of those screenshots here that Donald Trump has been beating

[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.440]  this is one of the articles up on infowars.com the Pope has come out in this a month ago he's done it again

[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.040]  truly insane
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.040]  meanwhile Trump's been talking about Hillary takes millions from anti gay anti women regimes
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.800]  but they come out and call Trump a sexist and a lot of leftists go along with that
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.520]  because they're not true liberals in the sense of more freedom they're just an
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.160]  authoritarian cult of pseudo-intellectual idiots who can care less about anybody's
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.080]  freedoms including their own they just want to delusionally feel like they're
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:56.120]  on some type of sick winning team I'm gonna get back into the British exit
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.720]  and what a big deal that is coming up at the start of the next segment then I'm

[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.000]  telephone that you'd be to the point and moving forward I know I tend to make
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.680]  people hold forever so that we either have great calls we have horrible calls
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.680]  so that people sit there I'm not going to do that today at the start of the third
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.960]  segment that's only about 18 minutes away I will go directly to your phone
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.960]  calls and the toll-free number to join us on Obama ignoring the Supreme Court
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.120]  oh my gosh when they said same-sex marriage was you know a okay
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.480]  he lit up the White House in a rainbow and then when they say yeah there's a law
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.400]  we you can't just bring in anybody and not even check their ID and legalize them
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.240]  and say they have all the rights of a citizen so the right has the citizen
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.400]  has a right to pay your pay for you and then you're just above the law and tax
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:57.720]  exempt or a god like a mini version of George Soros no I mean that's so crazy
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.440]  in fact it's so crazy I'll be honest with you I can't even believe the globalist
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:11.240]  have gotten this far I mean it's wild that in Europe the United States and
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.600]  Canada they just open the borders up and you'll see Canadian families when I've
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.800]  flown in several times being bitched out and screamed at by customs because they
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.200]  didn't dot an i literally on a customs form and then you'll just see people from
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.800]  China with Chinese passports just oh boom you're in boom you're in boom you're in
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.360]  but they want to break the Canadians because there's some history of western
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.600]  freedom some history of western background some history of Magna Carta oh you're from
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.360]  a country where they sell political dissidents organs and that children are chained up
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.840]  outside the factories on power poles to defecate the street and get one meal a day
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:54.120]  come on in baby that's who we want same thing here and they go oh you're against
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.240]  Chinese people oh because the government has mobile execution vans and they have no
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.960]  rights I'm against them that's how the mental illness of political correctness is like
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:08.280]  knowledge is evil and words are bad being informed is weird I'm a trendy I just want to

[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.920]  laughed at toll-free number to join us this is the sunday number different the weekday number

[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.040]  Joe Bates here with infowars.com.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040]  Exclusive.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.480]  Paranoid Hillary drove to moralize secret service to drink.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.480]  Do drugs?
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]  Have hookers?
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.480]  Says officer who protected Bridezilla.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.640]  A blockbuster book set for release on Monday paints Hillary Clinton as a shrewish and paranoid
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.120]  monster during her time as America's first lady.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.440]  Many turned to alcohol and drugs and performance enhancers and all kinds of other crazy stuff.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.560]  Bryce Byron in his upcoming memoir called Crisis of Character, a book about his 10-year
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.240]  working with Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.400]  Ms. Clinton was a joke.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.640]  She was a fake leader.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.800]  All barred no bite, but in a very real power position as first lady.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.800]  Daily Mail Online is obtained a copy of Byron's book in advance of publication.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.840]  It paints a picture of Hillary's paranoia about the agents and officers protecting
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.320]  her and her family, describing how it bled through in shouting matches between her and
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.320]  Bill Clinton.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.840]  I wonder he's going around and sleeping with other women because you're a raging b**ch.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:23.680]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:49.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:07:19.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.880]  And so, normally, Genesis takes the phone calls up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that's
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.440]  our syndicator, our satellite platform, but the Sunday show is all contiguous.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:37.360]  It's all homogenous, I guess you could say, to this studio on Sundays.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.280]  So that's why the number is different.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.320]  Okay, where to begin?
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:47.120]  Where to start here, obviously, recapping the Brexit, the British exit, despite all
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.160]  the propaganda, all the media demonization, all the lies, huge election fraud that was
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:58.960]  confirmed and reported, still the people of Britain, I guess reaching back to their vestigial
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:06.160]  roots of being the only folks that the Romans couldn't conquer, said no to the EU, and that's
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.160]  because of Lord Monkton and Nigel Farage and others that several decades ago founded
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:19.640]  the UKIP party, and UKIP is pretty much Ron Paul-esque, probably not even as hardcore.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:25.640]  You know, let's say hardcore-wise, I'm a 10, and of course there's folks more hardcore,
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.320]  but I think I get as hardcore as reasonable.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.320]  You can find folks that are 20 or 30 out there, but let's just say on the scale of saying
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.280]  I'm about as radical as you can get safely, but by safely, I mean without feeding into
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.280]  the globalist loop of civil war.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.800]  I mean, I really go as far as I can as I want to wake people up and try to really change
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.240]  society without causing infighting in civil war, and I'm really trying to fix stuff.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.960]  I really believe the pen is mired in the sword, I don't get off on, you know, twisted dreams
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.120]  of physical confrontation.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.920]  The globalists want to go to that because they think they can win that.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.760]  They definitely can't win a velvet revolution of ideas.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:11.480]  Both revolutions are actually intellectual, business, corporate, intellectual, development,
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480]  societal, technological.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.280]  They don't call those revolutions.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.480]  They always want to build, revolution is, you know, killing people because those are
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.960]  the hardest to win.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.120]  Almost all of those are lost, almost all of those create something worse than what you
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:34.160]  had before historically, except for ours, because ours was 90% intellectual, 10% physical.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:40.000]  And the founders said that we had 3% of the country fighting, maybe 2% supporting.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.360]  By the end of the war, it was 30, 40%.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.080]  The British knew it was shifting against them after six years they had to back off.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:53.560]  But ours was a velvet revolution backed up by a gun.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.920]  And it may go to that.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.120]  And God knows I'll be one of the first targets they're going to try to take out, not because
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:07.960]  I'm going to be leading some physical operation, but because I'm an intellectual leader, a
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.880]  born leader.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.640]  And not because I'm even the sharpest knife in the drawer or my elevator doesn't go all
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.240]  the way up to the Valhalla, but I'll tell you this, I'm not out to screw people.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.880]  I got good will.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.360]  I believe in humanity and I have vision, a purpose driven life of wanting others to
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.200]  succeed and wanting to believe in others.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.400]  And because I'm self-confident, and the minute I start trying to think of bringing other
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.480]  people down, I feel weak and pathetic and not like a leader.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:43.840]  And that's what a leader is, is somebody who's first at the scene, ready to take action,
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.040]  not afraid of criticism, to quote Mark Twain in the beginning, a patriot, a scarce man,
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.720]  hated, feared, and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds, it's him to join him because
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.320]  then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:08.440]  And I remember being three years old at the daycare Christmas, whatever you call it, play,
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.200]  and they had like 20 kids there, nice little daycare.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.200]  My mom works at Dallas Morning News, my dad was finishing medical school, he finished
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.240]  the next year, it was a nice little daycare, and they had the thing, and none of the kids
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.600]  would come out, none of them would do the play.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.400]  I'd been given a little role of the moo the cow that brought milk to the baby Jesus.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.840]  And I remember watching all the kids not come out, all of them being scared, all of them
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.720]  not willing to speak, all of them crying, and like a hundred adults out there wanting
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:44.160]  to watch the kids on the little stage they had, and I remember saying, well, I can't
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.200]  let everybody be bummed out, everybody be losers, I remember thinking, I can't let everybody
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.960]  be scared, why are they scared, it's fun to go out and do this, I've got to make everybody
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.440]  happy out there, I've got to go out and deliver these words, and I ran out and said, I'm
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.400]  moo the cow, I bring milk for the baby Jesus.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.640]  And those everybody had a standing ovation, everybody made a joke about it, the thing
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:11.320]  ended, not one child took the stage, from ages three years old to like seven.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.400]  And that's why I'm here fighting the globalists, I'm not going to just sit here and be overrun
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.000]  with propaganda where the UN openly runs open borders and brings in all the people with
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.040]  diseases to collapse the country and admits it's the plan and then tells us it isn't happening
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.800]  when we have video of it, well guess what, years later it's all over the news, years
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.000]  later it's admitted that's going on.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.680]  And I'm not up here saying, oh look, I'm this great leader, kiss my butt, I'm saying you
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.440]  just got to care about other people and not want to be run over and do your own research
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.520]  and you'll be a leader as well.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.640]  The problem is so many real leaders don't ever get involved in leadership because they're
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:54.240]  so humble, well listen, being humble is great, but being a slave is something you don't want
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.520]  to be, so stand up, speak up, get involved today in my humble view.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.800]  We need leaders to stand up and take action.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:08.600]  Speaking of leaders, Nigel Farage, 20 something years ago founded the UKIP party, had no coverage,
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.720]  no support, but kept pointing out the EU is unelected, we're going into it without being
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.640]  able to vote, then they were brought into it without a vote 15 something years ago by
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.080]  Tony Blair, then they pointed out almost all their laws were made by it, now it's banning
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:26.160]  free speech and how it's unelected and how it's evil and finally people said, man you're
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.840]  right and all of a sudden it's the fastest-growing party in Europe and the UK and it's patriot
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:37.240]  and he comes on this show and he's aware of the new world order.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.200]  That shows how in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared and scored,
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:48.080]  but in time, when his cause succeeds the timid join him because then it costs nothing to
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080]  be a patriot.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.360]  I don't want to just be some brain sheep that agrees with the crowd and sells my family
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.760]  out, if I know something's true, if I know something's run by bad people, I'm not a hero
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.560]  because I challenge it, man I'm self-preservation here, I'm somebody's not going to get pushed
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:12.240]  around or run over and I'm willing to die, not because I'm a hero, but because I'm alive,
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.160]  my progeny's going to go on, humanity's going to be successful if we succeed because I'm
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:26.000]  like my ancestors, I'm not going to lay down without a fight and that's called civilization,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.880]  goodwill, being informed, being involved, let's just play a short clip of this, I'll
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.680]  come back and play the rest and then we'll go to your phone calls, but here's somebody
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.480]  came from nowhere to now be the true leader of Europe.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:43.000]  The sun has risen on an independent United Kingdom and just look at it, even the weather's
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.560]  improved, it's been a hell of a long journey this, I first got involved in Eurosceptic
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.320]  Politics 25 years ago and the first election I contested I managed to beat the late great
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:02.200]  screaming Lord Such by 164 votes so I didn't come last and now there are 17 million people
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.520]  that voted for Brexit.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:10.240]  It's a victory for ordinary people, decent people, it's a victory against the big merchant
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.880]  banks, against the big businesses and against big politics and I'm proud of everybody that
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.000]  had the courage in the face of all the threats, everything they were told, they had the guts
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.600]  to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.120]  The election was won in my view in the Midlands of the North and I think it was the old Labour
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.880]  vote that came to us and we particularly as a party campaign as hard as we could in those
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.880]  areas.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:45.880]  There is still a massive disconnect between Westminster, SW1 and real Communities and
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.560]  the one image I will remember throughout the rest of my life was a woman in Bolton grabbing
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560]  my hands.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]  Let's back this up.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.920]  This is historic, stay with us, he's now admittedly the new leader of Europe.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.680]  Have you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.680]  low price?
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.160]  You are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160]  Here's why.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.080]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:15.720]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power and
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.680]  unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.200]  electricity from the sun.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.040]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.440]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.080]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.680]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.240]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.040]  price for infill-wars listeners, so it's a good time to check it out.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.480]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.320]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.600]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.280]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.600]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.560]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare,
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.880]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer,
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.960]  heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.240]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.400]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:21.320]  MUSIC
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.840]  I see on my TV screen here a monitor of the colors coming in.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.640]  It's like 11 of them on hold, and it's Scottish John
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.480]  says, Briggs at issue, disturbing news.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.280]  I don't know what he's going to say, but I'm guessing
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.520]  he's going to get into the pitfalls of it.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:48.560]  Our globalists are planning to use it to create a new scam.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.560]  How Scotland says they want to block the England's attempt
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.920]  to pull out.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.160]  We're going to cover all that.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.520]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.200]  And yes, there's going to be pitfalls.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.000]  Nothing's perfect.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  But unelected EU, taking over the UK
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.480]  without there ever being a vote, and now trying
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.280]  to ban people's free speech and becoming openly dictatorial,
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.640]  it's blowing up in their face.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.080]  And from Spain to the Netherlands,
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:19.280]  they now have prominent leaders saying it's time for us to exit.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.160]  And they have the leader of the Czech Republic
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.680]  and the leader of Romania and the leader of Hungary
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.600]  and the second most powerful party in Germany
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.760]  calling it a tyranny.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.520]  We couldn't even get people 20 years ago to admit
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.680]  they were setting up an EU when it was already set up.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.280]  They would say there isn't an EU.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.680]  It doesn't start till 2000 when it was already under treaty going.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.360]  I mean, that's the games we played fighting these globalists.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.440]  But it's not a game.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.480]  But they act like it is.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.360]  It just goes back and forth these games they make you play
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.240]  of trying to get the public to even know something exists.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.320]  And they call UKIP racist and all sorts of names
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.000]  that try to everybody trick in the book.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.960]  And all the UKIP says we can't have totally open borders
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.360]  and give everybody free stuff.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.840]  This is the globalist programs.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.920]  Let's finish up a little bit of Nigel Farage,
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.520]  the leader of UKIP, fastest growing party in the UK,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.040]  fastest growing in Europe.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.600]  It's UKIP, UK Independence Party.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.800]  Get out of the EU.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.960]  They have a ceremonial EU parliament.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.080]  He got elected to that and gets up every week
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.080]  and points out that they have no power
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.680]  and the bureaucracy runs everything.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.600]  And who set that up?
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.160]  A bunch of billionaires.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.640]  The EU is a giant scam.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.120]  And people say, well, why was George Soros involved in the EU?
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.880]  And wanting an EU bailout in Ukraine and backing it,
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.560]  but now he's making money off of it?
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.880]  Because these guys play both sides.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.440]  But just because they're playing both sides
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.520]  doesn't mean we're losers by battling the EU's tyranny.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.120]  And then they just jump over and try
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.320]  to control the opposition.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.480]  That's how this works.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.240]  And we fight them at that level.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.520]  We're fighting unelected government.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.880]  We're fighting global centralization.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:06.040]  We're fighting taxation boxes in your smart meter, your car.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.960]  We're informing people to the scams that aren't free market.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.080]  We want to have a system based on justice
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.840]  and voting with your dollars and a free open society
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.040]  and a renaissance, not one based on UN bureaucrats
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.440]  above the law, tax exempt with diplomatic immunity,
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.440]  owning and running global corporations that
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.960]  are exempt from carbon taxes.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.120]  You know that a whole bunch of UN officials,
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.480]  like Pichari and others, are exempt from carbon taxes.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.080]  So of course, they're factories.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:39.120]  They own factories and power plants next to them.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.240]  And everybody goes to build their factory there
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.080]  because they're above the law.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:43.880]  You can't compete.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.080]  That's what Donald Trump says.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.320]  He goes, yeah, I prepped my shirts in China and Mexico.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.960]  You can't afford to do it here.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.080]  I want to change the deal or I can do it here.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.600]  We get shirts made in America.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.560]  A normal t-shirt printed in America
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.640]  cost us $14 to $15 a piece.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.120]  We sell it for $25.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.320]  And after everything, make like $5.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:09.080]  I can get it printed in Mexico for $3, $4.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:12.400]  And I can then shell it for $5 to make a dollar.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.200]  Oh my gosh, I'm so evil.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.160]  I mean, how am I supposed to do it?
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.160]  So we print most of our shirts are made in America.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.440]  They're actually woven in America.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.520]  The cotton's from America.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.960]  They're printed in America.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.120]  I make special deals with people to try to drive the price
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.920]  down to maybe $9 in the US.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.040]  Cotton's in the US.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.000]  Ink's in the US.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.200]  It's printed in the US.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.080]  The trucks ship it in the US.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.480]  It's $9.95 and I shell it for $5.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.880]  Try that one on for size.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.960]  But see, I've got other products
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.520]  where we make enough of a profit to do stuff like that.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.400]  I'm just in a war.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.000]  I wish I had a billion t-shirts saying,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.480]  Hillary for President, I'd give them away.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.320]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.120]  I'm all in.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.880]  I'm firing everything I got.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.080]  I'm set to not take any money in 2016.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.000]  I don't even care.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.160]  I'm just like, hire more people, more cameras, more crews.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.600]  Battle, battle, battle, battle.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.680]  I am all in like the LMO swinging my musket here.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.440]  And all I'm saying is, if you have that attitude,
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.760]  there is nothing these globalists can do to stop us.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:11.600]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.440]  I'm all in.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.520]  I'm all in because I have no birthright.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.440]  I have no future.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.240]  My kids have no future if we don't beat these people.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.000]  I'm desperate.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.680]  And what do one of the most famous,
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.840]  I forget his name,
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.120]  but guys look up, the way of the samurai is desperate.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:25.960]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.480]  The way of the samurai is desperate.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.760]  It's one of the most famous samurais.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.560]  And he said, the way of the samurai is desperate
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.560]  and it's not even 10 men.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.680]  100 men can stop such a man.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.520]  And in my life, I've actually found that.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.560]  Most people are scared.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.400]  They're timid.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.240]  They're acting like they're tough.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.840]  They're acting like they're bullying you.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.080]  Now, when you take the gloves off and some thugs attacking,
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.040]  you actually start pounding the living hell out of them.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:50.880]  They get down on the ground,
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.280]  they're crying for mommy real fast.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.680]  I don't care how big they are
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.800]  because they're always the aggressor.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.160]  The aggressor is a punk trying to get something for free.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.800]  They don't have the spirit to win.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.360]  I don't care the way a hundred pounds more than me
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.040]  and they're the state wrestling champion.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.640]  They start the fight.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.000]  They get the tracheotomy.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.640]  And I'm just telling you right now,
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.640]  ladies and gentlemen, it's time to realize
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.640]  this spirit of weakness must be broken.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.920]  And it is being broken.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.640]  I can tell you, we've turned the tide.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.440]  We are gonna win the war long term.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.280]  God already promised that,
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.240]  but you can see it.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.800]  The Empire is gonna strike back.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.200]  They don't know they've won.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.560]  They don't know that they've lost the battle.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.920]  They don't understand that we've won.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.280]  They're like Hitler and his bunker.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.280]  So let's go ahead and finish up.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.720]  Go to break with Nigel Farage.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:36.720]  I promise I'm coming out of the gates with Trish
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.560]  and Donya and Brian and Trevor.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.280]  Those are all first time callers and Steve,
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.280]  then Scottish, John and other folks.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.080]  I said the first five callers will be
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.640]  first time callers and Andrew, Chris and so many others,
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.320]  Al and folks that are holding.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.600]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, but this is the leader
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.120]  of the UKIP party from nowhere 25 years ago,
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.600]  running from office, running from office 20 years ago.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.000]  And now the leader of Europe, the leader of opposition.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:03.960]  He's a libertarian.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.800]  He's a nationalist.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.840]  He's a listener of the show.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.880]  He's a patriot.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.040]  Just like 1776, they're having their declaration
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.720]  of independence in the UK.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.400]  You gotta hit bottom first before you come back
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.160]  up to the top and they're now doing it.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.200]  The UK's hit bottom.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.760]  It's now coming back up to the top
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.600]  and it's a beautiful thing.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.760]  We'll go out to break with more of the UKIP leader.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.360]  Between Westminster, SW1 and real communities
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.360]  and the one image I will remember throughout the rest
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.040]  of my life was a woman in Bolton grabbing my hands
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.440]  with tears in her eyes saying, why doesn't David Cameron?
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.680]  Why doesn't the government come and see what they've done
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.840]  to my community?
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.920]  What they've done to the prospects for my kids?
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.720]  People here don't understand.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.040]  They're too wealthy.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.080]  They don't get what open door mass immigration
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:53.000]  as a result of EU membership has done to people's wages,
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.840]  to people's availability of getting GP appointments
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.000]  or their kids into local schools.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.320]  This was the issue ultimately that won this election.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.160]  So I'm thrilled that we've done this.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.040]  I believe the other big effect of this election
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.760]  is not what's happened in Britain
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.520]  but what will happen in the rest of Europe.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.080]  I mean, in the rest of the EU,
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.720]  Euro-skeptic parties never talked about leaving the EU
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.920]  now they are.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.680]  An opinion polled in the Netherlands
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.680]  said that a majority there now want to leave.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:26.760]  So we may well be close, perhaps, to next it.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.600]  And similarly in Denmark.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.400]  That's right, the EU is collapsing.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.560]  The EU is collapsing.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.120]  We need Trump forage 2016.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.080]  It's a global movement.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.120]  It's 1776 worldwide.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:36.960]  I coined the term.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.800]  It's now been adopted by UKIP, Lord Monkton and others.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.400]  It is now happening.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.800]  Not global government but global awakening
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.800]  of liberty.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.920]  1776 worldwide.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.080]  It's unstoppable.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.360]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.720]  in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.840]  Young Jevity integrates years of scientific research

[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.920]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.240]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.240]  on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.480]  and optimizing your cellular energy
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.640]  at the same time.

[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.960]  Supermail vitality is infowarslife.com's
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.960]  number one selling product for a good reason.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960]  It works.

[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.960]  There are thousands of them with an average voting score

[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:19.960]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.960]  known to energize the body's natural processes
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.960]  that are blocked by estrogen mimicers
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.960]  and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.960]  Supermail vitality from infowarslife.com
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.960]  has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.960]  To fix that problem, we have now produced the biggest
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.960]  and most concentrated, high-quality batch
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.960]  of supermail vitality in the product's history.

[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.960]  Now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.960]  I'm Alex Jones for Supermail Vitality and infowarslife.com
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:33:23.960]  and I salute you, our supporters.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.960]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.960]  motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.960]  The first reports say that President Kennedy
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.960]  has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.960]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.960]  A new order.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.960]  It was almost as if you were planned in motion.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.960]  It's just pancake.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.960]  Either you were with us
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:34:07.960]  or you were with the terrorists.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.960]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:17.960]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:19.960]  Guns will be taken.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.960]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.960]  For many of the police and guard troops,
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.960]  it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.960]  It's global governance at last.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.960]  Is it one world? The central bank is in charge.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.960]  But aren't we all just living and dying
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.960]  for what the central banks do?
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.960]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:46.960]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.960]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.960]  Do I even need to tell folks that's Patrick Henry?
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.960]  Sometimes these quotes are so famous,
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.960]  I don't want to tell you.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.960]  Even though it's plagiarism, if I don't, what's the point?
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.960]  It's like saying YouTube, Brutus.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.960]  Julius Caesar said that.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.960]  But yes, that was Patrick Henry.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.960]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.960]  I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.960]  It's an amazing time to be alive,
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.960]  where they admit a planetary corporate
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.960]  above the law governments being formed.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.960]  Every world leader admits that.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.960]  They have all these big treaties.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.960]  Here, you set this on this TV show,
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.960]  or here's this document, or here's this global treaty.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.960]  They go, can I have a tin full hat?
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  And a great example of that was like six years ago, Gibbs.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.960]  The press secretary was asked about
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.960]  a bunch of shows about the drone program.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.960]  It was a public program for years,
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.960]  predating Obama's administration.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.960]  And he'd been told to say it doesn't exist.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.960]  And he said, and I would go on TV and say something
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:45.960]  didn't exist that existed.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.960]  And what was crazy is, most of the times I'm CNN,
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.960]  or Fox, or anywhere, they would just agree with him
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.960]  and then say there is no drone program.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.960]  I mean, think about that.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:00.960]  That is quite a level of mind control.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.960]  So I read, I mean, I saw over 50 articles this weekend.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.960]  I didn't even read four, five, six, up, whatever.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.960]  Just going, Alex Jones is insane.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.960]  He believes the Briggs, it is tied to world government.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.960]  New Yorker Magazine.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.960]  And then I learned that's actually going to be
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.960]  in the print paper.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.960]  Print, that's a pretty prestigious magazine.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.960]  I mean, I've read some pretty good articles in there.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  It's like the level they've stooped to just, uh-huh.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.960]  I mean, the EU, I could play you five or six EU
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.960]  former heads or current heads.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.960]  And I could play you two different, no,
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.960]  three different British prime ministers,
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.960]  admitting it's a world government project,
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.960]  shaying we will complete world government this year
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.960]  with the completion of the EU Atlantic deal with the Americans
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.960]  and the TPP in the next year.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.960]  In fact, I'm going to go to calls.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.960]  You guys just go to YouTube as a practice gesture.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.960]  You folks can even watch us search.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.960]  We're not just on the radio, we're on TV too
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.960]  at m4wars.com forward slash show and TV
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.960]  and cable stations around the country,
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.960]  but anybody can go watch us at m4wars.com forward slash show.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.960]  And just type in Herman von Rupy says
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  EU establishing world government.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.960]  And I can show you dozens of clips of him
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.960]  or Buroso or any of these guys.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.960]  But you can just type in Herman von Rupy,
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.960]  world government, type that in Herman von Rupy,
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]  world government.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.960]  And then you just, you have all the clips.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.960]  And I told people the story like five, six years ago.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.960]  Um, yeah, there's Nigel Faraz confronts Herman von Rupy
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:29.960]  on world government.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:31.960]  That's a clip right there at the top.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:34.960]  And there's on BBC with English subtitles
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.960]  and English narrator.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:36.960]  Here, let's just grab that.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.960]  We'll play that for some calls.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.960]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.960]  And I had the anchor, the host of ABC nightly news here.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.960]  They were doing a nightline piece.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:49.960]  And he goes, there's no world government.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:50.960]  You're making that up.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.960]  And I said, well, let me, I went and showed him six clips
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.960]  of world leaders call him for world government
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.960]  and saying we're establishing it.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.960]  He looked at me and he said,
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.960]  that's a different world government than,
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.960]  than, than they're talking about.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:07.960]  And he goes, hey, let's go to dinner and at dinner,
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.960]  he just laughed and said, I like your show.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:11.960]  Yeah, I know we all know this.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:12.960]  We do our coverage.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:13.960]  You do yours.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:14.960]  Yeah, I get it.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  And the guy was actually nice to me.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:18.960]  What was his name?
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:19.960]  What's that guy's name?
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.960]  It's not that big of a deal to the ABC news anchor anymore.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.960]  You see him.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.960]  He's used to be a 700 club reporter before that.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:26.960]  I don't know whatever.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.960]  The point is, I literally don't know.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:30.960]  I'm not even bragging.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.960]  I want people to know that Hollywood has no power
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.960]  and TV has no power.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.960]  I've hosted four different discovery channel shows.
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.960]  No, no, three different discovery channel shows
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.960]  and four different history channel shows
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960]  in the last six, seven years.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:49.960]  And I've never watched one of them.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:50.960]  Not one.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.960]  Not one.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.960]  I could care less about that.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:54.960]  That's an enemy transmission.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.960]  And I just put my info out and whatever they do with it.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960]  You know, they do.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  And then I go over here and I just have these pure
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.960]  transmissions where I can really talk to you.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:03.960]  But it's not like some power trip.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:04.960]  I'm on TV.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:05.960]  Oh, I'm embarrassed.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:06.960]  I even did those interviews.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.960]  Now I get calls and I go, you know what?
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.960]  Vice, vice wanted to come and do an interview.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960]  I just said, you know what?
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.960]  I'm just not going to do it.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.960]  Oh, HBO interview.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:17.960]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.960]  Oh, you want me to be in a movie with Christian Bale?
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:20.960]  You know what?
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  I'm just not going to do it.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.960]  Okay.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.960]  He'll jump in a frickin' freezing lake.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  How's that feel?
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960]  Like, let's go to drudgereport.com right now.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.960]  You know what?
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:30.960]  I want to be associated with people like Matt Rodge
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.960]  who actually have courage and care about freedom
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.960]  and are fighting for internet freedom and free speech.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:35.960]  Look at this.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:36.960]  Look, look, grudge gets how big it is.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.960]  Let's blow that up so I can read that.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:39.960]  Globalist rattled.
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960]  World government in trouble.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.960]  Here, let's blow up the top left-hand corner headlines.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.960]  I want to read those out to folks if we can.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.960]  Because my computer's down here, so I have to go off the TV screen.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:56.960]  Trump, independence wave coming.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.960]  What you guys can do is you can minimize the browser
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.960]  and make it a little bit smaller,
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:00.960]  but I can read that.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:01.960]  Oh, drudge is one of the oldest websites.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.960]  No, I know.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  That's why I love it.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.960]  What's old's new?
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.960]  Shadow over Hillary.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.960]  Open revolt against encrusted establishment.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.960]  And it just goes on and on about how their sorrows
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.960]  calls for reconstruction after he loots it.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.960]  Support for Spain's conservative party surges
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.960]  days after Briggs it.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:20.960]  I mean, just look.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:22.960]  It's total revolt against world government.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.960]  Everyone's saying world government.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.960]  Everyone's saying planetary tyranny.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.960]  Everyone's saying New World Order.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.960]  You failed.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:30.960]  Your hoax failed.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960]  It's all out in the open.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.960]  I'm so happy.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.960]  Okay, let's go to calls.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  Donna Trish, Ryan, Trevor, Steve, Zeb, Ryan, you name it.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.960]  Donna, or Danya, calling from Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.960]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.960]  Go ahead.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960]  Hi.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.960]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.960]  I'm doing good.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960]  How may I serve you?
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.960]  What's on your mind today?
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:50.960]  We're alive.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:51.960]  That's right.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.960]  First, I want to say thank you for the amazing product,
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.960]  amazing news, and the inspiration.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.960]  I have to say that.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.960]  Thank you for your inspiration, ma'am.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.960]  Your support.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  And it's just, you know, it's a European and it's an American
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:08.960]  renaissance.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.960]  I think they're both working in tandem.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.960]  Our histories have been intertwined for hundreds of years,
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.960]  so it's not a surprising factor that one continent affects
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.960]  the other.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.960]  And, you know, this is radicalizing the left.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:28.960]  And all I have to say is we have to stick to the headlines
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.960]  and repeat them because that's what these people are used to.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.960]  I've learned that stooping into the details and trying to
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.960]  explain it with sources and the history behind it all just gets
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:42.960]  a lot of folks lost.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.960]  And, you know...
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.960]  I agree with you.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.960]  I mean, once people are awake, it's great to give the whole
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.960]  history of it, but how do you reach out to somebody that's
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.960]  literally, like Helen Keller, not aware what planets are on?
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  I like to say you've been conned, you've been hoaxed.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:54.960]  I care about you.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.960]  I'm not telling you this to act elitist.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.960]  I used to be uninformed.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:41:59.960]  I used to be in this cocoon.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.960]  Let me teach you about this scam.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.960]  It can really empower you to be aware.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.960]  It's, you know, it's externalism.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.960]  It goes beyond one policy of converting countries to so-called
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.960]  democracies around the world.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:17.960]  We've been under a policy of externalism for decades now.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  And finally, people are waking up and they're realizing there's a
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.960]  big elephant in the room.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:24.960]  That's a great point.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.960]  The media has been bought and paid for.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:29.960]  And as a class have been the real deceivers enabling this giant
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.960]  line, this fraud.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:31.960]  Thank you so much, Johnna.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:32.960]  Great points.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:35.960]  Trish, I'm going to write to you that Brian, Trevor, Steve,
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:38.960]  Zeb, Ryan, then Scottish John, Andrew.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.960]  I'm going to everybody.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960]  Each person gets a minute, though.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.960]  Don't ask me a question because I'm going to make your statement
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.960]  and I'm moving to the next person.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.960]  So just get up there to the gate, get up there on the starting
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.960]  line and get ready for that green light.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  And those flags will start waving because we're about to start
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:52.960]  this sucker.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.960]  I'm sorry to get to more calls, but tomorrow we will
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:23.960]  be back.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:49.960]  Thank you.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:44:15.960]  Thank you.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:43.960]  Thank you.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  Thank you.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:35.960]  Thank you.
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  Thank you.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:28.960]  Thank you.
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:57.960]  Thank you.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:25.960]  Thank you.
