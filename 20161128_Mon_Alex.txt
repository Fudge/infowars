[00:00.000 --> 00:20.880]  If you control the media, if you control the Justice Department, if you control the police,
[00:20.880 --> 00:22.160]  you own the system.
[00:22.160 --> 00:24.040]  Why does pizza gate matter?
[00:24.040 --> 00:29.120]  Key elements include the ownership of Best of Pizza, located two doors down from Comet
[00:29.120 --> 00:30.880]  and Ping Pong Pizza.
[00:30.880 --> 00:37.080]  Best of Pizza is owned by Andrew Klein, a lawyer with the DOJ's Human Trafficking Unit.
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.920]  This symbol, which has since been removed, is the exact symbol representing boy love
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.680]  that the FBI flagged in their investigation of public displays of pedophilia code.
[00:48.680 --> 00:50.000]  It's pretty simple.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.560]  One of the leading prosecutors dealing exclusively with child trafficking decided to overtly
[00:55.560 --> 00:59.520]  display it on the menu of a business he owns.
[00:59.520 --> 01:00.520]  Coincidence?
[01:00.520 --> 01:03.520]  A case of bad luck regarding artistic license?
[01:03.520 --> 01:06.680]  Or is the Red Fox running the henhouse?
[01:06.680 --> 01:11.720]  Another key element, just three doors down from Best of Pizza is the Politics and Pros
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.600]  bookstore where many prominent politicians, including Barack Obama, have spoken.
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.840]  The bookstore is owned by Washington Post journalist Bradley Graham and his wife, Lisa Muscatine.
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.600]  Muscatine served as chief speechwriter and top advisor to Hillary Clinton.
[01:26.600 --> 01:31.520]  Directly across the street from prose and poetry is the Beyond Borders office.
[01:31.520 --> 01:36.400]  Beyond Borders claims it is fighting to end child slavery in Haiti.
[01:36.400 --> 01:41.560]  This after angry Haitians have demanded the billions of aid the Clinton Foundation stole
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.560]  from them.
[01:42.560 --> 01:47.800]  However, New Life Children's Refuge founder Laura Sillsby, a woman with financial hellhounds
[01:47.800 --> 01:53.560]  on her trail due to her failing internet business personal shopper, which was rife with charges
[01:53.560 --> 02:00.600]  of unpaid employees, fraud and wrongful termination suits, attempted to traffic 33 Haitian children
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.600]  into the Dominican Republic in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake on January 12, 2010.
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.880]  Haitian officials placed Sillsby and nine other missionaries under arrest for child trafficking.
[02:11.880 --> 02:17.320]  After all were released except for Sillsby, Sillsby's attorney withdrew as her counsel.
[02:17.320 --> 02:23.080]  Sillsby then hired Jorge Puello, a Dominican attorney under investigation for child trafficking
[02:23.080 --> 02:24.320]  in El Salvador.
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.520]  It was then that Hillary and Bill Clinton stepped in to diminish the charges against
[02:29.520 --> 02:30.520]  Sillsby.
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.760]  According to WikiLeaks, Hillary's interest in Sillsby dated back nine years before the
[02:35.760 --> 02:36.760]  Haitian earthquake.
[02:36.760 --> 02:42.080]  WikiLeaks also reveals that Huma Abidine kept Hillary in the loop regarding Sillsby's
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.080]  situation.
[02:43.080 --> 02:48.080]  When I King, writing for the Harvard Human Rights Journal, elaborates, the Haitian justice
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.320]  system, prodded in part by President Clinton's diplomatic efforts on behalf of the missionaries,
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.480]  determined that none of the missionaries were guilty of illegal activities except the leader
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.160]  Laura Sillsby, who faced a lesser charge of organizing illegal travel.
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.520]  Along with the Haitian justice system, some observers excused the missionaries actions,
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.800]  even though they rose to the level of child trafficking.
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.960]  They did so essentially because we place such little value on the integrity of poor families.
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.960]  Another disturbing pizza gate element, James Alifantis, has also visited the White House
[03:22.960 --> 03:28.000]  five times, which adds to the perverse nature of this WikiLeaks email regarding President
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.520]  Obama when the pedocode is applied to hot dogs slash pizza.
[03:32.520 --> 03:39.120]  It reads, I think Obama spent $65,000 of the taxpayers' money flying in pizza slash dogs
[03:39.120 --> 03:43.240]  from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago.
[03:43.240 --> 04:13.200]  Assume we are using the same channels.
[04:13.200 --> 04:19.560]  Say what you want about the filth on Comet Ping Pong pizza owner James Alifantis' Instagram.
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.560]  The most damaging pictures are those of digging holes in the floor in what appears to be an
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.680]  attempt to connect Comet Ping Pong to the exclusive underground labyrinth of Washington,
[04:29.680 --> 04:30.680]  D.C.
[04:30.680 --> 04:36.240]  Tie all of that into Alifantis' ranking as GQ's 49th most powerful man in D.C. and
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.280]  politics and pros owners Graham and Muscatine as numbers 50.
[04:40.280 --> 04:46.040]  Alifantis and company and the circumstantial evidence far outweighs even the Michael Jackson
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.360]  Pito scandal.
[04:47.360 --> 05:01.800]  Maybe that's why Macaulay Culkin named his band Pizza Underground.
[05:01.800 --> 05:06.480]  We have an article up on our website at infowars.com that talks about how one Italian minister is
[05:06.480 --> 05:11.080]  going to throw his citizens in jail if they don't open up their homes to migrants.
[05:11.080 --> 05:15.200]  This article was written by Chris Manahan of Information Liberation and it addresses
[05:15.200 --> 05:20.000]  how one Italian minister of interior Angelina Alfano is planning to throw his citizens
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.760]  in prison if they don't hand over their homes to migrants.
[05:22.760 --> 05:26.800]  This report coming out of an Italian paper coming just two weeks after a shocking video
[05:26.800 --> 05:31.960]  goes viral that showed an 80 year old Italian businessman being forced by the state to house
[05:31.960 --> 05:34.000]  African migrants in his hotel.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.520]  We learn this news today that the plan is slated to go through in hyperdrive come December
[05:38.520 --> 05:43.280]  and the government is keeping it secret so that no one will sway the upcoming referendum
[05:43.280 --> 05:47.120]  which could lead to ousting their current pro-migrant invasion prime minister.
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.880]  Well this news comes amid the holidays and we understand that there is an invasion going
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.160]  on in Europe right now and it looks like the Italian government is saying look you house
[05:55.160 --> 05:57.680]  these migrants or you're facing jail time.
[05:57.680 --> 06:04.120]  I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com We're selling a product DNA force that is

[06:14.840 --> 06:16.880]  very very important.
[06:16.880 --> 06:23.520]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[06:23.520 --> 06:25.760]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[06:25.760 --> 06:27.840]  And when it runs out you start dying.
[06:27.840 --> 06:33.640]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one of the most effective

[08:56.920 --> 09:04.320]  to cover every time I sit down I just cannot believe how over the top it all is I was going
[09:04.320 --> 09:11.400]  over just mainline news sites the Associated Press writers you name it McClatchy I was
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.640]  going to Drudge I was going to Infowars I was going to Breitbart I was going to my email
[09:15.640 --> 09:19.200]  I was going to Twitter I was going to Facebook last night this morning just looking at things
[09:19.200 --> 09:24.120]  and by the time I get on air my head is spinning just like I know yours is there is a stack
[09:24.120 --> 09:33.280]  of news of Muslims doing horrible horrible things to women and children and homosexuals
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.040]  and the Liberals don't care they actually praise it and push it and promote it and
[09:38.040 --> 09:43.400]  are mad that I just use the word homosexual all they care about is controlling the culture
[09:43.400 --> 09:52.120]  and they like Islam they like Orthodox Islam because it will meld into their authoritarianism
[09:52.120 --> 10:03.280]  quite nicely it's crazy how bankrupt the so-called leftists it really is crazy look at these
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.080]  headlines Indonesian woman flogged for close proximity with a man she got closer than a
[10:09.080 --> 10:17.480]  foot away Indonesian Muslim hardliners break up what they think is a gay sex party men
[10:17.480 --> 10:22.520]  aren't even allowed to have a party after the beating Moroccan TV this is on mainline TV
[10:22.520 --> 10:31.240]  airs makeup tips for hiding domestic violence this is what I'm even looking for this stuff
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.960]  Italy's Minister of Interior surrender your homes to migrants or face jail we saw video
[10:35.960 --> 10:40.720]  this last week they're expanding it across the country saying it may just be permanent
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.240]  in fact in Germany they're saying get out of your house and of course the migrants are
[10:46.240 --> 10:53.360]  almost all Muslim throwing people out and then bringing you know 15 people into a tiny
[10:53.360 --> 10:59.280]  hotel with an 80 year old guy named Luigi basically having a heart attack can't make
[10:59.280 --> 11:08.880]  that up and then I've got Kaepernick who is such a
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.200]  spoil brat can we pull up my tweet about him today I didn't put his name in it but I tweeted
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.080]  this morning I was doing a lot of tweeting this morning I was so upset about just the
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.840]  state of the world and I basically said makes a hundred plus million dollars plus I looked
[11:22.840 --> 11:29.480]  it up in his career he's been paid about 180 million if you count 130 or so he's been
[11:29.480 --> 11:34.200]  paid from the football league and then there's a whole bunch more from sponsorship yeah lives
[11:34.200 --> 11:39.880]  in the US makes a hundred plus million talks crap 24 seven about America and loves dead
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.760]  communist mass killer Castro that's it real Alex Jones and you know what the first tweet
[11:45.760 --> 11:53.000]  response was and a bunch of others were well I bet Castro never called him the N word see
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.400]  oh he is white parents that adopted him and then he goes around bitching everywhere and
[11:59.400 --> 12:11.760]  it's all incongruent and stupid and it's so cost celeb like Fidel Castro all that folks
[12:11.760 --> 12:14.400]  know a little something I mean I think I've shown a letter on there I don't think I'm
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.480]  breaking this here but I was invited to go speak and have dinner with Ahmed energy didn't
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.560]  do it and I was invited to Cuba and told and you might get to meet Castro and then you go
[12:23.560 --> 12:27.320]  through a little thing and he pats you on the head like I'm a monkey didn't didn't go
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.480]  on the Cuba trip 10 years ago back when I was exposed in the government for 9-11 they
[12:31.480 --> 12:35.940]  thought I was like a communist or something no I was a patriot discovering the facts
[12:35.940 --> 12:40.400]  just the facts ma'am don't want to go to Iran don't want to have dinner they're like
[12:40.400 --> 12:44.000]  you don't understand his official state letter of them calling me like a hundred plus times
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.840]  he wants to personally have done the president of the dinner with you alone not just as big
[12:48.840 --> 12:58.320]  event I said no everything paid first class no but let me tell you Fidel Castro calls
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.600]  you or he pats you on the head like he's done so many people and then oh he's so nice people
[13:04.600 --> 13:09.880]  ask Albert Speer the German interior minister pretty much ran the third right why he was
[13:09.880 --> 13:14.600]  only got it got off at Nuremberg without you know a long prison sentence or death and they
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.480]  said why did you go along with Hitler and he said well when the devils got his arm around
[13:18.480 --> 13:30.720]  you in a warm embrace you don't realize this is the devil now now before we go any further
[13:30.720 --> 13:35.480]  I want to just mention the other news that's here but imagine the ignorance of the guy
[13:35.480 --> 13:39.920]  that responded to my tweet if we can put it back on screen that oh I bet Fidel never called
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.600]  him the n-word you don't know anything about Cuba or anything about the Caribbean or anything
[13:44.600 --> 13:49.120]  about Latin America if you do anything about it you would know that blacks except for maybe
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.680]  Brazil are treated much worse than they're treated anywhere in North America I mean it
[13:54.680 --> 14:03.760]  is unbelievably racist but I just love the ignorant morons that tweeted me bet Fidel
[14:03.760 --> 14:08.520]  never called him an n-word oh the poor baby I bet he might have been called the n-word
[14:08.520 --> 14:15.040]  I was called a cracker ass honky hundreds of times growing up in Dallas routinely walking
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.360]  down the street black racists drive by on a beach oh ass skinny ass crack ahead you look
[14:20.360 --> 14:27.400]  like a cop you blonde haired freak you blonde haired devil you blew out devil ought to
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.680]  get out of this car and ought to kill your ass and I was brought up so colorblind I'd
[14:32.680 --> 14:36.040]  go I'm gonna go over to my friend's house I play football with this black it's like
[14:36.040 --> 14:40.000]  going to the black neighborhood they'd be like you better come on back in my house with

[14:43.960 --> 14:49.280]  ass blow your head off boy like oh that's racist imitating no that's how people talk
[14:49.280 --> 14:55.760]  to me it's okay to make fun of a you know Donald Trump's wife's accent I made fun anybody's
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.040]  accent we have to break with the political correctness and not be politically correct
[14:59.040 --> 15:06.920]  anymore I have been in let's just say a lot of what I called fights was where I was assaulted
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.360]  racially but see I'd transcend that and was never a tribalist because I understand those
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.640]  were brainwashed ignorant people just like there's white people that can act like that
[15:16.640 --> 15:22.280]  but there is an open season to demonize white people so let's say I want to call Kaepernick
[15:22.280 --> 15:27.160]  names is it okay if I said well I got called a cracker and then I got hit in the head with
[15:27.160 --> 15:34.000]  a lead pipe and then I was in the hospital for three days and can hardly see because
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.720]  the because the the concussion was so bad and then I got body slammed and got 15 stitches
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.960]  in the back of my head and then I fought back as I got older and put people in the hospital
[15:44.960 --> 15:50.600]  so I got thrown in juvenile repeatedly and they tried to break my parents parental control
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.040]  over me because they know how somebody 160 pounds was putting 250 pound people in the
[15:55.040 --> 16:01.000]  hospital and I mean in the hospital I'm not even proud of that but I defend myself I mean
[16:01.000 --> 16:07.280]  I love oh my god I love that ignorant racist swollen elitist on his own world Bernie Sanders
[16:07.280 --> 16:15.160]  going if you are white if you are white you don't know what it's like to be poor well
[16:15.160 --> 16:22.720]  I have the demographics here the most wealthy upwardly mobile group per capita is the first
[16:22.720 --> 16:30.320]  nine designations you can look it up yourself of Asians starting with Indians and then it's
[16:30.320 --> 16:36.320]  Japanese and then it just moves on down the line and then it's other subgroups of what
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.320]  you would call Asian or mixed with Anglo they call that's called Arab with a sprinkling
[16:41.320 --> 16:49.440]  of African people even know what an Arab is but oh someone could tweet back at me that
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.680]  Fidel never called him an n-word no they just called Obama a mayata and a black boy in the
[16:55.680 --> 17:01.680]  front page of Havana papers because in a communist world having someone grovel to Fidel and Raul
[17:01.680 --> 17:06.920]  and then getting to call him basically the n-word was a delicious pleasure to have the
[17:06.920 --> 17:11.320]  American president called an n-word in front of everyone in their newspapers was a big joke
[17:11.320 --> 17:16.240]  pissing down our backs but you don't care you're a pseudo intellectual that doesn't
[17:16.240 --> 17:25.320]  even know what a mayata is it means blackbird you know heckle and jekyll it's a racist term
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.160]  you've been in Latin America you watch the cartoons on TV you think you're at a frickin
[17:30.160 --> 17:36.360]  KKK rally and I'm not even bashing Latin America the point is that's just how people are all
[17:36.360 --> 17:39.880]  over the world you go to Saudi Arabia you're not a Saudi Arabian they're gonna ask every

[18:03.600 --> 18:08.520]  Kaepernick he's got his right why are you censoring him I'm not censoring him when I
[18:08.520 --> 18:16.400]  say the guy's a buffoon I bet this guy never had a white person lay their finger on him
[18:16.400 --> 18:24.000]  unless it was his adopted mama spanking his butt or something what a bunch of babies what
[18:24.000 --> 18:35.720]  a bunch of babies sick of it tired of it makes you want to throw up I told you last night
[18:35.720 --> 18:40.840]  just to keep pointing out before anybody announced this morning the Mitt Romney's going Tuesday
[18:40.840 --> 18:49.560]  to meet with Mr. 45 there at Trump Tower El Presidente Elect and I also told you that
[18:49.560 --> 18:54.400]  Petraeus was gonna be going Tuesday told you last night on there told you the special
[18:54.400 --> 18:59.840]  video I did last night and I'm just just pointing out that that just rubs it into the media
[18:59.840 --> 19:06.800]  that they have no idea what's going on and I do and I just heard from multiple sources
[19:06.800 --> 19:14.800]  because of Conway and other standing up and Bannon standing up that Trump is really backing
[19:14.800 --> 19:17.760]  away from Romney right now the decision has not been made nobody knows the Trump but the
[19:17.760 --> 19:22.440]  good news is I'm told that things are moving very nicely in that direction so keep the
[19:22.440 --> 19:28.200]  heat on him and Trump had really tried to work it out with Hillary and tried to say
[19:28.200 --> 19:31.080]  look I don't know what other prosecutors will do and stuff but you know I'll try to back
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.800]  off here if you just you know you back off and I told Trump a few weeks ago I said she's
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.240]  never gonna back off we did talk about some of this I said just watch and now Trump sees
[19:39.240 --> 19:42.960]  that she's not backing off with the whole recount she's officially joined to all that's
[19:42.960 --> 19:49.920]  going on but before I get into all that today I want to get into the key to everything the

[23:59.200 --> 24:08.280]  now before I get to the heart of the matter right here on the Alex Jones show thank you
[24:08.280 --> 24:12.640]  for joining us I'm yours truly Alex Jones I want to just point out that hours ago drudge
[24:12.640 --> 24:19.080]  had it right mash shooting Ohio State machete attack you had to dig into a daily mail article
[24:19.080 --> 24:23.240]  to find a school official saying it was a machete because they were attacked and it
[24:23.240 --> 24:29.040]  turns out hours ago the media knew this but as of break time is still announcing mass
[24:29.040 --> 24:33.440]  shooting CNN in the break room saying mass shooting will let you know more how many injured
[24:33.440 --> 24:39.760]  how many dead well turns out he had this written over an hour ago kid Daniels Ohio State attack
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.520]  copies ISIS killing style they've ordered ISIS and Islamists to launch more knife attacks
[24:45.520 --> 24:49.680]  a machete attacks it's happening on a daily basis in the western world or even more often
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.560]  in some cases update a federal law enforcement official said the suspect used a knife and
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.040]  a car in the attack just like the truck attack number in nice it wasn't Islamic attack it
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.840]  was truck attack not a firearm which still mimics the killing style of recent ISIS inspired
[25:03.840 --> 25:08.880]  terror attacks you can bet your bottom dollar that will get swept under the rug as quickly
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.920]  as possible I haven't even hit the news yet it's big it's important it's deep that's coming
[25:13.920 --> 25:20.120]  up in the next long segment but I was complaining this morning in there with some of my managers
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.480]  that when I leave my children for couple days with loving good family that I care about
[25:25.480 --> 25:29.200]  when they come back they're like zombies and it's not that they're eating bad food they're
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.800]  watching lots of television they're not focusing as much they're stumbling around it's a joke
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.680]  and I actually have hundreds of studies anybody can Google television watching link to Alzheimer's
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.040]  neurological disorders lower IQ ash burgers disorder when you're a kid if you watch too
[25:44.040 --> 25:49.240]  much TV you can just Google doctors say don't let kids have any screen time Steve Jobs wouldn't
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.800]  let his kids have any screen time and if you let them have any of it they then just start
[25:53.800 --> 25:58.200]  demanding it all the time it's it's amazing I'm the type on a plane ride or maybe the
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.800]  fifth hour of a trip in a car I'll say all right here here it is but I shouldn't even
[26:02.800 --> 26:07.240]  do that with my first child we let him have any TV till about two and a half the others
[26:07.240 --> 26:14.520]  we caved in quicker but depression loneliness it's all linked to it everybody knows this
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.680]  and so I am officially just taking the TVs completely out except for one that's going
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.840]  to be in a closet on a roller that you've got to bring out to watch DVDs or films that's
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.680]  it maybe once a week I'm done and if you want to know the secret to defeating globalist
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.920]  it's stop watching mainline television the flicker rates all of it puts you into a dream
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.800]  like state sure you're watching stuff online this lowers IQs to certain points study show
[26:38.800 --> 26:43.240]  but not as bad as mainline TV or entertainment TV where you suspend disbelief this is fact
[26:43.240 --> 26:47.480]  oriented that we're showing exhibits we're making you access information your own brain
[26:47.480 --> 26:53.080]  stuff that's just filler lowers IQ because it doesn't cause neurons to expand out reading
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.560]  does because you have to image everything you read if you say a Titanic hit the iceberg
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.600]  in the North Atlantic listed for two hours then sunk to the bottom you picture all you
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.840]  know about the Titanic you have to draw it up in your mind it expands neurons it expands
[27:05.840 --> 27:12.040]  connections when you listen to talk radio it's been found to boost IQ even more than
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.240]  reading because you're audibly listening to it and most people get their truest form of
[27:16.240 --> 27:20.560]  learning like sitting around the campfire they've got studies where if you have a campfire people
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.400]  are more attentive and listen that's why Hitler would have his rallies with big huge fires
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.960]  at night this is all known okay now that said Weldon Henson was in there he goes absolutely
[27:29.960 --> 27:36.320]  you know our daughter is the sweetest thing around wasn't one of any TV for two years
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.640]  wild girl what she's supposed to be bouncing off the wall she's so smart and Weldon told
[27:40.640 --> 27:46.000]  me the shocking development when they let her watch TV as a test Weldon Henson I guess
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.360]  you know we had that long weekend everybody was off for a few days and so day four I think
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.000]  me and my wife were going crazy because the kid is just running around which is great
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.400]  we're happy that's what they're supposed to yeah so day four we're just like yesterday
[27:57.400 --> 28:00.760]  we're like alright that's it we've had enough turn let's just turn the TV on we only have
[28:00.760 --> 28:04.920]  one TV we don't have cable we just try to find some stuff on the antenna I walk in the
[28:04.920 --> 28:09.960]  room to do something I come back out in two minutes Alex I walk out and my daughter looks
[28:09.960 --> 28:16.280]  like she's in a trance she's like sloped down on the couch like taking the prone position
[28:16.280 --> 28:22.360]  or whatever whatever you would do just totally unconscious in a dream state it actually scared
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.120]  me to be honest with you I was like oh my gosh it's like hey Brielle what you know hey and
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.280]  my wife came out she's like what's about I said Brielle looks like she's in a trance
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.720]  she looks like she's she's all of a sudden because she's in a medical trance and it
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.160]  was the first time we'd let her watch TV she's just a little over two years old magicians
[28:37.160 --> 28:42.160]  a thousand years ago was swinging a jewel with a candle could put you into a trance
[28:42.160 --> 28:47.720]  imagine listen the entire UT psychology department Weldon I was led into it secretly 15 years
[28:47.720 --> 28:51.600]  ago I could talk about it now because the guy moved on to MIT and I'm just gonna stop
[28:51.600 --> 28:55.640]  right there I ran into one of the other guys when I had surgery he was the anesthesiologist
[28:55.640 --> 29:00.880]  strangely enough that's what they were running in there on these monkeys the point is is
[29:00.880 --> 29:05.760]  that they had them all wired in to their brains and that just it was the monkey farm and basketball
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.840]  I was I was allowed to see it and it looked like some kind of science fiction movie hundreds
[29:08.840 --> 29:12.480]  of monkeys apes hooked into deals and they're just hitting them with flicker rates for the
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.520]  defense department just studying how to put people into a trance Weldon that's what the
[29:16.520 --> 29:22.040]  carrier waves they've got on MSMR I've always believed that TV was just like a weapon the
[29:22.040 --> 29:26.680]  new order uses for sure man you know it freaked me out to see her like that you know she's
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.040]  a little over two years old she's always been crazy and energetic and just very vocal and
[29:31.040 --> 29:35.240]  I I told my wife I said let's turn the TV off you know I know we've gone to the park
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.960]  twice already today I said we're going again we have a little park you know walkway from
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.480]  our house exactly how long did it take well let's talk about how long till she got out
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.240]  of the trance because here's the deal I'm gonna explain all this when we come back this
[29:46.240 --> 29:53.520]  is this is the big enchilada folks stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.520 --> 29:58.200]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:22.440 --> 30:27.480]  article up on their website entitled fake news onslaught targets pizzeria as a nest
[30:27.480 --> 30:32.160]  of child trafficking they go on to say quote days before the presidential election James
[30:32.160 --> 30:36.800]  Elephantus owner of a local pizza restaurant called Comet ping pong noticed an unusual
[30:36.800 --> 30:41.560]  spike in the number of his Instagram followers within hours menacing messages like we're

[34:11.640 --> 34:17.000]  apocalypse and gay frogs that's that's their talking point these are big journalists they
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.080]  just have 10 or 15 points they're given by the southern parvy law center in the white house
[34:21.080 --> 34:25.080]  that are approved this is all come out in the wiki leaks and then they just repeat them like
[34:25.080 --> 34:29.640]  they're geniuses and then go to coffee shops and talk about how liberal they are when we're the real
[34:29.640 --> 34:36.200]  liberals julia sange is a real liberal a snowden is a real liberal by exposing evil but the point
[34:36.200 --> 34:41.160]  i'm getting at here is i only said it cuz tiebe i mean i'm attacked by all these people every day
[34:42.440 --> 34:47.960]  almost every hour i mean there's everything from the australian papers to the german papers to the

[35:27.960 --> 35:33.880]  and reading new scientists about how the frogs are either asexual or deformed and then it turns

[36:46.120 --> 36:50.280]  uh you know but the thing we're gonna we're not gonna do is is stick them in front of a tv just
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.480]  so we can have time to ourselves like that's not very fair and and i guess we well now it's not
[36:55.480 --> 36:59.080]  your kid now it's the states and folks let me be honest with you as the years have gone by
[36:59.080 --> 37:04.600]  i have used the television uh as a pacifier and and you lie to yourself go oh i'm gonna let
[37:04.600 --> 37:08.840]  him watch a nova show or i'm gonna let him watch but then sooner or later oh there you catch him

[37:32.760 --> 37:38.120]  studies on the studies the parents are lying our daughter was watching tv for 15 minutes yesterday
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.320]  and that was the first time she ever watched it she was in a trance and for a second there i kind of
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.040]  felt like what it must be like whenever you over vaccinate your kid and you come home and they're
[37:48.040 --> 37:53.720]  not quite normal and i that's the kind of eye awakening uh absolutely well expanding on that

[39:41.640 --> 39:46.120]  we're not of the matrix folks we're here jack it into this thing warning you and i'll say it again
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.760]  statistically this is not as good and our main audience is talk radio let's not forget that talk
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.640]  radio is very good for your brain look at all this just google talk radio listening listening to
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.320]  book on tape is good for your brain you'll get more articles on that but it's the same thing
[39:59.320 --> 40:04.600]  spoken word is good for the brain you add a fire to it it takes you to a place let me tell you why
[40:04.600 --> 40:09.160]  i'm i hate it when it gets hot because you know where i am i'm in my backyard around a fire pit
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.080]  and three hours goes by and i got my kids hugging me and we cooked the little steaks over it and
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.080]  have a salad out there and you talk and you discuss things and it's just i'm hired a damn kite
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.880]  no that's exactly what we do fire is the original television set folks
[40:25.640 --> 40:29.800]  i'm telling you i want to launch an entire program of eradicating televisions
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.560]  and going to people's houses and just clapping while they destroy their televisions i'm telling
[40:33.560 --> 40:38.040]  you i want to start a g hot on televisions well then i'm i'm with you i mean we don't even have

[40:48.520 --> 40:53.000]  to fight the new world order i don't sit there and screw around on it but but but then my kids are
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.240]  like we can't have phones but you've got one what do i do i think you just really explain to them
[40:57.240 --> 41:03.480]  that using it as a weapon it's a tool it's a dangerous weapon too yeah absolutely tracks everywhere
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.040]  i go everything i do i remember 20 years ago there'd be reporters coming around wouldn't even
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.040]  that away 20 18 years ago and i'd turn a cell phone off and put it away before i talked about
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.800]  something classified i've been told or whatever and they'd say that's crazy and i said i've been told
[41:15.800 --> 41:19.720]  by nsa people that they've got tracker chips in and they triangulate and they listen and and they've
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.480]  got keywords that activate it and start recording once they hear it and they're just you're crazy
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.480]  why do you cover up you know you're you're you're unplug your camera when you know when you go to
[41:27.480 --> 41:31.320]  bed at night well i don't want to have them videotape me having sex with my wife all come out that's
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.040]  what they do folks yeah i mean the cell phone's another thing you know i know me and my wife you
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.280]  know we come into the house and we set our phones down on the kitchen table right there and they
[41:40.280 --> 41:43.800]  don't go anywhere else with us in the house i like the fact i'm trying to get a whole day
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.480]  with knife about a day during thanksgiving you know what he had his phone shut off and he
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.320]  wouldn't answer it i just was like you know what i'm shutting mine off well it's a huge distraction
[41:51.320 --> 41:57.240]  as well we've got it we've got it it's not selfish we've got to take back our lives like drudge said
[41:57.240 --> 42:01.240]  when he said feel the you know air you know touch the water i forget the exact quote it was better
[42:01.240 --> 42:07.080]  than what i just said when we saw that evil photo of zuckerberg walking and he's bipedal everybody
[42:07.080 --> 42:11.800]  else has devolved squatting there with these cheap ai systems on their head that these people are
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.680]  trying to control us google glasses failed all and we don't want this crap and notice now though
[42:16.680 --> 42:23.480]  they tell us all the CEOs go this is a false reality we offer a better one now this is all fake
[42:23.480 --> 42:29.160]  we're going to make it as ugly as we can that's been declassified so you accept this drug fake ai
[42:29.160 --> 42:33.720]  system no i don't want to accept the world in the universe you make can we pull up the drudge tweet
[42:33.720 --> 42:39.160]  about uh zuckerberg and the ai i forget it like drudge tweet says you know you know remember
[42:39.800 --> 42:44.440]  the you know the wind in your hair touching the water or something like that i need to send
[42:44.440 --> 42:50.440]  out stuff stuff more i saw this thing on on on reddit this morning because i'll go there a
[42:50.440 --> 42:56.120]  lot on the donald's they have great new sounds they find a lot of links and things and i and i saw it
[42:56.120 --> 43:01.800]  and it was like reddit had put out the question what is globalism like talking to us like what is
[43:01.800 --> 43:05.400]  the color yellow and what does it mean to you like the three years old that's how they get off
[43:05.400 --> 43:10.280]  i'm talking to us because you think well sir was oh they're dumb or they think we're dumb no no no
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.720]  they know dumbing down the message the message is the medium the message is turning you into that
[43:15.720 --> 43:20.600]  they talk to you like that to dumb the language down what is globalism does it exist like saying
[43:20.600 --> 43:27.240]  what is the sun does it exist what's funny alex we just got out of this huge you know um presidential
[43:27.240 --> 43:33.240]  you know electoral you know whole deal and i could always tell my friends who watch tv and
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.200]  they watched enormous amounts of tv just because when you'd have a conversation with them about
[43:38.200 --> 43:43.480]  you know the presidential uh debates or whatever you could tell and regurgitate who yeah you could
[43:43.480 --> 43:47.320]  tell who watches lots of tv and who doesn't who actually goes out and seeks information tries
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.640]  to find the truth and people just have talking points that you know they just spell will notice
[43:51.640 --> 43:56.120]  msnbc and cnn and and people like matt taimi that's about how they're intellectual all day
[43:56.120 --> 44:00.760]  what they are is really emotional cult members of their church of control
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.760]  and they can't admit that they're in a limited lexicon they're in a limited thesaurus a limited
[44:06.760 --> 44:11.800]  paradigm we're totally off the reservation labels mean nothing here i don't care what color you are
[44:11.800 --> 44:15.800]  where you're from as long as you promote freedom and and and believe in humanity i love you you're
[44:15.800 --> 44:20.760]  my brother you're my sister but i will not sit here then through guilt and bow down to your system
[44:20.760 --> 44:25.160]  that's only meant to make me submit you're not trying to get me to say i'm sorry for stuff i didn't
[44:25.160 --> 44:30.360]  do to make the world better you're doing it to make me your slave because you know i'm virtuous
[44:30.360 --> 44:37.560]  and i'm not going to do it but looking at this think about how controlled the media is think
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.920]  about everything we've talked about come true think about how the world is getting crazier and
[44:42.920 --> 44:48.360]  crazier and it's it's state run and and communism as an operating system of the robber barons is
[44:48.360 --> 44:53.000]  being rolled out on a planetary scale well done and their biggest weapon is the television you look
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.560]  at the mark dice interviews where nine out of ten people say put gun owners in forced labor camps
[44:57.560 --> 45:02.600]  uh nine out of ten say i mean i mean the latest thing is you know uh put big foot on the endangered
[45:02.600 --> 45:07.480]  species list he's not going out and finding mentally retarded people or folks that are deaf
[45:07.480 --> 45:11.960]  there's normal people off the street this is california this is trendy austin where let me tell
[45:11.960 --> 45:15.160]  you something they don't know what freaking planet they're on they're they're in a trance and it's
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.240]  actually funny to them that's the thing that really disturbs me sometimes it they actually find that
[45:19.240 --> 45:26.920]  it's that's funny that they don't know about anything exactly their pleasure is that is that
[45:26.920 --> 45:31.880]  they're uninformed and they'll always have some bigoted statement like you speak with the texas
[45:31.880 --> 45:38.280]  accent i don't listen to that and they relish being uninformed they relish uh being sheep they
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.960]  they they relish being led around and then look at their so-called gods i have met with and then
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.120]  around a lot of the top journalists in the country and you have dinner with them they're stupid
[45:48.120 --> 45:55.720]  i've been at the highest levels of hollywood and you know they're stupid i i mean what's crazy is
[45:55.720 --> 46:01.720]  to sit back and realize oh my god common sense is a hundred times smarter than these people that
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.440]  live in this whole plastic system and have no idea what they're doing it's pretty much work for them
[46:06.440 --> 46:11.480]  to actually go listen to 15 minutes of your show instead they just like to discredit you and say
[46:11.480 --> 46:17.800]  well he thinks frogs are gay haha it's a big joke it's funny discredit him right and then i come
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.520]  back out with sometimes a hundred articles i've done this like five times just testing them
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.360]  and i'll go here's the new scientist here's this sign of report here's the associated press here's
[46:26.360 --> 46:31.320]  Reuters here's this university let me have a scientist on it it's an epidemic of sperm low
[46:31.320 --> 46:37.080]  counts and tumors caused by glyphosate and i'll go ladies and gentlemen i'm so sick of them saying
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.960]  that i'm saying it's gay frogs this is made up hillary took that clip of me saying i'm sick of
[46:41.960 --> 46:47.720]  them saying gay frogs and put it in her national tv ad saying i said gay frogs again and it
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.280]  again it's that they're they think you're so stupid they would sit there and do that to you
[46:54.440 --> 46:56.200]  they would sit there and they put out new
[46:58.840 --> 47:04.840]  trump clips supposedly from his wife uh saying that she had to use masoni
[47:05.960 --> 47:11.400]  they're the ones launching this giant fake news crescendo they know they can just lie and put out
[47:11.400 --> 47:15.400]  one liners that draw attention and that are lies and they know people buy and then they exactly but
[47:15.400 --> 47:19.560]  then then they're accusing us of it and i mentioned matt tabie just i just picked him out because
[47:19.560 --> 47:24.520]  you know it's just people just walk around like oh i'm liberal i'm rolling stone oh i'm sorry we're
[47:24.520 --> 47:30.600]  only something like 50 something times bigger according to quantcast than the rolling stone
[47:30.600 --> 47:34.200]  people wonder why the rolling stone calls the new york times i don't even call them back because
[47:34.200 --> 47:38.120]  they're a joke they're just wanting to interview us to act like they did a real interview
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.440]  we're way bigger than them we're done with them so continuing at least he's out saying
[47:44.440 --> 47:49.080]  labeling news is fake is very dangerous and is a blacklist and we shouldn't do it so i single him
[47:49.080 --> 47:55.240]  out for attacking me a bunch the last few days and then i actually see him though at least agreeing
[47:55.240 --> 47:59.800]  you know this attempt to attack but then the international or a bunch of organizations of
[47:59.800 --> 48:04.040]  journalists have come out and said this is really dangerous and plus the new list the
[48:04.040 --> 48:10.120]  washington post is using welding didn't even it doesn't even say who it is it's some nebulous
[48:10.120 --> 48:15.480]  website it lists drudge in ourselves and says we're completely fake and then google puts alerts
[48:15.480 --> 48:21.480]  up on google chrome now saying don't go to our sites we're dangerous i mean folks that is such a
[48:21.480 --> 48:27.880]  a chevron such a star a gold star a metal make you want that i mean they're there oh no exactly
[48:27.880 --> 48:31.800]  they're like designating that we're the bad guys all i just did was show you a bunch of medical
[48:31.800 --> 48:36.120]  studies the tv's brain damaging your kids everybody knows that they're exposed what is fake about that
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.200]  what what they don't like folks is the sincerity they don't like sincerity is is where the power is
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.960]  folks that's when you get fully connected in your body with your gut your brain and your spirit is
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.920]  when you're for real and really care you're not alive you don't even you're you don't even activate
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.000]  your spirit i don't read this in some book or one of these phony churches i know it you don't
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.800]  activate yourself till you really care and until you really stop living in fear what people think
[49:01.800 --> 49:06.920]  about you and and i'm just telling you folks you can do it anytime you want you just say god come
[49:06.920 --> 49:10.920]  into me show me the truth i want to defeat evil and it's just like god will say are you ready for
[49:10.920 --> 49:15.800]  this and then the doors go boom blow back and you're like whoa i'm just telling him you can
[49:15.800 --> 49:20.120]  leave the matrix right now folks but let me tell you you start down the rabbit hole all i'm offering
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.240]  is the truth there's no doubt about that 10 years ago whenever i moved to austin started working for
[49:25.240 --> 49:30.680]  you alex uh it definitely is a way to open your eyes and you see things different and you read and
[49:30.680 --> 49:34.680]  you and you look into things and you're trying to find the truth and and then you all of a sudden
[49:34.680 --> 49:38.440]  it actually becomes a little addicting then all of a sudden you're you're looking for for more
[49:38.440 --> 49:43.480]  of that you're looking for sincerity in everything you do and then actually like you said it's it's
[49:43.480 --> 49:50.600]  down the rabbit hole you go and and once you've had sincerity and real love not fake um you know
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.800]  moral signaling once you've got the real thing it's like a woman you really love that you suddenly
[49:55.800 --> 50:00.840]  you don't want any other women it's fun when i started when i started cutting tv out all of a
[50:00.840 --> 50:04.040]  sudden is like i don't even want to see a tv at all i don't even want to see i don't care if it's
[50:04.040 --> 50:07.720]  not on i don't even want to be around it you know i want to be out camping oh that's like people don't
[50:07.720 --> 50:10.920]  believe me that like this new mel Gibson movie i know they license some clips of me in there and
[50:10.920 --> 50:15.560]  i'm in there and i'm in this other movie and a bunch of i mean i'm a you name it and i license
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.720]  them just because i see i'll see what they do i just you know sign the agreement christian bell
[50:19.720 --> 50:24.760]  movie you name it the point is it's such a pleasure that i hosted like four shows on history and
[50:24.760 --> 50:30.920]  discovery a few years ago and i never watched one of them i mean let me tell you let me tell you
[50:30.920 --> 50:34.520]  something most these people they're on the show they're sitting there with their family you know
[50:34.520 --> 50:39.000]  you know it's like the x-files characters based on me or whatever but that's just a sign of success
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.720]  breaking the matrix it's like i don't get a power trip out of it but i do take enjoyment well then
[50:43.720 --> 50:48.600]  in the fact that i don't watch any of it now i did watch two of the x-files and i did watch those

[54:20.680 --> 54:28.600]  the incredible news because we could talk about cappernick and all his garbage i mean this is
[54:28.600 --> 54:33.400]  just some idiot that watches tv all day and you know he's google and facebook funding all this
[54:33.400 --> 54:39.080]  race war crap this is just some waffle head that thinks if he bitches and gets into political
[54:39.080 --> 54:45.320]  correctness that you know it's somehow he's trendy and cool and doing something avant garde when the
[54:45.320 --> 54:51.240]  guy's a joke bucking the system defeating the system overthrowing the system empowering individuals
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.880]  is the answer we have a scientific global dictatorship that is third wave colonialism
[54:58.440 --> 55:05.000]  establishing corporate world governance i talked about reddit today was like what is globalism
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.320]  is it like globalization and everybody starts going are you kidding it's the announced form
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.960]  of planetary government in thousands of publications they're like oh we heard the alt
[55:17.960 --> 55:25.480]  rights into it does it exist of course they know they're globalist it's all part of their game
[55:26.840 --> 55:32.040]  the best hacks like i want a slow loris attack is where they just hit you with a handshake to
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.400]  your computer but never even ask for a command it's just the first point of connection and then
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.520]  it's like like you know like the punk kid would do in junior high he reached out to shake your hand
[55:42.520 --> 55:48.040]  they go oh i'm too cool to shake your hand i was like practicing how to be dishonorable
[55:48.840 --> 55:52.600]  that's what they do now i hate to say see i told you so
[55:52.600 --> 56:03.320]  but i have not believe trot would get in office without a major fight since he won two plus weeks
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.200]  ago and i said at the time i said okay my spider since says celebrate the victory over political
[56:08.200 --> 56:14.120]  correctness hillary's coming back and i personally told trot i said president elect she's going to
[56:14.120 --> 56:19.160]  still contest this she's going to stage riots they're going to try to get a recount
[56:19.160 --> 56:25.400]  and justice has to be done i understand the president doesn't go after people but
[56:25.400 --> 56:27.880]  you know we need a strong attorney general but i don't think you're going to get to that point
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.840]  he said just a moment just a moment he goes back to this he goes very interesting Alex tell me more
[56:33.640 --> 56:37.880]  i got the feeling somebody else came on the line i think the word i got was even having to
[56:37.880 --> 56:43.800]  argument with somebody five minutes before about that exact thing and i don't tell you these stories
[56:43.800 --> 56:50.280]  to impress you ladies and gentlemen i tell you these stories because not living in the matrix
[56:50.280 --> 56:57.000]  like the general public has brought me to this point the real interfacing with reality is outside
[56:57.000 --> 57:06.200]  of the corporate system everything the corporate system does is to keep you controlled and programmable
[57:06.200 --> 57:12.280]  and not conscious and not awake and not your own person so i'm going to break all this down but of
[57:12.280 --> 57:18.840]  course hillary was behind the recount the entire time the democratic donors were behind it and now
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.000]  ribs pre was came out and sounded the alarm that she's going to try to overturn it and they're trying
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.680]  to overturn the electors they're going to try to steal it on december 19th of the 20th at the
[57:28.680 --> 57:33.720]  electoral college i told you that a week and a half ago before the fricking recount started
[57:34.840 --> 57:41.000]  because of the death threats and stuff going on to electors and also my sources but i'll just be
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.720]  quite frank with you 90 percent of what we do is right out of mainstream news we just analyze it but

[58:59.320 --> 59:05.400]  much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and

[59:44.840 --> 59:48.920]  lives.com thank you dr group from the global healing center thank you so much for all your
[59:48.920 --> 01:00:07.240]  works are on this great product you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:16.040]  you want answers well so does he it's alex jones
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:27.160]  listen it's not that what i'm saying is that special it's that the globalists are projecting
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:35.560]  a system that is meant to hurt you all i'm trying to do is promote free will and a chance for children
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.720]  to grow up and be their own persons and differentiate and really create magical directions for humanity
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:46.920]  to go in i realize children are magic it's why i want to protect them want to build a better
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.280]  world for them and my instinct is i want to kill people that want to hurt them i'm going to be honest
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:59.400]  with you that's why i can't cover pizza gate that much is because yet i can't have a heart attack
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:07.080]  people so i don't say this like i'm some great goody two shoes but i have a lot of empathy
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:14.520]  and you know that's associated with more of an awareness more of a connection to the world
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.320]  but i'm also a pragmatist you know there are people that have so much empathy that
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:27.080]  i showed a picture of me over at friends house cutting up their turkey and did you know that
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.760]  animal was probably kept in torturous conditions and wanted a good life and it was killed here's
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.880]  the deal it's a prey animal it's an animal that humans and coyotes and wolves and wildcats eat
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.320]  and so that's its place in the universe should it be treated humanely absolutely because i deserve
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:52.040]  to eat something that's non-gmo and not full of garbage and if i do i'm punishing myself karma
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:59.080]  or you reap what you sow is certainly real but the agenda pushing animal rights
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:09.640]  the agenda pushing animal rights is anti-human and meant to take control over the environment
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:14.920]  from us so we can't be independent that's why the department of interior and department of labor
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:21.080]  remember five years ago wanted to ban kids doing any chores on the farm because they want you in
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.960]  there watching tv being a good little processed bot into the new system now once the processing's
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.080]  done they're gonna turn all this crap off and really set up a nightmare situation
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.520]  you know my my dad's dad loved his cows so much he did come over and he pet them and
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:43.400]  when my dad i was a kid joking after his dad died he said yeah this this herd was never profitable
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.680]  we're gonna sell this thing off my dad wouldn't be happy because he'd hardly sell cows
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:55.080]  but he'd been a world war two bomber pilot and a tough guy and a golden gloves boxing
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:01.320]  champion a smart guy he's a tough guy uh you know man's man but he he fed those cows it was around
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.680]  those cows he only had a couple hundred of them that he wouldn't even kill him he wouldn't even
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.400]  sell him off or if he would he'd shoot him in the head himself haul him up with a tractor by
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:19.240]  their legs and butchering himself and it was a it was a whole connection of the earth and then
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.240]  the average 20 would say well that's barbarous to kill something yourself no it's a respect thing
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.120]  that if you're gonna kill this cow you're gonna kill yourself
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.880]  it's just totally lost touch with our humanity i could sit here and tell you all day long about
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.840]  cappernick and what a little spoiled rotten piece of filthy as what is it what where does that get us
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.160]  where does that get us ahead
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.360]  then i think about the ruling class they're the only people that would be willing to do all
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:00.200]  these bad things to control and shudder humanity and that's why they've been given the power on
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:07.560]  this planet to do what they do is because they're Satanists
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.560]  and those of us that don't want to grab a kid out of their backyard and torture them for six months
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:22.840]  and drug them before you blow their head off that sounds like a damn nightmare you'd kill yourself
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.280]  before you did any of that wouldn't you before i'd fish some kid out of their backyard and throw
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.520]  him in the van and drug them and take them for freaking scumbags or rape the hell out of them

[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:30.040]  weeks after a shocking video goes viral that showed an 80-year-old italian businessman being
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.160]  forced by the state to house african migrants in his hotel now we learned this news today that the
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.200]  plan is slated to go through in hyperdrive come december the government is keeping it secret so
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.400]  that no one will sway the upcoming referendum which could lead to ousting their current pro-migrant

[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:33.400]  all right we are back live we are watching a disgusting parade of cavernic and trudel the
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:40.200]  prime minister of canada and obama and others uh thank obama they're saying might go to the funeral
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:46.440]  of fiddle castro fiddle castro killed hundreds of thousands of people he launched wars in angola
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.520]  that killed some estimates are half million people no one really knows uh i i've even had family and
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:59.320]  friends that fought in southern and central africa it was just a decades of hell uh a lot of it
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.400]  never even on our news and the communists just go into whole villages kill everyone that don't
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.720]  submit and then fiddle castro lived in a palace with all these women
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:16.600]  he was a cia blowback program that's all declassified and i get the fact that you know the cia tried
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:22.120]  to kill him so he was a survivor so he looks like a hero but the cia created him and i just
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:26.360]  can't believe if donald trump did one tenth of what castros done i wouldn't support him
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.200]  it didn't matter if donald trump you know likes me and you know calls me and says thank you
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.360]  i was invited to cuba before they're like you might meet with castro pat on the head that's
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:41.160]  what he does with all these idiots so i see tweeting and saying how great he was and it's
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:46.200]  just so frustrating to see this when look at venezuela look at cuba look at north korea look
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:52.680]  at what happened in russia look at china communism is just a bunch of ruling generals controlling
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.560]  the economies and demanding your daughter come service them i mean it is a horrible system of
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.120]  slavery but it's pushed as the best things to slice bread and we've got that going on
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.880]  and we've got the point that soros and hillary have bankrolled seven million dollars
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.720]  to the head of the green party which is really the communist party to do recounts and the big
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:19.960]  tell as i said a week ago is it's only in states trump won only in battlegrounds when
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.400]  there's other states hillary clearly stole according to bev harris who's a real election
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:30.360]  fraud expert a real liberal she just tells the truth but we saw it happen 100 percent many
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.720]  key precincts for hillary won were she get 100 percent of the vote does anybody believe that
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:42.280]  does anybody believe any of this crap so i i've told trump i when i talked to him a couple weeks
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.160]  ago i've told his people i said you watch they're not gonna give up they want those five supreme
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.040]  court justices they want to launch these wars they're not giving up they know you're a nationalist
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.480]  and you telling them you're not going to prosecute them they're not stupid
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.440]  you're not going to be able to find any prosecutor that won't want to go after them with the
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.200]  stuff that's happened now it came out as soon as hillary launched this a few days ago that
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.720]  trump is looking to have other foreign governments release the foundation info the laundered
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:15.560]  money just like we pressure switzerland to expose somebody so quite frankly i knew that over a week
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.840]  ago and i was saying just trust trump because at the level we've gotten this is beyond journalism
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.320]  now we always tell the truth but if something's going to damage the country or or our our free
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.960]  system if i've got something i'm not going to tell people if it helps the enemy we're in a
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:37.640]  total war folks this isn't rhetoric we're in a total war we are 53 days out from the inauguration
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.960]  of donald trump he is completely surrounded we have a precarious beachhead i like him this to
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:49.880]  normandy and 20 troop carriers have landed we've only got 300 troops on the shore and it's all
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:56.120]  coming down and they are planning something big folks race riots destabilization you name it
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.240]  they want a civil war let me tell you something i'm not a drama queen everybody knows that i've
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.320]  liberals i've never had problems with liberals they are coming up brandishing guns at me on the
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:09.720]  street they are telling me they're gonna get me uh i've actually gone ahead i'm gonna pull the
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.000]  trigger and get full-time security now uh because of it it's serious okay and i'm not gonna get all
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.360]  the stuff that's happening but let me just tell you something it's bad okay and it shows the
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.760]  season we're in we got communists up and down the street and awesome with guns threatening and say
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.600]  kill cops with guns in their hands that's not free speech that's a terroristic threat so
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:41.000]  we're here 53 days out i cannot stress to you how serious the situation is economist even more
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.640]  said on fox news of election results are overturned we will be looking at a civil war
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:51.080]  and he's absolutely right that's their plan because they can't win politically and they
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.760]  know there's a great awakening not of right-wing stuff or racism but of nationalism and common
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:03.160]  sense and freedom and not being bullied by political correctness and it's happening from
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.360]  catalonian spain to what's happening in brazil to what's happening with the briggs it with the
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.840]  the eu and and they have a quote you know oh and read it what's globalism it's worldwide
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:19.080]  corporate tyranny and people are waking up to it so their whole investment everything they've
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:24.840]  done the banksters have done is coming unravel and it's got to the point where the pope who's
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:30.360]  officially making a deal with the communist chinese to set catholic doctrine that's associated press
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:36.520]  the guardian pope possible deal with china would betray christ says hong kong cardinal it actually
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:44.760]  says we will set our doctrine worldwide not just in beijing with you this is a takeover they
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.120]  said which one about the catholic church it had its problems it was taken over by pedophile rings
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.280]  infiltrated that's how they blackmailed cell controls that's why good u.s intelligence
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:57.000]  agents these are good groups in and leaked all the pizza gate stuff as a checkmate instead of
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.360]  them using this against our government they've recruited pedophiles in the government let's
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.920]  just get the whole thing out and that's why signs disappeared because he was ready to release it all
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:10.360]  folks we are in the most dangerous time in world history right now so i wanted to get and i appreciate
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.960]  him coming on on short notice former navy seal author researcher matt bracken enemies foreign

[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  policy dot com the site that we usually show the article it's behind a paywall so we're able to get
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.960]  it to load for a few seconds but then it jumps off screen oh i got it well i'm not mad i understand

[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.600]  because it was my dad texted me earlier he goes alex the fake news is the fact that they started
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:36.440]  this three years ago so again this is the declared war against free speech that's now happening you
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.640]  understand so i cannot stress to you the emotional level here but i'm very intellectual when it comes
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.400]  to analyzing it very cold but they understand they have a cold but i'm here because the news is so
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.200]  important they understand their time is short they're really on every front so matt bracken of
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:57.320]  enemies foreign and domestic dot com joins us to break this down you've heard in the last 10 minutes
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:04.200]  my analysis obviously do you agree with it disagree with it what what other other info can you add
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:10.440]  my intellectual gut tells me that the real attacks coming i totally agree with it just
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:17.320]  as far as the fake news going a little bit on that the cia has employed quote unquote journalists
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:24.840]  you know real and fake journalists and send them around the world to generate fake stories you know
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.880]  that have obviously they need to have a kernel of truth in them but the trick is to plant the
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.080]  fake story in mainstream media you know so it appears to be just some legitimately sourced
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:43.560]  just organically developed news story out of timbuktu in you know 1955 the cia has been doing
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.440]  that from the very beginning i mean that's been a modus operandi after the church commission they
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.800]  tried to squelch that but they they can get around that so easily you know just like mockingbird well
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.880]  then what do you make of their whole fake news initiative it's usually blowing up in their face
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.360]  everybody knows they're the corporate globalist soros fake news and let's shift gears into i'm
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.360]  going to skip this break this is so important this whole civil war push they're involved in
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.160]  well the whole jillstein thing i think we need to know where the money's coming from are they
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:17.560]  five dollar donations or is it coming from uh you know um soros groups i think that they
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.520]  there's zero hedge and some other other websites this morning have nailed it i think it's an attempt
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:31.400]  to push past push the recounts past december 19th the december 19th is a is a hard a hard date
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.800]  they can't put that off the electoral college has to vote on december 19th if it doesn't because
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:42.760]  they're recounting in pennsylvania and wisconsin and so on they hope to then throw it into congress
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.120]  and create a complete scene of turmoil and i think steven more who generally just is talking
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.920]  about economics he's one of the uh trump economic team he's absolutely right i think they're trying
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:58.920]  to instigate a civil war i would say since you mentioned it here is the economist saying get
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:05.640]  ready for civil war the democrats are still in a state of denial about what happened in the election
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.760]  it would be one thing uh melissa if this were election were decided by say just one state but
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.480]  for the most you know for the most part donald trump an elect one an electoral
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:21.160]  uh landslide i will say this that if the democrats challenge this and try to change the election i
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.120]  think there would be a bit of a civil war in this country and one other thing you know you look back
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:31.800]  at history one of richard nixon's finest moment was when he did not contest the election in 1960
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.680]  that may well have been stolen from him and also say the same thing to al gore who accepted the
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.880]  results well after they were confirmed but i think hillary clint has to stop up and accept these
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.920]  results matt bracken again former navy seal a guy that comes highly recommended by smart
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.440]  folks he's had the pentagon that can't come on air because of classification reasons they say
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.440]  get this guy on he's a smart cookie which he's proven coming on the last six months with us
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.040]  i know he was big before i ever found him there's so many great people out there on the internet
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:03.000]  which totally dominates mainstream media when you add us all together but when info wars is now
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.800]  126 on quank cast bigger than bbc bigger than the new york times online they're in panic mode saying
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:16.520]  they want to shut us down uh but obviously i figured this out myself and then talked to a
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.840]  bunch of trump insiders i did not bring this up when i talked to trump it was limited time obviously
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.880]  but i figured out he at least told them hey back off take the results i'll leave you alone
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:31.640]  we now know obama called told hillary you know you better concede hillary's now double backing on
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:37.320]  that deal uh so trump's going ahead and announcing okay we'll go after your foundation uh i mean i
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:45.960]  cannot stress to people the street fight we're in right now with 50 days out 53 days out from this
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.880]  from from his inauguration i think they're going to pull out all the stops false flags you name it
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.960]  so so so spill your guts and i don't speculate what do you think's gonna happen i think this is i
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.640]  think this is sort of like a game of liars poker going on and a lot of it has to do with the calendar
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:04.840]  there are things that trump would say after january 20th if he's inaugurated that he he dare not say
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:12.680]  now i think that the electoral college december 19th is a critical day and obviously the inauguration
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:17.800]  january 20th but there's a game of liars poker you've got cards that are our face up and you've
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:22.120]  got cards that are face down you've got cards still in the deck on the bottom of the deck up your
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:27.800]  sleeve you know inside of your shoe and we're just seeing the face cards that are you know
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.000]  facing up but that's only a tiny fraction of the game that's like the invisible part of the
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:41.080]  iceberg there's an entire war going on right now um at a at a you know at a hidden level
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:47.080]  and the jillstein thing i think she's just being out she's being pushed as a patsy i think she's
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.960]  just being somebody's puppet probably sorrows hillary is going to see if it looks like it might
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:56.760]  actually work she'll go for it but if they if they do something to disrupt the electoral
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:03.960]  college vote on the 19th or threaten enough electoral college you know electors to change
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:10.200]  the outcome i think that what they're hoping for is that some somebody on either side is going to
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:16.600]  pull out a rifle and say damn it that's the end at this point a lee harvey oswald could walk into
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:22.520]  history and change history that's why something like what happened at osu today immediately goes
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.680]  the top of the news because we don't know if it's a guy named mohammed or if it's a guy named you
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:32.840]  know cletus turnbuckle from the white people's party uh you know everybody's waiting to see
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:38.280]  who it is because it's not such so much a matter of you know the eight wounded or i don't know if
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:43.240]  any have died that's obviously an important story but it's no more important say than the chattanooga
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:49.400]  bus um in terms of you know the families that are impacted but the the reason that it becomes immediate
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:56.600]  top of the hour news with you know with uh news conferences and breaking news etc is because it's
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:01.800]  it's up it has potential political ramifications notice how they said for three hours it was a
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:07.880]  gun because any type of campus emergency when they default to emergency you know high duck cover
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.160]  you know prepare to die whatever it is they say it becomes a gun even though they knew for hours they
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.600]  said mass shooting with a gun even though it was now a butcher knife not even a machete and look i'm
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.480]  not saying it was probably islamicist but every time i hear about a machete or a knife nine times
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.600]  out of ten it's an islamicist doing it and we know isis has called for intensified attacks on
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.640]  soft targets with knives unless it's unless it's a person having a psychotic break because that
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:39.240]  also happens you know um people will just walk into a mall and and they're you know they're seeing
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:44.920]  something that's not there you know they're seeing themselves in a in a delusional world where you
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.160]  know there are evil uh aliens around sure they might be a superhero and they think we're taking
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.000]  out the aliens of video game heads yeah that something i i jogged my memory today you know that
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.200]  the um the biggest school massacre in history happened in 1927 in in bath township michigan
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:10.440]  there were a 44 killed and another um 50 or so badly injured when a a person put dynamite in
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.880]  the school this is way before the internet i remember that television it's before television so
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:20.600]  there have always been psychotics that might do something like this but the difference then the
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.720]  reason that it's happening now is that the culture and the and television and the internet it's a way
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:31.080]  to grab instant or immortality you know if you're if you're a loser in life you can you can at least
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.680]  become famous and sure i agree with you and i'm not for big brother technology but they admit
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.560]  with the algorithms and things a psychopath online is very easy to predict what he's going to do
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:45.400]  amazon can predict when you're going to order something before you order it
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:51.240]  why are they not doing the profiling then when it's constitutional if it's open source stuff
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.400]  you're doing why does the system seem to want to protect criminals and psychopaths
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:00.600]  i don't know but with 300 million people just the law of averages says that even you know without
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:07.240]  this uh telegraphing in advance on facebook or so forth um you know that like look at the guy
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:15.560]  omor matin in orlando uh you know that if they couldn't detect omor matin uh and he'd been interviewed
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.160]  by the fbi when his dad was on tv saying kill the gays right so if they couldn't if they couldn't
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:27.080]  dissuade or detect an omor matin then i then somebody that's even further off the radar
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.800]  or never been on the radar is virtually impossible to well sure and we know they we they know they
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.600]  they knew he was there but it's just like the book that's out from the former
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.480]  government analysts that they were ordered not even look at something if it had the name islamic
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.720]  in it so so that's that's going to change that's definitely going to change you know
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:51.240]  one of the things that obama did was purge the trainers that were consultants to the fbi and
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:58.200]  the pentagon and so forth uh fellows like the man who wrote the man who wrote uh uh seno evil
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.120]  and um uh the other there are other books by the people that were kicked out basically the book
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:07.640]  see something say something we had him on something say something it's one of the daily books of
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:12.040]  that guy was senior analysts and they would have people planning stuff and they'd say we're not
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:15.240]  allowed to look at something that's islamic or a mosque they're like but they're saying they're
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:20.040]  going to do it they go it doesn't exist because they said islamic terror doesn't exist right
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:27.400]  both the boston massacre and san bernadino are the direct result of that purge because the people
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.760]  that that did it would have been detected for example going to saudi arabia and coming back
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.240]  with a pakistani madrasa trained fanatic wife that would have been stopped you know she would have
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.840]  been picked up at the airport uh interrogated etc by the way from my view back then i was saying
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.240]  back then i was saying well it must be an inside job if they knew and let them do it
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.280]  but instead it is an inside job it's not the low-level fbi it's the order to stand down
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:57.720]  so i'm right i just didn't have all the angles figured out because i was sitting there watching
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:03.320]  this another place that this is playing out right now in real time is in the military uh
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.720]  the the fact that they can't and soldiers cannot carry uh personal weapons or issued weapons on
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:16.120]  base he's changing that but the military that the obama generals these politically correct
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:21.080]  sycophants are putting a million catch 22 regulations in in front of it so that it's
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:26.280]  virtually impossible to um still carry a weapon you know you have to well trump just countermand
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:34.040]  all that i'm sorry won't trump just countermand it he he can have after uh january 20th possibly
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.920]  but um you know there are some regulation factors that i've been reading about if they do these if
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.240]  they put in these new regulations now and it's not countermanded within 60 days it becomes a law
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.520]  and it might require more than just an executive order let me ask you this then mr bracken looking
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:53.560]  at the islamic threat the the tet tet to islam clearly that's what's going on they've made a deal
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.480]  you said this like a year ago i was like that's wild it's confirmed they've made a deal to let them
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:02.280]  they have tv ads on how to like cover up abusing your wife how to make people submit to you we're
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:08.280]  being told they're putting women by the jibs on california and and and uh uk tv but christians
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:13.640]  can't wear crosses clearly a deal's been made with radical or orthodox islam so what are these
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:20.120]  sleeper cells the lefts brought in what is their purpose i well the the violent sleeper cells are
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:28.680]  actually considered um uh damaging to the cause by the much more dangerous cultural infiltrators
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.040]  that look at it from a generational long-term demographic point of view that will have seven
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:39.640]  babies each you'll have one and a half babies each and will outnumber you they look at the ones that
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:45.320]  actually pull the jihad the violent jihad as blowing their cover and and harming the cause so
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:51.400]  there's an internal conflict within the jihad over whether or not to do it completely by stealth
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:59.080]  and demographics or to or to um you know do violent jihad as isis has called for so there's
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.880]  that internal conflict right there within the muslim community inside of the of the west america
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.360]  europe everywhere right we're gonna you can see in germany i mean they're in germany they're you
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:13.560]  know going halal basically you know they're just saying we can't win so we're just going to take
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.840]  down the cross we're going to we're going to i was about to say the german government is making
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:24.360]  people submit to islam taking down crosses ending october fest because it makes the muslims man
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:30.520]  i'm asking you why is the left so inherently allied with it uh mr bracken state right there
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.280]  we're gonna come back i'm gonna open the phones up as well what do you think's coming up with
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.520]  the selection what do you think's coming up with the push for civil war it's clearly going on
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:44.360]  we're 53 days out from the inauguration the electoral college is on the 20th of next month

[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:13.320]  emails within the wikileaks dump that indict john pedesta his brother tony and james elefantis now
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.040]  the mainstream media instead of asking questions the same ones that we would ask here at info wars
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:23.320]  they've taken it upon themselves to indict the quote fake media they have an article up on their
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:29.320]  website entitled fake news onslaught targets pizzeria as a nest of child trafficking they go on to
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.360]  say quote days before the presidential election james elefantis owner of a local pizza restaurant
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.640]  called comet ping pong noticed an unusual spike in the number of his instagram followers within

[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.160]  not telegraphed to people like i said earlier this isn't rhetoric they're trying a recount i
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:46.440]  said hillary was behind it over a week ago she admitted it two days ago um just like i said this
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.480]  is probably a jihadi attack that's now admitted i mean it just gets more and more obvious we have
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:57.160]  people running the country that literally hate prosperity because their systems of command
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:02.360]  and control can't compete with it what else is on your big board what else are you looking for and
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:07.560]  how do we get aggressive because here's the deal i don't i'm not trying to shoot my mouth off but
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:13.400]  we can have a go at breakfast when a guy followed me out for no reason from the diner my son got
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.720]  another car with my cousin they were going to go off i had friends with me and the guy showed
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:22.600]  me his gun and like bowed up and stuff and i caught myself and i'm not bragging i didn't have a gun
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.560]  with me the vehicles full of guns behind me getting started to get out it's his wife tugged him and
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.880]  he ran around the corner and i'm trying to act tough i was going to go over there and beat the
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.440]  living hell out of him and i'm not trying to act tough it's just it's it's what i do i have a problem
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:42.200]  running in fact i get high when somebody is trying to attack me like you're in my face i'm going to
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.760]  tear you apart but i'm actually realized this job is more important and getting the word out is
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.160]  more important so i'm going to try to more and more we've seen we've seen that on we we've seen
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:59.160]  that on camera when i i i try to avoid uh public demonstrations anymore because i get i get to um
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:05.320]  hyped up also i mean i i i uh tend to go right towards it and and get in their face when they're
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.400]  in my face exactly i must say i'm a tough guy but i've got buttons they can push so i'm kind of going
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:13.720]  into a fortress mode now not allowing myself because they're everywhere i go they're they're
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:18.680]  getting in my face now what does that signify to you because there is a real hysteria i mean i've
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.880]  well the media is the media and obama and the democrats in general have been fanning it up
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.680]  every time a cop is shot sitting in his car i blame that on obama that goes all the way back
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:35.960]  through his entire presidency is whipping up this hatred of police um to where we're where you know
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:42.360]  they're shoving uh people into subway tracks saying basically i hate white people so that the
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.960]  the knockout game is now becoming the subway game so you're afraid of around mass transportation
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:52.280]  somebody's just going to take the chance to shove you under the tracks well that hatred has been
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:58.440]  generated and whipped up by the democrats and the media i i i see a huge media battle right now
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:05.160]  then the old media is trying to call it the alt right media i call it just the new media i would
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.520]  say the new media is better the rebirth of medium and i apologize for getting to myself i'm i'm
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:16.760]  actually psychoanalyzing on air the point that these people get in my face they minus me they're
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.400]  assaulting me i'm not saying i'm even going to win the fight i have a problem that i want to fight
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.640]  them when they assault me you know verbally or threaten me physically so i think you should
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.560]  i think you should send a christmas card to steve bannon because he's become the number one
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:39.240]  whipping boy of the new media instead of you for the time being right now what the what the old
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:48.760]  media is trying to do is to conflate uh bright part uh this this uh jack wad uh mr spencer who
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:54.360]  has like a following that you know could meet in a hotel room but the the the old old mainstream
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:59.800]  media puts the cameras on him and tries to make it look like you know the rise of uh hitler and
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:06.760]  in bavaria uh you know they're they're in a they're in a um uh symbiotic relationship this little
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:11.960]  pepsqueak uh sure i want to talk about that and i i've talked a little bit to bannon uh actually
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:15.880]  and they are attacking him 10 times more than they are me i only get like 50 articles a day
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:20.120]  saying disavow me for saying sandy hook didn't happen i never said that i said they clearly had
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.760]  actors there they exacerbated it they pumped it up to demonize the second amendment they take that
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:30.120]  out of context but they're definitely wanting to cut trump out of the real patriots that are
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:33.640]  that are supporting him or in his administration but let's shift back to what you just said about
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:41.160]  dead cops i don't have some frank a file worship of french or anglophile worship of british uh or
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:46.680]  other jock sniffing such deals for what a group is i i'm all about individuals but i again i'm not in
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:52.040]  some cop worship fest except that i've noticed cops tend to be more awake than the general public
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:57.640]  and more involved are there bad cops absolutely aren't the bad cops totally but the fact that the
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:03.000]  sorrows of the globalists would demonize cops as the main enemy and act like they run the show
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.360]  and say they're all racist and then have eight of them killed the last week murdered and when i put
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:14.360]  videos out they only get 300 400 000 views when my other videos get three four five million i'm
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.880]  actually ashamed of america that we know the name of trevon martin and all these other people that
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:26.280]  started it and that these cops that were killed pumping gas or changing tires or riding a ticket
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:32.200]  or at a or at a wreck we don't even know their names nobody cares that lets me know this when i
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:39.480]  get killed nobody's gonna care about me so it's an automatic kinship to experience being demonized
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:44.440]  and people out to get you and being hunted and your fellow countrymen don't give a damn you've
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:49.320]  been dehumanized all because you're not a traitor and i'll be honest i see these communists i'm gonna
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:53.800]  be honest i want to get in my car i want to go down there and beat the crap out of them because
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:58.440]  i'm sick of their crap they're in every day in austin and all over the country and on tape
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.080]  saying kill me too and threatening our female reporter and they're allowed to walk around
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.440]  with loaded guns saying kill cops in austin and i want to ask a question that's terrorism why are
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:14.040]  they allowed to do that these people are scum why are we waiting while they foment people to go kill
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:19.560]  cops right here in texas i fundamentally am pissed well they're piling they're piling tinder up in
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:25.240]  the gunpowder factory and throwing matches in it's all part of the same piece you know they're
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.840]  they're and they need to pay that's what i'm saying they'll get some poor black person who's
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.880]  brain dead you know from all the culture brainwashing to go kill a cop these little skinny neck
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.280]  communists they're not killing anybody they sit around like they're better than us directing all
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.080]  this and i'm asking a question why aren't their asses in jail right now if i was calling for
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.960]  killing cops with loaded guns in downtown austin i deserve to be arrested if i was if they were
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:55.080]  calling for killing male men i'd say they need to be arrested this is bs so i'm asking you matt
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:45:01.480]  bracken why is the government putting up with it well right now we're in the last days of obama
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:08.200]  and sometimes when a when a light bulb right before it pops and goes out it gets real bright and
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:12.360]  starts flickering and acting crazy have you ever noticed that you know an old philip an old philip
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:17.480]  light bulb i think that the that the mainstream media and the democrats they're all this in the
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:23.720]  george george soros the democrats mainstream media they realize they've got until you know
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:29.960]  a december yeah why is he still walking around yeah it's a good question well it for one thing
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:34.280]  he's probably extremely well guarded and very careful and you know moves only on his own private
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:40.120]  jets but um it'll be in it it's very interesting to see what's gonna happen if after trump is in
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:45.000]  and he's got the reins of power because they they do appear to be going for broke and just pile in
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.440]  the you know they're throwing gasoline on a uh bonfire right now basically whipping up hatred
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:56.120]  against cops they're still going with the hands up don't shoot false narrative we know which is a lie
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:01.640]  which you know led to a lot of the uh anger that you know the whole blm movement based on a lie
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:07.480]  same thing with uh with uh travon martin based on a lie so they're obviously they're they're i guess
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.360]  you would call them psychological arsonists you know the media and the democrats george soros
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.640]  they're all on the same team but they've only got a few more weeks and then they're out of
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:22.520]  they're out of power they're going to be on the sideline and you know they'll still have some power
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.800]  but right now when we already saw that the old media was beat down by the new media well sure
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:33.640]  that's my next question that's my next question i'm not vindictive i'm not authoritarian we can't
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:39.800]  leave this cancer here who's authoritarian anti-freedom most overthrow our system what do we do then
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:45.160]  once trump gets in i mean these people have overthrown other countries they've funded isis
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:50.200]  they've overthrown all these other nations like ukraine we can't just let them sit there
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:56.200]  and reconstitute and call for our killings i mean the communists on their websites call for my death
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.760]  i go to the police department follow complaint they go we're sorry we can't do anything that's wrong
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:06.120]  well it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of weeks you know
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:11.320]  that the media is the overt propaganda arm of soros and the democrat party they worked
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:18.360]  they work together they're a team but they couldn't get hill reelected despite day after day lying
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.960]  coming out with obviously completely bogus polls now they've lost all their credibility
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:29.560]  more and more people are going to info wars breitbart and drudge to get their news so the
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:35.960]  more hysterical and shrill they get trying to you know call steve bannon a racist they're still
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:42.440]  calling him an anti-semite based on a you know a single headline which was written an article
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:48.840]  written by david horowitz about another jewish fellow uh bill crystal i believe that he said
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.480]  renegade jew one jew called another jew for being liberal renegade what the hell has to be
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:48:01.000]  cemented but the propaganda the soros abc and nbc now meanwhile soros rounded up thousands of jews
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  and robbed them but he's okay well they'll never get into that but their youtube doesn't go away
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.720]  though and this is where i think that there is some hope because you know based on my children
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.880]  they don't watch tv to get the news they hear about something they go straight to youtube so
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.840]  things like the uh soros interview for my few years back they're not they're not going to go
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:28.280]  he's proud of supporting hitler exactly so let me ask you this question where do they go is
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.160]  they're defeated because i agree with you we are defeating them they're freaking out almost at a sick
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:37.240]  level i just hope they bring it stage some stuff because everything they do is going to blow up in
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.160]  their face i think they're they're going for that burning down the house scenario and at the very top
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.720]  the ones that aren't the street agitators but the ones that are the you know highest financiers at
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.440]  the soros level i think that they're not worried that they can go anywhere they've got jets with
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.960]  global capability they've got you know mansions and guards on every continent so i think that at
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.800]  their level they don't care they'll come back and buy the rubble you know on pennies on the dollar
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.880]  after the civil war they'll never get away with it but at the at the very top the way i look at it
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:15.880]  george soros uh based on his age how he looks how he sounds i think he's probably going to these
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.680]  swiss clinics and getting his you know very special rejuvenations which is probably very closely
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:28.200]  tied in with some very evil satanic type of deals you know what i'm just saying it's it's
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:35.240]  children's blood transfusions yeah that's right and but even he has to know he's running out of time
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:43.960]  and as a megalomaniac uh ego maniac atheist i think that he believes he has to go for it now
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.200]  he has to burn down the house that's the danger i totally agree you've got all these old evil
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:52.920]  globalists that think they see it all slipping they're going to double down nothing's more dangerous
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.320]  than some old guy that thinks his time is up right and i don't think that george soros has
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:04.040]  no hope of being global dictator of the world or the world's richest man that's not what motivates
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:09.400]  somebody he just wants to bring down america he wants to be he wants to in in essence put himself
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:15.880]  on mount rushmore a virtual mount rushmore in the sense of being someone that every history book
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:22.920]  when you turn to 2017 there has to be a chapter on george soros how he blew up the world that
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.280]  that no matter what you think of him like like fiddle castro you know no matter what you think
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:34.040]  of him he's part of the history book and that's his motivation and i and speaking of fiddle
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:41.400]  his funeral is going to be one of these rare litmus tests who goes who goes there as a sycophant
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:47.480]  you know uh apologist for tyranny and mass murderer and and who just sends nobody that's
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:53.080]  right imagine if trump would have killed even castro admits 200 000 people millions in prisons
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.520]  funding revolutions all over the world and i'll give it to him he was he was less of a killer
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:01.400]  than other communists and i get a mainly guy he says about survival these death threats i don't
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:07.720]  dislike him as a man but to worship him and to laud him when he was such a monster is a joke
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:14.440]  right and and if you lived in columbia uh during you know from the from the 70s until recently or
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:21.640]  if you lived in in uh peru during the 1980s sendero luminoso and and the fark where every bit is
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:28.840]  evil as uh as boko haram or isis they also did ritual torture slayings you know recruitment
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:34.840]  of children forced recruitment of children uh reprisals where they massacred entire villages
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:40.920]  including torture massacres so and that was that was all funded by cuba you know that was uh
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:47.240]  cuban agents cuban funds so yeah i defy uh shon penn and danie glover and these people
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:53.720]  to go to go to cuba after it's free they'll chase you in the streets the the cuban people right
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:52:00.360]  now i mean that are stewed and they say oh the cubans are very quiet they're very uh they're
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:05.720]  pensive they seem to be in a pensive attitude sure because they still can't protest or say i'm
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:10.840]  glad he's dead they'll wind up we saw people mildly protest when obama was there drug away and
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:18.920]  put police cars and let's expand on that you look you look at what communists have done all over
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:25.800]  the world and i'm ashamed of our teams in vietnam that did execute village leaders and people
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:30.760]  they were losing to the communists who would kill whole villages that's what apocalypse now is all
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:35.320]  about it's based on some composite real stories where some of our own colonels said okay we'll
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:40.360]  do communist tactics and started winning where you kill whole villages if they didn't go along with you
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:45.480]  but then they blame us our history only tells us what we did trying to beat them adopting communist
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:50.120]  tactics when the point is it's the communists that wrote those damn tactics and as you said
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:56.120]  latin america desquads killing everybody men women and children but it's all cute and funny when they
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:03.800]  do it well i i i know something about phoenix program because of i was in uh i was in the
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:09.960]  teams as a young man and and the people that were my instructors were there they were part of it i
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:17.720]  knew pru instructors provincial reconnaissance unit or uh folks that went out with phoenix program
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:23.000]  seals sheep dipped wearing you know uh native uniforms they weren't just going into villages
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  and shooting people i gotta argue with you there no i understand they were killing they were killing
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.920]  the leaders of it sources they knew who the vc guys a vc guy could be a member of the saigon
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:37.560]  government you know let's go back then tell us the truth of that all i know is the congressional
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.600]  hearings where they said a lot of large portions of villages the males got killed opposite military
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.960]  my point is the communists killed everybody but all our media tells us about is what we did so so
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:54.360]  tell us well i i don't know anything about other than you know uh obviously there were
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:54:00.760]  massacres like my life but we you know we eventually the word got out and there were some other but
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:07.960]  it's more of a case like uh the the the immigrant in new york named amon diallo we got shot like
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.520]  30 times by the police well they've got three undercover detectives want to you know anti-rape
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:18.680]  squad point and glocks at you somebody sneezes a car backfires everybody's gonna shoot that didn't
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:25.240]  mean they went out that night to put 30 bullets into an innocent man um and there were massacres
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:31.240]  that were basically you know uh somebody fires or somebody's no no i i get the fog of war i was
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.920]  only bringing the story out to say communist wrote sure communist wrote the book though correct
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:43.400]  on massing all villages and including in columbia and in peru where they did it for you know uh for
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:49.240]  decades and that was straight out of cuba and don't anybody forget also because and this is
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:54.680]  declassified after the fall of the soviet union fiddle castra was so crazy and such an egomaniac
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:01.160]  monster that during the the cuban missile crisis he was urged in khrushchev to launch a first strike
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:06.600]  even if it meant cuba being wiped off the face of the earth as long as america was
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.560]  what let's expand hugue absolutely then look at the nightmare of higo shaves but go to shea guavara
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:18.440]  who wrote books calling native americans indians subhuman trash i mean people don't know that they
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:25.160]  imprisoned gays and and anti-war liberals and everybody else china has homosexualities outlawed
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:30.200]  china they'll kill you for it and the left worships that's what i mean islam says they'll kill them
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.560]  but the left worships it what is happening well the the useful idiots are trained in college they
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:41.960]  just they they get the howard zinn version of history unfortunately but you know the last election
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:47.320]  it gives us cause for a lot of hope because despite pulling out all the stops and turning
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:53.400]  american media into just pure lying propaganda the american people enough american people saw
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.840]  sure hell we sold five states it still failed but they've only intensified the race baiting now
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:06.040]  so where does that go well the the next from now until what three weeks until uh december 19th
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:12.360]  is going to be very pivotal in history any act like a some a somali that stabs eight people the
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:18.120]  importance of it will be vastly magnified it will have a leverage you know multiplier effect
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:24.360]  um but yeah no it's obviously islamic they yeah they wish that it was somebody named you know
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:30.920]  named uh cletus johnson but it wasn't um go figure but what they would like to do is you know you
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:36.840]  you saw up in amherst they burned the flag and the veterans showed up they're trying to instigate
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:43.880]  something where and my fear is uh if a highway is blocked uh somebody's just going to get out and
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:49.880]  dump a mag into the protesters or so the answer is don't be violent over them don't be violent let
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:56.200]  them push and push uh the key is getting the getting the electoral college done the 20th
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:03.240]  and then just moving forward from there that's right and don't but they're they would they need
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:09.240]  somebody with a white face and a southern background to do something evil you know that
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:15.720]  dylan roof uh they said he's not mentally competent but um i have i have i wonder about that personally
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:20.600]  but what they're hoping for is another dylan roof type of an event all right listen i got a
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:25.000]  bunch of callers if you want to eject you're welcome to if you want to take these callers from
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.280]  mark chris howard andrew and jim for about 20 minutes the next hour you can uh again we've been

[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.040]  primus have to come out and meant okay it's serious they want to overturn the election
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:00.680]  i knew this two weeks ago they were already harassing and threatening electors in the news
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:08.120]  but i i i got calls and confirm with electors in michigan and ohio and pennsylvania that they are
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:13.480]  being their kids are being threatened i mean cars pulling up in their yards stuff being done i mean

[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.040]  i'm just sitting back thinking what do we do to push back you know i don't want violence i agree with
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:29.560]  bracken we need to like stop absolutely tap down on that but man then i had to think about if we
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.320]  actually do get into power george washington you know would have arrested every one of these people
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:41.080]  because these aren't americans folks these are globalist enemy combatants they i mean i'm telling

[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:42.600]  mika many cuban americans here for sci-cafe the political epicenter of this community in miami
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:47.640]  telling me this morning they cannot believe some of the world reaction from figures like
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.760]  justin trudeau and jill stein about fiddle cast or some of the reactions you were talking about
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:58.680]  just earlier in the show but they tell me they are especially hurt and ashamed won't even use the
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:04.280]  word humiliated by president obama's statement regarding fidel castro the president calling
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:11.080]  castro a singular figure who had enormous impact but didn't really using the word uh
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:18.520]  dictator now on the other hand many hear the bay of page veterans the women in white uh they are
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:24.600]  you know praising and thanking donald trump for his statement the president elect calling castro
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:30.760]  a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people and remember guys more than half of cuban americans
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:36.360]  supporting donald trump in the election and they are now looking to him to see what will happen
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:45.800]  with us cuba policy wow so i'm really ashamed people like jessie ventura coming out saying how
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:50.120]  great fiddle castro was i don't i don't want to i'm not jessie for like 10 years been friends with
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:55.320]  him but just give me a break i can't put up with three more where where everybody just sits here
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:00.040]  and this guy's killed hundreds of thousands he's exported war to africa exported war to latin america
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:06.040]  funded desquads with shaguel vara and then i've got to sit there and romanticize him and kiss his
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:12.280]  ass if trump did any of this we'd all be against him i would do but that everything trump does is
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:19.640]  fascist and evil it's just so one-sided and then i see this cappernick who makes a hundred million
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:25.160]  plus dollars maybe like 180 million dollars total in this career in the nfl bitching about america
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:28.680]  people go hey don't censor him it's not censoring about criticizing we're gonna come back in the
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:35.000]  next long segment and break all this down but there's just something oxymoronic about a guy worth
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.720]  hundreds of millions of dollars bitching about america talking about how great fiddle castro is
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:46.360]  who's never studied how fiddle castro took thousands of farmers families and just killed them so they
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:52.280]  could take their land a lot of poor farmers matt brack and we were getting into this it's a
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.680]  short segment but but you know looking at this this worship of fiddle i agree with you it's a real
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:03.560]  watermark it's a real gauge to see where people stand not only to see what world leaders go to
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:09.960]  as funeral it's very interesting to me that and it shows that rowell is probably afraid right now
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.720]  they're not having the funeral in hewana and i don't think that they're even having any mass
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.960]  mourning like you know lying in state anything like that and that tells me that they're afraid
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:26.040]  because a funeral can get out of control a funeral if you allow a funeral you can't tell if a hundred
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:30.520]  thousand might come now they used to bust in hundreds of thousands but for a funeral like this
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:36.120]  they must fear what if three or four or five million cubans show up and then the crowd just
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:41.400]  turns and says let's go get rowell at that point well with the police fire on them like you know
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:47.800]  in in uh romania uh at the end of the at the end of the um the fall after the fall of the
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:52.680]  berlin wall chalcescu and his wife said we're not leaving we're not going anywhere they brought in
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:58.520]  goons like uh union miners things like that they bust in goons with uh pickaxes to try to beat down
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:03.240]  the the dissidents and protesters but it didn't work and even putting machine guns on the roof of
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.240]  the palace didn't work that's right giving them the opportunity to fight was their end they they
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.600]  miscalculated and and they dragged chalcescu out and shot him and his wife that they call that
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:19.480]  romanian term limits and i think that's why yeah i think that's why they're having this um the uh
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:26.040]  fidel funeral in a remote location that millions of people won't be able to get to unless they're
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:31.800]  busting you know he's hated in his own country but every little fake civil intellectual tells us
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:38.040]  how great he is when the guy was a dirtbag it's very telling that he's not having he's not laying
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.640]  in state or laying you know laying in uh in to be viewed in havana they're taking him to some place
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:49.400]  that's remote so that they can control the roads and only bust in supporters that tells me they're
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:54.840]  afraid of a mass revolution a funeral can be a a big turning point you know the funerals are very
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:59.720]  dangerous you see that in israel when you know palestinian terrorists are killed they'll try to
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:03.000]  stand there we're gonna come back with calls good points we have an article up on our website
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.720]  at info wars dot com that talks about how one italian minister is going to throw his citizens
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:12.040]  in jail if they don't open up their homes to migrants now this article was written by chris
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:17.480]  manahan of information liberation and it addresses how one italian minister of interior angelina

[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:27.480]  this report coming out of an italian paper coming just two weeks after a shocking video goes viral

[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:37.720]  in his hotel now we learned this news today that the plan is slated to go through in hyperdrive come
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:43.000]  december the government is keeping it secret so that no one will sway the upcoming referendum
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.400]  which could lead to ousting their current pro migrant invasion prime minister well this news
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.640]  comes amid the holidays and we understand that there is an invasion going on in europe right now
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:56.200]  and it looks like the italian government is saying look you house these migrants are you're

[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:17.800]  every time i've been around a communist person
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:21.720]  at dinner they go ahead and say we want to kill people we want blood
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.920]  we better join us we're gonna murder everybody they're demons i don't know how to explain it
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:29.800]  i don't even know how all this works i saw they're evil
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:39.080]  if we just bet on america what made this country great and realize that the global
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.480]  eastern competition with the american system we're one of the stars i want to go to mark
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:51.240]  chris howard andrew jim and others i am such a liberal in the thomas jefferson vein
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:10:00.120]  that i can't stand islam i certainly can't stand orthodox islam but i went to high school and
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:05.720]  college with some nice and young muslim folks and i was against these wars so it was the wrong
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:11.480]  country's being targeted but i got to tell you watching the establishment the globalist ally
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:16.920]  themselves with the worst forms of islam and then just every day i have to look at it where
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:22.600]  they've got tv ads in germany saying submit to islam paid for by the u.m they've got maraca
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.040]  ads say when you bust your wife's nose open or black eye here's how you put makeup on to cover up
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:32.760]  i mean the whole culture is about infiltrating and taking over
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:38.760]  them and i've got stacks of articles here where they're just killing homosexuals they're doing
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:43.320]  all this other crap all i want is homosexuals not to recruit my kids or anybody else okay if we
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.160]  had a homosexual homosexual keep your damn hands off my kids unless you've got a death wish
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:51.720]  and then i've got it we play this a few weeks ago but now that's a new it's on the news in
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:58.040]  italy italy's minister of interior surrender your homes to migrants who face jail they don't even pay
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:03.240]  you to house them there's the famous footage from two weeks ago at luigi 80 years old tiny little
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:07.320]  end with like 10 rooms he's got a little restaurant they just say everything's free here they are
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:13.720]  and they bring in the muslims and these big old six foot four cops just shove the old man aside
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:22.760]  hell you can't go to north africa tunisia or libya or do this it's it's like a death wish of the good
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:29.080]  will and like all these special ops looking italian goons shoving old men around and taking
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:33.000]  their place over i mean i get i'm not somebody on the earth that calls for violence but i mean
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.080]  you're really hitting my buttons at this point and i agree with bracken we don't need to go that way
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:43.640]  but i mean they are just testing and pushing and moving the overton window to see what they can do
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:50.440]  and then i see this it's all over ms nbc it's all over bbc half the time i tune into bbc because
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:54.440]  i've got two different bbc channels on my cable it's one that in hajib's
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:02.280]  i mean this is the most oppressive system you can imagine canada celebrates hajib wearing
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:06.520]  news anchor while christian crosses her band on the same network they've even got the reporter
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:12.120]  who was kicked off because she wanted to wear a cross of course in most countries you don't wear
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:20.040]  a jib you wear a barca and how they got all the liberals selling this it just i just i just don't
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.320]  get it anymore and then i've got all these other articles here indonesian woman flogged for close
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:33.960]  proximity with a man yahoo news ap i've got like you know a couple men were meeting for hamburgers
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:38.920]  in indonesia so they thought they were gay and came in arresting them after the beating rock and tv
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:46.600]  airs make-up tips for hiding domestic violence it's like and then before i even really went on this
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:53.480]  this crusade against orthodox islam a few years ago they put out major movies cross what's that big
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:13:01.800]  director to median's name and mr show and all that they've crossed they've got two hour films
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:07.640]  that were in theaters locally i went in and saw the theater where the guy goes i hate black people
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:15.000]  and jews and muslims on alex jones i'm gonna kill people you're sitting there with a slurpee in your
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.840]  hand watching this it's like what the hell is going on with hollywood that wants access to our kids
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:25.800]  and wants to tell us what to do and then they're in a love fest with saudi arabia who's buying up
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:30.280]  hollywood along with the communist chinese and then two weeks ago the communist chinese were all over
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:35.720]  the news ap wall street journal saying you better shut down the alt right or we're gonna pull our
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:42.600]  money out of your treasuries so i've now reached a point at 42 years old about 43 that movie was called
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:50.440]  hits where i'm living in another world where the communist chinese that killed more people than
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:57.480]  anybody in history are telling the news shut me down and are telling trump get rid of steven manon
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.800]  now it's not a heady situation it's more of an awakening i guess that shows actually how weak
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:08.760]  they are the problem is they got nuclear weapons what will they pull to stop it so commenting on
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:12.520]  that bracken we're gonna take some calls and we want to tell us rest of the hour you're welcome
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.600]  and and again what else do you see them doing because they're so arrogant they're so mentally ill
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:24.200]  they don't realize that they're hitler in the bunker 1945 i still think because i've noticed
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:28.520]  delusional people that never really earned what they had as they get more power they get on a
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:33.320]  bigger power trip as i get more power i get more concerned and more more humble and more worried
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:37.960]  about what i do i'm really worried though about the paradigm i think they're crazy enough to try
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.760]  anything and i think in the next as you said three weeks till the electoral college but even into
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:47.240]  the election in in 53 days i think we're in the most dangerous time in human history what do you
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:53.160]  think very very dangerous but they're they're lashing out and panicking about the new media
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:15:01.000]  you know i uh shows me that they're very afraid it's like fiddle not fiddles uh funeral not being
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.520]  in hirvana that's a huge sign of weakness and fear they tried to ignore the new media and they
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:12.920]  tried to ridicule it now it's the russian trick it's all a russian conspiracy you know nobody's
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:18.680]  buying it that's why trump won they've played their card they've gone you know uh completely to the
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:24.120]  end of the rope of calling everybody a racist now they're trying to conflate breitbart and
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:31.160]  steve bannon with this nut job uh uh richard spencer uh to make them make you know ordinary
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.400]  people think that you know it's like a new coming of hitler but it's not working it's it's their
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:40.920]  panic it's the end of their road and now that they're they're they're trying to uh infer that
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:45.560]  we're all something now we never heard of last year now we're all white if you happen to be
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:51.560]  Caucasian i mean if your parents parents came from europe i had nothing to do with you know the
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:56.760]  color of my skin or the color of my eyes i just was born this way but now apparently i'm a white
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:03.320]  nationalist they're trying to make patriots who are americans and who happen by just the grace of
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:09.800]  you know the luck of the odds the luck of the draw to be Caucasian now we're somehow scary white
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:15.960]  nationalists so i agree with you let's just be honest i stage thinking or whatever it is every
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:21.160]  group has its talented skill on average everybody's the first but it's like you know kenyans are all
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:26.920]  the top long-distance runners what is it about europe that had its own problems that developed
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:32.040]  so much science so much renaissance and ended slavery and tried to empower women i think the
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:38.040]  despots are in competition with the true liberalism of the white male i mean not that we're perfect
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:42.520]  but i think they're really scared of the fact that we want to on average empower people so they
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:49.160]  try to focus in on dumbasses well they've they've they've done a very good job of sabotaging you
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:54.680]  know europeans from within i mean you can the evidence is the birth rate the you know collapsing
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.200]  demographic birth rate where people are so demoralized or into hedonism that they don't
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:05.880]  even want to have children so that you know italy is that like 1.0 with uh children per white
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:10.840]  italy is the worst you're right so they're so you know they're going to either what a great culture
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:16.040]  dying i mean i'm not japanese but they're second to italy is the worst i'm so sad the japanese
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:21.880]  are fading into history but yet the japanese are at least saying we're going to do it as japanese
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:25.880]  if we can't figure out how robots will take care of our old people then you know but we'll
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:29.960]  we're not just going to bring in millions of muslims that's for don't you have to hand the
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:35.560]  japanese i mean when things get worse they have a lower crime rate i i mean japanese yeah after
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.640]  fucus after fucus shima i mean it's legendary that you can leave a bicycle on the street or
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:46.040]  you're wild on a subway after fucus shima the equivalent of their uh wall greens and walmards
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:51.320]  had to put signs on the doors saying please take everything you need because even starving japanese
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:57.720]  wouldn't go into a broken drug store and get out bottled water i mean either it tells you
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:02.440]  something about their culture now obviously world war two they were fanatical in some very bad ways
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:07.320]  but goodness they do take care of their people and uh and they're not just going to be they don't
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:13.160]  have politicians that will just volunteer to have them genocided by you know islamist maniacs coming
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:19.160]  in that's right yeah and japan will not let one islamic in yeah and you know as far as going back
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:24.360]  i want to get this out if we're going to now be called white nationalists so steve bannon they're
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:29.880]  going to keep showing steve bannon and and you and uh and you know next to the worst of the worst
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:34.520]  of these you know marginal friends nobody ever heard of them until the mainstream media i never
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:41.320]  heard of this guy they're saying i'm best buddies with so i so i say i say that the the the mainstream
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:48.920]  media talking heads all of them the democrats i have a new term for them ps progressive international
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:55.320]  socialists if they can not only call us nationalists which i'll wear that proudly i'm a national populist
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:00.440]  i'm a patriot a patriotic american if they're going to turn that into somehow i'm a racist because my
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.080]  skin's white that means i must be a white nationalist i say take the gloves off you said
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.400]  what can we do well we don't want to get in their face and turn it into a shooting war at least not
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:17.720]  before uh december 19th or january but i say let's not play their game of using their terminology
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:24.120]  i call brian williams rachel madel all of them they're international socialists if they hate me
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:31.000]  for being a patriotic american nationalist then i say screw you pal you're an international socialist
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:39.800]  which is just the overt of polite form of saying you're a communist if you go to fidel's funeral
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:44.200]  you're a communist you know what he did and you're going to go and honor him you're a communist well
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:48.920]  here's the deal i mean they're demonizing they're demonizing sure we're gonna see if it's right
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:56.120]  they're demonizing trump for doing nothing and then fidel castro is a mass murder i mean if i
[02:19:56.120 --> 02:20:01.640]  killed one person in cold blood i would expect my family would disown me the guy killed hundreds of
[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:11.800]  thousands robbed i mean you folks i've studied history cuba was like more wealthy than florida
[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:19.640]  or texas it had the biggest middle class except for argentina or venezuela there were three rich
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:27.240]  hubs in the caribbean and in central and south america it was argentina cuba and venezuela
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:34.280]  and all those places are socialist hellholes now with just total collapse because they the
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.800]  elites wanted to get rid of the middle class and cuba had a big fat juicy middle class
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:45.560]  they were successful they were but but they got a lot of poor people piss going hey look somebody's
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:50.920]  got a nice car somebody you would have got a car the next year dummy you know oh look these rich
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:55.480]  casino owners are making money these hotel owners these foreign you know yankee pigs are here
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:01.720]  investing yeah of course it's a freaking nice country and now what do you have 60 years later
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:08.200]  a hellhole and it's it's so sad but don't worry we're under the same attack and i just feel so
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:13.000]  sorry because it was a saying 60 years ago as rich as an argentina as rich as a venezuelan
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:20.360]  or they even say in the 50s you know that those rich cubans because the average american was in
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:25.000]  a two bedroom house with one bathroom if they were lucky if they were middle class and the
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:31.640]  cubans had better than that it's all gone and our liberal media were helped in that helped to install
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:38.280]  these dictators you know whether it was on new york times uh duranti being they all the new york
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:43.800]  times the washington post talked about fidel like he was a rock star like they did about stalling
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:49.640]  during the uh the ukraine hollard more genocide the starvation genocide they were knowing what they
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:54.760]  knew about what was going on and they were saying oh i've seen them see a matai ebe doesn't doesn't
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:22:00.920]  know about that genocide or doesn't know about their median genocide he just foppishly walks
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:06.760]  real slow and goes uh liberal oh i had a coffee oh liberal how do you counter the fake pseudo
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.400]  intellectualism because i mean i study all the time i can tell talking to you you've done major
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:19.000]  study so we're on the same field here i talked to a like a fake or a fopp and i talked to a liberal
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:25.240]  they don't know anything they just even their top people just go oh yeah right sure racist and i'm
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:30.200]  like we have a we have a great opening there's a great opportunity here and i and i think that
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:34.920]  you know we've already maybe passed the high watermark for liberalism and now it's the tides
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:40.440]  going our way running our way because these people that these kids that have only learned history
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:46.920]  from howard zinn textbooks you know evil america invented slavery that that false history they're
[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:52.520]  they are ripe to have their eyes opened they don't know about jay guvara except that he's got a cool
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:58.280]  t-shirt so they're you know he wrote two books i personally even ordered one of the ones in spanish
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:05.960]  where he calls black people animals and where he says mexicans are dumb cockroaches lazy and yeah
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:11.000]  yeah lazy cockroaches so you've read that yeah there's so there's a there's a big opportunity
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:16.360]  but see how weird it is i can verse with you and you know what shagovar really said i tell some
[02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:21.960]  weird little commie kid wearing it they don't just laugh at me i mean you know well you won't be able
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:28.600]  to get them all but i i think that a one good approach um denis prager you know another great
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:33.000]  talk host he's got something called prager university it's excellent i want to get denis prager on
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.520]  by the way they're five minutes they're just like five minute episodes so there are five
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:42.120]  minute teachable lessons that make the best points possible it was simple graphics so there
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:47.080]  there are millions of people out there right now that are wondering like what is this argument
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:52.440]  about philol castro i know they got funky old cars in havana why is that but they've never
[02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:57.160]  heard that he had they had walls where people were just taken out and shot night after night
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:24:03.240]  they'd never heard that so there is an opportunity to to undo the learning that there's a good thing
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:09.400]  about these uh snowflakes is that they're empty vessels you know the first message whispered
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:15.160]  into their ear was the false howard no i agree i agree and you know they can be reeducated very
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:21.480]  quickly to that with the truth very quickly yeah they're just so entitled and so whacked out i want
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:25.960]  to go to some phone calls now we're talking to matt bracken of enemies far and domestic dot com
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:32.760]  all shows with info wars dot com uh we're sitting here talking we've got 53 days till the inauguration
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:37.960]  in january 20th uh we've got the democrats and hillary trying to overthrow the election even
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:42.600]  though she pledged she believed trump won that's because she'd stolen five states and still failed
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:48.680]  but notice jillstein is not auditing those states that she she won uh this is just this is outrageous
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:55.960]  and it shows they're setting the precedent for riots all they're waiting for is mr bracken said
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:01.640]  is for somebody to shoot a crowd of black lives matter people and i think cities burn all over the
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:09.800]  country that's what they're hoping for so let's quantify this i'll take a call for you to bring
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:16.200]  the comeback and take calls if you're sitting there is soros right now i mean i'm 42 and i'm i'm
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:23.400]  smarter business wise knowledge wise but i mean i'm tired i can't imagine being 87 or 89 like
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:28.680]  soros and i catch these at meetings all the world he's involved in everything where does this energy
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:34.520]  come from and i mean what is going on with this guy it's like what the hell's happening here i think
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:40.520]  that he wants to be considered one of the key figures in all of history um in a history book
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:46.360]  that shows you know hitler lenin stallin whether you think they're evil or whether you think they
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:50.840]  you know made the auto bonds or you know uh whatever they did that was you know they built
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:57.640]  canals where millions were killed to build the white sea canal uh it doesn't matter if you're
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.200]  in the history book that's what drives some people so it's a selfishness it's pissing on the world
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:07.800]  just like a mass murderer at a very small you know granular level somebody that you know
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:14.520]  takes a rifle and goes up on a building he's trying to beat the last death count so that
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:20.360]  people will remember his name even if he's dead so it's a true narcissistic psychopathic mental
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:27.080]  illness but at the very top level i think that what drives george soros is that i mean he knows
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:32.200]  he's going to die and i think that he believes he's just worm food after that the thought that
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:38.840]  comforts him is that every history of the 20th and 21st century he is going to be a key figure
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:43.960]  when they show the pictures of the presidents and of dictators they will also show and have a
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:49.320]  chapter on george soros and that i think is what motivates him it's not making more money
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:55.400]  it's not staying alive i agree and it's twisted true human power is about telegraphing knowledge
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:27:01.640]  forward to help others not of arrogance but of love and a wish to be with those before you currently
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:07.640]  and after you that's true human spirit he wants to take that and twist it when you watch the when
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:13.000]  you watch the uh video where he was very candid about his youth and he laughed about he said i'm
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.520]  proud of helping the nazis and didn't feel any so there was something you know happened uh
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:23.560]  something scarred him in his youth that took out empathy and replaced it with something cold and
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:30.360]  calculating he said he said i won by helping the nazis and i'm gonna go on winning right so i he
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:37.400]  would have won by killing 10 of them and not being a piece of filth if he hadn't been damaged
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:45.400]  psychologically in some way you know that uh i forget which of the uh the anthony hopkins
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:51.160]  movie uh hanibal you know there's the early sounds where he's where he's a child where he's a child
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:57.880]  and he's watching the horrors i think that some people come out of trauma at the correct age you
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.680]  know if you if if you're pushed into a lake as a three-year-old believe me you're never gonna
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.800]  want to go swimming for the rest of your life if a if a big spider bites you uh when you're an
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:13.000]  infant you're gonna have spider phobia so i think it's very possible that whatever happened to
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:20.040]  george soros in eastern europe set him on the path that he's been on his entire life and and part of
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:25.800]  it is you know it's just evil satanic diabolical but it might just be explained in psychological
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:29.720]  terms that's right we're going to bring in one minute coming back with call after call mark
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:34.040]  chris howard andrew jember one right you have a break what do you make of the wakey leaks and all
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:40.280]  the clear pedophile code words i mean i'm looking at this it's clearly pet pedophile code words
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:46.680]  i mean what the hell's going on there i thought that what had happened in belgium and uh that area
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:53.800]  uh like 20 25 years ago i thought that was an aberration but apparently when you get into the
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:29:01.720]  upper levels of the of the of evil you know the evil power it seems to go towards um to go towards
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:08.200]  this uh ritualistic pedophilia rings it's just pretty disgusting but when you look at some of
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:14.040]  these characters that are around hillary you have to wonder what uh you know what kind of evil is
[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:23.240]  there i mean uh huma abadine from age 19 a 19 year old intern has become her uh body companion you

[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:36.520]  news being attacked it's because we're effective and the enemy knows we're having a big effect so

[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:55.400]  i used to think when i was in high school that friends of mine that didn't go to two of days
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:01.240]  and so they had allergies were hypochondriacs i thought it was fake um my allergies have gotten
[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:06.440]  a lot better as i've lost some weight and stuff but right now half the office is sick or more and

[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:36.360]  bucks it's like menthol and a couple other things this is dozens of essential oils the only problem
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:41.560]  is it's so thick you gotta every every other time you use it wash out the sprayer tip because it's so
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:48.120]  thick uh it will um not spray through it thank you so this is a new package of it i need to take
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:54.760]  this home because i've had a package for about six months i haven't really gone through yet but it's
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:36:00.200]  almost it's almost empty this is the ultimate lung cleanse uh thing out there about today we are
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:05.800]  under such assault all the gmo the life of states all the rest of it and i how would it be all
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:15.160]  the early days i apologize but i'll see how that does let me tell you it is fun now getting back
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:19.960]  to matt bracken of enemies foreign and domestic dot com want to go to your phone calls right now
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:25.560]  and and take your questions and comments but i feel guilty that i'm not able to get excited enough
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:31.720]  and upset enough matt about hillary wanting a recount the black lives matter running around
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.520]  groups calling for cops being killed they're shooting them almost every day dead and the
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:42.040]  media even seen it's like well they're cops they deserve to die it's their job the random
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:47.960]  killing of people is such an authoritarian thing well i think they're just pulling out all the
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:56.520]  stops i'm i'm very uh i'm i'd like to say something about cops um you know in my youth i was a navy
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:03.640]  seal i'm not career but i'm you know when i was uh you know junior officer i couldn't be a cop for
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:08.920]  two weeks i guarantee you i mean i'd i'd absolutely lose my mind i'd go into some house and see
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:16.360]  child abuse going on and and i would flip out so how you can be a a social worker and carry a gun
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:21.160]  at the same time is something that i couldn't juggle i totally agree just watching it and
[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:27.480]  covering it drives me crazy i couldn't do it so that how how you can expect to uh make a
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:32.440]  you know nanosecond decision life or death and they're going to dissect that nanosecond into
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:39.400]  a billion micro nanoseconds and hang you on it when day in and day out you know you're seeing
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:45.480]  motor vehicle accidents and you know you're seeing uh domestic abuse situations and elder abuse and
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:52.360]  child abuse and to be be able to keep a serenity inside and not not go home and and be a psycho
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.720]  in your own house to your own children so i give all honor and respect to law enforcement that can
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:02.360]  juggle all of that and balance all of that because i know within my own heart and my own soul i wouldn't
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:08.040]  last two two weeks as a cop at any level i couldn't do it matt that's well i couldn't i couldn't
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:13.560]  carry that job i couldn't do it so god bless the police without them you know there was a famous
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:19.000]  incident in montreal canada about 30 years ago third maybe it was in the 70s where the police
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:25.560]  went on strike and immediately the every jewelry store was hit you know as soon as the the criminals
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:31.400]  figured out this was for real the police have gone on strike it was complete mayhem immediate so
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:37.240]  there are you know thousands even millions of predators out there without any morals or scruples
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:43.240]  or conscience that if they knew that the police were out of the way they would absolutely wreak
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:49.800]  havoc on society and that i think is part of the whole deal with uh with the this cabal between
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:57.880]  soros the propaganda media and the democrat party is to is to uh break the morale of the police just
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:03.320]  get them to either stay in their patrol cars you know hide behind dunk and donuts don't get out there
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:09.080]  and mix it up don't do your job just basically demoralize law enforcement and i think that i
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:15.880]  agree but hasn't it backfired hasn't it backfired i hope so but it remains to be seen
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:22.120]  it certainly isn't going to help minority neighborhoods if the police won't go in there
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:28.840]  because then you're just handing over control to the gangs completely so i mean yeah obviously there
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:33.960]  are bad cops and obviously some cops go on a power trip and maybe some people come into law
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:40.920]  enforcement because they've got like a latent power power you know uh urged to be a bully sort of
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:47.320]  thing but i don't think by far most cops i think i believe sure by far though they want to be the
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.520]  sheep cops aren't where i agree cops aren't where the revolution happens and the fact that soros
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:57.160]  the mainstream media want to make that the main focal point we can deal with cops have problems
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:01.960]  the issue is is that this is an attempt to destabilize the whole country mark in california
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:09.560]  on the air with mr bracken go ahead yeah thanks for having matt on kowm why 1540 i really appreciate
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:18.760]  that you know um matt and alex um when we think about king syris he's much more than a king because
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:25.720]  this is he of whom it is written behold he is my shepherd and he'll perform all my pleasure even
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:31.640]  saying to jerusalem now she'll be built into the temple by foundation should be laid and when
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:37.560]  trump came out and just was honest about castro i can't tell you what that did for me you know all
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:44.120]  these lying commies you know you know talking about how great the man was he's a despicable
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:50.120]  communist and he's gonna go to hell after on judgment day and uh when we think about trump has
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:54.920]  appointed these guys i mean think about it we've gone from eric holder who says we have to quote
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:41:01.160]  brainwash him to hate guns and uh what's her name loretta lynch for attorney general
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:07.000]  that after you know uh san bernadino happened uh she says we'll prosecute you to the full extent
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:12.280]  of the law if you speak against mohammed to jeff's sessions and we need to pray for jeff
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:18.040]  and pray that god will fight without stretched arm you know against uh uh checky schumer and such
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:24.280]  and uh you know because this is really exciting this is exciting this is god it's not agree and the
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:29.400]  enemy is crapping themselves and is planning something in the next 53 days thank you mark
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:36.520]  i'm it's a civil war this is a civil war we are in a civil war make no mistake it's not at the
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:42.200]  shooting in streets uh phase of a civil war but believe me like he put his finger right on it
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:50.360]  holder and lynch and then jeff sessions uh this j johnson and then and then general flinn
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:58.760]  this is tectonic this is this is you know opposites opposites it's it is opposites and
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:04.040]  they're not going to just quit let me ask you this because obviously none of us could war game this
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:08.840]  and know how it's going to go but hypothetically we're not calling for this if they suspend things
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:14.120]  say trump lost let's say they kill trump say oh he's died in helicopter crash killer he's coming
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:19.160]  in or whoever and announced that we're shutting down you know the fake press that's us they're
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:24.760]  gonna arrest us we're not looking for trouble but when folks try to pull up and take us off to the
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:30.040]  reeducation center i guess all bets are off i just want to make sure because it won't do anything
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:34.680]  the the foolish cops or anybody else the young military officers how do we get around them the
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:39.240]  real tire there aren't enough there aren't there aren't enough especially uh the fleas the federal
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:45.160]  law enforcement agents they're just aren't enough the math doesn't work you know all of the all of
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:53.640]  the power of the state could barely get to to louisiana after katrina and no i agree so why are
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:58.840]  they so arrogant because they've taken our restraints weakness when there are like millions of
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:03.960]  veterans many of which i know that aren't looking for trouble they're not scared to die they are
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:11.000]  ready to just dominate and i don't think not only that i would i would ref i would recommend people
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:17.640]  read um some of my essays like the uh civil war two cube um which is uh sort of like a rubik's cube
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:24.200]  showing the uh demographic cultural and geographical axes that that the civil war will be fought on
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:28.680]  or my other essay on when the music stops how america cities may explode in violence
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:35.400]  if you look at the red blue county map most of the food grows in the red counties most of the
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:40.120]  energy comes out of the ground in the red i was about to say we have 90 geographically
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:45.800]  in military nomenclature isn't that total dominance well and and they say well we have more people we
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:51.240]  won the popular vote a lot of people is not an advantage if you can't feed them a lot of people
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:55.400]  is it is a tremendous no it's true the communists and the globalists want to play this capitulation
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:44:00.520]  game i'm not looking for this but if they want to take the gloves off don't they in a bare knuckles
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:06.440]  fight we kick their ass well in the if you look at the russian revolution when the russians came home
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:12.040]  from world war one they were carrying um most in the gantt rifles and swords and and uh pistols
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:17.240]  revolvers um but they were disarmed very quickly by the communists they ordered it and the people
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:21.720]  turned them in that's right that's not going to happen this time but then they could go out in
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:26.680]  the countryside and they could literally steal the food from farmers leave nothing in the ukraine
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:31.480]  leave leave take the grain from the ukraine and leave the ukranians to starve that would
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:36.920]  absolutely not work in united states of america the other the other big factor is our agriculture
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:44.520]  now is big mass uh industrial agriculture it's not a family farm so if the if the uh transportation
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:49.960]  infrastructure breaks down and there's no oil and fertilizer going out to the farms then there's no
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:55.160]  food going anywhere and the power will be in the small self-sufficient family farms that's right so
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:59.480]  it'll be it will be a starvation so i'm gonna look over trouble but if they want to push this
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:05.720]  if they want to push this into a hot war that they're entering our briar patch and that then
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:11.000]  the last occasions that we could use as references of the french revolution and the russian revolution
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:17.720]  they were able to harness and militarize the urban population go out into the countryside with
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:25.000]  guillotines and execution squads in russia and take the food by force they would never be able
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:31.720]  to take the food by force in this country it would be a suicide mission for a every girl boy
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:36.360]  i don't care what color they are in looking for trouble they are locked and loaded and ready to kill
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:42.440]  and forget and forget about the the ar-15 uh uh so-called assault rifles yeah that's
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:47.960]  interesting they're fun to play on spears 50 cows everywhere it's it's no it's just the basic
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:55.160]  remington 730 odd six with a cheap bushnell scope on top that's a 500 yard right everybody's got
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:00.200]  millions of them there's millions of can you imagine if they try to march a communist army
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:05.400]  of potbelly dumbasses in against that's what'll happen well at the at the first bridge it would
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:11.240]  just be a choke point and after that it would be uh impassable because if somebody laying in a
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.280]  in a culvert 500 yards from the bridge will be able to stop anybody there just aren't enough
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:24.040]  drones and helicopters to play uh you know uh some kind of video game war where they go out and
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:29.080]  i agree i heard from the leftist their favorite statement is we got drones will kill you look
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:33.240]  we're not looking for a war dumbasses but if you physically want to start one are you I mean
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:37.320]  you really have no idea what you're dealing with and who do they think the drone operators are
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:43.080]  they're military and they're you know 90 on our side they come from the red counties so they
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:47.560]  you would believe me it would be a starvation event for the entire country but the cities
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:52.680]  would absolutely implode into cannibalism we've killed 55 million babies maybe we deserve that
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:58.440]  let's take a call from chris and virginia you're on the air go like chris yeah it seems like to me
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:05.640]  that you are pretty bright person and and thorough with your research so i was wondering if you picked
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:11.800]  the long term ago the battle that she was going to fight to go after the globalists and and go that
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:18.280]  route and expose them as opposed to going after them satanists which i believe is the real issue
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:24.360]  the same people believe the same people listen we tried to we took over the republican party with
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:30.040]  trump i mean we men to we mean to win everybody doesn't realize the power of the individual
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:33.640]  i'm not here on some power trip but i mean you know i talked to president i talked to everybody
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:37.720]  else generals you name it they all the people they care they're waiting for leadership too
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:41.480]  the fact that we amass this huge audience has given them the power and i don't say that to brag
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:46.680]  but they let me tell you something info wars you the listeners you are what gives them the power
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:52.920]  to do this is happening now my friend again and it's not a question of us choosing the time
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:59.000]  eventually i mean we're sort of like racing towards the edge of a of a plateau where there's a
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.760]  cliff like in indiana jones or uh the fight exactly we don't want this event horizon we've
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:09.720]  been pushed it's coming anyway it's like what trotsky said you may not be interested in war
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:15.000]  but war is interested in you and like it or not eventually you know the the global financial
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:20.680]  structure which is a house house of cards soaked in gasoline eventually that's going to implode
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.960]  the atms are not going to work the ebt system is not going to work get you know the credit cards
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:30.520]  aren't going to work and and a week after that our cities will be not will not be whether you're
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:36.360]  rich or poor that affects you the same way exactly and i take it i take it matt bracken in the last
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:40.440]  five years we reported it for anybody else did but it's now admitted the elite going to armor
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.240]  redoubts all over the world hiring huge security teams who are my listeners who are ready to turn
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.560]  on them in an instant that seems to be their achilles heel they're already evacuating that shows
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:55.720]  they've already lost right a plan to ride a tiger is not the same as riding a tiger so you know when
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:01.400]  when this house of cards burns down it's going to burn if they have any idea how much the black
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.360]  water and all the other folks that on average are good people that are guarding them how much
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:10.600]  they hate them i don't talk to these folks i don't think they have any idea that they think they've
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:15.880]  got a 50 man team guarding them in new zealand they have no idea those guys are just waiting i

[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:27.240]  you know x special operations guy who now makes high dollar for unscrewing nukes and putting them
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  back together and he tells the security guards inside of the locked facility thanks for carrying
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:39.240]  my gun until i need it and that's how the blackwater guys look at their so-called employers
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:45.480]  thanks for letting me drive your armored Mercedes until i need it because you'll be on the curb at
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:53.240]  best i know they're so stupid they're sitting there in armored redowds with 50 killers right and
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:57.240]  these guys have no respect for them because they're traders they have any idea they're just
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:02.520]  sharpening their knives just waiting and imagine if imagine if the traders that they're guarding are
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:07.000]  you know abusing children around the swimming pool while the blackwater guys are watching
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.160]  they're not happy about it believe me the blackwater guys have a plan to bring their own
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:18.440]  families to the redoubt after they uh you know get rid of their uh so-called bosses i know they
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:25.160]  should know that they are so freaking stupid aren't they they are absolutely skip this break
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:31.640]  let's go to more calls um i just talked to chris or i just talked to john all right howard in
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:43.880]  arkansas you're on the air yeah hello alec hello matt thanks bye your phone's breaking up power go
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:50.680]  ahead yeah we're gonna move on you're having fun trouble andrew in minnesota you're on the air
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:57.480]  andrew go ahead hi alex i had just a couple quick points if i could why is it i think you would
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:51:03.960]  agree that language is it can be very powerful when you know when you talk about illegal aliens
[02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:08.440]  voting in our elections or anything it just seems a roll off people's backs but you know
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:14.520]  there are not so mexican citizens so i think it would garner more outrage if we were saying
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:21.560]  mexican citizens are voting in our elections and mexican citizens are are draining our our
[02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:27.000]  government resources and things like that it changed the perspective i think a lot of people
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:32.600]  have no i agree it's something we're against the mexicans is that they wouldn't let us engage in that
[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:40.200]  and this is a joke that is going on democrats everywhere are passing laws that let illegals vote
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:44.440]  and they say trump is a conspiracy terrorist to say three million illegals were on the voting
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:50.600]  rolls they were right they give them the vote the voter uh the voter card with their you know
[02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:57.640]  their driver's license i also think that it's very immoral for us to let carlo slim and these
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:52:03.880]  mexican billionaires to let them just push the poor and the poorest people out of their country
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:09.160]  to go to america to send checks back i say send those people back to mexico now that they've had
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:14.440]  a taste of freedom and opportunity send them back to mexico with a you know with a an instruction
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:20.760]  for a revolution for a uh a true free market in mexico and not this you know crony oligarch kind of
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:26.440]  of a of a system that they have perpetuated and i'd also want to see trump start building this
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:34.200]  wall very fast because that will be a visual galvanizing experience after 30 years of hearing
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:39.480]  to politicians talk about protecting that fence that wall or excuse me even building any kind of
[02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:46.120]  a barrier virtual fences drones that never take off when we actually see a fence being built from
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:51.880]  the gulf of mexico to san diego it's going to be galvanizing it's going to mean this is for real
[02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:57.080]  you know i think that's when we will see self deportation a lot of self deportation yeah exactly
[02:52:57.080 --> 02:53:01.320]  all we care about is the criminal self deporting it's just that they're meant to be brought here
[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:05.720]  the democratic party operatives thank you andrew and i and i bear them no ill will and i wish that
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:11.240]  they go back to guatemala el salvador in mexico and force their leaders to be responsible to the
[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:18.840]  entire country and not just use america as their safety blowoff valve jim jim in georgia you're on
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:27.320]  the air hello alex this is jim narner in georgia say i spent my time in the military i did six years
[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:34.520]  in the infantry got all back in 83 in 1988 i started getting involved in a local militia up in
[02:53:34.520 --> 02:53:44.440]  wisconsin where i was from original in 1994 94 actually spring in 95 a manual came into the
[02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:52.360]  possession of our company commander who had some his vietnam bet was some black ops northern africa
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:57.800]  and i believe it was one of his friends from the inside that might have gotten it to him but it was
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:05.320]  called it's called an fm 41 10 a military civil affairs operations man it says on the cover it
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:11.400]  doesn't say classified or secret or top secret but it does stay on the cover destruction notice
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:15.720]  destroyed by any method that will prevent disclosure reproduction of this document
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:22.360]  well they failed in their mission because this man ran a couple hundred copies and i got the first
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:29.160]  one off the press but that was about the only one that got released it may have been two or three
[02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:34.600]  others because it wasn't long after that is log cabin furthouse in the middle of the night luckily
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:39.240]  the dog woke up okay well i happened to pretty much know everything about that kind of stuff so
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:45.400]  tell me what it supposedly says you know the 41 10 all right we disclosed to the milwaukee
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:52.760]  sentinel journal in 1995 there's a what it's saying all right in this manual the the military
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:57.640]  made a statement to the paper that this meant yes there's such manual it was developed only for
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:03.720]  use in foreign countries during times of war well it talks in here about yes troops coming
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:09.560]  to host nations to quell civil disturbances another major problem and it's implemented after
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:15.960]  martial law i find it funny that they'd say it was for foreign countries because in my copy it has
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:19.800]  a map of the continental united states broken in here let me bring this up i don't know about
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:24.440]  the particular thing you're mentioning but i've read the washington post rondo star on air
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:30.040]  about 12 14 years ago where they said we'll use mexican and canadian troops to quell
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:35.400]  terrorism and civil disobedience in america that's actually in my film police day to the takeover
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:41.480]  so i know i've read those plans very very bold plans let's get matt braggins take on that
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.800]  yeah i'm not familiar with that um with that manual i've seen other i've seen other manuals
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:53.560]  talking about civil affairs which you know clearly show plans uh for setting up uh
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:59.800]  you know detention camps and things like that are pretty scary that but like i always say that's
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:04.760]  the civilian inmate labor camp program that's that's admitted young but a plan to ride a tiger
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:09.240]  is not the same as riding a tiger anybody who talk is cheap and manuals are cheap
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:12.840]  but they got to remember that the people that they're depending on it's just it's just like the
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:17.800]  blackwater guards for these elites and they're they're in their uh that they're in their redoubts
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:23.240]  and retreats the people that they think are going to be rounding us up are us it's not going to work
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.800]  what i could much more likely see by the way let me ask you this particular and then continue
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:34.920]  would you say 90 percent of actual train troops special forces people operators are patriots
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:41.080]  just because that's how folks they are well it you have to distinguish between combat arms and
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:45.400]  some logistics and support a lot of the bases that i've been on it it almost seems like a
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:50.200]  welfare program has been instituted and i mean all the real people that actually put themselves
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:55.720]  in line the war fighters the the war fighters seem to all be dolled into freedom yes they are and
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:57:01.480]  they're they're very much so and i've it's very rare to meet a warfighter who is a liberal although
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:07.800]  i will say that both betray us and the crystal are on record as being against civilians owning
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:14.200]  semi-automatic rifles which worries me a lot but they're just you know the higher up that they go
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:20.520]  it seems like they they uh you know they they they select for sycophancy and for you know go along
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:25.800]  to get smoke the dope right they want to they want to become a member sure so what number what 95 percent
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:32.920]  though war fighters are patriots of combat arms of o4 you know major and lieutenant commander and
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:39.800]  below i would say 90 percent are our patriots in that way and and they definitely believe in the
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:44.600]  constitution and defending it against all enemies foreign and they're not afraid to kill people
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.840]  that's opposed to him and if they're told that if they're told they're to take these
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:54.040]  10 buses from the base to go to some subdivision and round everybody up the people who give that
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:58.920]  orders are much more likely to be hanged from the flagpole than those buses go out and let's say the
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:03.640]  first round up maybe they don't hang but once they see a family's mowed down then then it's over
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:09.960]  it's over and and the people that would that would be going along with any orders and i'm and i'm
[02:58:09.960 --> 02:58:15.400]  not i'm gonna be nonpartisan in this case if it was no matter who said we're gonna go round up the
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:21.560]  jews the muslims the blacks i don't care it wouldn't go down it just wouldn't be successful
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:26.360]  it would the people giving those orders would be hung they should know that that's why i say it
[02:58:26.360 --> 02:58:30.760]  they should all right well powerful interview matt bracken enemies foreign domestic dot com

[03:00:11.800 --> 03:00:20.760]  but whose law the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:21.720 --> 03:00:28.600]  i love how all these trendies all these delusionals thought they'd just take over america and set
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:35.080]  up their world government passed all over the republic without a fight as they get deeper
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:39.880]  out of this thing they realized it's far from what they thought it'd be now they're fighting for their
[03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:44.920]  lives that makes the enemy even more dangerous now they're not just operating on hubris
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:54.680]  as i've said many times wild horses couldn't drag me away from what i'm doing here today
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:01:01.720]  i'm not trying to talk like some guy from a wolf playing chili had my my lungs pretty infected
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:07.720]  today but as i said wild horses couldn't drag me away i just look at the offense
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:14.360]  of a culture that makes women wear hoods over their heads and cuts their channels off and then
[03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:20.920]  floods our country with it paul watson info wars dot com canada celebrate type jib wearing news anchor
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:26.920]  while christians on the same network are banned from wearing crosses and then you're about a machete
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:30.200]  attack with the news is saying it's a gun attack that's how controlled the press is
[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:38.200]  i got upset about that and then sharing off it was a jihadi from somalia
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:43.560]  in my own life i don't need to blame some group or hate some group to feel good about myself
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:49.240]  the fact that muslims are on average so oppressed and so backwards makes me feel sorry for them
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:02:01.720]  but uh i can't be told i'm some backwards guy that hates women and all i do is spoil women
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:08.200]  i can't sit here and listen to lies anymore i can't go along with this bs anymore
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:13.800]  i can't i've had dinners with these pseudo-intellectual
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:21.240]  big newspaper reporters liberal icons they're like middle medgets it's like how the hell are you
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:26.440]  rolling over us but it's because the power structure put them in power because they're

[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:39.720]  they're not straight shooters yeah these people wouldn't be anywhere to fight
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:46.200]  half of them don't know who their daddy is i don't mean that mean the folks don't know who
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:51.000]  their daddy is but knowing your daddy is a lot bigger than knowing who your daddy is
[03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:56.680]  they don't stand for anything except screwing people over
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:05.160]  they're the most unhappy miserable people i could ever imagine
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:11.000]  and i think in this great animating contest of liberty the most important thing i could ever
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:16.680]  transmit to anybody is that we'd not be part of these people god they're a joke

[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:38.760]  detonators imagine a woman can't wear a cross on cnn but this woman can wear
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:44.760]  wear that all arrogantly in her little stockhome syndrome
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.520]  yeah i'm not gonna go along with her here's a clip
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:59.560]  the time come to defend the muslims has not the time come to avenge the brewed woman
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:06.920]  has not the time come to seek revenge for the imprisoned so where jihad fight for your religion

[03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:16.760]  deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[03:06:16.760 --> 03:06:22.040]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen
[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:27.480]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[03:08:25.400 --> 03:08:32.360]  alex jones show on this monday november 28th 2016 cyber monday if you're paying any attention to the
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:38.120]  sales and the specials that have started uh on thanksgiving this year uh a lot of optimism we
[03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:45.320]  see in these sales figures as people are looking forward to a a change of events a new deal a
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:51.080]  an environment that is going to put the economy first and of course i think that was a key thing
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:57.880]  i think uh donald trump didn't stress it as much as he could have but people understood that what
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:03.320]  this was about was the economy and i think that was really a major part of the win for donald trump
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:08.360]  to understand that he was going to do things as we saw the thanksgiving weekend to tackle
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:13.880]  carrier air conditioning and say uh don't move your factory to uh mexica let me tell you why we
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:17.240]  don't know what he said to them maybe he said uh you know you're going to find that it isn't really
[03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:21.640]  going to work out for you if you do that because it's not going to give you a price advantage
[03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:26.040]  we're going to make sure that doesn't happen i don't know what he did but uh hopefully that is in
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:32.280]  play and we see that type of thing and at the same time as i tweeted out it says amazing contrast
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:37.640]  between obama and hillary clinton who bragged about how they were going to take jobs how are
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:41.640]  they going to shut down entire industries how they were going to starve us of energy how they
[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:46.360]  were going to shut off our air conditioning even we just had john carry middle of september
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:50.040]  saying yeah we're going to we're going to cap your air conditioning usage and then we're going to
[03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:56.680]  start reducing it right away uh no you're not from my cold dead hands and so now there's optimism
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:10:01.320]  you know we've got uh it looks like we're going to have somebody who is friendly to our economic
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:06.600]  activities who wants us to have air conditioning and things like that so uh i think there's a lot
[03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:11.240]  of optimism that we're seeing in these figures and of course we have a lot of sales at info wars
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:17.480]  as well from black friday to cyber monday we've got several sales at info wars life dot com
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:24.360]  some of those 50 percent off a silver bullet at info wars life dot com 30 percent off supermail
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:29.640]  vitality at info wars life dot com also we have black friday specials that we've extended
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:36.600]  uh through today 30 to 40 off all info war select storeable food and 30 off survival
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:43.240]  shield x2 nascent iodine all of those are key ingredients for your preparedness as well as
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:49.400]  for your health and this is a great time to stock up on it uh you should be optimistic
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:54.040]  but also be prepared now today i want to talk about several things that have been bothering me
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:11:01.560]  over the last couple of days as we look at the transition we've got barack obama saying that
[03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:08.920]  he's going to put in a flurry of new rules for us forget the fact that hopefully donald trump is
[03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:13.640]  going to reduce these i remember during the campaign it was just back the beginning of october
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:18.440]  that uh donald trump was talking about how he's going to reduce uh probably 70 percent of the
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:23.800]  regulations he said and the hill took him to task and they said no you can't do that you
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:30.200]  can't just cut regulations that easily going back to october 7th they said uh the issue of regulation
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:34.200]  has been so thoroughly politicized that it's not surprising if members of the public think that
[03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:39.160]  issuing a regulation or rescinding one is something that a president can do with the stroke of a
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:43.640]  pin no i think you need a phone too don't you obama you need a pin and a phone to do that kind
[03:11:43.640 --> 03:11:48.440]  of stuff i say regulations often get confused with executive orders which can actually be done away
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:54.360]  with quite easily oh really okay well let's let's talk about the regulations and i think this is a
[03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:59.800]  key thing to understanding how much power has been concentrated in the office of president and why it
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:07.160]  is such a bad thing and hopefully this is going to change under trump if not hopefully at least he
[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:12.360]  will remove some of the burdensome regulations that have been placed on us he'll take those away
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:17.640]  and whether they've been done by executive order or whether they've been done by the orders of the
[03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:23.560]  massive bureaucracy remember the declaration of independent independence where they said that the
[03:12:23.560 --> 03:12:29.800]  king had swarms of officers that were harassing our people and eating out their substance remember
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:34.600]  when we rebelled against taxation without representation well we have all that in these
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:40.520]  bureaucracies we not only have taxation without representation we not only have swarms of officers
[03:12:40.520 --> 03:12:47.960]  who harass us who eat out our substance but we also have a regulation without any representation we
[03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:54.520]  have legislation without representation not just taxation understand that these regulatory agencies
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:13:01.240]  are little empires under themselves they have they write their own laws they're given broad powers
[03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:06.280]  by the congress which has advocated its power to these regulatory agencies and they work under and
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:12.280]  with the president as an extension of executive orders you need to start thinking of the epa and
[03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:17.160]  the irs and all these other regulatory agencies you need to start thinking of them as an extension
[03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:21.400]  of executive orders because that's truly what they are and so we should get to the bottom of this
[03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:26.040]  it's one of the reasons why is i look at all these different cabinet picks that trump is doing
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:31.800]  in many regards i just look at it like i just wish he would shut down that entire organization
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:37.000]  as opposed to putting somebody in front and top of it and continuing on with it but they talk about
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:41.800]  and they said this back in october 7th this editorial by the hill said trump can't really
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:45.480]  cut these regulations because it takes a very long time to do it it's a very time consuming
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:51.160]  process they said proponents of regulation often complain about just how hard it is to get a new
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:57.640]  regulation oh yeah that's why we have 80 000 plus pages of them every year because it's so so difficult
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:03.480]  no no it's not hard but they do drag the process out they say for better or worse it takes roughly
[03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:08.840]  the same amount of time to get rid of one years they say first the agency has to propose a regulation
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:13.800]  then they open the proposal for public comment then if it has a large economic impact then we
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:17.880]  have to do studies about that then once they get all this stuff back they have to respond to the
[03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:23.720]  comments redo their analysis and so forth and then they're going to get sued so they they say
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:29.320]  one of the key things and this is what you have to understand the purpose of regulations the purpose
[03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:36.520]  of the FDA the purpose of all these other regulatory agencies is if an industry has spent millions of
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:43.320]  dollars coming into compliance with the regulation they're not likely to be happy that new competitors
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.600]  can now enter the market without complying with those regulations you understand then when we look
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:53.880]  at stuff like the Dodd-Frank bill that was not really set up to control the banks if they wanted
[03:14:53.880 --> 03:14:57.960]  to control the banks they'd break them up which is what Bill Clinton did he created the two big
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:15:03.720]  to fail bank mergers the first one being nation bank and bank of america and then they all started
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:07.720]  merging everybody said we're going to wind up a five or six banks that are huge and that's what we
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:12.120]  did and they were too big to fail too big to jail we've seen that type of thing over and over again
[03:15:12.120 --> 03:15:17.160]  when you look at the FDA what do they do they put these regulations in here so that they can keep
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:22.360]  other people from getting into competition with them that's the whole purpose of this that's why
[03:15:22.360 --> 03:15:28.520]  you have regulatory capture they speak of that they take control of the FDA and their regulators
[03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:33.880]  to keep their competitors at bay look at what happens to somebody wants to start a new car
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:38.280]  company for example you have this guy the only person i've seen that is seriously trying to
[03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:44.040]  start a new car company i think since delorean is this guy elio and what did he have to do he
[03:15:44.040 --> 03:15:49.160]  had to go to something that had three wheels so he could escape some of the onerous regulations
[03:15:49.160 --> 03:15:53.720]  that were put in there by detroit to keep competition out they don't want new competition
[03:15:53.720 --> 03:15:59.160]  so he had to create a car that wasn't technically a car and we'll see how that goes but that's the
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:04.360]  purpose of these regulations and so when i look at this i look at this article that came out of the
[03:16:04.360 --> 03:16:08.040]  christian science monitor it was linked on the drudge report federal agencies are pushing a
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:12.760]  flurry of midnight rulemaking under obama they talk about how well the white house is reviewing
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:17.960]  as many as 98 final regulations that could be implemented before trump takes office including
[03:16:17.960 --> 03:16:24.200]  17 with an estimated annual economic impact of a hundred million dollars or more that would be each
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:30.600]  folks each of those 17 regulations would have an impact of more than a hundred million dollars
[03:16:30.600 --> 03:16:37.000]  see that's the issue and that's what needs to stop we need to have something that is going to
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:43.400]  we need to have a revolution it needs to be based on the constitution and the thing that
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:48.200]  i'm concerned about with the trump transition team as we've seen now there's been so much pushback
[03:16:48.200 --> 03:16:54.840]  against romney kelly and conway is talking about how the masses of people are furious about this
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:16:59.720]  others have spoken out against it like huckabee like gingrich that it's a betrayal if he if he
[03:16:59.720 --> 03:17:05.240]  were to do this i think it's a big mistake i think we need somebody who is going to
[03:17:05.240 --> 03:17:10.840]  to not push back against donald trump's agenda what he ran on and i don't really understand i
[03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:15.880]  understand reaching out to the other side trying to get a consensus but when you pick somebody
[03:17:15.880 --> 03:17:21.160]  like your chief of staff like previous or you pick somebody like romney or even worse betray us as
[03:17:21.160 --> 03:17:25.720]  that they're now talking about when you do that you have to understand that what he's doing when
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:30.360]  he puts these people in his chief of staff as secretary of state he's really kind of running
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:35.640]  a three-legged race with these people and that's kind of hard to do when the other guy is desperately
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:41.160]  trying to go in the other direction when these guys are died in the world globalists who are
[03:17:41.160 --> 03:17:47.480]  going to fight you on these key issues that's a real problem and when we look at this i want to
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:52.360]  look at this in just a moment some of the other things i'm going to talk about in this hour
[03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:56.200]  just to give you an idea and if i don't get all of these things i'll be talking about them on the
[03:17:56.200 --> 03:18:01.320]  nightly news tonight where i'm hosting i'll also be talking about the world leaders reactions to
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:09.400]  fidel castro there's an amazing twitter hashtag that is really hilarious that came out of a response
[03:18:09.400 --> 03:18:15.880]  to pierre trados eulogy for fidel castro people making fun of that but i also want to give you
[03:18:15.880 --> 03:18:20.200]  just my personal take on it somebody who grew up in florida who was a child during the cuban
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:27.160]  missile crisis who knew a lot of liberty loving cubans also i want to talk about jill stein
[03:18:27.160 --> 03:18:32.680]  and this attack not only on trump but on the electoral college and why the electoral college
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:37.880]  is so important and i want to get to all that but let's go back to patrice here for a moment
[03:18:37.880 --> 03:18:44.600]  understand where patrice is coming from as we see the the news articles that today he is going to
[03:18:44.600 --> 03:18:49.240]  be going to trump tower to talk to donald trump about secretary of state also mit romney is going
[03:18:49.240 --> 03:18:53.880]  to be coming back again tomorrow hopefully that's going to be a meeting where donald trump says
[03:18:53.880 --> 03:18:58.360]  sorry it looks out like the engagement is off can i have the ring back okay i hope that's what's
[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:03.000]  going to be behind this romney meeting but it concerned me very much to see david patrice there
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:08.760]  why why because david patrice has been a strong supporter now live hillary clinton he was during
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:14.440]  the election he is a not only a frequent but a regular attendee of bill deberg he's one of the
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:20.200]  inner circle of bill deberg that's where he hangs out okay he's an emerging leader amongst the
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:28.440]  globalists okay this guy is patrice is a nascent kissinger or nascent brzezinski we do not want
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:34.760]  to have them take over the trump presidency by having somebody like this in that position
[03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:40.200]  he's also a wall street crony capitalist he also is a gun control advocate he's also a supporter
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:46.520]  of total surveillance state remember when he was bragging about how your appliances the internet
[03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:51.480]  of things all these things are going to be spying on you very soon and he was happy about that
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:55.640]  stay with us we're gonna be right back when we talk about what's behind all of this we'll be right back
[03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:05.560]  will the government protect your family from iran and north korea's newest weapon
[03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:11.160]  emp we buy guns to protect ourselves home health and car insurance for accidents maybe you also

[03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:25.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david now your host i was just talking about the possibility
[03:24:25.080 --> 03:24:32.680]  that donald trump might choose general portray us as a secretary of state and not mit romney would
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:38.680]  that be better i think it might be even worse than mit romney and i'm not at all a supporter of
[03:24:38.680 --> 03:24:43.400]  mit romney for that position let me tell you think about what the duties of the secretary of state
[03:24:43.400 --> 03:24:50.200]  are okay secondary estate is going to be essentially the the president's eyes and ears abroad
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:54.920]  he's going to be involved in war and peace and determining whether or not we're going to go to
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:58.360]  war with people or we're going to have peace or we're going to have more interventionist wars
[03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:02.040]  he's also going to be involved with the trade treaties he's going to be involved with the
[03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:08.040]  climate treaties as we've seen with john carrey is this going to be somebody that is going to be on
[03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:14.520]  donald trump's side that is going to further the policies that donald trump ran on and got elected on
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:20.040]  the policies that people voted for him to put in place think about general portray us think
[03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:25.880]  about the fact that he is part of the inner circle at bill de berg now there are people who go to
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:29.880]  bill de berg and they'll go just once and they'll look at it's like i'm i'm not going back there
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:34.280]  again that was margaret thatcher she went she criticized them and within a few months they
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:41.640]  removed her as prime minister from the uk but someone like portray us who is now embedded himself
[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:49.800]  in uh wall street crony capitalism he's with a kkr he is i think an emerging kissinger an emerging
[03:25:49.800 --> 03:25:55.560]  brazinski this guy is thoroughly a globalist he is not going to be with donald trump in terms of
[03:25:55.560 --> 03:25:59.800]  fighting these global trade treaties i can tell you that he's probably not going to be with him
[03:25:59.800 --> 03:26:03.880]  on the climate treaties as well he is somebody who has continually supported these kind of
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:10.120]  interventionist wars so it's not going to be a pullback against our involvement in unnecessary
[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:14.600]  wars either to have somebody like this and so i hope that donald trump realizes that he doesn't
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:19.800]  really need the republicans and he certainly doesn't need democrats like portray us yeah portray us
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:24.840]  really is a democrat look back at the beginning of september we had this article from politico
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:28.840]  saying clinton was going to convene a meeting at the time with portray us and other national
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:33.960]  security experts uh she was going to have him in along with former homeland security chief
[03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:39.880]  michael shirt off these are people who supported her during the election understand portray us was a
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:47.800]  clinton supporter along with people like michael moral uh the former deputy cia director who was
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:54.520]  a big league trump critic okay and he openly endorsed hillary david portray us that a lot of
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:27:00.360]  very kind things about hillary clinton and of course in this meeting we also had janet napolitano
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:06.520]  john allen who was also involved in the sex scandal with general portray us what happened
[03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:13.480]  with general portray us in terms of the emails it was also the next month in october 22nd
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:18.520]  we saw a report from fox news we want to talk about this email scandal here that portray us
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:25.000]  essentially had a leak of classified information just like hillary clinton did there were 1000
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:31.240]  and this is key 1000 clinton portray us emails that were missing from the records sent to state and
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:38.760]  the fbi records show so the issue is this we've got general portray us who was convicted and
[03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:43.080]  we'll have got an article here as to uh who who was worse in terms of security issues
[03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:49.080]  clinton or portray us hillary clinton or portray us well uh there's two ways to look at this but
[03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:56.040]  the bottom line is why would we be embracing somebody who has shown open contempt for national
[03:27:56.040 --> 03:28:03.400]  security we have lost virtually all of our freedoms in the last 15 years in the name of national
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:09.000]  security it has become a religion of the state and yet we give the people at the top portray
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:14.920]  us in clinton we give them a pass and a call although he was convicted and uh of a misdemeanor
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:19.720]  even though he had multiple felonies we'd let these people get a pass and then we give them
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:24.920]  rewards of letting them run for president or making them secretary of state i just don't get it
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:30.920]  here he has 1000 clinton portrays email so you might say well you know what what is this why is
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:37.320]  he meeting and and the headliner for a security meeting for hillary clinton trying to get up her
[03:28:37.320 --> 03:28:42.840]  credentials to show that she's really tough on isis most because they have a deep long relationship
[03:28:42.840 --> 03:28:47.480]  say roughly 1000 emails between hillary clinton and general portray us were thought to be missing
[03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:52.920]  from the 30 000 emails provided by clinton's team to the state department in december 2014
[03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:59.320]  according to back in october 22nd newly released fbi investigative files additional documents obtained
[03:28:59.320 --> 03:29:03.640]  through a federal lawsuit by judicial watch show that clinton had directed portray us to send her
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:10.920]  emails at her personal address so she told david portray us send these classified documents to me
[03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:17.240]  at my personal address and he did he's no better than hillary clinton and of course they go on to
[03:29:17.240 --> 03:29:25.160]  say that this was heavily redacted fbi interview summary from august 17th 2015 a state department
[03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:30.920]  employee from the office of information programs and services which handles for a request showed
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:36.120]  how these records are apparently not among those that were turned over by hillary clinton they say
[03:29:36.120 --> 03:29:41.400]  they had sent com records that showed approximately a thousand records but hey we can't find those
[03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:46.680]  and the ones that were turned over to the fbi see they're missing okay understand that so they
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:52.200]  hid those emails what were they hiding stay with us we'll be right back we're on the march
[03:29:52.200 --> 03:29:57.480]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.560 --> 03:30:07.320]  pizza gate more information is unfolding but here's what we know there's some creepy unexplained
[03:30:07.320 --> 03:30:13.160]  emails within the wiki leaks dump that indict john pedesta his brother tony and james elefantis now
[03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:17.880]  the mainstream media instead of asking questions the same ones that we would ask here at info wars
[03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:23.160]  they've taken it upon themselves to indict the quote fake media they have an article up on their
[03:30:23.160 --> 03:30:29.160]  website entitled fake news onslaught targets pizzeria as a nest of child trafficking they go on to
[03:30:29.160 --> 03:30:34.200]  say quote days before the presidential election james elefantis owner of a local pizza restaurant
[03:30:34.200 --> 03:30:39.480]  called comet ping pong noticed an unusual spike in the number of his instagram followers within
[03:30:39.480 --> 03:30:44.680]  hours menacing messages like we're on to you began appearing in his instagram feed in the ensuing

[03:30:49.640 --> 03:30:54.280]  and twitter so instead of addressing the creepy messages they've taken it upon themselves to
[03:30:54.280 --> 03:30:59.480]  become an advocate for one person indicted in those emails i'm margaret howell reporting for

[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:36.200]  i'm going to get back to david betrase and his involvement in the hillary clinton email scandals
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:42.520]  a thousand emails we now found out actually it wasn't just now we found this out uh back in
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:47.480]  october uh that there were a thousand emails between hillary clinton and david betrase that
[03:33:47.480 --> 03:33:52.680]  had gone missing that the clinton group did not turnovers yes obstruction of justice
[03:33:53.720 --> 03:33:59.880]  that's a very serious felony what were they hiding there and what does it tell us when we see
[03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:05.400]  that donald trump is considering david betrase for secretary of state and i say this not to
[03:34:05.400 --> 03:34:13.000]  criticize but to warn donald trump not to bring somebody like this into his inner circle we have
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:17.640]  to understand that the way the system is going to fight this and they've been fighting it both the
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:21.000]  leadership of the democrats and republicans who's pointed out through the entire election
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:26.600]  attacking donald trump he won without them he doesn't need them to govern he needs the people
[03:34:26.600 --> 03:34:31.720]  he can go over their heads he can have the same kind of massive rallies that he did when he was
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:35.240]  running for president he can communicate directly to the people with social media
[03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:41.240]  he can put pressure on these people using the public and so it ought to be donald trump with
[03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:45.800]  the people ronald reagan said he was going to do that he never did it ronald reagan said he was
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:50.120]  going to go over the heads of washington bureaucrats and he was going to go straight to the people
[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:54.840]  donald trump actually did that and he has done that far to a far greater extent than ronald
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:58.600]  reagan ever did and we need to understand that when ronald reagan became president one of the
[03:34:58.600 --> 03:35:06.440]  ways that they co-opted him was by infiltrating the state department with 300 plus council on foreign
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:12.600]  relations people who were globalists who were warmongers who were the kinds of people that
[03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:19.720]  david patreus is and so when we see cnn reporting that david patreus is meeting with donald trump
[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:25.800]  at trump tower today and a top transition official tells cnn that many in trump's camp support having
[03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:31.080]  patreus filled the position they say trump is inclined to pick patreus according to the official
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:35.640]  yet he's weighing where there's a good idea to have two retired generals heading the state department
[03:35:35.640 --> 03:35:41.080]  and the pentagon well that's not the problem i mean he could fill the entire cabinet with generals
[03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:46.840]  that wouldn't be a problem the problem is filling your inner circle with the kinds of people who
[03:35:46.840 --> 03:35:54.760]  opposed you who opposed the agenda that people voted for and also the hypocrisy of putting somebody
[03:35:54.760 --> 03:36:01.240]  in who has the same kinds of issues as hillary clinton this and and when we say this there's been a
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:07.640]  massive pushback against mitt romney for whatever reason donald trump thought that mid romney might
[03:36:07.640 --> 03:36:12.840]  be a good secretary of state maybe it was being pushed by uh rince previs i believe that was
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:19.720]  probably the case but the people spoke in massive numbers kelly and conway is talking about that and
[03:36:19.720 --> 03:36:26.280]  i hope that it isn't simply but they're not opposing him simply because uh this is um partisan
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:31.080]  tribalism i hope it's because i understand the principles involved and i hope they won't bring
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:36.600]  in david petraeus who is equally comfortable with both the republicans and the democrats this
[03:36:36.600 --> 03:36:42.040]  guy has absolutely no principles other than globalism and we have seen that over and over again from
[03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:48.040]  him but when we look at this going back to again to october this is something from political fact
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:55.000]  and at the time donald trump had said well david petraeus was treated worse than hillary clinton
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:00.200]  she's he was hammered by this and they said well really whose case was worse political fact
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:06.200]  believe that uh petraeus's case was worse than hillary clinton's i don't think so but here's
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:12.360]  what they said they said petraeus pled guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling
[03:37:12.360 --> 03:37:17.800]  confidential materials a misdemeanor charge thank you now i want you to hear what he did okay
[03:37:17.800 --> 03:37:22.360]  is this a misdemeanor charge of a national security violation he gave his mistress paul
[03:37:22.360 --> 03:37:28.520]  abroadwell access to eight notebooks with top secret and code information she made copies of
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:33.960]  over 300 documents that were marked secret now what was he given for that well he was given
[03:37:34.760 --> 03:37:39.960]  a $100,000 fine which is nothing to somebody like him uh the kind of connections he has on
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:45.080]  wall street and he was given two years probation now that was it back in 2015 would he even be
[03:37:45.080 --> 03:37:50.040]  eligible to become secretary of state would donald trump have to give david petraeus a pardon
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:55.080]  in order to make him his secretary of state what does that say when you have to give somebody
[03:37:55.080 --> 03:38:00.040]  a criminal a pardon so that you can make them secretary of state and they say in addition
[03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:06.040]  david petraeus lied fbi agents who are investigating the case well and when he gives up 300 documents
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:13.480]  that were marked secret why is that a misdemeanor why did that one individual who was a lowly seaman
[03:38:13.480 --> 03:38:21.640]  on a submarine who took uh four or five pictures on a submarine with his iphone as a souvenir and
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:28.840]  those were classified as confidential why is he in prison for an extended period of time
[03:38:29.560 --> 03:38:35.240]  and then these people go free so in clinton's case they say the fbi found 110 emails with
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:41.080]  classified information on her server eight of which were designated top secret here's the deal okay
[03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:48.440]  it doesn't matter if you've got 110 classified secret documents or you got 300 classified
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:54.440]  documents you shouldn't be given have that taken down to a misdemeanor as it was for david petraeus
[03:38:54.440 --> 03:38:59.880]  or you shouldn't have it completely ignored as it was for hillary clinton why don't you just
[03:38:59.880 --> 03:39:04.840]  make hillary clinton your secretary of state if you're going to go with david petraeus we really
[03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:09.080]  need to push back on this we need to do it for the sake of the republic we need to do it for the
[03:39:09.080 --> 03:39:15.640]  sake of donald trump because this guy will torpedo his administration i am absolutely convinced of
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:23.240]  it i don't trust david petraeus whatsoever now let's take a look at the fidel castrow
[03:39:24.760 --> 03:39:31.720]  responses when i saw the way people reacting i tweeted out and if you want to follow me on
[03:39:31.720 --> 03:39:37.560]  twitter i'm liberty terrian at liberty terrian on twitter i said isn't it telling to see democrats
[03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:44.360]  who called trump hitler falling all over themselves to praise castrow and i said trump was right he
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:49.720]  is a brutal dictator and here's some of the reactions that we have from usa today we've got
[03:39:50.840 --> 03:39:56.120]  president obama saying today we offer condolences to fidel castrow's family and our thoughts and
[03:39:56.120 --> 03:40:01.640]  prayers are with the cuban people think about if this were hitler would we say today we offer
[03:40:01.640 --> 03:40:08.120]  condolences to hitler's family and our thoughts and prayers are with the german people see there
[03:40:08.120 --> 03:40:13.320]  was a there was a hashtag that came out because pierre trudeau did that i'm going to read you
[03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:18.040]  some of those in a moment they're really funny but then again the analogy they said this is what
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:23.560]  obama said about castrow he said for nearly six decades the relationship between the us and cuba
[03:40:23.560 --> 03:40:29.800]  was marked by discord and by profound political disagreements well what would we have said for
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:35.000]  nearly a decade the relationship between the us and germany under adolf hitler was marked by
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:42.200]  discord and profound political disagreements let's call a real dictator a real dictator that's what
[03:40:42.200 --> 03:40:49.320]  these people are unable to do uh donald trump however was able to do it and i don't see any
[03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:54.440]  other world leader that called it like it was we did have some commentators who spoke out we had
[03:40:54.440 --> 03:40:58.840]  marco rubio and ted Cruz both of whom had families who came from cuba who spoke out about that
[03:40:59.480 --> 03:41:03.720]  but donald trump said this and he got it right he said today the world marks the passing of a
[03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:09.640]  brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades but el castrow's legacy is one
[03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:15.880]  of firing squads one of theft one of unimaginable suffering poverty and the denial of fundamental
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:21.640]  human rights while cuba remains a totalitarian island trump said it is my hope that today marks
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:27.480]  a move away from the horrors endured for too long toward a future in which the wonderful cuban people
[03:41:27.480 --> 03:41:33.480]  finally live and the freedom they so richly deserve yet then we see john carrey coming out
[03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:38.040]  we extend our condolences to the cuban people today as they mourn the passing of fidel he played
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:44.040]  an outsized role in their lives and he influenced the direction of regional and even global affairs
[03:41:44.040 --> 03:41:50.440]  just like adolf hitler and then we have latimer putin coming out saying that castrow was a symbol
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:58.680]  of a whole era of modern world history yes he was the cuban missile crisis the cuban missile crisis
[03:41:58.680 --> 03:42:03.880]  and that's my personal connection to fidel castrow that and the fact that i grew up
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:12.440]  up was so close to the missiles that they were trying to put in he brought us as peter hitchens
[03:42:12.440 --> 03:42:23.800]  points out in the daily mail fidel castrow and his pal uh what's his name hammered his shoe on the
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:30.600]  on the desk saying we will bury you the two of them brought us to the brink of armageddon
[03:42:30.600 --> 03:42:37.240]  and i was a very young child at the time and i will never never forget that and at the time
[03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:42.040]  they told us even though we had schools that were very close to our homes we had neighborhood
[03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:47.400]  schools in those days we didn't bus everybody from one side of town to the other they told us
[03:42:48.120 --> 03:42:53.400]  that we wouldn't have time to get home if there was a nuclear attack because cuba was so close
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:42:59.320]  and they scared us to death and with good reason we were right at the brink that was the closest
[03:42:59.320 --> 03:43:05.320]  the world has ever come to a nuclear catastrophe and so from that reason alone we should be upset
[03:43:05.320 --> 03:43:09.960]  about it but we should be upset for what he did to the cuban people and i knew a lot of cubans
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:16.920]  who had come to florida from castrows cuba and i have to say that like the people who have escaped
[03:43:16.920 --> 03:43:24.840]  communism or the forms of totalitarianism they are some of the most hardcore liberty lovers you'll
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:31.400]  ever find i was friends with a lot of them whose parents had come i was in bands with a lot of
[03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:40.280]  cuban guys lopez dies rodriguez a lot of guys really fine musicians and their parents knew
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:44.680]  what cuba was like they'd had businesses confiscated by this guy stolen from them that's the theft
[03:43:45.320 --> 03:43:50.120]  that donald trump was talking about they knew people who had been killed by this ruthless
[03:43:50.120 --> 03:43:59.560]  dictator and to see this guy eulogized by these people on the left even to see them eulogized
[03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:04.280]  by the people who are now saying oh we don't like the electoral college it's just isn't democratic
[03:44:04.280 --> 03:44:09.560]  enough and it's like seriously are you serious about this look at some of these other reactions
[03:44:09.560 --> 03:44:14.680]  here's here's ireland's president having survived some 600 attempts on his life oh why would they
[03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:18.760]  have tried to kill him well only because he brought us to the brink of an armored armored
[03:44:18.760 --> 03:44:24.520]  gun and when i go back to putin's reaction to this talking about how he was a friend of russia
[03:44:24.520 --> 03:44:31.240]  and everything what we need to understand is just how dangerous and provocative it is to position
[03:44:31.800 --> 03:44:36.920]  missiles on the border of a country and we should understand that in our foreign policy as well
[03:44:36.920 --> 03:44:41.720]  because now we are making the same mistake in aggressing against the russian people in the
[03:44:41.720 --> 03:44:47.160]  ukraine that they did under khrushchev that's the name i can't remember under khrushchev when they
[03:44:47.160 --> 03:44:55.240]  came to uh trying to uh preposition nuclear rockets in cuba as close as it was to florida so
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:59.640]  that was a very provocative thing now we are doing the same sort of thing want to do that in the
[03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:06.440]  ukraine and elsewhere to russia is a very destabilizing thing so we don't want secretary of states
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:12.040]  who do that type of thing we shouldn't line eyes people who do that putin shouldn't line eyes people
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:17.320]  that did that to us and at the same time be concerned about us doing that to him in the ukraine
[03:45:17.320 --> 03:45:22.120]  but let's talk about what ireland's president said oh he survived 600 attempts on his life
[03:45:22.120 --> 03:45:28.440]  after he tried to blow up the world and he was known to his peers in cuba as el commandante
[03:45:28.440 --> 03:45:32.600]  and he became one of the longest serving heads of state in the world well you know what that's not
[03:45:32.600 --> 03:45:37.880]  an accomplishment if you're an authoritarian dictator because to survive for a long period of time
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:42.680]  as a head of state they don't have elections right all these people again as i point out
[03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:47.160]  who are complaining about the electoral college and as they pointed out in this reason article
[03:45:47.160 --> 03:45:53.720]  where they quoted this they said uh you know what you don't have uh peers as an authoritarian
[03:45:53.720 --> 03:46:00.440]  dictator by definition you don't have peers and they could say one could argue that the inequality
[03:46:01.080 --> 03:46:07.000]  that this guy uh and from ireland says he guided the country through a remarkable process of social
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:12.440]  and political change advocating development path that was unique and determinedly independent
[03:46:12.440 --> 03:46:16.600]  well you could say that inequality is less pronounced in cuba than in other latin american
[03:46:16.600 --> 03:46:21.880]  countries because why the entire country has been taken to the least common denominator
[03:46:22.760 --> 03:46:28.440]  impoverished that's the way uh the communists work then you've got european commission president
[03:46:28.440 --> 03:46:33.480]  john claude yunker saying that the world has lost a man who was a hero for many
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:39.800]  these are the globalists who just love fidel castrow he changed the course of the country
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:44.680]  and his influence reached far beyond his legacy will be judged by history yeah it sure will the
[03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:50.200]  uk's socialist leader jeremy korben called him a champion of social justice and his reason
[03:46:50.200 --> 03:46:54.520]  magazine pointed out this must be news to the gays who were herded into labor camps following his
[03:46:54.520 --> 03:46:59.960]  revolution the poets and the musicians who were imprisoned for having counter-revolutionary
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:05.960]  expressions and they exploited workers who in the cruelest of ironies were forbidden from
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:14.840]  unionizing oh just as they did in east germany and then we've got the guy who takes the cake
[03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:21.720]  just in trudeau canada's prime minister called castrow a remarkable leader he said he served
[03:47:21.720 --> 03:47:26.760]  his people for almost half a century what does it mean when a dictator is said to have served
[03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:34.280]  his people i'm reminded of the twilight zone episode we have the alien's land and they said
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:38.360]  we know we come in peace and we're going to give you all this wonderful technology and you know
[03:47:38.360 --> 03:47:43.160]  we're we're your friends and at the very end we're here to serve mankind is what they kept
[03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:48.600]  telling we're here to serve mankind at the end one of the guys gets into the ship and he sees
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:55.560]  a cookbook on how to cook human beings and it was called to serve mankind well that's the kind of
[03:47:55.560 --> 03:48:02.120]  of serving that fidel castrow did for the Cuban people but that's what justin trudeau said he
[03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:07.720]  served his people yeah he did he did he was a controversial figure he said but and he had
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:13.400]  his supporters and his detractors but the Cuban people many had a deep and lasting affection
[03:48:13.400 --> 03:48:19.240]  for el commandante in other words the commander and you know i've seen the same sort of thing
[03:48:19.240 --> 03:48:25.480]  when we went to a china to adopt my daughter i saw the cult of personality that had grown up
[03:48:25.480 --> 03:48:33.160]  around mal understand the same thing happens in russia around stalling people love strong leaders
[03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:36.760]  and they get very nostalgic for when they disappear you know kind of like we do for
[03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:43.240]  abraham lincoln our stalling in this country uh that's my opinion of lincoln but you know
[03:48:43.240 --> 03:48:48.440]  they love these the strong leaders they call them remarkable and so i want to read you some of the
[03:48:48.440 --> 03:48:55.560]  people who trolled justin trudeau on twitter this is also from reason they they pulled out some of
[03:48:55.560 --> 03:49:02.680]  these quotes on trudeau eulogies as the hashtag here's one of them today we mourn painter and animal
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:09.400]  rights activist adolf hitler his deaths also highlights the need for suicide awareness or this
[03:49:09.400 --> 03:49:15.720]  one mr stallins greatest achievement was his eradication of obesity in the ukraine through
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:21.720]  innovative agricultural reforms because of course he was responsible for mass starvation
[03:49:21.720 --> 03:49:27.720]  in the most fertile area of the former soviet union or president snow was a troubled leader but
[03:49:27.720 --> 03:49:33.880]  one who knew the value of lasting entertainment for his districts uh let us remember from the
[03:49:33.880 --> 03:49:39.160]  lord of the rings sauron whose leadership united the disparate peoples across the lands of middle
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:45.960]  earth in a singular purpose or this from star wars while controversial darth vader achieved
[03:49:45.960 --> 03:49:52.120]  great heights in space construction construction and he played a formative role in his son's life
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:58.520]  or also from history i offer my condolences to the family of gingis kong a controversial figure
[03:49:58.520 --> 03:50:03.960]  who also created a bond between east and west another one from fiction if nothing else can
[03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:10.920]  be said for Hannibal lector at least he had great taste in people that's the kind of tags you can
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:17.960]  see at hashtag trudeau eulogies maybe you can come up with some yourself but of course marco
[03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:25.640]  rubio had it right when he said castro is now facing his maker after many attempts by the cia it was
[03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:33.240]  finally old age who got him and uh we have ted cruz giving an abc anchor an earful and a fire
[03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:38.120]  reaction to castros death he says the funeral will be a test for obama are we going to have obama
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:46.520]  and john carrey or maybe uh joe biden all show up and weep for this dictator i wouldn't be surprised
[03:50:46.520 --> 03:50:49.960]  that's the kind of leaders they are stay with us we'll be right back we're going to talk a little

[03:54:05.800 --> 03:54:23.480]  welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night i'm gonna talk we've got some breaking news
[03:54:23.480 --> 03:54:29.240]  about this challenge to the electoral college a challenge to the various states by jill stein
[03:54:29.240 --> 03:54:36.040]  and i'm gonna talk tonight about what this is truly about this really is important because
[03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:41.080]  it's not just an attack on donald trump it's also an attack on the electoral college which is a
[03:54:41.080 --> 03:54:46.440]  firewall to the corruption and the concentration of power that we have in big states you have to
[03:54:46.440 --> 03:54:50.680]  understand that's a very important function of the electoral college if we didn't have that
[03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:55.480]  then as donald trump pointed out he could have campaigned in four or five big states and that
[03:54:55.480 --> 03:55:01.720]  would have been it and you won't have anybody coming to ask for your votes outside of new york
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:07.000]  chicago in la if we didn't have the electoral college as it was he really kind of focused on
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:12.120]  15 states out of 50 and if you want to make it even more concentrated and if you want to give the
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:19.880]  power to rig the election to some of the most corrupt jurisdictions in our country then by all
[03:55:19.880 --> 03:55:24.920]  means go to a direct popular vote so we'll talk about that i've got some breaking news about
[03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:29.960]  jill stein and her challenge it looks like she may have lost i'll tell you why in just a moment
[03:55:29.960 --> 03:55:35.560]  real quickly however i want to remind you of our cyber monday and black friday specials our black

[03:56:29.240 --> 03:56:34.600]  male vitality now the breaking news that i was just informed of by the crew while we were on
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:41.800]  break jill stein needed to get a recount and i think it was three states and if she did that
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:46.680]  they would take it down they take them off because she's looking for a hand recount they would not
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:52.440]  be able to get that done by the time the electoral college meets so those states votes would not be
[03:56:52.440 --> 03:56:55.720]  counted to either candidate which would mean that the best that donald trump would have been able
[03:56:55.720 --> 03:57:03.080]  to get was 260 short of the 270 and then that creates more problems in the election but it would
[03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:07.640]  not really change the outcome it would go then to the house in the senate which are controlled by
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:13.640]  the republican party not likely to have that overturned however she has missed the deadline
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:20.600]  for pennsylvania pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes so that looks like that uh he would have
[03:57:20.600 --> 03:57:27.880]  280 then uh with pennsylvania in the mix and she would not change anything i have to say
[03:57:28.680 --> 03:57:34.920]  when i looked at all this the point of all this is really to delegitimize the election
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:40.760]  this is really the way george soros starts his color revolutions remember they began immediately
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:48.520]  with riots in the streets and part of what he's done in former soviet union countries where he's
[03:57:48.520 --> 03:57:53.000]  done these color revolutions is first of all he does it following an election he tries to
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:58.440]  delegitimize the election and then he tries to paint the person who won the election as authoritarian
[03:57:58.440 --> 03:58:03.400]  that's what's behind all these references to donald trump being hitler calling him a racist
[03:58:03.400 --> 03:58:11.000]  and then he hopes to use those two things to energize the communist student brigade which we
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:17.640]  have plenty of now in united states after our government has run the education system for
