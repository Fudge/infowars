[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.720 --> 00:33.080]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.080 --> 00:42.080]  It's February 11th, 2013, on this Monday Worldwide Transmission. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:42.080 --> 00:49.080]  Thank you so much for joining us today. The news websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com,
[00:49.080 --> 00:56.360]  and streaming video at prisonplanet.tv. Wow, it has been said that much is afoot, and that
[00:56.360 --> 01:04.080]  is certainly the case today. We have a supermassive transmission lined up for you. Holland Vander
[01:04.080 --> 01:12.800]  Neuenhof, filmmaker, researcher, former Marine, one of the filmmakers and researchers in A
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.040]  Noble Lie that I appear in, exposing the inside job that was Oklahoma City, 1995. He's gonna
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.080]  be joining us in the third hour, giving us his breakdown on false flag terror attacks
[01:23.080 --> 01:30.060]  and the attempts to start a civil war in this country, and how that ties into the mass shootings
[01:30.060 --> 01:37.760]  and the reported killing spree by the maniac former police officer there in Southern California.
[01:37.760 --> 01:46.840]  That is all coming up today. Now, when we come back from break, I want to launch into
[01:46.840 --> 01:53.480]  the general news stuff like Federal Employees Union had Obama pay raise proposal simply
[01:53.480 --> 02:03.240]  not enough. As even CNBC reports, there are payroll taxes hitting people making $30,000
[02:03.240 --> 02:05.840]  and up and it's causing a firestorm.
[02:05.840 --> 02:11.120]  And I knew this would happen when Obamacare went in. That's only one of many taxes. It's
[02:11.120 --> 02:16.520]  just one that people can see. The others are hidden up the chain. And it's designed to
[02:16.520 --> 02:23.260]  shut the economy off. And I'm gonna tie that in to the news that I wanted to get to yesterday
[02:23.260 --> 02:24.260]  but didn't.
[02:24.260 --> 02:28.920]  There's even more today on it. So we're gonna cover it at the bottom of the hour in great
[02:28.920 --> 02:35.800]  detail. US citizens brace for austerity impact. China eclipses US's biggest trading nation
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.600]  measured in goods. I wanna break down how this has been done by design. Cuz it'd be
[02:41.600 --> 02:45.920]  great if China was a trading partner and became a free country and they got built up and we
[02:45.920 --> 02:46.920]  got built up.
[02:46.920 --> 02:50.760]  But this is all one sided, not even for the Chinese people. And I wanna break down what
[02:50.760 --> 02:56.520]  globalism and agenda 21 is going to look like under this system. And that video that we
[02:56.520 --> 03:03.320]  posted on infowars.com, World Banker drops bombshell with James Wolfdinson. And we're
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.420]  gonna be going over that today.
[03:07.420 --> 03:13.280]  Because knowing that it's engineered means we can stop it. Cuz the very people who are
[03:13.280 --> 03:21.800]  carrying all of this out love, absolutely love to sit up there and act like, they're
[03:21.800 --> 03:27.080]  gonna help us try to not be completely poor. But yes, get ready for the end of the middle
[03:27.080 --> 03:28.520]  class.
[03:28.520 --> 03:34.480]  It's just something that has to happen, but it's for the greater good. And don't worry
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.800]  if we do everything they say, there'll be a future in the new economy. Just like there
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.360]  would be under the new service economy they told us about in the mid 90s. And then now,
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.160]  of course, that did materialize.
[03:45.160 --> 03:51.080]  And then, naphton gat's gonna be great. And then, the new green economy designed to bankrupt
[03:51.080 --> 03:58.640]  Spain, Portugal, Greece and others, now bankrupting us. Not a green economy, but a fascist, eugenics
[03:58.640 --> 04:04.720]  based economy, socialist and communist on the surface. But when you get to the core
[04:04.720 --> 04:11.160]  of it, corporate, fascist, eugenics, anti-human based. And if people don't get the real political
[04:11.160 --> 04:20.920]  and socioeconomic and cultural and societal names and touchstones, the population can't
[04:20.920 --> 04:23.040]  figure out how the world really works.
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.360]  It's very elementary, it's historical, it's factual, it's overwhelming how in our face
[04:28.360 --> 04:33.240]  it is. But people still buy into the fake spectrum of left right. And there is some
[04:33.240 --> 04:38.840]  reality in left right because that's part of the inner control debate. But the choices
[04:38.840 --> 04:45.280]  are very limited. And the real differences are rhetorical in rhetoric, not in actual
[04:45.280 --> 04:46.280]  policy.
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.600]  So we're gonna be looking at the way out of this today, how to defeat this. The Pope has
[04:51.600 --> 04:55.720]  announced he's going to resign first time in 600 years. That's happened, as I said,
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.120]  a lot is afoot. Stay with us.

[07:02.160 --> 07:07.880]  lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The
[07:07.880 --> 07:13.920]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[07:13.920 --> 07:18.040]  to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness
[07:18.040 --> 07:24.600]  items at infowarshop.com. These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

[08:04.920 --> 08:14.760]  command center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. It
[08:14.760 --> 08:22.000]  is February 11th, 2013 on this Monday edition. Thank you for joining us. You have found at
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  the tip of the spear in the fight worldwide to awaken humanity to the growing technocratic
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  oppressive scientific tyranny that we face. And knowing how much trouble we're in is half
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.440]  the battle so that people realize that we're in a crisis and realize it's orchestrated.
[08:43.440 --> 08:50.080]  That's the good news. There is a way out of this. There is a way out of this. Now obviously
[08:50.080 --> 08:56.000]  today we're going to talk about Pope Benedict to resign at month's end. What's really behind
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  that, all the scandals at the Vatican, but that's not really our top story. We're going
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.680]  to get into anxiety grows as thousands remain stranded in the dark after the huge storm
[09:10.680 --> 09:12.740]  Nemo.
[09:12.740 --> 09:21.160]  We are also going to be looking at the fact that with storm Nemo, Nemo, Nemo, tomato,
[09:21.160 --> 09:28.360]  tomato with storm Nemo that just like with Sandy, FEMA Canton won't help people and puts
[09:28.360 --> 09:35.440]  out signs saying, sorry, closed this week for the storm. It is the height of hypocrisy
[09:35.440 --> 09:42.040]  and bizarreness. We're going to be looking obviously at the situation with growing support
[09:42.040 --> 09:50.640]  for former LA officer accused in killing spree, extremely bizarre that Christopher Dorner,
[09:50.640 --> 09:54.800]  the alleged person doing this is getting massive support.
[09:54.800 --> 10:00.840]  And even mainstream media is saying, well, maybe we should turn our guns in and yeah,
[10:00.840 --> 10:10.400]  the police are bad. He's striking back against evil people. What shooting a cop and his girlfriend
[10:10.400 --> 10:16.000]  and then calling up and teasing the police captain. If you believe any of this, it could
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.160]  be a sign up, but a lot of evidence points towards it being one of the system's killers
[10:22.160 --> 10:25.880]  going haywire because he got kicked out of the cult.
[10:25.880 --> 10:33.560]  We're gonna be breaking all of this and more down today and the use of drones and how that's
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.440]  all being rolled out new cybersecurity legislation that brings in Chinese style net censorship.
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.400]  That's even against CNET saying that not Alex Jones. I mean, this is this is so draconian
[10:44.400 --> 10:50.440]  that even globalist media admits it's draconian and we're gonna look at the economy at the
[10:50.440 --> 10:51.540]  bottom of the hour.
[10:51.540 --> 10:56.720]  This is the top story and there's no doubt the program, the plan that they have for our
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.520]  society. One of the most important articles we've put out in recent memory is now up at
[11:01.520 --> 11:06.960]  prisonplanet.com and its sister news site, infowars.com. And I recommend you get this
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.520]  out to people because if we expose the globalist program and people understand this is premeditated,
[11:12.520 --> 11:18.200]  organized, engineered, we have a really good chance of turning this around.
[11:18.200 --> 11:25.000]  And that is why the banking elite want riots in America, Civil War II, the economic imperative
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.800]  for mass social unrest. And the article goes through how the globalist plan to engineer
[11:32.800 --> 11:41.240]  this in their own words and how it's been done in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa,
[11:41.240 --> 11:44.640]  and is now going to be carried out in the United States.
[11:44.640 --> 11:52.960]  This has been done four times since the 1960s in Mexico. This is an exact program and plan
[11:52.960 --> 12:03.960]  to impoverish you. And we're going to be going over all of this today and tying it into CNBC,
[12:03.960 --> 12:11.440]  US citizens' brace for austerity impact. EU leaders strike deal on long term austerity
[12:11.440 --> 12:17.240]  budget. Your taxes are raised, your pay is cut. You're told it's your debt when 90 plus
[12:17.240 --> 12:21.160]  percent of it is derivatives, your criminal government run by the six mega banks assigned
[12:21.160 --> 12:22.160]  on to.
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.680]  In address, president will focus on middle class. It's like if someone was in freezing
[12:26.680 --> 12:29.400]  cold water in the North Atlantic and they come up to a boat or trying to go up the ladder
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.920]  and somebody's pushing their head out of the water going, let me help you again. Let me.
[12:33.920 --> 12:37.280]  But you still struggle and grab their arms. They pull a hammer out and whack it in your
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.820]  head, blood sprays, and they go, I'm helping him. I'm helping. Or like if you were smothering
[12:42.820 --> 12:44.800]  a small child with a pillow.
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.520]  Somebody walks in, what are you doing? I'm helping him go to sleep forever. I mean, it's
[12:49.520 --> 12:59.000]  so sick. In address, president will focus on the middle class. Just like the healthcare
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.120]  was gonna give you free health care, raises taxes on every worker in America, their payroll.
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.000]  That's just one of over 14 taxes in it.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.200]  Makes me sick. See, I've learned to do a fake laugh because I do a sick laugh that keeps
[13:16.200 --> 13:22.220]  me from raging. And so that's why I do that, folks. That is a steam valve. That is a steam
[13:22.220 --> 13:23.220]  valve, okay?
[13:23.220 --> 13:27.800]  Because for my health, I cannot get angry. And a lot of people say, hey, the public's
[13:27.800 --> 13:32.600]  that dumb, let them. That argument is just really screwed up. Well, the public's dumb,
[13:32.600 --> 13:36.560]  let them be slaves. And that's always said by people that know the scam and don't wanna
[13:36.560 --> 13:39.680]  admit they're being screwed as well.
[13:39.680 --> 13:45.600]  Less than 1% of people stand to gain from this, okay? You talk about the upper 2%, it's
[13:45.600 --> 13:53.520]  the top 10th of 1%. And then there's a tiny, there's less than 20 families. 20 families,
[13:53.520 --> 14:00.440]  let's say 1,000 people, roughly. That's what Rothkopf estimates, about 1,000 owners, 6,000
[14:00.440 --> 14:04.180]  super gophers, the head of the Kissinger Group for the Council on Foreign Relations.
[14:04.180 --> 14:08.080]  Also put in his book, Superclass, but one of their own internal reports. What is 1,000
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.600]  divided into 7.5 billion? What's the percentage on that, guys? Do that for me in a calculator.
[14:13.600 --> 14:17.680]  1,000 divided into 7.5 billion, roughly the Earth's population.
[14:17.680 --> 14:25.280]  Okay, so they're going to the unwashed masses who would sell their souls for professional
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.460]  wrestling and monster trucks. Hey, I like monster trucks and professional wrestling.
[14:29.460 --> 14:33.840]  It's a lot of fun, but it's not real. Well, the monster trucks are. Those things do double
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.520]  backflips now, have you seen that? I actually went to a monster truck deal this weekend,
[14:37.520 --> 14:39.520]  it was pretty fun, but side issue.
[14:39.520 --> 14:45.480]  I wanna go to one of the big tracks so they can really get going fast cuz it was in the
[14:45.480 --> 14:48.800]  Travis County Convention Center and they really couldn't get going. It wasn't what I'd seen
[14:48.800 --> 14:54.960]  online. It was still okay, but it wasn't like double backflips and stuff and people dying.
[14:54.960 --> 15:01.400]  It's pretty gladiatorial, actually, those guys get really hurt doing it. Sorry, folks,
[15:01.400 --> 15:02.400]  I'm digressing here.
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.680]  We're gonna be breaking all this down at the bottom of the hour. Subprime is back, will
[15:07.680 --> 15:14.740]  this end badly? Why do they mail credit cards to poor people, but not to people that are
[15:14.740 --> 15:19.680]  doing well? If you're poor, you get credit cards weekly in the mail, if you're not, you
[15:19.680 --> 15:22.720]  don't get credit cards in the mail.
[15:22.720 --> 15:30.920]  Why is that? Because it's all just fiat made up, they want you as a debt slave. Subprime
[15:30.920 --> 15:37.440]  is back, will this end badly? Well, no, it'll end in tens of trillions more than bailed
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.360]  out by the taxpayers, that's how it works.
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.480]  Third payroll tax pinches those who earned the least. Jack Andrews and his wife get to
[15:46.480 --> 15:54.160]  go out one time a month to have a nice dinner, one time a month. And now because of the payroll
[15:54.160 --> 16:03.420]  tax, taking $30 out of her paycheck, she makes 22,000 a year, and I guess he makes what 40.
[16:03.420 --> 16:09.960]  And so that's $800 less a year, they're gonna get the rich guys. Yeah, the rich guys run
[16:09.960 --> 16:16.840]  things, suckers, suckers. And again, Obama wasn't even elected, they ran a dead political
[16:16.840 --> 16:18.180]  candidate against him.
[16:18.180 --> 16:23.340]  He staged the whole thing, he stood down, he put out libertarian conservative rhetoric
[16:23.340 --> 16:28.480]  just so he could be defeated in the mock fight and discredited. And we could have a mandate
[16:28.480 --> 16:35.560]  for world government and socialism and crony capitalism, a total hoax. Congress has a 9%
[16:35.560 --> 16:39.240]  approval rating, but you're hearing, hey, there's a mandate to end the family.
[16:39.240 --> 16:45.120]  There's a mandate to teach the Boy Scouts how to have gay sex when they're five years
[16:45.120 --> 16:51.400]  old, the Cub Scouts and people. Whether you are a liberal or a conservative when it comes
[16:51.400 --> 16:57.560]  to sexual stuff, they try to get us obsessed over all day as a political football distraction.
[16:57.560 --> 17:04.760]  No children should be taught anything sexual, period, period. And this is all part of the
[17:04.760 --> 17:10.840]  pedophile state wanting to destroy our youth. But again, I digress. Restored payroll tax
[17:10.840 --> 17:12.640]  pinches those who earn the leash.
[17:12.640 --> 17:16.600]  I told you a couple years ago that was in the Obama bill. It's like, be quiet conspiracy
[17:16.600 --> 17:22.440]  theorists, there are no death panels. Really, Tom Daschle, who helped write it off of what
[17:22.440 --> 17:27.300]  the insurance companies wrote for Romney to get through in Massachusetts, said there were
[17:27.300 --> 17:28.300]  death panels.
[17:28.300 --> 17:32.320]  Well, they were in there. It's federal panels, they don't call them that, but they decide
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.760]  what type of care you get. And then they now say, yeah, we're gonna kill people. So again,
[17:36.760 --> 17:43.480]  write about that, and write about a payroll tax increase for everybody. Depending on how
[17:43.480 --> 17:47.440]  the actuaries and the government breakdown works, I was saying 30,000, it turns out you
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.520]  can make $22,000 a year.
[17:52.520 --> 18:00.080]  But then they added into what your spouse makes 60,000, 40 and 20, 60,000. So you're
[18:00.080 --> 18:03.960]  putting 60,000 together, and they go, okay, we're gonna raise both your payroll taxes.
[18:03.960 --> 18:12.080]  I mean, this is so sick. This is so sick. And it hurts me. It hurts me that the globalists
[18:12.080 --> 18:18.520]  have unlimited fiat money. They put 85 billion into a black hole just to burn it up, just
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.360]  to hurt the economy, just to shut things down to make their fiat worth more.
[18:22.360 --> 18:27.160]  They've got to destroy capital to make their capital worth more, you see. And it's even
[18:27.160 --> 18:32.460]  more complex than that. And to know that they're taking money out of people that are living
[18:32.460 --> 18:40.160]  hand to mouth, so they can put 85 billion into a literal digital incinerator. And it's
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.760]  all funny, and they all write white papers and IMF and World Bank plans.
[18:43.760 --> 18:47.440]  It's linked in Paul Watson's article today that I helped write. It's Paul Watson, Alex
[18:47.440 --> 18:53.400]  Jones' article, technically. The point is, is that you sit here and you know it and you
[18:53.400 --> 18:57.640]  know, watch it. And the Obama people, four years ago, they voted for him and it felt
[18:57.640 --> 18:58.640]  real good.
[18:58.640 --> 19:03.120]  Cuz McCain, again, was another establishment guy. That's how they fixed the whole deal.
[19:03.120 --> 19:06.240]  And they kinda, ooh, we're gonna be rich, ooh, everything's gonna turn around, ooh,
[19:06.240 --> 19:09.600]  you lost. And I'm like, no, no, they're both New World Order, you're gonna be gamed, you're
[19:09.600 --> 19:13.560]  gonna be scammed. And then they figured out they didn't get free goodies and life got
[19:13.560 --> 19:14.560]  worse.
[19:14.560 --> 19:18.200]  So they kinda were getting down on Obama. But in the rah-rah left versus right Republican
[19:18.200 --> 19:24.080]  Democrat, they're still by about 25% of the population that voted for Obama. Cuz you got
[19:24.080 --> 19:27.020]  about half the population that voted, about a little more than half of them reportedly
[19:27.020 --> 19:31.720]  voted for Obama. So 27, 30%, depending on how you look at it, let's just round up.
[19:31.720 --> 19:37.160]  30% of the country votes for Obama. And they're walking around still, even as their payroll
[19:37.160 --> 19:43.960]  tax goes up, just going, look, I'm a winner now, in a euphoria of suckers. A euphoria
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.040]  like somebody that gets a letter saying you just won a million dollar sweepstakes just
[19:48.040 --> 19:49.480]  fill this out and send it in.
[19:49.480 --> 19:55.120]  They don't read the five page contract that says that if they're chosen they win it. And
[19:55.120 --> 19:58.600]  they're just like, no, I'm a millionaire. You're like, no, you're not. It's the same
[19:58.600 --> 20:00.560]  thing with the Nigerian emails.
[20:00.560 --> 20:05.260]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[20:05.260 --> 20:09.240]  through the year. From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[20:09.240 --> 20:12.780]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[20:12.780 --> 20:16.620]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear

[20:25.080 --> 20:29.240]  almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[20:29.240 --> 20:31.140]  to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[20:31.140 --> 20:35.400]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late. Heed

[24:03.700 --> 24:11.240]  presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind. Alright, here's some
[24:11.240 --> 24:18.360]  of the headlines up at Infowars.com. I just mentioned the top headline, LinkedIn Red.
[24:18.360 --> 24:25.800]  Why the banking elite want riots in America. The plan for Civil War 2 becomes clearer and
[24:25.800 --> 24:30.920]  clearer with Obama as Lincoln, our savior. Congress prepares to kill the Sixth Amendment
[24:30.920 --> 24:40.120]  with secret drone court. Ah, secret drone court to kill you. Man sues TSA for 5 million
[24:40.120 --> 24:44.120]  following peanut butter arrest. They thought the oil on the top of the peanut butter was
[24:44.120 --> 24:49.160]  a terror bomb. When you find Al-Qaeda working for the globalist in Libya and Syria running
[24:49.160 --> 24:52.480]  things, you wouldn't find them actually in the peanut butter there. But it's all about
[24:52.480 --> 24:57.880]  how we're the suspects and bad. Twitter explodes with fears of armed drone strikes targeting
[24:57.880 --> 25:02.240]  Tris Dorner. Yeah, they're not worried about America becoming a police state New World
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.360]  Order with the government judge, jury and executioner run by foreign banks. They're
[25:06.360 --> 25:13.160]  worried about their precious Chris Dorner. In fact, I'm getting criticism that A, this
[25:13.160 --> 25:19.360]  is a stage government event and I should just out of hand say it staged. And B, no, Chris
[25:19.360 --> 25:25.240]  Dorner is a hero. Yeah, I mean, if he's behind this, which a lot of evidence points towards
[25:25.240 --> 25:33.980]  it, then yeah, killing people that you don't even know or shooting people's daughters just
[25:33.980 --> 25:39.200]  to get at them. That's real classy, that's real classy.
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.560]  And of course, he's an anti-gun guy and an Obama supporter who thinks only the government
[25:43.560 --> 25:51.040]  should have the guns. See, I have guns to protect myself from people like him. So just
[25:51.040 --> 25:57.560]  absolutely amazing. Twitter explodes with fears of armed drones strikes targeting Chris
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.060]  Dorner. That's just some of what we've got.
[26:01.060 --> 26:05.720]  Argentina's regime leader freezes food prices, pushes the country towards food shortages
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.000]  and riots. We're gonna be getting into the economy and more. Here's what I'm gonna do.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.940]  You know what? I wanna go to your phone calls and then at the second segment like eight
[26:13.940 --> 26:18.920]  after next hour, we're gonna change that clock soon back to the regular clock.
[26:18.920 --> 26:23.660]  It was my cockamamie thing 14, 15 years ago, not liking the news that stations were putting
[26:23.660 --> 26:28.120]  out to just do a five minute segment, have a three minute break and come in at eight
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.000]  after. And we gotta work it out with all the affiliates, but I'm sure they're gonna like
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  In the next few months, we're gonna go to the same clock we've got, except we're gonna
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.480]  come out at six after. And then I'll still do a little three minute segment there if
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.560]  stations want it, but that way we can adjust the clocks. We've had a lot of requests to
[26:44.560 --> 26:50.640]  do that and I'll be honest with you, I'm planning a lot of other things down the road like radio
[26:50.640 --> 26:52.840]  news 24 seven.
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.360]  But that's after we launched the TV show on the satellite and the rest of it the next
[26:57.360 --> 27:02.060]  few months. So we're definitely busting our hind ends around here. That's why you've been
[27:02.060 --> 27:06.920]  seeing the nightly news live, not as heavily produced, because we can do it quicker and
[27:06.920 --> 27:09.460]  easier but also more up to date when it's live.
[27:09.460 --> 27:14.440]  It will be generally taped to air an hour before it goes live once we're officially
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.680]  putting it out at seven o'clock central. So by the way, be part of this revolution against
[27:19.680 --> 27:27.280]  tyranny. If you're not a subscriber to info wars news.com or prisonplanet.tv as it's been
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.680]  for 10 years, then you need to go there.
[27:30.680 --> 27:39.760]  One membership 595 a month is really 11 memberships, your membership and 10 others. And you just
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.200]  create a unique username and passcode and then share that with friends and family. In
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.760]  fact, I think you can share it with about 20, 30 people, cuz the chances of all 30 of
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.040]  them tuning in every night at seven o'clock are slim to none.
[27:52.040 --> 27:56.560]  And if you do tune in and you can't log on because more than 11 people logged on, just
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.280]  get another membership. It's 595 a month, it's paying for the bandwidth. My goal is
[28:01.280 --> 28:06.200]  to reach people. And we get censored on the YouTube, AM and FM's come and go, all this
[28:06.200 --> 28:07.520]  stuff happens.
[28:07.520 --> 28:13.020]  This is our platform with all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, the expanded extras,
[28:13.020 --> 28:18.640]  the rant section. And the site just gets better and better. I think it will, was it nine or
[28:18.640 --> 28:23.480]  ten years in April? I can't remember, I gotta call Paul Watson, he knows. The point is there's
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.520]  17 years of material up there on the site, but it's been around I guess since what, 2002,
[28:28.520 --> 28:29.860]  so do the math.
[28:29.860 --> 28:35.800]  But it's all there, ladies and gentlemen, prisonplanet.tv. Go there and you're signing

[33:36.780 --> 33:41.200]  I would not be fighting as hard if we just had an old fashioned corruption where some
[33:41.200 --> 33:45.680]  corrupt interests wanted to run things but weren't so incredibly predatory. They are
[33:45.680 --> 33:52.520]  engaging in an organized economy designed to impoverish us and that's not even a tool
[33:52.520 --> 33:58.360]  of their end game. Okay, that's just to get us to the end game. They want us poor under
[33:58.360 --> 34:04.640]  their control so they can then carry out the orderly eugenics operations.
[34:04.640 --> 34:09.020]  You want to know the mindset of the globalist. I've watched 12 monkeys with Brad Pitt and
[34:09.020 --> 34:19.240]  Bruce Willis last night with my wife. And when you see the top by biologists slash biochemist
[34:19.240 --> 34:25.000]  in there working on zoological viruses in one of his lab techs, who is a eugenicist
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.120]  gets the weapon and goes and basically releases it and kills 99% of the world population.
[34:31.120 --> 34:37.200]  You have to understand movies like that are based on what they're really planning. In
[34:37.200 --> 34:46.360]  the film, a PETA type person works in a bio weapons lab, a bio research lab, a genetics
[34:46.360 --> 34:53.760]  lab and gets a virus that kills all the humans that comes in contact with.
[34:53.760 --> 35:07.800]  There are different poxes out there that have been manipulated in their genetic RNA to kill
[35:07.800 --> 35:14.800]  over 90%. I'm being conservative there. Some of these mousepox reportedly kill about 98%
[35:14.800 --> 35:19.120]  of the humans they come in contact with in animal studies. They can design it for whatever
[35:19.120 --> 35:24.320]  mammal they want. It's called a mousepox. But they can design it for whatever mammal
[35:24.320 --> 35:35.200]  they want in a small laboratory with a couple $100,000 with a proper biologist, virologist
[35:35.200 --> 35:36.500]  can develop this.
[35:36.500 --> 35:44.620]  And it's been published by Australian universities, by US universities and by European universities.
[35:44.620 --> 35:51.320]  And to the FBI's credit a few years ago, they tried to block the publishing of this information.
[35:51.320 --> 35:59.840]  And the argument is no, publish it so researchers can find cures for it. You need to understand
[35:59.840 --> 36:04.400]  something, they want this stuff to just get out on its own so they can claim plausible
[36:04.400 --> 36:05.640]  deniability.
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.600]  They're building level four bio weapons labs all over the United States in the middle of
[36:09.600 --> 36:16.960]  major cities. And I want you to understand that it's not, Alex, you saw a movie and you're
[36:16.960 --> 36:25.320]  crazy. I literally on the bookshelves at this office have over 100 books written by the
[36:25.320 --> 36:31.400]  globalist where they've said they're going to develop super viruses and kill 90% of us
[36:31.400 --> 36:32.400]  at least.
[36:32.400 --> 36:37.720]  The UN numbers are 80%. When you get higher up reports, it's 90% and you get into deeper
[36:37.720 --> 36:43.280]  reports, they debate whether all humans should be killed period. And it is the ultimate power
[36:43.280 --> 36:49.840]  tripping behavior. And when we start the next hour, I'm going to get into how they wanna
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.040]  bring an economic collapse, the new world they're going to set up after that, and how
[36:55.040 --> 36:56.400]  we can stop them.
[36:56.400 --> 37:01.120]  But you need to understand we've got a shot at beating them. Since I've been covering
[37:01.120 --> 37:09.600]  this the last 15 years since I really woke up to the eugenics, I have seen this go from
[37:09.600 --> 37:16.560]  almost no one knowing it, no one being aware of it. Except for those involved in it and
[37:16.560 --> 37:23.360]  the technocratic class and their wanna be followers to 20, 30% of people being aware
[37:23.360 --> 37:24.820]  of the program.
[37:24.820 --> 37:29.440]  And now if we just educate one more person and then they educate one more person, that's
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.880]  90%. And then as the globalists try to implement all this, they're going to have problems.
[37:35.880 --> 37:42.060]  They're gonna have serious problems. We've got a chance to beat this. We've got a very
[37:42.060 --> 37:49.360]  good chance to beat this. But it's going to take people realizing that you know what,
[37:49.360 --> 37:52.680]  Alex Jones was right, we better go look at his films.
[37:52.680 --> 37:56.600]  We better go listen to his show. We better go check the claims he's making. What is the
[37:56.600 --> 38:05.400]  endgame.com is a good place to start. Online bibliography for my film, Endgame Blueprint
[38:05.400 --> 38:11.360]  for Global Enslavement. They Want You Dead is the tagline for the film. For the new world
[38:11.360 --> 38:14.720]  order, world government is just the beginning.
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.920]  Once their planetary regime is in place, the orderly experimentation of at least 80% of
[38:19.920 --> 38:27.680]  the population is the prime, prime directive. In fact, we've been trying to do the math
[38:27.680 --> 38:35.520]  of 7.5 billion divided by 1000 people and it's something like 0.0000004, but they're
[38:35.520 --> 38:37.720]  still in there crunching it.
[38:37.720 --> 38:43.040]  But we'll try to get you those actual numbers. So they talk about the 2%. The elite want
[38:43.040 --> 38:49.500]  the general public to rob the 99.9% of the 2% the nouveau riche because the globalists
[38:49.500 --> 38:54.280]  have trouble controlling new wealth and where it goes and new ideas show that it is that
[38:54.280 --> 39:09.400]  0.0000. Okay, so it's 0.733333331333. Okay, we'll get it all written up and show me how
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.400]  you did it.
[39:10.400 --> 39:16.200]  Thank you and then we'll, cuz earlier it was coming out to a basic 000004 but you said
[39:16.200 --> 39:20.080]  no, that's not exactly right. Let me check it. And so why don't you write up if you can
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.040]  CJ, cuz you're decent at math better than I am. Write up how you came up with the equation,
[39:24.040 --> 39:25.240]  show the site where you did it.
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.880]  The point is there's 1000 members of the less than 20 families, that's a high number. There's
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.380]  6000 super gophers, this is the Kissinger group's own analysis. This is their analysis
[39:35.380 --> 39:41.880]  of themselves in the book Superclass. And so there's 1000 people who've mainly gotten
[39:41.880 --> 39:47.480]  their wealth out of monopolies and military force and tyranny. And they're archenemies
[39:47.480 --> 39:50.820]  of independence and they think the world is theirs.
[39:50.820 --> 39:54.060]  And they're eugenicist and they got where they are cuz they're psychopaths and they
[39:54.060 --> 39:59.620]  have a hatred of humanity. And they're planning on dropping the hammer and look, I know modern
[39:59.620 --> 40:06.200]  society is ugly. I know there's a lot of ugliness and a lot of lethargy and patheticness and
[40:06.200 --> 40:12.420]  the public's being soft killed and doesn't even care. Listen, I care and I don't like
[40:12.420 --> 40:14.080]  who these elitists are.
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.720]  I mean, you certainly are uglier than the public. I mean, I'll say that. You're wicked,
[40:19.720 --> 40:24.680]  you're physically more ugly, you act horrible, you aggressively attack beautiful smart people
[40:24.680 --> 40:28.100]  cuz you're threatened by it. It'd be bad enough if they were gonna kill everybody except the
[40:28.100 --> 40:34.560]  really intelligent and beautiful. I would be against that. But the globalist hate the
[40:34.560 --> 40:38.140]  smart and intelligent and good looking and dynamic, okay?
[40:38.140 --> 40:42.240]  Because they are twisted, they're like cancer. They're in power because they don't have empathy
[40:42.240 --> 40:45.120]  and don't care and are willing to be in power. And they think that gives them a right to
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.180]  total power. Well, I say, and I've seen the evidence and the history of it, you people,
[40:50.180 --> 40:52.520]  if anybody needs to die, it needs to be you.
[40:52.520 --> 40:59.300]  If anybody needs to die, it's you, okay? You want us dead, you go first. I gotta lay down
[40:59.300 --> 41:06.160]  and die so you and yours can have the whole future and all of it. You're gonna get a fight.
[41:06.160 --> 41:10.480]  You're gonna get a fight. And listen, the transmission has been issued. You think you're
[41:10.480 --> 41:16.280]  gonna put neural reprogramming nanotech viruses in the vaccines that go in and attack the
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.760]  cortex and make people emotionless zombies?
[41:20.760 --> 41:25.240]  You think that's gonna work on everybody? You think you're not going to end up being
[41:25.240 --> 41:33.000]  infected by that? You are going to destroy yourselves and you might destroy us with you.
[41:33.000 --> 41:40.320]  Stop now, stop now, stop now, stop now. I'm gonna give the number out and take some calls
[41:40.320 --> 41:41.320]  right now.
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.360]  Then I'll get into the economy and I'll get into the gun grabbing and the reported Obama
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.600]  supporter now calling up and taunting people whose daughters they've killed. It just shows
[41:50.600 --> 41:56.120]  why we have guns to protect ourselves from crazy people in government like this individual
[41:56.120 --> 41:59.480]  Chris Dorner, who's now being praised by the left.
[41:59.480 --> 42:08.060]  Cuz they're not leftists, they're eugenicist, death loving, sicko control freaks. They're
[42:08.060 --> 42:13.460]  gibbering nobodies who absolutely, have you ever been around an authoritarian liberal
[42:13.460 --> 42:18.200]  and you look good, your wife looks good, your kids look good, you look healthy, you're happy.
[42:18.200 --> 42:25.960]  They get upset by that, you see, they get upset by that. And they're the people that
[42:25.960 --> 42:28.040]  get upset by success.
[42:28.040 --> 42:30.980]  They're the people that don't like the fact you're successful. They're the people that
[42:30.980 --> 42:35.260]  don't like the fact that you're happy. They're the people that tell us we're all screwed
[42:35.260 --> 42:39.720]  up because they want to make us like they are. Listen, I'm not screwed up, you understand
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.360]  that? I enjoy my life, you understand that?
[42:43.360 --> 42:49.360]  Only thing I don't enjoy is having to look at what you're doing. I mean, I see this kaleidoscope
[42:49.360 --> 42:55.360]  of beauty and magic and wonderment all around me. And then I see you, there's this big ocean,
[42:55.360 --> 43:04.440]  this delicious kaleidoscope ocean to swim in of reality. And then I see you floating
[43:04.440 --> 43:08.200]  by big, ugly, disgusting turds.
[43:08.200 --> 43:13.640]  And I just don't like you. And so I wanna tell you, I've seen who's ugly, I've seen
[43:13.640 --> 43:21.280]  who's got the, I mean, your spirit's ugly. And no amount of jet copters and palaces on
[43:21.280 --> 43:27.920]  top mountains, and no amount of all the weird stuff you're into is gonna ever make you not
[43:27.920 --> 43:29.160]  be what you are.
[43:29.160 --> 43:34.840]  Of your father, the stinking loser black snake of the New World Order, okay? I just wanna
[43:34.840 --> 43:43.680]  get that through your head. I wanna get that through your head. I want you to translate
[43:43.680 --> 43:48.920]  that right through to your soul and understand you're a loser. You are a loser from the foundation
[43:48.920 --> 43:49.920]  of the Earth.
[43:49.920 --> 43:56.160]  You are a failure. I want you to understand, I want you to know I see you. I see you and
[43:56.160 --> 44:02.000]  I'm not afraid of you. And I know you don't like that. Because I realize this whole planet
[44:02.000 --> 44:08.720]  and everything in it is only a testing grid, a game board to where we can have our free
[44:08.720 --> 44:13.520]  will tested.
[44:13.520 --> 44:19.220]  And I know what matters is my heart, not the Pharisees arguing over who the real Jesus
[44:19.220 --> 44:24.340]  is and you're not right and this person's not right. I know my heart's right. I know
[44:24.340 --> 44:30.900]  I love liberty and good and decency and honor and I want the innocent to be able to succeed
[44:30.900 --> 44:32.240]  and I love innocence.
[44:32.240 --> 44:39.880]  And I know because my heart is going in the right direction that we are going to have
[44:39.880 --> 44:44.520]  a better future if we believe it and take that promise in our hands. And enough preaching,
[44:44.520 --> 44:48.880]  the toll free number to join us, the toll free number to join us for first time callers
[44:48.880 --> 44:58.880]  800-259-9231.
[44:58.880 --> 45:05.160]  Hey, again, after I take some phone calls, when I start the next hour, I will get into
[45:05.160 --> 45:11.160]  the incredible, undeniable, it's terrible to know I've been right, with all the writing
[45:11.160 --> 45:16.040]  on the wall. Now it's like you hear a noise off the distance, is that a train blowing
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.480]  its whistle 20 miles away and then five minutes later you hear it again, sounds a little bit
[45:21.480 --> 45:22.480]  closer.
[45:22.480 --> 45:26.300]  Yeah, I think that's a train. You hear it the next time, that's a train for sure. Now
[45:26.300 --> 45:30.320]  you see it's light up ahead, it's two miles away. Now it's coming up to your stop blowing
[45:30.320 --> 45:39.120]  the whistle. Well, death and hell rides on that train and now it's coming to our stop.
[45:39.120 --> 45:45.440]  There's no doubt I was right about the train coming. I heard it a long way off because
[45:45.440 --> 45:47.680]  I'd studied history and I knew the signs.
[45:47.680 --> 45:53.240]  Let me tell you, when you go to an urban warfare drill and you watch Marines training to kill
[45:53.240 --> 45:57.120]  people wearing overalls and John Deere hats, screaming, I'm an American, I have a right
[45:57.120 --> 46:04.200]  to a Second Amendment, and the Marines practice killing them. You know you're in deep trouble
[46:04.200 --> 46:12.360]  and you come and warn everybody you can and the media says, that's fake video.
[46:12.360 --> 46:17.280]  Then you know you're in deep trouble and you get video of Boy Scouts training to tell the
[46:17.280 --> 46:26.720]  Army and the Marines what's in mommy and daddy's house. I told you about that in 1998, showed
[46:26.720 --> 46:31.440]  you video, Hebron, Maryland, other areas. Now you can read the New York Times and read
[46:31.440 --> 46:34.280]  about Boy Scouts training for gun confiscation.
[46:34.280 --> 46:39.600]  It's like Paul Craig Roberts wrote last week, it happened here. People say it can't happen
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.440]  here, can't happen in America, it happened, it happened. We're already in deep, deep,
[46:44.440 --> 46:52.340]  deep trouble, folks. 800-25-99231, I'll get into the economy, I'll get into the latest
[46:52.340 --> 46:54.080]  on the shooter as it breaks.
[46:54.080 --> 46:58.440]  I'll get into the Pope and I'll get into the federal employees getting their raises and
[46:58.440 --> 47:02.560]  Israel strikes in Syria might be first in Syria. Just hope for our safety, we're gonna
[47:02.560 --> 47:06.000]  bomb you cuz the rebels might get weapons, the rebels our government put in there. I
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.840]  mean, totally immoral, people go, well, hey, that's how you win.
[47:09.840 --> 47:14.000]  You're not part of the winning team, you're not part of the New World Order. Hey, we're
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.480]  gonna get the oil. Yeah, the mega banks are gonna shut off the oil in Iraq and jack up
[47:18.480 --> 47:23.960]  the prices. See, you think of getting oil like you go and rob them and get their oil
[47:23.960 --> 47:25.400]  and you get cheaper oil.
[47:25.400 --> 47:30.560]  You get cheaper oil after the Iraq war? No, you got more expensive. See, you're not on
[47:30.560 --> 47:36.800]  the team, you can fantasize you're on the team. If you're a bureaucrat, a cop, FBI,
[47:36.800 --> 47:43.880]  school teacher, whatever. If you're not bucking the system, you're a fool and a chump. You
[47:43.880 --> 47:51.460]  like being a chump? Okay, great. You understand, you're not on the winning team with the New
[47:51.460 --> 47:52.460]  World Order.
[47:52.460 --> 48:04.840]  And even if you were in the inner circle, the 0.00000133333, you've conned yourself
[48:04.840 --> 48:10.840]  as well. You think this cold blooded system is gonna give you final immortality in the
[48:10.840 --> 48:19.440]  cybernetic interfaces? You think you're going to ascend to the stars? I guarantee you, the
[48:19.440 --> 48:23.880]  creator of the universe is going to be standing blocking your way.
[48:23.880 --> 48:29.820]  When it was all there waiting for you to begin with in your spirit, you had everything right
[48:29.820 --> 48:37.160]  there always ready for you. But you were of your father, the devil who comes to kill,
[48:37.160 --> 48:44.640]  steal and destroy. The devil can be an angel of light. Quoting scripture, it can be a great
[48:44.640 --> 48:52.040]  black serpent or a red dragon. But the devil kills, the devil destroys, the devil deceives
[48:52.040 --> 48:55.700]  because the devil is throwing a temper tantrum.
[48:55.700 --> 49:02.900]  The devil is a cancer in the matrix of creation. The devil does not eliminate. The devil says
[49:02.900 --> 49:08.240]  he eliminates, God eliminates. The devil has taken all of God's symbols and counterfeited
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.660]  them for you can't even recognize God's symbols. You think the devil's God because he's masquerading
[49:14.660 --> 49:18.280]  as God. The devil is never a maker.
[49:18.280 --> 49:25.520]  The less that you give, you're a taker. Let's go ahead and take some phone calls here. Mike
[49:25.520 --> 49:33.160]  Ian, Oregon, you're on the air. Welcome. Yeah, what's up, Alex? Worldwide broadcast, my friend.
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.560]  How's it going, brother? Pretty good. What's your point?
[49:37.560 --> 49:44.000]  I was watching your documentary America Destroyed by Design and I had actually shed some light
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.240]  on the subject. Me and my grandparents and a part of our family owned some beautiful
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.920]  property out in Eastern Oregon. And we went out there to do some restoration and we caught
[49:53.920 --> 50:01.040]  the Forest Service moving the property stakes to just butcher up property, cut down trees,
[50:01.040 --> 50:02.040]  do whatever.
[50:02.040 --> 50:05.840]  And when we took them to court, they basically laughed at us and told us they're just going
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.760]  to wait till my grandma basically died or sucked their drive, all our savings. And then
[50:10.760 --> 50:15.480]  they were going to take the property anyways. No, they by and large hire people who don't
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.800]  want you there. I told people this in that film 15 years ago, and now they're saying
[50:19.800 --> 50:24.400]  can't swim on these East Coast beaches for the earth. Can't go now. First can't drive
[50:24.400 --> 50:26.240]  now can't walk into the areas.
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.760]  And they're grabbing buffer zones. I've seen in federal court in Denver where they took
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.960]  people's family property under admiralty. You're absolutely right, Mike. You had a point
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.920]  on Chris Dorner, the Chris Dorner thing. I thought that that was they're making him a
[50:41.920 --> 50:47.320]  celebrity. But people like Terrence Yankee, who's a real hero, they don't want to promote
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.080]  or do anything about that. That's one of the greatest unsolved murder mysteries of our
[50:51.080 --> 50:54.120]  time. That's right. A black police officer cop of the year saved a bunch of people in
[50:54.120 --> 50:58.960]  Oklahoma City murdered by the feds because he knew they planted bombs in the building.

[53:03.600 --> 53:09.960]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985 President Ronald Reagan
[53:09.960 --> 53:14.080]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[53:14.080 --> 53:19.640]  President could obtain this world class healer. Now 27 years later Carnivora capsules are
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.200]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[53:39.480 --> 53:49.160]  don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com

[53:57.400 --> 54:04.400]  it's the only one you've got.
[54:04.400 --> 54:24.040]  You can look at the look and the eyes of many of these government bureaucrats. You can see
[54:24.040 --> 54:33.360]  the ridiculous power trips they're on. But all it is is they're putting on the office
[54:33.360 --> 54:40.000]  of the corrupt government. You know there's a viral video of a young lady flipping off
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.360]  the judge and acting totally stupid and everybody gets off on looking at how dumbed down she
[54:44.360 --> 54:47.960]  is. I'm going to play it the next hour it's been seen I don't know 15 million times on
[54:47.960 --> 54:48.960]  YouTube.
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.560]  But when you look at the poor woman she's just a product of the culture. You know when
[54:53.560 --> 54:59.120]  I got a lot of money like you know this rapper and that rapper and the judge is just reveling
[54:59.120 --> 55:03.280]  in the fact that she doesn't know her head from the hole in the ground and the argument
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.280]  is well this will teach her but she's in there to begin with for some petty charge. It's
[55:08.280 --> 55:13.400]  just the biggest prison population in the world and they set it up to get you on the
[55:13.400 --> 55:18.240]  drugs to get you in the system so then a judge can call himself honorable.
[55:18.240 --> 55:22.200]  These aren't honorable judges most of them greasing the skids to destroy the Bill of
[55:22.200 --> 55:29.840]  Rights and Constitution they're dishonorable they're disreputable they're frauds. I don't
[55:29.840 --> 55:34.640]  know about that judge in particular but the system itself reveling in the petty exercise
[55:34.640 --> 55:42.960]  of power over dumbed down idiots. I don't know and I watch these videos of judges and
[55:42.960 --> 55:49.040]  proceedings just getting off on they're in charge and they're telling people what to
[55:49.040 --> 55:52.720]  do and there it's a disease.
[55:52.720 --> 55:58.940]  It's a disease of just mindlessness. I'm gonna go back to your phone calls jam-packed second
[55:58.940 --> 56:03.560]  hour coming up with your calls and I'm gonna get into the nature of the New World Order
[56:03.560 --> 56:08.480]  and their plan to destroy the economy from the pages of the latest news. But right now
[56:08.480 --> 56:11.520]  let's go to another caller here.
[56:11.520 --> 56:14.520]  Mark in Ohio wants to talk about smart meters go ahead.
[56:14.520 --> 56:21.240]  Hey Alex how you doing today? Pretty good sir. I actually didn't believe what you were
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.200]  talking about last week when you were talking about the smart meters and all they're watching
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.720]  you and stuff like that and all your appliances so I decided to do a little experiment on
[56:29.720 --> 56:33.520]  my own they tell you online how you can block the RF signal.
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.600]  So I did this and I had the strangest thing happen everything in my house that was smart
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.240]  went off just stopped working it was plugged in everything nothing worked my phone didn't
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.640]  work cable didn't work nothing worked and then depending on where I was at the house
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.360]  stuff will start flipping on and off it was almost like somebody somewhere else was trying
[56:51.360 --> 56:57.280]  to get the information to upload of whatever I was doing that week and it just didn't work
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.000]  and this went on for about four or five hours.
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.360]  Yeah well see sir what you should do is is not just you are better than Alex Jones okay
[57:08.360 --> 57:12.720]  I guarantee you in many ways of your life you're smarter more you know more intelligent
[57:12.720 --> 57:19.160]  more focused you should then shoot video of all this happening and upload it to the enemy
[57:19.160 --> 57:25.000]  system YouTube to show it to people and everybody should do this and everybody should shoot
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.280]  a video showing how it's a tyranny and showing the owner's manual but I want you to listen
[57:29.280 --> 57:35.600]  to me it's NBC CBS ABC Washington Post it was the I mean I've got articles out of the
[57:35.600 --> 57:40.040]  San Francisco Chronicle where they started this 15 years ago lying to people saying don't
[57:40.040 --> 57:44.720]  worry and then 10 years you know later saying of course we're watching you and tracking
[57:44.720 --> 57:50.480]  you five years ago it's all official sir all the new appliances everything wire into these

[58:07.280 --> 58:13.320]  it's not the technology's bad it's that they piggybacked it onto this and then you pay
[58:13.320 --> 58:18.000]  for it in the cost of the product for your own enslavement now how is that not fraud

[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.040]  understanding this and exposing it is the way to go so that's coming up in the next

[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:29.000]  worldwide total control grid track everything you do part of the smart dust rfid control system
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.440]  start over how you didn't believe me what specifically how you went and checked what
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.680]  happened go ahead okay i just uh you know like like you said i didn't i didn't quite
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.240]  believe i believe a lot of things you say but this one i was like okay that's a little
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.880]  over the top so i went ahead and there's a way you can find out online how to block and
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.240]  it doesn't everybody's got the products in their house they can use i blocked the signal
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.160]  after about an hour or so everything that would have had a smart meter my printer my
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:00.600]  phone my tvs even the tvs now hooked up the cable everything just went out systematically
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.620]  then it was almost like they were trying to reboot stuff and get things to start working
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:10.480]  again the weirdest part is is i have a cv radio in my house i started hearing i i brought
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.280]  my cv radio because i know it's an rf channel i actually was talking through my cv and
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.480]  i could hear it through my tv and other appliances which was just the creepiest thing ever oh
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:26.120]  yeah all the new tvs have microphones and most of them cameras and see see if i wanted
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.760]  to blow everybody away i would get together do a survey find volunteers that have smart
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:39.580]  meters they're doing a big test uh in central austin um central east austin where it's admitted
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.880]  they've got microphones up around town it's admitted they're listening over your tvs uh
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.080]  and uh i think i've told the crew we need to investigate reports on this um but we're
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.960]  just so busy trying to do everything else but because people need to see it it's not
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.120]  enough when i go here's the cia director admitting they're listening to you via your washing
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:03.080]  machine uh it's not enough to show that it's not enough to to show you know the philadelphia
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.580]  inquire or the philadelphia schools or watching the kids at home over the government issued
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:12.400]  laptops it's not enough to show sacramento police doing it in california people need
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.940]  to see this so sir do it all again videotape it put it up on youtube and if you're not
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.720]  good at that get your neighbor to help you okay there's no excuses i can't do it all
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.780]  i'm telling the alternative media that are half of so jealous of us they could they could
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:33.740]  spit i'm giving you the idea you go do it we'll post your video i just want to beat
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.840]  the tyranny uh but people are all you should do this you should do that i can't do anymore
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.340]  i've got the big ideas and people don't carry them out because there's just so much going
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:52.240]  on but but yes we need to go show this everybody listen just like when your cell phone is sitting
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.940]  next to your computer and every minute and a half or so depending on how it's set you
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:06.120]  hear a that is the cell phone microwave transmitting to give your location and your search history

[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.540]  just got real upset off that in case you've taken any photos they're uh they've got compression
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:21.200]  systems that are unbelievable they're sending your photos out as well this is a this is
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:30.080]  a demon police officer of the new world order to track everything you're doing okay and
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:36.600]  so okay to quote south park okay so there it is right there just be aware of what it
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.240]  is it's there to give you cancer it's there to microwave you it's there to track everything

[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:21.040]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:37.480]  it is Monday February 11 2013 I am your host Alex Jones thank you so much for joining us
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:43.560]  the total free number to get involved on air is 800-25-99231 it's going to be open phones
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.640]  coming up at the bottom of the hour in to the third hour today we have an investigative
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.560]  journalist joining us to talk about staged mass shootings versus real mass shootings
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:09:00.000]  and get a filmmaker on the show Holland Vanden Nieuwenhoff to give us his expert take on
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.040]  all of this filmmaker of a noble lie that conclusively proves Oklahoma City was a staged
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:12.020]  event to blame American libertarians and conservatives in 1995 and it's a blueprint of fast and furious
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:17.260]  stage to blame the Second Amendment and we can expect more of those in the future so
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:24.080]  we're going to be looking at the latest on the alleged cop killer who's now reportedly
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.440]  calling up and taunting people and how he's being praised by the so-called left and the
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.940]  anti-gun people as a hero beyond bizarre I'm going to cover that at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:42.000]  before we go to all the people that are patiently holding like Joe in Ohio listening on WAIS
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.320]  770 am we'll go to him first when we do go to calls okay that said one of the most important
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:55.120]  articles we've put out in recent times is up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com our
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:03.680]  news websites why the banking elite want riots in America civil war 2 the economic imperative
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:12.080]  for mass social unrest and that ties in to of course people calling for civil war and
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:18.880]  the killing of police in mass on the so-called left and the praising of their hero Chris
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.320]  Dorner whether this is a real story or not it has a lot of telltale signs that it that
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.480]  it is real but they won't let a good crisis go to waste you better believe that but again
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.440]  that's coming up at the bottom of the hour now we're also streaming video at info wars
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:40.640]  news.com or prisonplanet.tv will also get you there and so I want to show viewers some
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:47.840]  numbers and a basic equation here as I break down the fact that America and the West are
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:54.680]  being deindustrialized and economically imploded by design and this is what agenda 21 is all
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.480]  about and knowing this can turn everything around if we can ever have a real debate with
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.760]  the ruling political class and the minions they're buying and selling then it can be
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.200]  game over for them but let's explain something throughout history and this is covered in
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.320]  the book that we sell none dare call a conspiracy that was out of a print for a long time by
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:20.280]  Gary Allen who had was working with people like Larry McDonald and Congress and others
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:27.340]  to expose this that a tiny, tiny elite not 2% but much smaller than that is anti-free
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:32.580]  market and that everywhere they get in control throughout history it's the same oligarchical
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:41.760]  system of crony capitalism, crony insider monopolism every time they get in control
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:48.420]  the middle class disappears a giant underclass is formed and a tiny elite then segregates
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:57.560]  themselves into protected areas walled cities within the city controlling the general population
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.480]  and this is the real political paradigm in fact if you're watching on TV I want to show
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:08.460]  people an article here out of the London Guardian it says shocking figures reveal the growth
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:16.400]  in UK's wealth gap the middle class is disappearing the poor are surging in numbers but a tiny,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:23.920]  tiny fraction they say 1% actually went and did the math on there it's less than one tenth
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:35.000]  of 1% has seen a ultra massive increase in their wealth there's been a 18 to 19% drop
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.320]  in the poor in what they've been making and a huge increase depending on how you break
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.440]  the numbers down in the so-called rich and then the organization for economic cooperative
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.240]  development that's what did the Marshall Plan that's the banking receivership arm of the
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:58.360]  UN that's the real global government at the heart of it is the OECD key organization,
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.600]  organization of economic cooperative development they're all the big global government treaties
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.280]  you name it they then criticize themselves in their own policies offering socialism as
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:14.560]  the solution to no jobs no economy no system where they've used regulations and bureaucracy
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.560]  to wreck everything so there's just one example now let me the ultra not even one tenth of
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:27.160]  1% it's way past that they want to blame the 2% the local person that makes $500,000 a
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:32.480]  year that's got boats that's got cars that comes to your restaurant that buys clothes
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.360]  that goes to the golf course that actually has a business, runs things, has a bunch of
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.840]  employees, and then goes out and spends that money and flies to Cancun and flies to New
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:52.040]  York to see a play that's who you want you want more of those upper middle class or new
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.620]  rich new bo-rich as the French call them in every economy that's who you want because
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:00.800]  they have a tendency to grow and grow and grow and then lift up the poorest the poorest
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.900]  people start living like the last generation's rich now the globalists say this is bad for
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:12.100]  the earth let's not go shopping and of course there's extremes in that the wealth does eat
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.960]  up resources the wealth does cause decadence to where people get so wealthy even the poor
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.200]  they don't care anymore because they've got their cheeseburgers so there's an equation
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.640]  there where this this type of wealth does create a lot of slob behavior and spoiled
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.080]  rotten kids and so the elites sit there and they argue hey you got a bunch of people that
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.320]  are animals we're soft killing them it's come out they don't care let's just go ahead and
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.100]  wipe them all out and we'll enjoy the life extension and you know we'll end war and set
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.040]  up a global government the difference is the globalist throughout this entire program they're
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:51.240]  the ones putting out the GMO and the cross species and the super mutated insect viruses
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.320]  in the food and the zoological disorders cross species and the fish infusion and the antimatter
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:07.760]  reactors and the black mana sabo armed drones and the particle beam laser blimp installations
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:14.520]  and all of this stuff that is statistically i've studied it absolutely totally dangerous
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:19.180]  and these people are not in control of it but they're in a race with a few other elites
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.200]  they don't want the arabs to get the technology they've got a double deal with the communist
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:29.400]  chinese i'm going to get to in a moment but they're absolutely in an arms race with themselves
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.660]  and they're in control of most the world but they're not in control with their own internal
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:40.920]  power structures and the less than 20 families 1,000 members of that 6,000 servants superclass
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.400]  that aids them according to the kissinger group prospectus breakdown because they have
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:49.320]  to understand themselves they publish books they publish periodicals discussing themselves
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:55.960]  tragedy and hope superclass brazinski's new book i mean there's a bunch of them and it's
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.080]  just all openly discussed there how they're going to kill us and how they're going to
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.300]  take over and i mean you read stuff by brazinski written in the 70s it's all come true they're
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:09.720]  about six seven years behind maybe a decade but but if you back it up and they admit they're
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.160]  behind and by the way this is when they're talking to the cfr they think you're so dumb
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:22.160]  he goes on the cfr on television and admits all this just leaving tiny membranes of plausible
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.000]  deniability in there where he talks about maybe this isn't a good idea maybe it is but
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.940]  this is where it's going again they and they tell you bill joy tells you in the april issue
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:37.240]  2000 of wired magazine why the future doesn't need us again i'm telling you again i don't
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:43.520]  deserve this and you don't deserve this i have had the establishment reach out to me
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.080]  over the years and it's always off record as a journalist i can't talk about it or no
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.240]  one will ever reach out to me again intermediaries presidents vice presidents billionaires you
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.520]  name it well-known people to like alex i know it's bad but you know the leader bad look
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:01.040]  how ugly the public is politically now they tear you apart they hate you you're never
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.980]  going to help them you might as well join the establishment and try to work from within
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.680]  how would you like a show on national tv how would you like book deals every you know six
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.680]  months how would you like to be you know the next rush limbaugh i mean this is how the
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.240]  system works this is how the system operates people that have sold out to the system they've
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:24.200]  heard this speech before oh globalism is to raise the third world and to empower them
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.840]  and sure to lower our standard but we want to lift them up then you get the actual inside
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.480]  imf world bank prospectus on how they were going to implement the treaty because governments
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.040]  won't sign on to these even if they know it's a con job for the public unless they know
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:44.320]  the inside deal of what this treaty implementation means take the copenhagen treaty from three
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.080]  years ago at the u.n summit for global carbon taxes and the third world leaders got it and
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:18:01.460]  said we're right at we're right at 195 percent or almost double uh the taxes of the west
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:06.000]  you were supposed to destroy the west and give us the money not raise taxes and de-industrialize
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.200]  the west and then you were going to industrialize us and and see that that's the public sale
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:20.280]  of agenda 21 which is the global zoning rules of eugenics and the post-industrial economy
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.760]  which on its surface you can say hey we shouldn't be so wasteful we shouldn't be so slovenly
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.840]  we shouldn't just buy things in some malfunctioning hunter-gatherer mechanism you know off the
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.360]  home shopping network and pile your garage up full of junk you never open and crap you
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:39.240]  don't need you see they've got a good sales but on the level but this isn't a real debate
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.000]  about nations working together to have real goals and not be so slovenly and honoring
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.600]  men and women in our roles and building society no at its heart it sells the mighty it sells
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:58.680]  the virtuous it sells the good on corruption and evil but in the name of helping humanity
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:04.880]  and saving the earth so that's my real indictment is that this is a very ugly thing now we come
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.120]  back from break i'm going to go over the statistics but let's start doing this now there's 7.5
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.640]  million people roughly now Rothkopf and the Kissinger group who i've interviewed on air
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.480]  you look it up five years ago they came on i said why are you here he goes i'd like to
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.840]  talk to you openly and you know maybe talk some sense into you you know would you like
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.480]  to talk some time off air by the way john harmon was running the show that day he was
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.400]  a witness to this during the breaks i'm talking to Rothkopf and i didn't agree didn't be nice
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.900]  with him on air and he said that's it i'm never talking to you again people said we'll
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:36.480]  get Rothkopf on again did you see most journalists get to talk to people like that or lord Rothchild
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.920]  or whoever we got on the heir to the Rothchild and you're supposed to just they come on to
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.640]  see if you'll kiss their butt the minute i kiss their butt i'd be on a jet airplane paid
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.780]  for by them to london by the way i've been offered before by some of the most powerful

[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.840]  because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend

[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.720]  tomorrow part 2 is coming out why the banking elite want riots in america civil war 2 the
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:36.280]  economic imperative for mass social unrest where their own documents linked in this article
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.840]  linked in this article how they plan to make you poor and then cause riots and cause civil
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.280]  wars they've done this all over the world to bring in even more control but i'm telling
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.280]  you how the trick works see when you're a little kid the magicians up there and it looks
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.120]  like you know he really cut the lady in half or he really pulled a rabbit out of a hat
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.360]  but once you learn the trick you see it and you know it and i'm here to teach you the
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.120]  trick folks i'm here to teach you what i've learned studying these people and studying
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.960]  history and it's not hard it's not like i'm guessing the trick they all write manuals
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:16.160]  white papers government documents public reports like you don't exist because they know you
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.280]  want to go watch the football game or go to the topless bar or uh do whatever it is you
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.480]  do or you know go to church and hear some preacher worship the government instead of
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:31.160]  christ and they know you're not focused on this information now i know our our audience
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.360]  is but i'm talking to all of the i don't know tens of thousands of new listeners today we're
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.120]  getting like two three new affiliates a week i want you to understand global government
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:45.440]  is a global crime monopoly of ponzi scheme operators that have taken almost the entire
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.040]  world over through fraud and they want to attack the two percent that's all that's left
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:56.820]  of what they call the rich and somebody making 250 000 a year the husband and wife that is
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:04.040]  not rich with a devalued dollar okay now when you've got when your granddaddy's got you
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.640]  know airports named after them and you've got you know you're on the board of a hundred
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:14.560]  companies and your wealth is tax exempt then you're wealthy that forbes list is nothing
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.160]  ladies and gentlemen there are families leveraging it's been estimated the russian press estimated
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.900]  when they arrested a bunch of oligarchs the rothchilds have leveraged this is a decade
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:33.520]  ago 300 trillion dollars 300 trillion and they don't spin that they they use it as a
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.320]  political weapon now let's go over the math here look at this 7.5 billion people on earth
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:47.760]  roughly 1 000 it's really less than that members of the less than 20 families okay and it's
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.160]  only in those families a few people controlling the wealth 6 000 super go first serving them
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:27:00.040]  this is all out of the kissinger group okay now let's do the math of that 1 000 people
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:12.840]  out of 7.5 billion we're not talking about the two percent out of 100 so you've got 98
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.340]  as the enemy of the two percent and if they just didn't have that wealth it's this two
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.800]  percent that comes to the golf course the two percent that buys plane tickets the two
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:27.360]  percent that comes to the opera if it's the bottom 99.99999 of that two percent that makes
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:33.520]  the world go round okay they make the world go round and the rest of the 20 or 30 below
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:42.720]  them okay now historically this tiny 1 000 out of 7.5 billion they use feudalism to have
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.240]  managed economies so no one can challenge them they want monopolies now what is 1 000
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:28:07.960]  people out of 7.5 billion is 0.000001333333 so it's the 0.0000013333333 that we're talking
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.880]  about and by the way there are actually some people in that top little percentage that
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.480]  actually made their money off real things so that's even discriminatory but the majority
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:24.000]  of that wealth of the 1 000 superclass has been stolen or gotten through combines okay
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.920]  and these guys are the ones every case pushing globalism pushing the 1.5 quadrille quadrille
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:43.480]  how many zeros is that 1.5 how many zeros are in a quadrille i know it goes quite a
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:49.960]  while 93 on average of that globally this is even the washington post is derivatives
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:58.400]  that they created that are not ours our national debt 16 well it's about to be 17 trill 17
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:06.320]  trill compared to 1.5 quadrille they're telling us too big to fail we've signed on to this
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.840]  we've signed on to the 1.5 quadrille and then the media is sitting there knowing people
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.560]  don't pay attention to numbers they're telling us that we owe all this and we're deadbeat
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:23.560]  slouches because of the 17 trill and it's true the debt's gone up 207 since obama got
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:33.000]  in they're trying to trying to get us into some real debt a quadrillion has 15 zeros
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.480]  or more than 50 yeah is it 24 i can't even keep track of this anymore all right we're
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.960]  going to come back and get into the meat of this and then i promise your phone calls be

[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.520]  reported cop shooter and all that's happening in the push for a civil war in this country with
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:12.760]  an investigative journalist holland van den newenhoff who agrees with my analysis and has
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:19.480]  a lot of cogent points to add you've heard him co-host the transmission before now before we
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:27.800]  go any further here let me just recap that the ultra rich are monopoly men and they are out of
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:34.520]  the 7.5 billion people they are zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero one three three three
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:41.240]  three three three three uh percent and they've signed us onto their 1.5 quadrillion that's
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.560]  actually a three-year-old number it's closer to two two quadrillion or two thousand trillion
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:53.080]  and that's got 24 zeros a quadrillion does 24 zeros on it so we're talking about quite a bit
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.960]  of money which is hundreds of times more than all the real assets in the world as they're currently
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:04.280]  valued but the globalists have signed us on to too big to fail and then they take 25 million a
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.600]  month and pump it directly into that not to prop it up they've already written that off
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:16.520]  to destroy wealth raising payroll taxes on people making 22 000 a year i apologize
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.320]  it's in cnbc today i thought it was 30 000 and up you got a payroll increase i'm sorry
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:27.960]  22 000 a year that is poverty by any mark uh in most areas of the country i guess there's a few
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:33.880]  areas where stuff's so cheap you could live like that uh and you count the property taxes and the
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.280]  rest of it i mean this is total enslavement and so cold-blooded but that's because we have the
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:43.000]  most cold-blooded elite ever who sees cold-bloodedness as a virtue
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.800]  now let's go over some of the articles here for people watching on tv radio listeners these are

[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.960]  they got shows everywhere demonizing anybody that talks about this because it's a takeover
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:32.600]  and you can't do the delusional thing where you watch the sitcom where the terrorist is a gun
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.840]  owner and you watch the drama where the terrorist is a gun owner and loves the founding fathers and
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.600]  feel like you're a winner when you watch your neighbor drug away because they're a patriot in
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.880]  the future you're not part of the winning team your water your foods having chemical and bio

[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:02.600]  drugs just like the troops anybody the globalist control will show you where they're going they
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:09.960]  want full control over everybody so the economy will never turn around none of this will ever get
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:16.920]  fixed none of this will stop until you realize that it is a master scientific plan written up
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:22.520]  by inbred royalty rothschilds rockefeller's and others of social darwinism that it's their right
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.720]  to be totally cold-blooded and wipe everybody out for the new age to begin their new age where they
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:31.960]  will become god men now i don't know if that's really going to happen or not they believe it
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:36.360]  the media always watches endgame and says jones says they're going to live forever i didn't say
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:41.880]  that i quote them bibliographed what book what statement what un document where they say it
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:49.240]  this is an emergency red level alert warning you you know about all the secret testing all of it
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.680]  continuing they made insider deals with china and i mean they're the communist chinese generals are
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:47:00.280]  worth billions because they own and control the licenses to get the factories where slaves are
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.600]  literally marched in or you can just starve to death and they're taking the rural people's
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.120]  property making them go into the big compact cities just like they've done in southern mexico
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:15.800]  under the un to force them up to mexico city it is it is it is a exploiting the third world to
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:21.240]  build slave widgets where idiot westerners buy it to be de-industrialized and enslave themselves
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.720]  while the police state grid is put in place so when they collapse at all they can then
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:32.120]  everyone beg for this for the fewer resources from the system with hat in hand to accept higher
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:38.600]  levels of social engineering into the next phase and once all that's put in place then they start
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.680]  having the controlled bioweapons releases and wiping out large swaths of the population
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.680]  everything you've seen up to this point is just testing and conditioning getting the public ready
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:54.680]  for it so that's why they have now announced china is the biggest owner of u.s debt that china now
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:04.040]  has a bigger actual trade not just fake fiat gdp we've been maneuvered into this maneuvered into
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:10.280]  higher taxes higher regulations carbon taxes that china's exempt from this is economic warfare that
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:19.000]  isn't rhetoric this is economic warfare against our republic to bring this system in and it's the
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.320]  same system from australia to germany to canada to the united states from wales to scotland from
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:33.880]  ireland proper uh to you name it it's the same global standardized system on record designed to
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:39.800]  break up the family dumb down the children drug the population just getting you used to it they're
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.360]  now rolling out vaccines that you'll never be depressed again that literally attack your
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:49.800]  cerebral cortex injectable uh selective lobotomies i mean you're in a science fiction movie
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.840]  you're in a science fiction movie and the only reason i'm still alive is because they
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.520]  underestimated us and there are a lot of good people in the system now and this thing is
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:05.000]  compartmentalized where they don't want to mess with the research project they want to roll it
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.680]  out and see what happens and it's a weird rule that they have under social darwinism that if we
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.760]  wake up to this and say no and fight them and reverse it they're not going to do it
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:20.760]  it's a weird metaphysical rule that we've got to invite them in we've got to give into this
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:28.760]  it's the free will issue and i'm telling you right now ladies and gentlemen you're already
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:32.440]  walking dead many of you you've already been you've already been eating and drinking and
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.000]  giving shots of things that even if you try to eat the best vitamins and minerals and exercise
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.320]  you're you're not going to be i mean the number the actuaries are off the chart the cancer rates
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:47.400]  the death rates the the longevity is lowering everywhere i mean we're in trouble and it's going
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.800]  to get worse and crazier and weirder and stranger and we're never going to come out of it and here's
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:57.480]  the key they're selling a self-fulfilling prophecy and the video is up on infowars.com
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.640]  world banker makes stunning confession where wolfdenson is going to all the big universities
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.800]  there's a bunch of these speeches and admitting oh the less is about to be all poor and all the
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.520]  powers going to china and india well not the power but to the elites over there because they're part
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:16.280]  of the globalist program to leverage out the wealth that we don't have to become poor for
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:22.360]  them to succeed globalism isn't meant to raise everybody up it's meant to lower everyone that's
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:28.280]  the great lie of globalism and things are only going to get worse until we realize this and say
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.600]  no to it we're going to go to break and come right back with joe and everybody else for two segments
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:38.200]  that our guest is joining us and then we'll continue taking phone calls but this is a nightmare

[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.360]  it's it's a economic warfare with the globalist bringing america down raising our taxes and
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.120]  regulations and then moving all our businesses to china totally conscious we can turn this around
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:07.960]  if we understand it's by design go ahead well uh mr jones i just uh i agree with what you're saying
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:14.600]  uh it's been proven many times uh to me and and to quite a few people over the years
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:22.920]  and uh what i would like to do is thank you for for what you're doing uh i know it's difficult
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:30.680]  at times you seem like you're going six different ways at once uh i can understand that i mean
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:36.440]  you've got a lot on your shoulders and uh back when i started listening really listening to
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:45.000]  the program about eight years ago i had time to uh it's just proven to me and some of the
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.040]  folks i listen with that uh yeah there's some things going on in this world that
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:00.120]  need to be taken care of and uh well my problem is i get angry at obama grandstanding about how
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:05.400]  much he loves poor people and engaged in class warfare when he represents the robber barons
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:10.600]  eugenicist who are doing forced abortions now in africa that the federal government just funded
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.560]  three years ago and then i get to see jamie fox saying racist things all day while they're killing
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:23.080]  black kids and it's just it's so over the top and obama has got quote poor people thinking he really
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:29.720]  wants to help them when he raised their taxes and then i know they're moving all our jobs to china
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:35.000]  not even to help the chinese but to even lower their standard of living and we're totally being
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.120]  enslaved i mean this is a fact we're being absolutely economically attacked what do we
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:47.720]  do about this i say we get angry we get the word out definitely um and again that's where i want to
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:58.920]  reiterate as is as long as i've been listening uh and i i thought years ago uh especially after 9 11
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.920]  uh boy that that was something that uh kind of woke a lot of people up
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:08.760]  uh there's still a lot of people that need to be woke up about it but uh the day that that happened
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:18.680]  um and the stuff that went on after as far as the media uh it wasn't right it wasn't right and
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:24.280]  regardless 9 11 has been used to set up a police state now admittedly aimed at gun owners
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:29.560]  conservatives libertarians returning veterans undoubtedly i was right it happened and yes the
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.160]  globalist around al-qaeda it's not even so much our government it's criminal elements within

[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:04.200]  on your mind anyway uh first of all i want to talk i woke up about uh it's sad to say that i
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:11.720]  forgive me i'm getting over the flu uh it's sad to say that i'd uh and i just woke up probably
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:21.720]  less than a half a year ago um anyway up about the flu vaccine uh the flu vaccine i haven't had
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:28.360]  a flu shot since the 90s and this is the first time that i had the flu uh since uh since the 90s
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:36.840]  uh the last time i had a flu shot i got sick um anyway isn't it ironic if you actually think
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.760]  about it if they were actually you know how every fall they say hey you need to get a flu shot right
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:50.520]  and um as soon as you get everybody gets a flu shot all of a sudden the flu spreads now no no
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:54.760]  no they're actually studies by major governments you can pull them up we've done these reports
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:02:02.200]  your common sense is dead on where the regular flu shot actually causes the flu that's why they give
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:08.600]  the nasal live virus first and they admit in the literature it's actually causing and of course
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:15.720]  they spread the flu themselves so that they can then scare everybody look the this government
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:25.480]  alone has declassified more than i don't know it's more than 2 000 programs many of which were lethal
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:30.920]  spraying lethal stuff on towns foster kids troops in the old days it was minorities because they
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.760]  they primed the pump with well those those are minorities you know let's do let's kill them or
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.440]  hurt them but now it's everybody and it's been everybody actually for a long time
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.920]  in phase two but i mean there's been no reparations there's been no big investigation
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:50.360]  it's like oh we apologize for doing this or that so obviously why do we trust anything they're
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:55.800]  doing do you see my point exactly that's what i was trying to say i mean imagine if they were
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:00.360]  to give the flu shot in the springtime you probably see a flu epidemic through the summer
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:06.520]  oh there's no doubt there's no doubt and if you get the flu shot one year it doubles your chances
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:11.400]  of catching other variants of it that's the canadian government's uh two studies four years
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.680]  ago i mean we already knew that but it it how many people got a flu shot for the first time
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:21.560]  and got the flu a day later i mean even piers morgan got deathly ill a couple days after
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:27.480]  taking the shot i mean this is not a game folks these are not oh the government and big pharma
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:33.880]  most big pharma was uh was in germany under hitler uh bayer ig farben you name it they're
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:38.360]  like oh people that ran the death camps they run our drugs now oh well they're nice people
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:45.160]  and bayer didn't just get caught in the 40s remember they got caught for 11 years shipping
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:50.760]  out millions of ampules of factor 8 that gave every hemophiliac or others that took that blood
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:56.440]  product drug gave them hiv and hepatitis and then it came out in the court documents that they knew
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:02.280]  it and quote didn't care well it's more than didn't care can you imagine giving hundreds
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:08.200]  of thousands of people hiv and hepatitis can you imagine that brother uh no i couldn't
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:13.640]  hey you know what you know what the sad thing is uh the sad thing is that people are they're so
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:19.720]  blind i've been trying to wake people up and they they call me a conspiracy theorist yeah
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:23.880]  everything you said is is being true and i'm not committing you as god and all that i know you're
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:27.800]  not no no but i mean it's on record about bayer everything i said is on record if it wasn't i'd
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:33.720]  be sued into oblivion yeah i know that and the thing about it is i used to be a big glint-backed
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:39.080]  supporter i really was a big glint-backed fan and my wife thought that i went off the limb
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.640]  now my wife looks at me because shane i can't listen to glint back anymore
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:50.600]  no i mean well we're getting glenn to come around a lot of ways he he went through a lot growing up
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:55.240]  and took him decades to make it that's why he's so competitive with other patriots and does some
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:05:01.720]  bad things but you know overall i think he's doing a good job and we forgive him you prepare

[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:33.400]  are at least provocateur and allowed to happen prior knowledge scripting you see how the media
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:38.200]  behaves you learn when it's staged you learn when it's not you learn when they're just not letting
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:44.040]  a good crisis go to waste and you learn when they are behind it or when even mainstream media
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:48.760]  admits every few weeks they bust some mentally ill person who's been profiled with an 85 iq
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:55.000]  who's schizophrenic who they've given drugs and money to for two years on average who they finally
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:00.600]  convinced will give you another ten thousand dollars and the heroin or the meth when you go
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:07.960]  blow up the christmas tree or again and then they're oh we busted a terrorist but now they're
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:13.160]  flipping the script from its al-qaeda which the west openly runs in libya and syria and other areas
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.320]  too gun owners conservatives libertarians you name it and the reason i was in the film noble
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:21.160]  i that we sell an info store.com discounted i hope you get it and give it to everybody
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:26.280]  well you heard me this last few years i said all the obama advisors say he needs to really get
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:30.520]  power and get done what he wants chapeiro you name it in the financial times of london
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:35.880]  they're internal high-level donors people that give you like a million bucks for the democrats
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.880]  every year one way or another they got internal letters and at meetings it got recorded
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:44.760]  uh that hey we're gonna blame the what they call the right wing but they mean the real right wing
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:49.000]  not the fake stand-in one the libertarians conservatives they see that as left and right
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:54.680]  at least in the paradigm they communicate we're gonna blame all this on them don't worry you know
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:59.800]  he's gonna get it done and and we've been told gun owners we we killed the kids at sandy hook
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:06.520]  doesn't matter of real violent crimes down 49 since uh 2001 uh excuse me since 1991 it doesn't
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.520]  matter if that is accelerating it doesn't matter if more guns mean less crime doesn't matter of
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.600]  switzerland's the safest country in the world and has the highest gun ownership
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:19.080]  i saw a washington post article this weekend admitting that but demonizing it they're trying
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:23.960]  to take their guns you can't take everybody else's guns and do all this worldwide if a
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:30.520]  couple countries stand out meanwhile this new cop which i look at this i read the manifestos which
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:37.720]  are his online postings what he said it fits the mo of one of their wind-up toys who's into being
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:42.280]  a hollywood star that that's what they think me and a cop is been you know counterterrorism training
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.160]  and all this going off the rails being mad because his whole identity i mean just look at the photo
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:52.600]  of this guy i've seen that eye i've seen that look let me see a document cam here it it's it's
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:56.680]  a narcissism look and you see the you know the whole way except the way the cops are so scared
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:03.160]  shooting up innocent people's cars the way the media is spinning it like oh maybe it's good
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:10.040]  maybe it is racism that's telling you that it's not staged now they'll sure use it to push drones
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:16.440]  and police state and all the rest of it and you know to sell the idea of just we'll kill whoever
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.440]  we want at checkpoints whenever we want i mean they have a bank robbery in denver and an hour
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:25.240]  later they shut down a highway and aim m16s and every family in their cars i mean and if they
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.080]  killed people it'd be good kill more i mean the proof you're a good american is to kill yourself
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:35.240]  you know the government's got everybody else's trash everybody else's filth now i know most
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:41.320]  police are not like this but the system's trying to twist them so i want to get holland van a
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.120]  newenhoff's take because he was on a lot up to the election saying look they're going to stage
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:49.800]  stuff they're going to blame it on us they're going to provocateur it and then you get anderson
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:55.320]  cooper's green screen his nose disappearing uh i mean are they doing that on purpose to make
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.160]  his focus on that knowing the public's not that awake and will think we're cooks
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:04.280]  uh multiple men who were police from another jurisdiction caught by police then the media
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:08.520]  said it didn't exist they didn't say hey they were cops later it's come out in court it's no
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.840]  that didn't happen you didn't see that see it's the evidence of the cover-up the scripting the way
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:18.040]  they jumped on it within five minutes literally with tweets that's how they caught them setting
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:22.920]  up dominique straus khan is a horrible globalist but he was being set up by sarcozy still failed
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:27.400]  the socialist still got back in it just wasn't khan two different brands of the new world order
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:31.000]  stabbing each other in the back separation of powers that's one thing that holds back to
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:37.160]  globalist throughout history is they're always stabbing each other in the back holds back tyrants
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:45.720]  the modern version globalist was that the official twitter of sarcozy got time zones off
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:51.560]  and tweeted a good 30 minutes before the police were even called before he'd even left the hotel
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:57.000]  that he had raped a woman and that he had been arrested that's like publishing in a whole bunch
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:04.280]  of other time zone you know australia new zealand uh and then one other asian country that lee
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:09.080]  harvey oswald had killed jfk before he was even arrested and his name was even broadcast they got
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:13.880]  the time zones off just like they announced building seven had just blown up and collapsed
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.840]  and and cnn's going it's not hadn't collapsed well reuter says it has they got the scripting off and
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.880]  then two bbc's said the same thing you see and it's not people say oh are you saying aaron brown
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.640]  was i don't know he lived in new york he went but it appears to still be there but it fell in its
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.520]  own footprint from the fires there it is okay yeah and then other networks and i said it was
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:37.800]  probably reuters because i knew they're the highest level globalist internal propaganda feed i said
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.280]  that on record turned out it was reuters bbc had to admit at first they said it wasn't real footage
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:50.840]  that we faked it see we've got them ladies and gentlemen we have them now okay and if we just
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:55.800]  expose them it's over but we're entering the main danger quadrant right now now he may disagree with
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:02.440]  me and i want his take on sandy hook on the aurora that's totally staged so i haven't heard his his
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:06.840]  take on this yet i haven't haven't heard him on local radio in about a month hasn't been too busy
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.120]  uh and i want to get his take on this new guy i'm gonna try to shut up give him the floor for about
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:14.600]  15-20 minutes then i promise we'll go to your calls holland vanden newenhoff thank you for
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.080]  joining us sir uh thank you very much for having me on again alex it's a pleasure what do you think
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.080]  of that rant you just heard your points on it what do you think's going on right now i think
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:28.760]  you're making very good points uh what you pointed out in your uh video release on the green screen
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:33.560]  of anderson cooper is the fact that cnn is actively engaged in a propaganda campaign revolving around
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:39.720]  the sandy hook massacre to uh fulfill a gun control agenda and as you pointed out cnn has time
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.680]  and time again over the past two decades been heavily involved in the deep state agenda being
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:50.760]  the propaganda arm of the pentagon and the national security state and uh whatever uh uh
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:55.480]  whatever the political agenda that needs to be fulfilled uh during the current administration
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:59.800]  of course we're seeing under the current uh pretender and thief president obama a mere
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:06.120]  a mere continuation of the policies of president bush uh expansion of the war on terror and at the
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:11.960]  same time he's asking us the american people to disarm ourselves at the very same time that they
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:17.720]  are uh taking the drone technology that they've already used overseas to kill hundreds of children
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:21.880]  and they're importing it they're bringing it here to this country and they're using it currently
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:28.040]  uh in uh the hunt for the lapd uh cop killer the supposed cop killer christopher dorner so we see
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.160]  we're seeing if this event in california is not contrived and i'm reserving judgment on that
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:39.320]  perhaps could be legitimate a legitimate uh outpouring of rage at a man's life destroyed by
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:45.880]  a corrupt system and if so uh we're seeing how a legitimate threat to the system they see this lone
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:49.800]  individual who has just the right amount of training to be a threat to their control system
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:56.440]  you see the panic mode they go into protective details doesn't shooting up passers-by who happen
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:01.240]  to drive by the wrong house at the wrong time aren't even in trucks and and a white guy they
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:07.320]  pull over let him go and then shoot him up exactly and this is not professional behavior this is
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:13.960]  panic driven behavior uh police officers are used to being having the tactical advantage in numbers
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.320]  and equipment and oftentimes when you see them at a disadvantage just like the overconfident
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.840]  person in an earthquake who loses his bearing because all of a sudden his size has no standing
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:30.440]  on his survival status they completely go to pieces you see the police seeing that their
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.800]  their supposed advantages are no more and they simply go to pieces we saw it after katrina
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:42.920]  we saw it at waco when the atf were you know basically got their um they got beaten in the
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:47.560]  first firefight by a bunch of children and old men uh even though they had the tactical advantage in
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:51.800]  the firepower but they they came up against against some resistance they weren't expecting
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:55.800]  they went completely to pieces you know i think you've gone to the heart of it i want to talk
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:00.440]  about that first when we come back this should everybody al sharpness says we got drones we're
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.600]  taking your guns the government owns you the globalists couldn't hold back dead and if you're
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:08.920]  willing to fight i don't care how many robots how much crud you've got unless you nerve gas
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:14.440]  everybody you're going to lose and if they start this civil war it is going to wipe out the police
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.920]  and military period but i don't want that to happen because the globalists plan on that
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:23.800]  happening yeah i mean you'd be a fool to see it not happening we see the potential of it fulfilling
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:28.760]  right now just imagine if a couple dozen christopher donors were on the loose in one
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:34.680]  state pulling off such havoc i mean you would see a complete uh collapse uh instant martial law
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:39.400]  and then that won't matter because they'll all they're gonna go to redoubts they're gonna go
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:44.280]  dig in when all this happens and then that's gonna just let the economy fall apart until they get
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:49.320]  citizens to rat people out it's look listen it's it's a trap none of us want to do this but i'm
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:54.600]  telling you they're all talking about civil war the media's hyping him kind of going oh civil war

[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:33.080]  globalists were able to take over because nobody saw what they were doing they did it incrementally
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:38.040]  but now as you get down to the end game people are really waking up look at this article up at

[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:48.760]  teachers yeah that's the new corporate global governance where they're saying that the u.n
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:53.640]  will enforce where you can't even use words without paying a tax now with voice recognition
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:57.720]  they're going to do it and then when you write something or teachers write something you don't
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:02.200]  own it the government does and that's how they actually spy on you see computers sound great
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:07.800]  in schools but then everything you're writing is being read by the feds it all goes into a database
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:12.760]  and they say they have computer programs that check it for plagiarism i mean it's just a nightmare
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:17.160]  world they're building because none of us think about infrastructure we just put up with whatever
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:23.640]  they roll out to us going back to our guest holland van den newenhoff syndicated talk show
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:29.400]  host documentary filmmaker okay hall this is short segment long segment coming up bottom line
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:35.320]  now hundreds of millions more bullets they're buying 1.6 plus billion checkpoints highway
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:41.720]  checkpoints tsa checkpoints in austin now i mean it's just it's accelerating but it shows how it's
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:48.040]  a paper tiger because if we ever resist it it's all over but they're going to stage stuff and
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.160]  blame it on us to get the hearts and minds that's the race in the hole that's why we've got to
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:58.920]  expose they're the ones behind so much of this but what do you make of them now in cbs news and
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:04.760]  others hyping this guy like a hero going well it is wrong and i guess it is good to shoot them you
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:09.560]  know shoot somebody's daughter to get back at their dad i mean what do you make of that psy-op
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:15.480]  now i guess that leftist terrorism because he's a gun grabber this is something good yeah it's
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:20.760]  very tempting to have some sympathy for the suspect in this case and frankly his case does
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:26.440]  seem like it needs to be examined but his actions in in slaying innocent people the daughter of a
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:31.320]  police officer and her fiance that has no moral value i have no sympathy for that at all and let
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:36.920]  me clarify my position what i was referring to earlier i do not uh want to engage in a shooting
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:42.040]  war with my fellow americans in this country i think that would be the absolute worst case
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.360]  scenario if it does come down to that i'm pretty sure what the outcome is going to be but if that
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:51.000]  does happen there's going to be traumatized generations that is going to take a long time
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  to get over it's going to it's going to be it's not going to be good and i don't want that violence
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.200]  is not what we are striving for and if we win the information war that we're all engaged in right
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:05.960]  now we don't have to go to violence we don't have to use violence in self-defense because we win the
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:10.840]  information war we bring the people over to our side they see the falsity of the system being
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:15.480]  erected in front of them and they reject it so we are not even close to that we're still in the
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:20.280]  first phase of resistance right now which is the ideological war in which you have termed and uh
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:26.600]  basically owned as the information war well all i did was look at what the enemy did saying that
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:32.680]  90 of pentagon operations were in full war and i took their term and turned it around to try to
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:38.200]  restore the republic how do you see things going for the globalists right now i mean i see them
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:43.480]  carrying out their global takeover but it's not happening in a vacuum and people are way more
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:49.240]  awake than they thought we would be and their own internal white papers admit this yes the uh the
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.840]  they're not keeping up with the curve the learning curve that the people are engaged in in the
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:59.640]  information where we are waking up we are learning people are the human brain is talking to to itself
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:04.040]  like uh no other time in recorded history learning things about itself learning things about what is
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:07.800]  going on learning things about our respective systems that we live under seeing the similarities
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:11.880]  say hey uh my system's corrupt too your system is corrupt what are we doing here let's come up with
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:16.920]  something else let's come up with something that works uh so that's happening we're talking having
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:23.000]  that dialogue that discussion and they are they are behind we are winning in this because you see
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:29.320]  the desperation the very fact that they are engaging in atrocity at sandy hook at tucson
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:35.320]  and other places tells you that they are desperate these are the actions of basically a serial
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:43.480]  murdering system when pushed to extremes when stressed will lash out and seek blood to teach
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:48.440]  us to love them so they can play the part of the hero exactly exactly and something about this
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:53.240]  dorner case is it reminds me of the like the so-called sympathy being joined up by the media
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:57.880]  like i said it's very tempting to be sympathetic to the man and and part of me is but i have no
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:03.720]  sympathy for his value in slaying and taking innocent life but it reminds me of in the 1960s
[02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:11.080]  and 70s actually when um marxist groups were were actually advocating shooting cops on the street in
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:18.920]  order to make cops more antagonistic towards the citizenry and therefore creating a cultural divide
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:24.520]  between the police and the citizenry so this could be a divide and conquer attack you're right i've
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:29.800]  forgotten about that that's why going back about five six years i would get more angry at the police
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:34.920]  not realizing it was a globalist tactic having them act like goons to create the divide of us
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:40.680]  against them when instead we need to be engaging them and waking them up and getting them back to
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:44.920]  american standards let's talk about how to defeat this and what you see on the radar screen and

[02:33:26.040 --> 02:33:33.560]  holland van den newenhoff filmmaker talk show host former marine rifle squad leader looking at this
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:38.360]  they've tried to create a militarized culture with the police where the public is seen as the enemy
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:44.200]  but it's now public the cia brings in most the drugs with the big banks it's now public
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:50.200]  the government runs al-qaeda it's now public but but not known by the general public it's
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:58.040]  admitted but not known but with the intelligentsia it is and so they have real trouble coming out
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:02.920]  and attacking myself and others talking about false flags now as they try to flip the script
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:09.880]  onto gun owners veterans and the rest of us do you see any scenario where chris dorner
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:16.440]  who says he reportedly loves obama loves piers morgan and people hate the police so much in
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:19.720]  southern california and they a lot of them are pretty bad out there i've actually met some pretty
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:24.120]  nice ones too that they're saying yeah let's kill more cops i'm seeing this all over facebook
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:32.120]  twitter it's being left up i mean we posted a video about about uh 3d printable gun cartridges
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:37.720]  or or uh gun magazines clips whatever you want to call them and you know youtube's removing that
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:42.360]  doesn't even really show how to make it uh if i make fun of some globalist professor they remove
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:48.360]  by video but people can be up there saying let's kill cops and nothing happens and again they want
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:52.440]  to get black versus white old versus young i've got some clips of that coming up in a moment
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:59.720]  but never american people against globalist or hey why does my tax money go to foreign banks
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:05.000]  so i see it as desperate divide and conquer and they want to get a shooting war started somehow
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:12.840]  i guess to forever get the police to see the public as an enemy but i think fundamentally
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:17.000]  even though the globalists have a lot of good tacticians and people they think as they're
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.920]  being landed in helicopters and things on air force one that they're going to be able to
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:27.320]  negotiate this and win this i really see them doing what hitler and others did you know turning
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:34.440]  east into russia or or are biting off you know more than they can chew or you know the romans
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:40.520]  getting run out of northern england by the scots and then building that wall there i mean i really
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:44.840]  see them miscalculating but i don't want the miscalculation to happen but then if they do
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:48.680]  go ahead and start the civil war that'll be the quickest way to bring it to its end but
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.480]  what are points you want to make on that rant and other points we haven't gotten to yet
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.880]  well looking at the actions that this government is undertaking the purchasing of
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:04.840]  tremendous amounts of firearms and ammunition of police state technology one could only conclude
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:11.560]  that they are indeed preparing for civil unrest they're not buying billions of rounds of ammunition
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:17.080]  to fight al-qaeda here in the united states that is not happening who are they preparing for well
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:22.760]  the other enemy is the american people now they know that they are preparing for civil unrest
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:28.280]  they know that trying to forcibly disarm the american people would would would provoke
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:33.720]  violence uh that's they have probably calculated that that cannot be ruled out therefore they are
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:39.000]  betting on it and oftentimes when in a bad situation it's better just to put your foot
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.480]  on the gas and drive it towards its ultimate culmination point and so they know it's going
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:48.440]  to get violent so they are doubling down on dealing with the violence the fact is that
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:55.960]  the american people must be disarmed for this uh control grid to advance to the next state because
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:00.520]  right now uh we're starting to grumble we're starting to grumble and we're still armed we're
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:06.040]  also grumbling because this government is telling us that we should disarm ourselves so um the
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:11.960]  confrontation may come and they know it so they're going to do it on their terms that's right they're
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:16.440]  going to strike first exactly they know what's going to come so they're not going to wait for
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:21.880]  a random chance to throw their calculations are where we have a real lesson center concord
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:26.120]  and they're clearly in the wrong they want to strike first but frame it like they didn't strike
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:30.920]  first yes they said this time and time again when karl rove boasted to the media about creating
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:36.440]  reality he was talking about staging events and therefore altering the course of events after
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:41.960]  that therefore you create reality this is what they teach each other staging events to create
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:45.960]  reality they know this is going to happen so they will stage something they staged everything else
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:52.120]  thus far with the gun control agenda in mind sandy hook was scripted tucson was certainly scripted
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:56.680]  fast and furious was run by the same that's right you instantly see the scripting people ask how we
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:02.600]  know and how we get proven right over and over again you instantly see the scripting yes in
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:06.840]  tucson when that happened the first piece of news was the sheriff saying this was because of
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:11.720]  the political atmosphere i didn't even know who was dead yet and then we see at sandy hook when
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:15.880]  i turned on the news the first thing i heard was a police spokesman saying this was the result
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:20.120]  of access to firearms i don't even know what's going on yet how many people are dead or what's
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:25.640]  going on but they're telling me why this occurred you see the script running concurrently with the
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:29.640]  event unfolding that tells you that script is laying on someone's desk ready to be read
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:35.800]  well humanity doesn't awaken until we're under pressure people are adapting they are improvising
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:41.480]  and the globalists should look at the mass of zombies and think we're all weak there's a large
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:46.200]  percentage of us that are not zombies and just because you've neutralized most the public into
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:50.600]  mindless gibbering idiots you know arrested development morons doesn't mean you've gotten
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.560]  a lot of us and they need to understand that exactly exactly a lot of us are awake i mean
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:39:00.120]  it's it's it's almost scary how many people are awake alex when when we are changed oklahoma
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:05.160]  goes out onto the highway and holds a google building 7 banner across the highway during
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:12.040]  uh high traffic high traffic times i i'm not exaggerating fully 10 of the cars are honking
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:17.560]  in support probably half the truckers now a lot of people are awake and they just they they they
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.400]  they're not advertising it they're not you know talking they know what's going on but they just
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:26.520]  choose not to engage and frankly i don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing but they they are
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.560]  awake they know what's going on that's a giant mass of hidden force exactly and if something
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:37.160]  comes down the pike that perhaps this massive force finds a bit objectionable they may just
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:41.880]  and if we can convince them uh effect a critical mass you know what's going on it's time for you
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:47.240]  right now in this day and moment right now to draw a line in the sand make your stand and say
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:52.040]  no more you're going to compromise me out of my destiny my entire life but at this point
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:56.760]  i'm going to say no because once we cross this line there is no going back and my children
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:00.600]  children will never experience the freedom that i did growing up in this country that we were
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:05.240]  and by the way i've said i'm not turning my guns into my line in the sand is there it is good and
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:09.640]  human and fundamental to commit to something and stop being afraid ladies and gentlemen they're
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:15.080]  already soft killing us creeping around turning up the ambient manipulation we need to just
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:20.200]  accelerate this not the physical end they're going to do that we need to accelerate the info
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:27.480]  war now every day before this war kicks off we've got to use the info war exactly and this is a
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:31.400]  process we make our stand every day with the choices we make once you wake up you start making
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:34.840]  choices what what you're going to do with your day where you're going to spend your money what
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:38.280]  you're going to do with your energy if you're going to spend four hours watching tv if you're
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:43.640]  going to disengage from those matrix those are little stands we make every day every month in our
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:47.480]  in the information war that we know we're pulling away from them that's why they're desperate to get
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:52.120]  us to come back and it's not happening and as we make these stands make these decisions that will
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:57.880]  give us the strength and the character that when the decision becomes more dire more consequences
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:02.920]  we've already made these decisions before we've paid little prices before and we we were proud
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:08.040]  of our decisions before now we're being given a bigger choice are we going to make a stand here
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:12.920]  yes we are because we've already been through this process we're evolving we're trying to fight back
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:17.960]  and we're going to say no i am not going to go quietly into the night i am not going to turn in
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:24.040]  my firearms for better or worse that is not going to happen that's right and and notice they've now
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:28.200]  backed off and obama's out with guns and morgan's out with guns piers morgan they're like we never
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:32.920]  wanted your guns as soon as they lose an offense they pull back and say there was never a fight
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:37.080]  because they don't want us getting together and massing ourselves they don't want us forming
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:43.800]  organizations they want us and of course that's a military tactic as well they don't want to give
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:49.960]  us any kind of even ideological victory uh for example in california after 1990 when president
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:55.560]  bush senior outlawed uh assault rifles in that state there was a massive non-compliance people
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:00.440]  were not turning in firearms that was not reported in the news because that would tell you that their
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:04.760]  people were not complying with the law it was like 99 people were not turning in their firearms that's
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.760]  just not going to happen they're not going to grant us these ideological victories in the
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:12.520]  mainstream media we just like when we say we're going to have an opt-out week they just turn the
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:18.920]  body scanners off they're not gonna let us know we have power exactly but we can see beyond that
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:23.640]  because we're not paying attention to their mainstream propaganda see we're we are fighting
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:28.040]  the fight we're not the bystanders the the mainstream audience watching tv we are fighting
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:32.120]  the fight we see the the how well that's the essence once you realize they're cold-blooded
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:37.880]  lying enemies you know just like that big gun shop owner listened to morgan he lied to him about
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:41.240]  everything and the guy just said i can't believe he lied like that you kept your word that if i
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:45.880]  let you go under you'd be polite i said i didn't want to but i kept my word uh people said well
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:51.240]  why were you nice because i gave somebody my word my point is is that you need to understand folks
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:56.200]  they're not well-meaning liberals these are not liberals these are cold-blooded people using
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:03.160]  psychological tactics anthropology and sociology tactics who see you as an animal or as a tribe
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:08.200]  they're observing that's how they describe us and and we don't we're observing you too
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:13.240]  you know you little chicken necks this is a bunch of professors and technocrats who hate real men
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.640]  hate families that's why they're ideal they're a bunch of weaklings i'm telling you folks it's
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:22.200]  an army of nerds running this thing okay i don't mean there's a lot of nice nerds too but i mean
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:27.000]  it's an army of sycophantic nerds running this who literally think we're like a bunch of villagers
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.800]  they're watching from a spaceship i got news for you you're not god okay and we know what
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.720]  you've done you little turkeys we're coming after you yeah it's herd management that's how they
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.960]  consider they cull the herd from time to time so they can reap its wealth but the herd is becoming
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:45.960]  sentient we got internet now and we're realizing that we have uh herd masters and we are going
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:50.040]  we're breaking away we're breaking down the fences we don't care what you say or do anymore
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:54.280]  we don't even want to fight you we just want to get off the reservation no longer be under your
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:58.440]  control we're not looking for a fight here if you will if you just want to give up your control
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:03.560]  system that's fine that's not going to happen history dictates it won't um but hopefully you
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:07.480]  will wake up too i mean we need to engage the enemy also talk to them and i'm not just talking
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:10.760]  about police officers i talk to police officers all the time and frankly most of them are some of
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:15.080]  the most upstanding human beings ever met in my life but there's a good number of them out there
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:18.520]  who are corrupt and the other police officers they're in a paramilitary organization they're
[02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:22.600]  used to following orders they will tolerate that stuff in order to further their own careers and
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:27.400]  their own security and that of their families it is good people tolerating evil within their ranks
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:31.560]  we need to engage the police and we need to engage those who are trying to control us
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:37.800]  we don't need to do this these are these are old ideals of managing the human herd calling it we
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:43.960]  can come up with better solutions their system is obsolete and their their resort to violence
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:48.920]  is indicative of the fact that their system is obsolete you're right the reason they're
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:53.240]  panicking and in an arms race against us is they're losing the infall war folks they're
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:58.200]  losing on every front because their own minions have now figured out wait i'm in the crosshairs
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:02.040]  of this too yeah and we need to ascertain the nature of the threat against us like you said
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.840]  alex we need to know we're not just facing liberals who hate america that's just not
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:13.240]  we're facing we're facing a funded propaganda arm called the media cnn that is part of the pentagon
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.160]  and national security state they've been owned since the first gulf war that's not hippies that's
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:21.960]  the foreign banks that run our government yeah it's not hippies who hate america i mean they're
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:28.200]  the tools but the guys pulling the trigger they wear suits and they they don't go to potluck
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:35.000]  suppers they eat at five-star hotels absolutely and they're all eugenicist it's incredible i want
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.320]  to play a clip here because in the divide and conquer i knew they'd try to put obama in to
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:44.040]  create racial division bring obama in the name of unity so a bunch of you know white people vote
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:48.120]  for him again not that mccain was good either total globalist the fact is it's staged it's
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:53.880]  rigged the whole thing and then now i've never seen it without even trying to look for it
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:58.760]  i mean it is the most fashionable thing to say whites are dumb whites are stupid whites are ugly
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:04.840]  whites are pathetic you know the white men can't jump thing but times a hundred to make whites not
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:10.040]  like black people i mean i mean see see black front men like jamie fox are out there not knowing
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.640]  why they're encouraged to do all this by the system believe me folks that's all vetted and
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:19.320]  scripted they think it's all part of a big joke it's meant to create division and i want to play
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:23.240]  this clip and then ask you why they want that division then we're going to go to another clip
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:28.680]  and then phone calls for corbin and others that are holding let's go to this clip of jamie fox
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:34.120]  chris rock and others here it is uh jango unchained i play a slave uh how black is that
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:42.600]  and uh in the movie i have to wear chains um how whack is that but don't don't don't be worried
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:48.280]  about it because i get out the chains i get free i save my wife and i kill all the white people
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:59.640]  in the movie how great is that and how black is that uh i am just here to support the president
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:08.760]  of the united states president united states is you know our boss but he's also you know
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:12.360]  the president and the first lady are kind of like the mom and the dad of the country
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:19.000]  and when your dad says something you listen and when you don't it usually bites you in the ass
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:26.360]  later on black people are the most talented people in the world i it's i can't explain it
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:34.840]  you can't sit in this room and not watch gladys knight sing and go like golly what in the world
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:40.600]  in the world now what if david duke got up and said white people are the most
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:46.920]  talented people in the world well he does uh but the issue here is what this is a major
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:51.720]  psy-op folks because it's everywhere where you don't like big government won't turn your guns
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:58.760]  in you're a racist so stuff that isn't racist is called racist and things that are racist are pushed
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:05.160]  and again it's meant to create some type of bizarre clash um holland van den newenhoff what
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:09.080]  is your take on this psy-op what do you think they're trying to do well it's definitely divide
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:15.400]  and conquer and this kind of sentiment that jamie fox and chris rock are are um subjecting us to it's
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:20.840]  it's infantile this is not uh we don't play with building blocks anymore we're in the adult world
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:27.400]  and uh and adults don't view things in terms of racial matters i don't view my interactions with
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:32.520]  society in terms of racial politics or now it's about ideas and what people stand for yeah and
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:37.960]  and i'm not even i'm racially indistinct so i really have no dog in the hunt but these are all
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:44.200]  just it's infantiles divide and conquer and frankly i don't are people really buying this
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:49.160]  this black and white divide anymore i mean it just it just seems so outdated but i guess it is
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:53.400]  working because that's what the media is pushing and we see it time and time again people are
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:57.480]  falling for and we see a lot of people right now under president obama we saw this under president
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:01.800]  bush for eight years under president bush liberals were my best friends in the world because for
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:06.360]  i was talking smack on the bush administration so were they as soon as president obama became
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:11.080]  president i was they literally we were stabbed in the back several times we were sabotaged and so
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:17.080]  forth by our erstwhile friends now we're seeing a a pendulum swing now we're seeing a lot of
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:21.720]  republican so-called right wingers talking about revolution and wow the constitution the bill of
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:26.200]  rights and so forth well they were completely silent for eight years exactly it isn't about
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:31.960]  republican democrat uh identity politics or black or white but see even though we're not into
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:36.600]  identity politics it's real because they've gotten the illegals and then other hispanic supporters
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:41.000]  to say get rid of the borders or you're racist against hispanics and i'm like what pay for
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:46.120]  everybody's babies and go bankrupt and then the illegals vote to take my guns you see so they
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:51.080]  force you into they've because even if you don't want to operate at that level a lot of these
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:55.640]  groups are operating as an identity group yeah i don't want to be talking about race but apparently
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:00.760]  i have to in the 21st century still well that's the plan it's total instead of talking about the
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:04.760]  globalist i want to go out to break with this clip and come back with calls here's a clip of al
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:08.440]  sharpen going hey don't worry about the second amendment we got drones here it is i mean if you
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:15.000]  look at the second amendment it was that you would have militia to protect yourself in case the
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:21.880]  government came and attacked citizens first of all if the government were to come to disarm you you
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:26.920]  would not be able to use an automatic weapon to defend yourself let's be serious we're in a world
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:33.480]  of drones now so the second amendment would not help you in that area that's enough everybody's
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:38.200]  laughing and i get this when i'm on socialist globalist shows they go we got the drones ah
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:42.680]  because they know it's about power really you got the drones with dorner how's that helping you out
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:46.840]  there inside of california and that's not working so well for yeah i mean it's all just a bunch of
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:52.280]  crud okay the will to kill is what it's all about i don't even need weapons i can kill people

[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:55.320]  and the uses of the ssris the maos and the tios i work here at this hospital i'm not
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:58.360]  going to name it because of all the laws and regulations that i'm supposed to uphold
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:05.480]  but i work in this hospital and we feed these kids these drugs daily and they're very violent
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:10.120]  i'm going to say that working on one of the violent levels of this hospital most of them
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:16.440]  are 13 14 years old alex i asked the doctor the other day because i'm really getting sick
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:21.640]  of taking care of these kids i said what is the scope of treatment here actually because i see
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:27.000]  nothing being done they say we're trying to make them feel remorse for the things that they've done
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:30.840]  and like i said i'm not going to name some things but i want you just to imagine the worst
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:36.440]  psycho killer movie you could imagine and that's what a 13 year old sweating their three-year-old
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:42.280]  sister's throat yes sir i mean and it gets you know uh rape and everything else just the things
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:47.240]  i've heard and how well thought out it is i said what is the scope of treatment here doctor he said
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:54.040]  well we're trying to make them feel remorse well i start talking to these kids alex i do my own
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:57.080]  thing because like i said i'm a nurse i'm supposed to be looking out for their health as well
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:01.720]  well i asked him i said how do you feel on these medications what does it make you do uh is it
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:07.160]  working for you they all tell me the same thing no it's worse i said well what happens what's your
[02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:11.800]  signs and symptoms well i had this one kid the other day tell me that the past three years he's
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:16.520]  had the same dream of this same girl that lives on his street well here's the thing alex as a
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:20.840]  juvenile in the state of west virginia your papers are not to be reviewed or brought to you in a court
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:27.800]  of law against you you can't tell people that when he gets out he's planning to go stab this girl
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:32.840]  that's exactly alex what i'm saying here's the thing when he turns 18 we have to release from
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:38.440]  that day and then we have to wait until he commits a crime to bring him back in and again they grab
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:42.120]  these kids when they're bad in school when they're eight put them on psychotropics and then they
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:47.400]  become demons with the video games the culture if you believe in spiritualism it's basically a drug
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:51.320]  that allows demons to take control of your mind regardless it's causing them to kill let's get
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:55.640]  holland's take on this we're gonna do 20 minutes 30 minutes of overdrive maybe an hour overdrive
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.400]  this is so important can you stay with us holland yes i can okay i want to keep going to calls we're
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:03.880]  going to and stay there uh corbin i'm going to bring you back after the break but a quick comment
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:08.440]  on what he just said well yeah the system is self-sustaining we see the drugs being used to
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:12.840]  turn our children into psychopathic killers and then are not being treated and they go on to
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:18.600]  commit crimes thus justifying everything that is being inflicted upon us and their answer from
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:22.920]  sandy hook and this is more mental health more kids on drugs which will cause more of the mass
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:28.760]  shooting and then more mental health more drugs but it's brave new world 1984 they're playing out
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:35.000]  the script unbelievable and it says on the insert makes you do this it's it's not a conspiracy theory

[03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:28.360]  all right we are live lunging into hour number four and it is the
[03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:37.480]  11th day of february 2013 and our guest is holland van denuenhopper taking phone calls
[03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:45.400]  listen they use the national security state to cover up their crimes and they selectively use
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:51.560]  the medical privacy issues that when you've got people adjudicated you know 13 14 15
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:56.920]  as psychopathic killers on the drugs of course uh you know already abused and things then put
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:00.600]  on drugs that take away their inhibition the the violent culture the way it's glorified
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:06.120]  and the good news is i have my second amendment that when one of these guys gets out when he's
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:11.240]  18 years old wants to come to my house well i'm just going to be waiting on them not worried about
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:17.800]  it oh got a crazy bust in the door meet mr uh semi-auto shotgun but you see the globalist hate
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:22.600]  this they're criminals at heart and they want a system where their children their little demons
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:29.160]  they've wrecked can have fun with us that's what the jackabins uh the elusiferians the illuminati
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:34.520]  and the french revolution that they basically created and hijacked they said well you know the
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:40.120]  journey is the destination raping killing burning murdering overturning god's creation that's what
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:45.000]  they're looking for the genetic engineering the splicing all of this but i want to go back to
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.680]  corbin in this short segment and get holland van den newenhopp's take and then more calls from
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:54.120]  leaf and others in the next segment corbin uh what else is going on there so so so you're saying the
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:02:00.760]  common theme is they're on the psychotropic drugs oh yes sir uh it goes beyond that i mean uh and
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:05.240]  to be honest like you just said uh coming to your house people need to understand this alex and like
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:11.080]  i said i really had no other way to get this out here without you know ruining my license but the
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:16.200]  you have to understand i'm talking i was on one level alex there's 30 kids up there they're all
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:23.400]  from two counties this is you know uh one of the bigger hospitals in my state but they have to be
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:28.360]  just they have to really think that they're in a high place to really think that these kids don't
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:32.680]  live next door to you and once they take your guns away and things and like i said just like you said
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:37.640]  what are you going to do when 12 year old kenny has been watching you because alex they they really
[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:43.320]  it's scary they wait three months it's all about power it's all about the ownership they watch they
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:47.320]  know what you do it's just like what you're saying with the government they see you i've had people
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:51.160]  tell me they know when mommy and daddy get off work and they know when playtime is listen it's
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:56.760]  demonic it's demonic the whole culture is being given over and the chemicals and everything that
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:01.640]  the chemicals and everything is turning them over but then there's the spiritual overlay this is a
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:07.480]  very demonic plan uh god bless you sir and please call us back you should do a youtube video but
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:11.640]  again just don't say where you work all of you need to not wait and just call in here you need
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:18.360]  to get out and warn others uh holland your take on that chilling phone call well it reminds me uh
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:24.840]  perhaps uh some say the ultimate plan of satan if one believes that is to take god's creation
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:30.600]  and destroy it in front of him uh perhaps that's a play there's always unknowns at work and where
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:36.200]  we do see a spiritual aspect to this uh this is spiritual warfare where it's it's warfare at every
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:41.480]  level they want to own our souls they want to destroy this and when you actually look at just
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:48.040]  uh look at demonic possession not as a literal fact but look at what the what the methodology is
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:53.640]  in trying to get someone under the at least in the theology under the influence of a demon it's
[03:03:53.640 --> 03:03:59.240]  pretty much propagandizing them uh traumatizing them it's everything that's being done to the
[03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:06.120]  american citizens to make us not a whole person to to leave us a shell of a person that get to be
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:12.040]  filled by whatever trash that the control system wants to shove down our throat to keep us happy
[03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:18.920]  slaves to keep the the herd fat and happy while they capitalize off of our flesh absolutely the
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:22.440]  only thing they can take over is to turn our children into manifest demons whether that
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:28.280]  means decadence or not caring or or being nihilistic or being flat out psychos and
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:32.120]  they're going to take a lot of them and turn them into cops i mean it's it's it's a folks

[03:08:47.720 --> 03:08:52.680]  their minions are drinking their own kool-aid as well uh they try to project this image of
[03:08:52.680 --> 03:08:58.200]  all-powerful but southern california is paralyzed and the police are gripped in catatonic fear over
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:03.160]  something statistically still it's very very uh remote that they'll be killed by one of their
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:09.560]  own supposedly but they the globalists are able to shut down our economy they are able to selectively
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:15.640]  enforce taxes george washington of course famously said the power to tax is the power to destroy
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:21.640]  and this is economic warfare transferring our jobs to china de-industrializing the u.s
[03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:26.520]  putting in carbon taxes that everybody else is exempt from obama raising taxes on the poorest
[03:09:26.520 --> 03:09:30.680]  americans totally cold-blooded but it's okay because he loves them he's liberal uh i mean
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:35.640]  just the con games how do you get around the economic shutdown well you start buying locally
[03:09:35.640 --> 03:09:39.960]  whenever you can you start growing a garden you start making those choices you start supporting
[03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:45.560]  the mom and pops aggressively and it doesn't mean you're always perfect and won't sometimes you know
[03:09:45.560 --> 03:09:49.960]  sometimes you don't have a choice but we better like you said the little battles every day
[03:09:49.960 --> 03:09:55.400]  uh because this is serious business holland vandenewen off comments on that uh yes definitely
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:10:00.200]  as for the economy yeah you need to start planning now because once the economy fails which it will
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:04.760]  on purpose or contrived most likely they will simply trigger the crisis because they know it's
[03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:09.080]  going to come anyway and they want to control it they have they know that the old system is
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:13.240]  collapsing it's a it was built in the 19th century it's old and the timbers are creaking they have a
[03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:18.760]  new high-tech dam ready a 21st century dam to contain the waters of the people uh once the old
[03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:23.320]  uh once the old system fails they have that ready and when the chaos caused by the the collapse of
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:28.440]  the old system we will be begging for their new control system but to avoid that we we need to
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:34.040]  avoid uh being uh hungry enough to have to make that choice and that means coming up with support
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:41.080]  systems now engaging your local economy now engaging alternative currencies now so when we do
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:46.760]  have to engage in alternative currencies and bartering and acquiring local food sources we're
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:50.600]  not uh guessing we already have an established system you already have a network you have a
[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:59.320]  community that you can go to well said well said just realizing evil predators are in control
[03:10:59.320 --> 03:11:05.960]  and withdrawing your consent and your support even verbally and really not hating these people
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:11.400]  but realizing they're a danger just like a highway by your house is a danger to your children i mean
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:17.480]  being aware that that's the danger over there uh and not being scared of it but but being steadfast
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:23.240]  and any opportunity you have to hurt the system anytime you've got a way to expose it because it's
[03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:28.120]  a cancer the system is destroying our constitutional system it's the imposter
[03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:32.840]  we are the counter-revolutionaries leaf in oregon thanks for holding your on the air
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:41.560]  hello yes sir go ahead hi first time caller long time listener thanks alex for all your info no
[03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:46.040]  no thank you thank you don't thank me go ahead um i'm a little nervous so excuse me if i stumble
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:51.160]  um i want to talk about some of the crazy stuff we're learning in our psychology class
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:55.160]  that's okay well you're learning that men inherently are all rapists in bed you're
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:58.440]  learning that world government's good are you learning about how you're a racist as well
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:03.720]  well basically they're indoctrinating us into this whole new religion of psychology and social
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:09.240]  darwinism and so what we're learning right now we're learning about um we're reading the descent
[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:15.720]  of a man by uh charles darwin yep and what's blew me away i couldn't believe this he actually says
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:22.280]  in his book that only a small percentage of people are evolving and these are the evolutionary elite
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:28.920]  and he calls the rest of us evolutionary retarded yeah you know i i'd read that quote he wrote a
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:35.480]  couple books which book was that uh the descent of man yep yeah and not only that he he even goes on
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:41.240]  to say i'm paraphrasing here he says that if the the evolutionary elite allow their sons and
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:47.640]  daughters to breed with the evolutionary retarded it'd be the end of humanity so this is insight
[03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:53.560]  insight into their mindset right there and this gives them justification and reasoning for you
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:13:00.600]  no no no 160 years ago or whatever he wrote that his cousin galton picks it up the royalty all
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:03.560]  here is we're elite we're going to set up we're going to develop the science we're going to
[03:13:03.560 --> 03:13:07.560]  discover why we're all inbred and dying and we're going to get rid of all these people and it's all
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:12.920]  off malthus 100 years before that that's what the end game covers but no no that's what they teach
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:18.040]  again they're not liberals and again they said we can't give our genetics to the general public
[03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:24.040]  we just got to kill them so see and then they say anybody who is upstanding and not of their blood
[03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:29.080]  line that's the number one enemy so see it's even a lie there are a bunch of people that want a
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:35.080]  monopoly on the future we own the future we are the future as obama says tell us what else they're
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:39.960]  saying we'll get holland's take on it well it's just insane i'm taking i'm getting my degree in
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:44.760]  i'm getting my degree in computer information systems and why am i taking this class in
[03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:50.440]  psychology why is it required no no they make you listen that's part of what woke me up in just the
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:53.720]  first classes i took at community college because i wasn't sure i even wanted to go to college i
[03:13:53.720 --> 03:13:59.560]  was working two jobs and uh you know it knew it was a scam so i went to community and they said
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:05.160]  first classes psychology sociology anthropology and uh texas history of all things i guess in
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:11.320]  texas and every class was whites are the devil and evil uh men are bad the family is bad world
[03:14:11.320 --> 03:14:15.320]  government's good we're going to take your guns we're going to reduce population and then i'd go
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:21.640]  turn on c-span hearings about how the extremist conspiracy theorist and militias believe there
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:27.560]  was a plan to take over and do everything i saw being taught keep going go ahead well it's
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:31.400]  insanity they even they even get into religion and they talk about how well religion's not a
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:35.480]  real theory because you can't prove it wrong so don't even discuss that with people like you
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:40.840]  like you shouldn't even talk about it and then furthermore you can just look at um charles
[03:14:40.840 --> 03:14:46.280]  darwin's book what is it called the eva um the origin of species the full title of that book is
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:52.360]  the origin of species or the preservation of the favored races right there i mean that's just in
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:56.680]  plain sight and i mean so far college has been pretty good i've learned a whole bunch of stuff
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:01.240]  it's really opened my mind but as soon as i got into this psychology after listening to you since
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:05.640]  basically end game it was just it just made perfect sense oh here's their whole reasoning
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:11.480]  behind everything eugenics world control listen my dad was top of his class and this happens to
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:15.640]  everybody that's top of their class in high school they they take you to a special academy
[03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:20.280]  and a major university then they test the rest of them then they call you behind closed doors
[03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:24.360]  and they say you want to join the new world order i mean you know we're going to take over we're
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:29.080]  going to exterminate almost everybody i mean that's what i'm saying folks this is this is real
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:35.960]  this is all that's going on people need to understand this everyone who's got they i've
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:40.680]  been approached you know to join the new world order i mean this is a real deal ladies and
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:46.040]  gentlemen okay i mean it's horrible i appreciate your call you should do videos about it you should
[03:15:46.040 --> 03:15:51.160]  write a book about it you should expose it you should write a paper about it you have to engage
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:56.360]  it everywhere and remember they play this mind game of we don't say that there's no world
[03:15:56.360 --> 03:16:00.360]  government well you say right here you want a world government oh you're mentally ill you're
[03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:05.080]  like they're it's called gaslighting it's a psychological warfare technique uh holland your
[03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:10.360]  take on what he was just saying oh definitely social darwinism was uh nothing new it's merely
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:17.080]  just a uh a development to justify old attitudes about their position uh going back to plateaus
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:22.360]  republic the reference in a noble lie of course the documentary that's being sold in the info shop
[03:16:22.360 --> 03:16:28.440]  but social darwinism was merely just an invention to justify the elites position they were asking
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:33.560]  themselves why do we have this power to control society how should we use it well we are the
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:40.280]  elect we're the elite by nature of our position this ancient brahmach class system uh uh anyways
[03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:45.640]  so they use social darwinism as justification francis gaulton who publicized darwin was a
[03:16:45.640 --> 03:16:51.480]  member of the elite darwin was a member of the elite the huxleys uh publicized darwinism to the
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:55.880]  full extent possible well they were related to him they did a five family inner breeding study
[03:16:55.880 --> 03:17:01.240]  to create the superman all it created was stillborn dead babies exactly exactly they've
[03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:06.040]  been involved in this from the beginning like i said i keep on saying herd management that that's
[03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:11.480]  just a metaphor but that's oftentimes it's very applicable and they are trying to breed the best
[03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:18.680]  elect they can and they're trying to breed out any kind of sense of independence uh self-actualization
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:23.560]  out of the general population because that's simply uh it's economically unfeasible you
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:29.240]  can't take that into account people they want us ugly they want us dumb see the low-level eugenics
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:36.440]  is we're going to make everybody better that's not what it is exactly it is to breed a servile class
[03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:41.720]  and a controlling class and that's not the point of when they get all the robots in place then
[03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:45.640]  they're just going to get rid of everybody in their own words that's happening right now the
[03:17:45.640 --> 03:17:50.760]  braid great brit has just developed a robot drone that's going to fly uh over to its target in
[03:17:50.760 --> 03:17:55.880]  afghanistan by itself and choose its own targets and the u.s has already come out well they had
[03:17:55.880 --> 03:17:59.800]  them 20 years ago but now they're admitting it to the slaves chet in texas you're on the air
[03:17:59.800 --> 03:18:05.000]  thanks for holding go ahead hi alex holland how are you guys today i guess we're all right we're
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:09.800]  exposing the master plan hope folks are listening yes sir this is the first time i've ever called
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:16.040]  and i've actually just been uh you know checking out your videos and and following you and sorry
[03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:22.200]  i missed you when you're in katie which is pretty close to where i live um i like to consider myself
[03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:28.840]  a true patriot i'm what you would call the um uh you know i joined the military at 18
[03:18:28.840 --> 03:18:34.840]  served fought in desert storm did three more tours in iraq after that i'm obviously one of obama's
[03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:40.680]  number one enemies because uh you know i've lost half my team while i was there and you know the
[03:18:40.680 --> 03:18:46.520]  whole ptsd issue you know that we're going to be targets for him and his gun control issue has got
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:18:54.600]  me greatly concerned and the primary reason is i see a lot of uh republicans nra and others saying
[03:18:54.600 --> 03:18:59.240]  oh it's never going to happen it's never going to happen it's never going to happen the thing is is
[03:18:59.240 --> 03:19:06.200]  obama really has his ducks in a row and he's out there on a major media campaign out in front of
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:11.720]  people every day day in day out day in piers morgan you know a joke doing the same thing oh
[03:19:11.720 --> 03:19:15.400]  yeah yeah obama care was never going to happen and the government would never openly admit they ran
[03:19:15.400 --> 03:19:19.400]  al-qaeda but now it's happened i appreciate your call great points yeah holland we've come to this
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:25.800]  point where now everything's really out in the open exactly exactly and it it's not it's not a
[03:19:25.800 --> 03:19:30.760]  secret they acknowledge this this is talked about i mean the fact is they're openly like you said
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:35.400]  uh supporting al-qaeda our state department in syria in libya and other countries in molly and
[03:19:35.400 --> 03:19:41.160]  god knows where else this is literally 1984 and brave the world we have the drug force drugging
[03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:45.000]  of the children which we've been discussing we have the the false dichotomy of left versus right
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.960]  al-qaeda versus the united states that switches back and forth this is all being played out before
[03:19:49.960 --> 03:19:54.520]  and we are fools if we're not going to recognize it's the global scientific technocrats against
[03:19:54.520 --> 03:20:00.120]  all of humanity humanity must come together hit the film a noble lie at info war store dot com
