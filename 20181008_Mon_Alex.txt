[00:00:07.917 --> 00:00:25.912]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:29.635]  29 days to the most important election in world history.
[00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:30.436]  A referendum?
[00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.322]  A nationalism versus globalism.
[00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:43.256]  By the way, in the first round of voting out of more than 15 candidates, the Donald Trump of Brazil wants a second amendment, free market, you name it.
[00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:48.637]  They tried to kill, they stabbed in the liver and the kidneys.
[00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:55.342]  He just won the first round ultra massively by a huge margin.
[00:00:55.342 --> 00:00:59.305]  Sending the Globalist Facebook, YouTube, Twitter into a tailspin.
[00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:03.909]  Soros is crapping his wicked Nazi britches right now.
[00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.192]  This is just continuing the trend worldwide against the Globalist.
[00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:11.614]  Big multinational corporations above the law allied with the Chai Koms.
[00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:15.976]  Coming in and trying to take our nations over and jacking up taxes?
[00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.037]  And then looting everything?
[00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:21.598]  And then they're led by evil, wicked people like Pelosi and Juncker?
[00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.319]  And the Chinese dictator?
[00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.600]  I mean, what a sick joke.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.581]  What a sick joke.
[00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:33.743]  People are coming off the plantation like Kanye West just said.
[00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:34.443]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.931]  It's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.652]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room.
[00:01:41.652 --> 00:02:01.540]  You know, I saw this last week before they rolled out examples of it, and I should have led the show with it, but it shows how conditioned we are to Big Brother that even I, you know, Trailblaze, pioneered exposing that they would put little appliances in your house that surveil you and control you.
[00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:06.415]  Didn't even cover it, but now with the video of them actually doing it, it's incredible.
[00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:19.225]  It's a activated robot hooked in to Facebook and Zuckerberg saying, our users trust us, they're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:23.549]  Tied into the communist Chinese, tied into all these different groups, tied into hackers.
[00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.912]  And now, I'd tell people 20 years ago, cover up your webcam.
[00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:30.775]  Nobody listened to me until James Comey said he did it himself three years ago.
[00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:38.404]  And now they just go, hey, let's come all the way out and just say, of course, we're going to be in your house.
[00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:40.184]  Of course, we're going to be watching you.
[00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:45.125]  And of course, the camera is going to be waiting and following you around the home and listening to you.
[00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:50.646]  And in the terms of service, they admit the information is given to third party groups.
[00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:56.048]  But then when you're at Zuckerberg's offices, what did they notice a few years ago?
[00:02:56.048 --> 00:03:00.769]  That he covers the camera on his computer.
[00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:17.324]  But he thinks you're a dumb effer and that you're going to take this new Google device called Portal, that's what it is, a portal to a big evil corporation run by the globalists, the Democrats, and that you're going to put this in your house.
[00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:19.346]  It's one thing to have a quote webcam or whatever.
[00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:26.611]  This is an AI computer that follows you and listens to you and is grabbing everything you say and putting it into a digital algorithm.
[00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.290]  Of course!
[00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:59.198]  Oh, but look, it's got a little thing to cover the camera up when you want to, because you understand it's watching you.
[00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:05.581]  Remember, Who Pioneered was made fun of in documentaries 20 years ago.
[00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:09.424]  When BBC and people come to my house, they'd say, why is your webcam covered?
[00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:16.888]  And I said, because hackers and governments and others can dial in and use it, but I also go into the computer and disable it, except when I use it.
[00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:20.090]  Then they laughed at me, see, because being right is bad.
[00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:22.258]  When you're ahead of your time.
[00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:25.006]  Because you're not supposed to be there and actually warn people.
[00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:27.253]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:27.594]  Also...
[00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:32.206]  Google's being summoned to the Pentagon for their treacherous activities with Communist China.
[00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:34.648]  I told you last week that was coming.
[00:04:34.648 --> 00:04:51.018]  We're also going to get into Taylor Swift rolling over like a yellow-bellied possum to the establishment, talking about her Tennessee values, even your Los Angeles, New York City leftist globalist values, not even the values of folks in New York City, but the values of the globalists and the rest of them.
[00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:52.759]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.361]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:04.321]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:07.625]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:13.894]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:16.657]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:21.220]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.683]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:32.646]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:37.319]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:44.523]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:49.226]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:55.430]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.413]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:06.363 --> 00:06:17.909]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:24.052]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now only 29 days out from the referendum against globalism.
[00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:31.136]  And across the world, other populist, nationalist, patriot candidates are in the lead and winning.
[00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:34.798]  Like what just happened in Brazil, it's all coming up today.
[00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:37.646]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:39.488]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:42.950]  Let me tell you what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:49.095]  The Democrats have pledged to get extremely violent and aggressive.
[00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:53.117]  Top Dem Trump GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh.
[00:06:53.117 --> 00:07:01.303]  Politico says after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:04.165]  The ruthlessness is what blew up in your face, idiots.
[00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:04.606]  The bullying.
[00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:14.430]  Continuing, we'll get into incredible news where the city of Columbus, Ohio is not going to celebrate Columbus Day because he's evil.
[00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:17.562]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:24.707]  And don't worry, the city of Austin is set to change the name of Austin because they say Stephen F. Austin was a racist.
[00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:27.469]  And don't worry, there's more news on that front.
[00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:37.535]  One of the former top astronauts has come out and apologized for saying that Winston Churchill was a good guy and quoting Winston Churchill.
[00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:39.617]  This is incredible.
[00:07:39.617 --> 00:07:45.761]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you go to any time or place in the world, it'd be like saying that
[00:07:47.628 --> 00:07:57.354]  You couldn't ever have a statue to somebody who lived in Africa 200 years ago because slavery was legal in Africa 200 years ago.
[00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:59.736]  Hell, it's still legal in many African countries today.
[00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:05.280]  But we don't run around saying how evil black people are because slavery still goes on in three African countries at least.
[00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:08.632]  Or that the Africans were selling slaves.
[00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:10.332]  And so were the Romans.
[00:08:10.332 --> 00:08:12.113]  And so were the Germans.
[00:08:12.113 --> 00:08:13.693]  And so were the Visigoths.
[00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.214]  And so were the Gauls.
[00:08:15.214 --> 00:08:16.794]  And so were the Chinese.
[00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:18.675]  And so were the Japanese.
[00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:21.195]  Every culture had slavery.
[00:08:21.195 --> 00:08:23.956]  You ever read a history book?
[00:08:23.956 --> 00:08:30.518]  That no one cares about liberated Libya by Al Qaeda and ISIS that Hillary liberated and put in charge.
[00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:39.413]  And took out a truly progressive Islamic leader who actually had women going to college and no burqas and blacks lived in peace with Arabs.
[00:08:39.413 --> 00:08:43.336]  I just put USA Today on screen for TV viewers.
[00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:51.480]  Let's put that back up where Africans are being sold at Libyan slave markets, thanks Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.502]  So occasionally mainstream media actually gets it right.
[00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:57.224]  And I remember, was it Colbert, about a year ago, made a joke.
[00:08:57.224 --> 00:08:59.205]  He goes, what's a slave block?
[00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:13.233]  They made a joke on the comedy show, and I said, Hillary's responsible for Libya, and now they're selling women on slave blocks, and they go, what's a slave block?
[00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:14.573]  It's a block, it's what it's called.
[00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:18.474]  It's a big square block with steps.
[00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:21.255]  It's a pedestal for the goods.
[00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:23.596]  And in every major culture, you have slave blocks.
[00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:26.597]  And you march people up there, and a lot of times you take their clothes off.
[00:09:27.574 --> 00:09:29.456]  They're like, but wait, Islam, you gotta cover a woman.
[00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:31.437]  Not when you're buying a slave!
[00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:33.539]  They march those women up there butt-naked!
[00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:43.187]  And they sell them to Islamic brothels where they have sex with up to 100 men a day.
[00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:51.494]  When they get pregnant, they beat them with sticks until they have miscarriages so they can get back to business.
[00:09:51.494 --> 00:09:51.634]  Now,
[00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:56.791]  That's the radical globalist Islam that Hillary Clinton has been funding and has been pushing.
[00:09:56.791 --> 00:10:00.133]  Every time they try to get good people into a country to actually stabilize it, they get removed.
[00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:15.762]  My point is, Taylor Swift talks about she's not going to vote for the Republicans in Tennessee for the first time becoming political, because she's under such pressure, because she didn't Tennessee values what happened with Kavanaugh.
[00:10:15.762 --> 00:10:19.944]  And Tennessee values, and all the rest is, hey lady, you didn't Tennessee values
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:39.292]  The pedophilia in Hollywood, the mass abuse of women, the sexualization of children, and lying about Kavanaugh, and not having due process, and not having innocent until proven guilty, and not having the statute of limitations, which you guys want to get rid of?
[00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:43.034]  And then they went and looked at all the cases, and they were all bunk.
[00:10:43.034 --> 00:10:44.415]  They were all boulderdash.
[00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:46.637]  They were all baloney.
[00:10:46.637 --> 00:10:48.298]  They were all Bravo Sierra.
[00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:49.379]  None of it added up.
[00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:50.780]  None of the witnesses said it was true.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.841]  It was all lies!
[00:10:52.892 --> 00:10:55.354]  Perjury!
[00:10:55.354 --> 00:11:00.617]  But she's got them Tennessee values of Taylor Swift!
[00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:04.799]  She isn't listening to her common sense, or her mother, or her father now.
[00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:09.783]  No, she's the biggest star in the world, and she didn't want to go the way of Kanye.
[00:11:09.783 --> 00:11:14.726]  Like, Kanye was number one, and now he's only number two or number three, because he got political, so now they're persecuting him.
[00:11:14.726 --> 00:11:16.907]  Well, that makes him a hero for standing up for what's right.
[00:11:16.907 --> 00:11:19.629]  I got a Kanye clip here, where
[00:11:20.953 --> 00:11:30.280]  A lot of this got censored off Saturday Night Live, but folks taped it, where he said the Democrats had a plan to pay black women to not have their husbands in the house to get welfare, to destroy the black family.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.201]  They go, oh, that's a crazy conspiracy theory.
[00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:33.502]  You're mentally ill.
[00:11:33.502 --> 00:11:37.145]  They said last Saturday night, the week after he was on, make fun of him.
[00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:41.268]  We didn't bully you, but we wish we would have bullied you.
[00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:49.975]  LBJ wrote a whole string of letters you can pull up and read online at his own library, where he said these n-words are getting up in him.
[00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:55.572]  They own their own businesses, their own communities, and segregation's only made them stronger.
[00:11:55.572 --> 00:12:03.675]  We're going to desegregate, and I'm not saying that that was a bad thing, but the reason he did it was bad, and we're going to have these N-words voting Democrats for 100 years.
[00:12:03.675 --> 00:12:11.417]  And we are going to basically put the women in charge, get the men out of the home, and we'll have full control of these people.
[00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:16.199]  That's what they did!
[00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:19.240]  Black illegitimacy in the 40s.
[00:12:21.343 --> 00:12:23.585]  Was lower than white illegitimacy.
[00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:24.285]  Now it's over 80%.
[00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:28.409]  You say, oh, you're not being mean to single mothers, are you?
[00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:28.709]  No!
[00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:31.451]  A lot of them are great and do a great job.
[00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:37.736]  The point is it's all geared to make men a bunch of lazy slobs and then women be wedded to the state.
[00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:44.201]  And if you're a single mother, your child, be it male or female, the numbers vary year to year and the crime statistics are what?
[00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.122]  Five times more likely to end up going to prison?
[00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:52.412]  Something like nine times more likely to end up taking drugs and being drug addicts.
[00:12:52.412 --> 00:12:57.716]  Many, many times more likely to end up dropping out of school.
[00:12:57.716 --> 00:13:00.978]  This was done by design.
[00:13:00.978 --> 00:13:05.382]  And then Hollywood and the gangster culture came in and weaponized the black community.
[00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:11.732]  And the black community was set up for the place where you allowed prostitution and you allowed drug dealing.
[00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:16.254]  That was done as a racist thing in Democrat establishment cities.
[00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:23.618]  The right-wing Christian Republican cities were the ones that went the other extreme and banned alcohol and wouldn't allow any red light districts.
[00:13:23.618 --> 00:13:34.703]  But the old Democrat areas of Chicago, New York, places like that, they're on record, folks, saying, just like in The Godfather, which is based on true stories, but they put it into a composite.
[00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:40.048]  Mario Puzo, you made that clear in articles you wrote.
[00:13:40.048 --> 00:13:45.812]  But remember, they're in the big commission meeting, and Don Corleone doesn't want drug dealing going on, period.
[00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:53.539]  Because we have the judges, they're our friends for alcohol and, you know, prostitution, things that are denied to them by the church, but we all do.
[00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:57.722]  But this drug business, I'm telling you, will be the end of it.
[00:13:57.722 --> 00:14:01.345]  Our friends in law enforcement and the courts are not going to go along with this.
[00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:02.686]  I'm telling you it'll be the end of us.
[00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:06.312]  I agree with Don Corleone.
[00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:07.433]  We control it.
[00:14:07.433 --> 00:14:09.174]  Keep it in the colored areas.
[00:14:09.174 --> 00:14:12.235]  The animals, let them lose their souls.
[00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:12.755]  I didn't say that.
[00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:13.736]  That's the Godfather.
[00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.317]  If Hollywood can say that, I can't.
[00:14:15.317 --> 00:14:16.437]  I'm quoting that.
[00:14:16.437 --> 00:14:17.298]  I don't believe they're animals.
[00:14:17.298 --> 00:14:18.858]  I don't believe they should lose their souls.
[00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.439]  We're all made in God's image.
[00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:22.981]  Like Martin Luther King said, and many others.
[00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:24.121]  Genesis.
[00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.602]  But that's them telling you!
[00:14:27.315 --> 00:14:29.477]  That's them telling you.
[00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:30.799]  It's a plan.
[00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:34.343]  And here's Kanye talking about it and getting persecuted for it.
[00:14:34.343 --> 00:14:35.764]  Here it is.
[00:14:35.764 --> 00:14:37.106]  That's why I'm always Democrats.
[00:14:37.106 --> 00:14:45.976]  You know, it's like the plan they did to take their fathers out of the home and promote welfare.
[00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:47.477]  Does anybody know about that?
[00:14:47.477 --> 00:14:48.679]  That's the Democratic plan.
[00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.751]  And it goes on from there.
[00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:54.512]  And that notice didn't air.
[00:14:54.512 --> 00:14:58.635]  It had to be shot behind the scenes, because they won't let Kanye go on live now.
[00:14:58.635 --> 00:14:59.996]  Because things are so controlled.
[00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:05.740]  And when Kanye came out and endorsed Donald Trump and Alex Jones, that same week, he said that they're matrix breakers.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.502]  Alex Jones and Donald Trump are matrix breakers.
[00:15:09.611 --> 00:15:11.892]  It was in news articles, and then they removed it.
[00:15:11.892 --> 00:15:13.473]  They didn't deny he said it.
[00:15:13.473 --> 00:15:18.856]  They removed the video before anybody could get it, and they removed it because they don't want that solidarity.
[00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:25.220]  I'm meant to be destroyed, Trump's meant to be destroyed, Kanye's meant to be destroyed, and little Taylor Swift runs out and says, Tennessee values.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.182]  Lady, you make me sick.
[00:15:29.182 --> 00:15:31.683]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[00:15:31.683 --> 00:15:34.705]  One trillion infinities.
[00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:38.247]  The Democratic Party is the party of slavery and the KKK, and
[00:15:40.268 --> 00:15:44.831]  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and segregation made blacks stronger.
[00:15:44.831 --> 00:15:46.072]  I'm not defending it.
[00:15:46.072 --> 00:15:46.953]  It wasn't one evil.
[00:15:46.953 --> 00:15:48.914]  They replaced it with something even worse.
[00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.836]  Leftist brainwashing in the end of their families.
[00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:53.758]  That's what they're doing to everybody now.
[00:15:53.758 --> 00:15:55.519]  We'll be back with the really big news.
[00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.220]  Robots be deployed to U.S.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.341]  citizens' homes to watch you.
[00:15:59.278 --> 00:16:03.139]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:08.141]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:34.776]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:37.797]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.797 --> 00:17:43.719]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.719 --> 00:17:47.520]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.780]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.121]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.121 --> 00:17:56.322]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.322 --> 00:17:57.763]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.879]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.879 --> 00:18:05.641]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:16.930]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:26.857]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:37.404]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.924 --> 00:18:40.546]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.546 --> 00:18:42.268]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.268 --> 00:18:52.276]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:54.919]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:59.623]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.248 --> 00:19:08.634]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.634 --> 00:19:10.096]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:14.799]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:19.803]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:19:20.043 --> 00:19:40.203]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.683 --> 00:19:44.686]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:44.027]  Looking for you to start up a fight!
[00:20:44.027 --> 00:21:01.351]  A little bit of old school Metallica from the Kill Em All album.
[00:21:01.351 --> 00:21:01.991]  Seek In.
[00:21:03.024 --> 00:21:04.185]  Seek and destroy!
[00:21:04.185 --> 00:21:13.974]  Or politically correct, search and clear!
[00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:16.437]  Seek and destroy!
[00:21:16.437 --> 00:21:20.140]  Seek and destroy globalist operations!
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.662]  Seek and destroy!
[00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:22.082]  All over the world!
[00:21:32.284 --> 00:21:33.205]  Good stuff right there.
[00:21:33.205 --> 00:21:37.388]  And we're doing it through intellectual prowess.
[00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:41.872]  We're doing it through determination and dogged true grit.
[00:21:41.872 --> 00:21:46.476]  The animating contest of liberty is now.
[00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:48.718]  Let me do this.
[00:21:48.718 --> 00:21:58.506]  Let me be a good boy in this segment because it's so important I tell you what's coming up and not just digress because I say here's what's coming up and then I hit one stack and then I go off into that instead of saying what's coming up.
[00:21:58.506 --> 00:22:00.668]  So I'm going to discipline myself right now and I'm doing it.
[00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:06.857]  Top Dim Trump GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh.
[00:22:06.857 --> 00:22:11.780]  Politico After failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dims wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.703]  Taylor Swift bashes Blackburn in favor of Tennessee Dims, breaking political silence.
[00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:22.767]  Kanye West quits social media amid criticism for pro-Trump remarks.
[00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:27.329]  Brazil's Donald Trump wins overwhelming support in first round of presidential vote.
[00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:29.211]  After they almost killed him.
[00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:29.751]  Tough hombre.
[00:22:31.443 --> 00:22:36.805]  Asylum seeker brutally rapes child who was teaching him German.
[00:22:36.805 --> 00:22:38.465]  We're gonna cover this first in a moment.
[00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:43.767]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room and watches you for your own good.
[00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:47.528]  It's an imperial probe droid.
[00:22:47.528 --> 00:22:49.449]  Good chance the Empire knows we're here.
[00:22:49.449 --> 00:22:51.149]  Better start the evacuation.
[00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:54.070]  Instead, oh come on in my little copy taker.
[00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.571]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:22:56.991 --> 00:22:58.553]  Google's in trouble.
[00:22:58.553 --> 00:23:01.496]  Caught working with the Chi-Coms on their AI weapon system.
[00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:12.787]  They've been summoned to the Pentagon to go tell them that we are not going to work with America, because we've all been trained to hate America, but we'll kill your friend and pat him on the head.
[00:23:12.787 --> 00:23:15.449]  So we'll see how that goes.
[00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:17.011]  Oh, it's getting better by the minute, isn't it?
[00:23:17.011 --> 00:23:18.533]  These people are crazy.
[00:23:18.533 --> 00:23:19.694]  So we're going to break all that down.
[00:23:21.189 --> 00:23:23.290]  Also, I didn't get through this yesterday, but I'm going to cover it today.
[00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.952]  Microwave weapons are prime suspect in the ills of U.S.
[00:23:25.952 --> 00:23:30.674]  Embassy, and it's the same microwave relay frequency that G5's in.
[00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:46.782]  And there's even mainline scientists coming out and saying that the new communication systems that they're coming out with are really mind control devices.
[00:23:46.782 --> 00:23:49.364]  You know, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:23:50.723 --> 00:23:58.648]  So we're going to be getting to more of all that coming up.
[00:23:58.648 --> 00:24:00.309]  We're showing footage of people getting hit with microwaves.
[00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:03.230]  We're going to be breaking more of this down coming up.
[00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:09.174]  And then we're obviously going to get into the Twitter trolls, the Google trolls, the Facebook trolls.
[00:24:09.174 --> 00:24:17.259]  They're now threatening to ban people and banning people if they say Christopher Columbus was a good guy or George Washington was a good guy or you quote
[00:24:18.354 --> 00:24:21.495]  Winston Churchill, you're bad.
[00:24:21.495 --> 00:24:28.137]  And, oh, we're not going to celebrate Columbus Day in Columbus, Ohio, and Austin's going to rename to some new name.
[00:24:28.137 --> 00:24:31.138]  It's Maya Angelou or something.
[00:24:31.138 --> 00:24:38.001]  Because if they can do that, they can get rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, because some of those people were slave owners.
[00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:38.481]  That's what it is.
[00:24:39.807 --> 00:24:46.750]  They won't talk about sex slaves in Saudi Arabia, or black slaves in Africa right now, or how Christians in the West ended slavery in most areas of the world.
[00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.190]  No!
[00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.532]  Because we're the ones that ended it, we have the guilt.
[00:24:51.532 --> 00:25:03.778]  Then continuing, Cray's leftist tweet about ruining Kavanaugh's life gives us a window into their main game plan, and then that ties into, 29 days out,
[00:25:06.653 --> 00:25:27.757]  How they're pledging to still try to unseat Kavanaugh, but many Democrats are now saying, no, we're not going to try to unseat him now because they don't want any criminal investigations into the fantastical contradictions of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who, by the way, come back full circle,
[00:25:29.298 --> 00:25:42.108]  Writes papers on 5G-type wavelengths being used to soothe the mind of the average person.
[00:25:42.108 --> 00:25:43.930]  Isn't that crazy how it's just everywhere now?
[00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:44.790]  Mainstream news.
[00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.832]  Oh, 5G can control your brain.
[00:25:46.832 --> 00:25:47.713]  Oh, we're deploying it.
[00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:51.256]  Oh, little robots are going to be in your house and track and trace everything you do.
[00:25:51.256 --> 00:25:52.837]  That's coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:25:54.670 --> 00:26:09.775]  Because it's a new level of the rollout of the little home assistants that are watching you, listening to you, they're watching what you click, what you do, what you say, what you write, what you speak, but now they're gonna be watching you and tracking you openly!
[00:26:09.775 --> 00:26:12.235]  So that's all coming up next segment.
[00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:24.259]  Now I've got something that is a huge announcement that is extremely exciting, and I hope everyone listens up very, very clearly to this, because we've had a lot of big sales at InfoWarstore.com, but this is hands down the biggest we've ever had,
[00:26:25.652 --> 00:26:30.315]  And this was going to be the Christmas specials.
[00:26:30.315 --> 00:26:35.859]  But because, as you know, they've taken PayPal from us, they're trying to get our other payment processors.
[00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:39.341]  We're preparing all sorts of legal systems to that, obviously.
[00:26:39.341 --> 00:26:42.463]  This is the next, they want the NRA's payment processors.
[00:26:42.463 --> 00:26:44.965]  They're saying they're going to kill members of Congress.
[00:26:44.965 --> 00:26:46.486]  The Democrats said they're going to get more ruthless.
[00:26:46.486 --> 00:26:48.067]  This is real racketeering.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:57.302]  Combines, cartels, working in unison to punish people politically for wanting an American resurgence and free market and family values.
[00:26:57.302 --> 00:26:59.903]  This is true bullying.
[00:26:59.903 --> 00:27:10.305]  So to counter all that, I'm just going to go ahead and sell even all of our best-selling items and even things that are about to sell out or have already sold out.
[00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:16.367]  We are doing the Christmas Black Friday Cyber Monday all rolled into one for at least a week.
[00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:24.341]  On every supplement at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and many of the other items.
[00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:31.724]  Now, things like water filtration and air filtration, there's not even 50% in our profit and the maker's profit.
[00:27:31.724 --> 00:27:37.607]  I mean, like Alexa Pure Breeze, when we sell it 200 bucks, you know, we're making 50 bucks, they're making 50 bucks.
[00:27:37.607 --> 00:27:41.769]  When we sell it 150, we're making like $25, they're making $25.
[00:27:41.769 --> 00:27:44.130]  And leading competitors are 600, 700.
[00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.031]  And these are just as good.
[00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:47.152]  They just don't have all the markup in them.
[00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:50.040]  So that's my philosophy.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.822]  So, everything is massively discounted.
[00:27:53.822 --> 00:27:58.185]  There are some things that are 50% off because there's not even 50% markup in them.
[00:27:58.185 --> 00:27:59.285]  You understand?
[00:27:59.285 --> 00:28:01.727]  There's not even, it's not there.
[00:28:01.727 --> 00:28:08.111]  So, Happys, Brain Force, X2, even though it's the last run of X2, and even though we almost sold out all of it, you know what?
[00:28:08.111 --> 00:28:08.871]  It's 50% off.
[00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:13.094]  Because we're gonna build our war chest.
[00:28:13.094 --> 00:28:16.176]  They want to shut down this year ahead of trying to destroy Trump.
[00:28:17.253 --> 00:28:22.238]  And so we need to fill our coffers that are running on the low end.
[00:28:22.238 --> 00:28:25.741]  You know, we're not on empty, we're not on reserve, but we can get there quick.
[00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:28.083]  So I need to do some massive re-air fueling.
[00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:33.628]  It's a great way for you to support the M4 War, stand up to these bullies, get great products, and go ahead and just buy your Christmas gifts.
[00:28:33.628 --> 00:28:39.393]  Go ahead and buy what you want of Happy's, or Rainforest, or Ultimate, Bone Broth, or Knockout.
[00:28:40.234 --> 00:28:42.857]  Or the Real Red Pill Plus, it's really amazing.
[00:28:42.857 --> 00:28:45.240]  Or X2, or Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.124]  Go ahead and stock up yourself, and go ahead and do your Christmas shopping.
[00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:51.907]  Because quite frankly, you might be doing it by mail order if you wait.
[00:28:51.907 --> 00:28:54.190]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.912]  They're trying to stop you, don't let them.
[00:28:59.557 --> 00:29:01.718]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[00:29:01.718 --> 00:29:02.499]  Not true.
[00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:04.340]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.342]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:09.462]  Introducing Protovite.

[00:29:30.606 --> 00:29:34.528]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:29:34.528 --> 00:29:36.068]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:29:36.068 --> 00:29:39.029]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:44.571]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:29:44.571 --> 00:29:45.791]  I can help you, too.

[00:29:55.374 --> 00:29:57.675]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[00:30:59.975 --> 00:31:10.583]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.

[00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.891]  It is a classical 360 win.

[00:33:02.801 --> 00:33:05.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.886 --> 00:33:25.431]  Well, I don't want to say that the AP is plagiarizing me, but I...
[00:33:33.897 --> 00:33:35.018]  I like it.
[00:33:35.018 --> 00:33:35.879]  I like what they've said.
[00:33:35.879 --> 00:33:36.379]  I like what they've done.
[00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:38.360]  Maybe they just get the metaphor.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.442]  But here's the headline from AP.
[00:33:40.442 --> 00:33:45.385]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes.
[00:33:45.385 --> 00:33:53.451]  Because you know, metaphysically, evil has to trick you to invite it into your life.
[00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:57.894]  And then God will step aside and it can have its way with you.
[00:33:57.894 --> 00:34:00.296]  But that is a metaphysical rule of the universe.
[00:34:00.296 --> 00:34:02.618]  It's not just in vampire movies.
[00:34:07.947 --> 00:34:11.869]  Don't ever invite a vampire into your house, you silly boy.
[00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:14.311]  It renders you powerless.
[00:34:14.311 --> 00:34:15.591]  Did you know that?
[00:34:15.591 --> 00:34:17.012]  Of course.
[00:34:17.012 --> 00:34:18.513]  Everyone knows that.
[00:34:18.513 --> 00:34:20.294]  Has everyone gone crazy here?
[00:34:20.294 --> 00:34:23.015]  What's the matter with all of you?
[00:34:23.015 --> 00:34:25.677]  It was you I was after all along, Lucy.
[00:34:25.677 --> 00:34:26.837]  What?
[00:34:26.837 --> 00:34:34.242]  I knew that if I could get Sam and Michael into the family, there's no way you could say no.
[00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:34.942]  Where's Michael?
[00:34:35.922 --> 00:34:38.123]  It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.
[00:34:38.123 --> 00:34:47.788]  Just like one big happy family.
[00:34:47.788 --> 00:34:51.811]  Your boys... and my boys.
[00:34:51.811 --> 00:34:52.691]  Great!
[00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:54.712]  The blood's sucking pretty much!
[00:34:54.712 --> 00:34:59.675]  But I still want you, Lucy.
[00:34:59.675 --> 00:35:01.096]  I haven't changed my mind about that.
[00:35:02.596 --> 00:35:04.496]  I didn't invite you this time, Max.
[00:35:04.496 --> 00:35:07.897]  So, there's the metaphysical archetype, and that's what this is.
[00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:13.978]  And if you're dumb enough, you've already invited the smartphones in there tracking and tracing everything you do, selling the data.
[00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:15.598]  They're already censoring.
[00:35:15.598 --> 00:35:19.479]  iPhones won't even let you go to our RSS feed on my website.
[00:35:19.479 --> 00:35:20.239]  That's a link.
[00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:23.480]  They've hijacked it at the URL level.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.941]  They won't let you send emojis of Taiwan and their flag, or the name Taiwan, in China.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.263]  And Google and Apple all over there, yay, yay, we love it!
[00:35:35.263 --> 00:35:38.225]  And now, they want you to fully embrace it.
[00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:54.995]  Remember how I, 20 years ago, was in several documentaries like Secret Rulers of the World and others, and I remember being made fun of when I was on several national programs, and I pointed out that I had a tape over the webcam in my house.
[00:35:56.089 --> 00:36:00.393]  And then later, people noticed Zuckerberg, five years ago, had his webcam covered.
[00:36:00.393 --> 00:36:01.234]  And again, two years ago.
[00:36:01.234 --> 00:36:03.196]  And so did Comey, and people asked him why.
[00:36:03.196 --> 00:36:06.299]  And he said, well, folks can hack in and watch and listen.
[00:36:06.299 --> 00:36:13.626]  It's the big tech companies, and they've already gotten away with all this, so why shouldn't they try to get away with more?
[00:36:15.572 --> 00:36:29.582]  Because remember, what Zuckerberg said when he was getting investors to have Facebook go public, and he was at the Bilderberg Group, and parts of it over the years leaked, and he said multiple emails, he said, I can't believe how effing dumb people are.
[00:36:29.582 --> 00:36:33.604]  They effing trust us, the dumb effers.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:35.726]  Very big little potty mouth on him.
[00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.307]  But look, he's a predator!
[00:36:37.307 --> 00:36:38.488]  Has a little psychotic smile.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.141]  And so he's selling your data.
[00:36:42.141 --> 00:36:43.502]  They're trading your data.
[00:36:43.502 --> 00:36:44.062]  They're listening.
[00:36:44.062 --> 00:36:47.044]  They're watching all the Facebook apps, the Google apps.
[00:36:47.044 --> 00:36:54.468]  It came out 10 years ago that the Google cars drive around with those antennas and grab all your personal data and your passcodes.
[00:36:54.468 --> 00:36:57.469]  And then they transfer the data offshore.
[00:36:57.469 --> 00:37:00.191]  Then they have third parties break into all your stuff and sell it.
[00:37:00.191 --> 00:37:02.552]  And now they officially help China, Google and Apple.
[00:37:03.973 --> 00:37:13.042]  With surveillance grids and censorship grids and censorship apps that the public has to have in order to even have a smartphone.
[00:37:13.042 --> 00:37:17.266]  They built it, what, in 2006.
[00:37:17.266 --> 00:37:20.429]  They got caught over there in China.
[00:37:20.429 --> 00:37:21.871]  Google did.
[00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:23.773]  And so they backed off for a while.
[00:37:23.773 --> 00:37:26.716]  So everything you hear about Dragonfly, all this stuff is old news.
[00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:30.408]  So, why was I banned?
[00:37:30.408 --> 00:37:36.054]  The biggest thing ahead of the midterms was I was making this a central issue and I knew I was getting information from the President.
[00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:37.855]  But now you see it's the big number one issue.
[00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.018]  And I have an article that I forgot to get out of the printer.
[00:37:40.018 --> 00:37:41.379]  You guys bring that to me please.
[00:37:41.379 --> 00:37:42.740]  Thank you so much.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.383]  The White House Chief Economic Advisor warns U.S.
[00:37:45.383 --> 00:37:48.846]  companies not to invest in China.
[00:37:48.846 --> 00:37:51.649]  That's the Associated Press as well.
[00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:55.842]  Didn't get printed, it's no big deal.
[00:37:55.842 --> 00:38:02.223]  About 10 minutes ago during the break, I was in there and I said, this printed wrong, can I please have it?
[00:38:02.223 --> 00:38:09.285]  If not, Daniels can come back in and give it to me again, I know he tried to give it to me, and I will just read the one that's cut off, it's fine.
[00:38:09.285 --> 00:38:11.725]  Or we can search engine, I can do it.
[00:38:11.725 --> 00:38:14.306]  I'll do it myself, if I have to, no big deal.
[00:38:14.306 --> 00:38:19.487]  But I wanna show people this because I need that little critical piece of intel.
[00:38:22.295 --> 00:38:25.258]  I just want that one little piece that I needed.
[00:38:25.258 --> 00:38:26.218]  Just that one thing.
[00:38:26.218 --> 00:38:28.480]  I'm just doing it so badly.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.923]  Oh my God, I'm out of now.
[00:38:31.923 --> 00:38:33.024]  I've become OCD.
[00:38:33.024 --> 00:38:34.786]  It is a serious problem now.
[00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:40.851]  Now, stay away from China, White House top economic economist tells U.S.
[00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:41.352]  businesses.
[00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:46.044]  Yahoo Finance, AP, Bloomberg are all reporting it.
[00:38:46.044 --> 00:38:49.227]  Stay away from China, White House top economist tells U.S.
[00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:49.707]  businesses.
[00:38:49.707 --> 00:38:52.090]  We're going to get to more of that in the next segment.
[00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:56.794]  But right now, let me give you the big drum roll and the big news, because you know how I do it.
[00:38:56.794 --> 00:39:02.099]  I tend to give you the background news first, just to remind you of the history and the rest of it.
[00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:03.520]  I know most of you know more than I do.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.002]  I'm just, it's for the new viewers.
[00:39:05.002 --> 00:39:06.103]  They're the really important people.
[00:39:07.671 --> 00:39:08.992]  It's like the lost sheep scenario.
[00:39:08.992 --> 00:39:11.573]  Why would you spend so much time with this little sheep when you've got thousands of them?
[00:39:11.573 --> 00:39:14.974]  Because that's why I have thousands, is I try to take care of the sheep.
[00:39:14.974 --> 00:39:17.055]  And it's the prodigal son.
[00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:23.858]  The bad, spoiled son goes away, spends his inheritance, comes back five years later totally broke and brain dead.
[00:39:23.858 --> 00:39:30.982]  And the father kills the top cow, the juiciest cow, and has a big party and orders huge celebration.
[00:39:30.982 --> 00:39:33.203]  And the good son says, Dad, you never did any of this for me.
[00:39:35.307 --> 00:39:40.391]  Imagine how big the party would be for you when you're way better than your younger son if you came back, buddy.
[00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:42.132]  I love you a lot more than him.
[00:39:42.132 --> 00:39:44.594]  But we don't need to do all that for you.
[00:39:44.594 --> 00:39:48.156]  We're celebrating this fact that your brother's back.
[00:39:48.156 --> 00:39:52.199]  You don't need to have the big celebration to make you understand you're part of the family.
[00:39:52.199 --> 00:39:53.721]  You're smarter than he is.
[00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:54.921]  You've got the birthright.
[00:39:54.921 --> 00:39:56.763]  You get everything when I die.
[00:39:56.763 --> 00:39:58.084]  I didn't need to do that.
[00:40:00.233 --> 00:40:01.734]  That's why you're the number one son.
[00:40:01.734 --> 00:40:03.815]  And he's like, oh, I get it.
[00:40:03.815 --> 00:40:05.036]  You see how that works?
[00:40:05.036 --> 00:40:08.678]  We're trying to wake up the victims of this stuff before it's too late.
[00:40:08.678 --> 00:40:11.199]  That's who we're targeting.
[00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:13.320]  The targets, the ones that globalists are feeding on.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.322]  Excuse me, let me get back to this.
[00:40:16.322 --> 00:40:22.425]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes.
[00:40:25.066 --> 00:40:32.387]  It's what you've already done, ladies and gentlemen, but now they're just throwing it in your face, and they say, oh, it watches you, it listens to you, it gives recommendations.
[00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:36.308]  It's never off, and it's gonna run your life.
[00:40:36.308 --> 00:40:43.509]  Imagine if I showed up at your house with a camera, and I said, you know, I'm just gonna put this camera in your house and watch you, and I'm only one guy.
[00:40:43.509 --> 00:40:46.290]  You'd flip out and say you're crazy, get off my front porch.
[00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:54.511]  But if it's Zuckerberg that says you're a dumb effort, and it's all tied into everything else, and it gets better, he's joined Google and Apple in AI development,
[00:40:55.231 --> 00:41:07.814]  In China, and they helped put spy chips in the Apple products to help China steal all your data, including the Pentagon and the NSA, and they jacked into everything, and the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:41:07.814 --> 00:41:12.255]  That's why Zuckerberg and none of them respect us.
[00:41:12.255 --> 00:41:16.857]  They've already gotten away with everything.
[00:41:16.857 --> 00:41:17.797]  We are a joke!
[00:41:19.517 --> 00:41:21.078]  And they're all American haters.
[00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:30.761]  They're corporations and bureaucracies who got together when America had half the wealth 50 years ago, and they said, let's sell this son of a gun out.
[00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:35.383]  And they built up China and India and 100 plus other countries, but not their people.
[00:41:35.383 --> 00:41:38.164]  The middle classes got smaller.
[00:41:38.164 --> 00:41:38.484]  On average.
[00:41:39.468 --> 00:41:40.989]  Because they want a giant sucking sound.
[00:41:40.989 --> 00:41:43.911]  They don't want to build a middle class like Ross Perot did.
[00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:50.376]  They want this actuary plan to steal everything and then make you poor so there's no middle class to threaten them.
[00:41:50.376 --> 00:41:52.618]  They are monsters!
[00:41:52.618 --> 00:41:54.079]  They are selfish!
[00:41:54.079 --> 00:42:00.424]  They are cultural, spiritual, genetic psychopath monsters.
[00:42:00.424 --> 00:42:02.805]  And they are wildly criminal.
[00:42:02.805 --> 00:42:05.447]  Oh, but they banned the Nazis off the web.
[00:42:05.447 --> 00:42:07.169]  And then next it's Alex Jones.
[00:42:07.169 --> 00:42:08.029]  And then it's you.
[00:42:08.029 --> 00:42:08.790]  And then it's the NRA.
[00:42:10.211 --> 00:42:11.692]  Oh, and they're virtue signaling.
[00:42:11.692 --> 00:42:22.378]  Oh, we're, you know, teaching people gender fluidity here at Google and some executives make people call them dragonettes in beautiful ornate buildings.
[00:42:22.378 --> 00:42:29.082]  It's all just training people for mental illness and how to submit to pure evil.
[00:42:29.082 --> 00:42:31.283]  So I'll play you some of the video inside your home.
[00:42:32.057 --> 00:42:34.619]  With the Portal, it's called.
[00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:36.121]  Yes, the Portal.
[00:42:36.121 --> 00:42:41.005]  Oh, let's put from Facebook and Apple and Google and the Chi-Coms, the AI Portal.
[00:42:41.005 --> 00:42:45.229]  Directly in our house with all this little Imperial Probe Droid eyes.
[00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:47.151]  Hooked into the big AI systems.
[00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:49.573]  That's a great idea.
[00:42:49.573 --> 00:42:52.616]  Why don't you let Jeffrey Dahmer babysit your kids, too?
[00:42:52.616 --> 00:42:54.478]  That might get you a better result.
[00:42:59.275 --> 00:43:03.189]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:43:04.562 --> 00:43:13.225]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:43:13.225 --> 00:43:15.206]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:43:15.206 --> 00:43:18.667]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:21.288]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:43:21.288 --> 00:43:23.569]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:30.532]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:43:31.072 --> 00:43:40.874]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:43:40.874 --> 00:43:42.054]  We'll win.
[00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:44.955]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:52.116]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:43:52.116 --> 00:43:55.796]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[00:43:55.796 --> 00:43:57.357]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:43:57.357 --> 00:43:58.217]  We need your support.
[00:43:58.217 --> 00:43:58.757]  I'm counting on you.
[00:43:59.244 --> 00:44:01.607]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:44:01.607 --> 00:44:08.196]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[00:45:00.054 --> 00:45:08.563]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:45:08.563 --> 00:45:10.024]  Believe me, I know.
[00:45:10.024 --> 00:45:14.729]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:45:14.729 --> 00:45:17.792]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[00:45:18.272 --> 00:45:19.953]  I still have that energy.
[00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:40.107]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:47:21.365 --> 00:47:22.525]  Big Brother.
[00:47:22.525 --> 00:47:23.526]  Mainstream Media.
[00:47:23.526 --> 00:47:25.147]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:25.147 --> 00:47:27.908]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:27.908 --> 00:47:29.529]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:29.529 --> 00:47:33.792]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:33.792 --> 00:47:35.993]  Princess, we have a visitor.
[00:47:38.743 --> 00:47:41.586]  Picked up something outside the base zone 12 moving east.
[00:47:41.586 --> 00:47:42.387]  It's metal.
[00:47:42.387 --> 00:47:43.768]  Then it couldn't be one of those creatures.
[00:47:43.768 --> 00:47:45.650]  Could be a speeder, one of ours.
[00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.371]  No.
[00:47:47.371 --> 00:47:48.252]  Wait.
[00:47:48.252 --> 00:47:53.978]  There's something very weak coming through.
[00:47:53.978 --> 00:47:57.001]  Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.
[00:47:57.001 --> 00:47:58.923]  This signal is not used by the Alliance.
[00:47:58.923 --> 00:48:00.044]  It could be an Imperial code.
[00:48:06.078 --> 00:48:07.200]  It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.222]  Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
[00:48:42.101 --> 00:48:48.924]  I'm afraid there's not much left.
[00:48:48.924 --> 00:48:49.464]  What was it?
[00:48:49.464 --> 00:48:50.445]  A droid of some kind.
[00:48:50.445 --> 00:48:51.605]  I didn't hit it that hard.
[00:48:51.605 --> 00:48:53.646]  It must have had a self-destruct.
[00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:55.527]  An Imperial probe droid.
[00:48:55.527 --> 00:48:58.388]  It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
[00:48:58.388 --> 00:48:59.669]  We better start the evacuation.
[00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:11.024]  Oh, but Mark Zuckerberg, he's just building AI with Google and Apple in China and helping round everyone up.
[00:49:11.024 --> 00:49:16.608]  And Tim Cook's in the front of major papers saying, I support Chinese censorship and I want it in America.
[00:49:16.608 --> 00:49:19.790]  And taking Jones off hundreds of platforms at once.
[00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.352]  Well, it's called curation.
[00:49:22.352 --> 00:49:24.794]  We're curating everything.
[00:49:24.794 --> 00:49:29.258]  And just bring this into your house and just be a trusting, crazy soy boy.
[00:49:32.204 --> 00:49:33.185]  Hi!
[00:49:33.185 --> 00:49:39.088]  I want to put a little thing in there that watches you and tracks you with AI technology!
[00:49:39.088 --> 00:49:40.509]  Trust me!
[00:49:40.509 --> 00:49:41.830]  I'm not the American Psycho!
[00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:45.472]  Hi ladies, would you like to... You're hitchhiking, I see.
[00:49:45.472 --> 00:49:47.733]  Would you like to get in the car with me?
[00:49:47.733 --> 00:49:50.915]  What planet are we on?
[00:49:50.915 --> 00:49:52.436]  Our users trust us.
[00:49:52.436 --> 00:49:55.178]  Dumb effers.
[00:49:55.178 --> 00:49:56.659]  So there's a little Zuckerlyberg.
[00:49:57.961 --> 00:49:59.322]  And I can joke around about it.
[00:49:59.322 --> 00:50:01.063]  This is deadly serious.
[00:50:01.063 --> 00:50:20.358]  You see, it's the over-the-topness of big tech, the globalists, under Obama, under Hillary, under the big plan, moving all the tech to China, giving them all our military secrets, allowing them to put spy tech in all the major consumer electronics and phones, which I told you 10 years ago.
[00:50:20.358 --> 00:50:24.942]  We wrote articles 10 years ago giving you exactly what was happening.
[00:50:26.854 --> 00:50:28.435]  And that's why I'm the number one enemy.
[00:50:28.435 --> 00:50:31.216]  I told you they're buying the debt before it became big news.
[00:50:31.216 --> 00:50:33.517]  Because I was reading the CFR like 15 years ago.
[00:50:33.517 --> 00:50:35.017]  They said, we're going to position the U.S.
[00:50:35.017 --> 00:50:37.458]  as a debtor to China, transfer everything so the U.S.
[00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:38.839]  has to capitulate.
[00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:42.901]  So we can have an orderly ascendance of the Chinese century.
[00:50:42.901 --> 00:50:44.221]  These are quotes.
[00:50:44.221 --> 00:50:48.283]  I'm reading this going, this is from David Rockefeller.
[00:50:48.283 --> 00:50:51.584]  It's from these jerks!
[00:50:51.584 --> 00:50:53.465]  And then I started talking to high-level Hollywood folks.
[00:50:54.753 --> 00:50:57.515]  And they're like, oh yeah, the Chinese are buying everything up.
[00:50:57.515 --> 00:50:58.616]  And now that's mainstream news.
[00:50:58.616 --> 00:50:59.656]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:02.458]  China now owns Hollywood.
[00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:05.200]  And it's insane what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.082]  And now they're financing the Arab Spring against us.
[00:51:08.082 --> 00:51:09.583]  They are our enemies.
[00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:15.387]  And that's why the White House has come out and told companies, you better abandon China.
[00:51:15.387 --> 00:51:21.731]  And now even the establishment's going, okay, it's hard to give up on them, but you're right, because your check made it.
[00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:34.055]  Just because Obama and Hillary and everybody finished the process of transferring everything to China, you didn't get the presidency to put the cherry on top and now the rug's being pulled out from under you.
[00:51:34.055 --> 00:51:41.038]  You got this big dinner table set and Trump walked over and he's not pulling the tablecloth off that trick and leaving stuff on the table.
[00:51:41.038 --> 00:51:45.479]  Remember my dad, when I was a kid, did that once in front of me and only one glass fell over?
[00:51:45.479 --> 00:51:46.420]  My mother was impressed.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.221]  We're watching a movie or something and they didn't move my neck.
[00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:50.142]  I can do that.
[00:51:50.142 --> 00:51:53.224]  Like the next day we're about to have dinner and my neck goes like pulls the whole thing off.
[00:51:53.224 --> 00:51:56.386]  But the point is, Trump's not doing it where the stuff stays on.
[00:51:56.386 --> 00:51:58.107]  He's just dragging it all off the table.
[00:51:58.107 --> 00:51:59.808]  How do you like that, globalist?
[00:51:59.808 --> 00:52:02.869]  And they're crapping their dirty little britches.
[00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:06.011]  This is a time to say hip hip hooray.
[00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:07.212]  Frabjous day.
[00:52:07.212 --> 00:52:09.253]  Kaloo kalay.
[00:52:09.253 --> 00:52:11.274]  We have slain the Jabberwocky.
[00:52:11.274 --> 00:52:13.055]  That went floofle as it went.
[00:52:13.055 --> 00:52:15.417]  But I have not gotten to that yet.
[00:52:15.417 --> 00:52:16.037]  Continuing here.
[00:52:17.674 --> 00:52:18.936]  This is critical.
[00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:21.799]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes!
[00:52:21.799 --> 00:52:22.741]  AP!
[00:52:22.741 --> 00:52:24.923]  Infowars.com!
[00:52:24.923 --> 00:52:27.607]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room!
[00:52:27.607 --> 00:52:30.090]  Gee, I bet this won't be used to spy on everyone!
[00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:35.417]  And let's go ahead and go to the little promo piece with a bunch of soy boys, smiling all the way!
[00:52:35.417 --> 00:52:35.918]  Here it is!
[00:52:36.983 --> 00:52:40.504]  Meet Portal and Portal Plus from Facebook.
[00:52:40.504 --> 00:52:44.505]  A new way to connect that makes you feel like you're in the same room.
[00:52:44.505 --> 00:52:50.747]  Portal's smart camera follows the action, keeping you in frame and everyone in view.
[00:52:50.747 --> 00:52:54.388]  Smart sound focuses on your voice, minimizing the rest.
[00:52:54.388 --> 00:52:56.949]  That's what it's supposed to do.
[00:52:56.949 --> 00:52:58.270]  You stay in control.
[00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:02.391]  Disable the camera and microphone with a single tap or flip the cover over the camera lens.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:08.682]  You can connect with your closest contacts from Facebook and Messenger, even if they don't have Portal.
[00:53:08.682 --> 00:53:13.704]  And when you're not in a call, Portal displays photos, videos, and events.
[00:53:13.704 --> 00:53:20.006]  And Portal has Amazon Alexa built in, so you can ask a question, check the weather, or set the mood.
[00:53:20.006 --> 00:53:23.587]  Alexa, dim the lights.
[00:53:23.587 --> 00:53:27.068]  Portal is a whole new way to spend more time with your favorite people.
[00:53:27.068 --> 00:53:31.410]  Hey, guys, bring me... I know we got the older Alexas around here for jokes, but can we bring one in here later?
[00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:32.470]  I want to tell it to kill itself.
[00:53:33.595 --> 00:53:37.236]  I want to ask about the Chinese Communist and stuff like that.
[00:53:37.236 --> 00:53:42.538]  But seriously, you notice, oh, it dials in on your voice with voice print.
[00:53:42.538 --> 00:53:45.079]  It can listen to you in three rooms away.
[00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:57.003]  The Kinect systems nine years ago, eight years ago, admitted that they could see through your walls using basically a form of radar, sound waves.
[00:53:57.003 --> 00:54:01.905]  I mean, these things are Trojan horses of Trojan horses, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:03.007 --> 00:54:07.409]  And so, sounds great, but you know who the company is.
[00:54:07.409 --> 00:54:08.329]  Is this great for your business?
[00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:09.550]  Yeah.
[00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.251]  You just better not have it plugged in all the time or be around it.
[00:54:12.251 --> 00:54:15.133]  You better treat it like a giant rattlesnake in your house.
[00:54:15.133 --> 00:54:24.117]  Because it'd be one thing if it was a security company, trusted, that had a long history of not letting anybody get into their data, and then, you know, this is just for, you know, for your security or whatever.
[00:54:24.117 --> 00:54:26.998]  It's Zuckerberg, man, in bed with the GICOMS!
[00:54:30.987 --> 00:54:39.072]  It'd be like randomly getting an email from some Nigerian prince or something saying, you know, they're saving people from human smugglers or something.
[00:54:39.072 --> 00:54:41.233]  You know the Nigerians are the biggest scammers ever.
[00:54:41.233 --> 00:54:45.035]  You know their national product is scamming people over the internet.
[00:54:45.035 --> 00:54:52.739]  That'd be like coming home and your wife, you know, has brought the Nigerian prince delegation into your house and all they need is a million dollars to save the children.
[00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:54.440]  But this is more dangerous than that!
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.141]  It's Zuckerberg!
[00:54:57.278 --> 00:54:58.719]  You know, they go, oh, be politically correct.
[00:54:58.719 --> 00:55:03.464]  Yes, the gypsy culture of many Romanov gypsies is to rob the cultures around them.
[00:55:03.464 --> 00:55:07.548]  But let's just, you know, bring a gypsy caravan and let them move into your house for a month.
[00:55:07.548 --> 00:55:08.909]  Nothing's going to get stolen.
[00:55:08.909 --> 00:55:10.551]  Your kids aren't going to get kidnapped.
[00:55:10.551 --> 00:55:14.615]  This is more dangerous than bringing a hundred Romanov gypsies into your house.
[00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:22.258]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:55:22.258 --> 00:55:23.079]  We're going to come back.
[00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:26.341]  I've got a great, incredible Millie Weaver, well down to the insanity of the leftist.
[00:55:26.341 --> 00:55:27.402]  She's going to be joining us later.
[00:55:27.402 --> 00:55:29.704]  We have several big guests as well.
[00:55:29.704 --> 00:55:32.086]  I want to get into the left pledging more violence.
[00:55:32.086 --> 00:55:36.028]  Democrats in Politico talking about getting more ruthless.
[00:55:36.028 --> 00:55:40.632]  They've gone full authoritarian.
[00:55:40.632 --> 00:55:42.653]  You don't ever want to go full retard.
[00:55:42.653 --> 00:55:44.695]  Well, they've gone full authoritarian.
[00:55:46.834 --> 00:55:47.774]  So that's coming up.
[00:55:47.774 --> 00:55:49.255]  Critical intel straight ahead.
[00:55:49.255 --> 00:55:50.655]  A ton of clips I haven't gotten to.
[00:55:50.655 --> 00:55:51.836]  Trump on fire this weekend.
[00:55:51.836 --> 00:55:56.178]  Talking about Denang, Dick, Blumenthal, and so much more.
[00:55:56.178 --> 00:55:57.638]  But that's it.
[00:55:57.638 --> 00:55:59.779]  We have launched the biggest sale in our history.
[00:55:59.779 --> 00:56:01.620]  We're planning for Christmas.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:09.563]  But because they're racing to try to shut us down, all the rest of it, it's absolutely critical that you get your shopping in now and your Christmas shopping.
[00:56:11.032 --> 00:56:14.574]  So, we're launching the Christmas Black Friday Cyber Monday all rolled into one.
[00:56:14.574 --> 00:56:15.874]  All the specials.
[00:56:15.874 --> 00:56:20.757]  We were planning for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas.
[00:56:20.757 --> 00:56:22.177]  And we're still around then.
[00:56:22.177 --> 00:56:22.878]  Seriously.
[00:56:22.878 --> 00:56:24.358]  I've got good cheer about this.
[00:56:24.358 --> 00:56:25.619]  We've already devastated the globalists.
[00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:27.220]  And I hope we'll be around.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.101]  I'm sure in some permutation.
[00:56:29.101 --> 00:56:34.583]  But you need to get the products now and support the broadcast so we can be bunkered in, hunkered in.
[00:56:34.583 --> 00:56:35.804]  Supply the Alamo.
[00:56:35.804 --> 00:56:37.405]  We promise we won't give up.
[00:56:37.405 --> 00:56:40.126]  But it'd be good to have a little bacon and a little beans.
[00:56:42.363 --> 00:56:45.085]  To whip the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.
[00:56:45.085 --> 00:56:46.566]  So, they hate you supporting us.
[00:56:46.566 --> 00:56:47.486]  You get great products.
[00:56:47.486 --> 00:56:49.708]  You beat the globalists.
[00:56:49.708 --> 00:56:51.549]  50% off all InfoWars Live products.
[00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:53.590]  Super sale!
[00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:58.654]  And we're just going to continue through the month of October while supplies last of each product.
[00:56:58.654 --> 00:57:00.415]  And every other product is massively discounted.
[00:57:00.415 --> 00:57:01.075]  And did I forget?
[00:57:01.075 --> 00:57:02.697]  Because we probably want to add that or scroll down.
[00:57:02.697 --> 00:57:04.738]  Is it on there that there's free shipping?
[00:57:04.738 --> 00:57:05.338]  There it is!
[00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:05.698]  It's there!
[00:57:06.764 --> 00:57:09.787]  Free shipping store-wide on top of it.
[00:57:09.787 --> 00:57:11.830]  Other incredible specials as well.
[00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.453]  Support the Info War now and get great products.
[00:57:14.453 --> 00:57:17.536]  And yeah, we're getting close to selling out Rainforest and X2, our last run.
[00:57:17.536 --> 00:57:18.217]  Happy's just came in.
[00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:18.837]  It's very popular.
[00:57:18.837 --> 00:57:19.418]  It's amazing.
[00:57:19.418 --> 00:57:21.220]  Knockout, got a lot of that.
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.843]  X2, again, that's running out.
[00:57:23.843 --> 00:57:26.546]  Bodies just came back into stock.
[00:57:27.206 --> 00:57:30.789]  We've got so much more at InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:35.052]  Toothpaste!
[00:57:35.052 --> 00:57:41.156]  50% off, fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue for adults and children, and the mouthwash and immune gargle.
[00:57:41.156 --> 00:57:44.138]  All 50% off, biggest sale ever!
[00:57:44.138 --> 00:57:46.300]  Help fund the InfoWar and take us to victory!
[00:57:50.188 --> 00:57:53.150]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.752]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[00:57:55.752 --> 00:57:57.633]  No one else has this from deep earth.
[00:57:57.633 --> 00:57:59.694]  Crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[00:57:59.694 --> 00:58:01.175]  It's very hard for me to get.
[00:58:01.175 --> 00:58:03.076]  It's the good halogen.
[00:58:03.076 --> 00:58:05.178]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[00:58:05.178 --> 00:58:11.722]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[00:58:11.722 --> 00:58:14.324]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.745]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[00:58:17.066 --> 00:58:22.771]  It's seen as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:24.573]  So these go incredibly well together.
[00:58:24.573 --> 00:58:26.134]  We have a combo of those.
[00:58:26.134 --> 00:58:27.516]  Just experience it for yourself.
[00:58:27.516 --> 00:58:30.238]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[00:58:30.238 --> 00:58:31.279]  Very simple stuff.
[00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:32.921]  Filter your water.
[00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:34.843]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[00:58:34.843 --> 00:58:36.584]  Best out there for the price.
[00:58:36.584 --> 00:58:37.545]  When I say it's the last run,
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.341]  I think it'll be six months a year until we get more.
[00:58:40.341 --> 00:58:41.161]  I hope we get more.
[00:58:41.161 --> 00:58:42.482]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[00:58:42.482 --> 00:58:43.342]  Survival Short Act 2.
[00:58:43.342 --> 00:58:46.564]  InfoWars4.com or InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:50.202 --> 00:59:09.055]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[00:59:09.375 --> 00:59:10.175]  The revolution.
[00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:12.296]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:59:12.296 --> 00:59:16.017]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:16.017 --> 00:59:23.539]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:59:23.539 --> 00:59:25.940]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.580]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.501]  That's my dad.
[00:59:29.501 --> 00:59:31.361]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:59:31.361 --> 00:59:32.982]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[00:59:32.982 --> 00:59:34.502]  And you're purchasing the products
[00:59:37.623 --> 00:59:43.025]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:59:43.025 --> 00:59:53.210]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:14.990]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.371]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:30.720]  So, you know, they always say when they kick you off Google, Facebook, Twitter, when they only put the negative results up about you and you're Donald Trump or Alex Jones at the top, they always say, oh, just build your own thing.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.541]  And then they come after your credit card processors.
[01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:34.543]  They come up with the very software you use on your website.
[01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:40.692]  They come after your very internet service providers, and then they come after your payment processors, everything.
[01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:54.435]  So Andrew Torb at the bottom of the hour from Gab, which again is just a free speech site, so you've got black nationalists, white nationalists, you know, maybe that's 5% of the site, but then you've got just regular conservatives, libertarians, liberals, it's a free-for-all!
[01:00:54.435 --> 01:00:57.756]  Long as you don't, remember how the internet used to be?
[01:00:57.756 --> 01:01:01.857]  Long as you don't call for killing anybody, or you're not selling methamphetamine or whatever,
[01:01:02.878 --> 01:01:05.779]  You can do it, but then they can come into your site and say, look, a Nazi!
[01:01:05.779 --> 01:01:13.061]  And they have the leftist groups call up and go, oh my God, they can't have a donate button on their website.
[01:01:13.061 --> 01:01:13.961]  Take that away!
[01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:16.102]  And you'll get another process company.
[01:01:16.102 --> 01:01:16.962]  Take that away!
[01:01:16.962 --> 01:01:24.384]  And then the Democrats just have a way, even though it's not public who you're using, they know, because they have the Justice Department.
[01:01:24.384 --> 01:01:30.546]  It's nice to have some FBI agents, like, you know, with reality winners, political views.
[01:01:31.776 --> 01:01:48.971]  in there and that's that's what Project Veritas shows they're in there and they're doxing Congress and doxing and it's just fun giving ISIS blueprints and just you know and that Google's helping China build AI to suppress their people with Operation Skynet.
[01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:51.173]  I'm not kidding that's not from Terminator that's what they call it.
[01:01:52.426 --> 01:01:56.109]  I told you Skynet was a Pentagon plan for this big wireless grid.
[01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:57.109]  Now China's doing it.
[01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:59.051]  Because it's all been given to them.
[01:01:59.051 --> 01:02:01.052]  They're the good boys.
[01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:02.473]  China's the good authoritarians.
[01:02:02.473 --> 01:02:06.176]  They don't have that pesky voting and things.
[01:02:06.176 --> 01:02:10.479]  And so, now we've got the head of Interpol, who was a CHICOM.
[01:02:10.479 --> 01:02:12.340]  He was the deputy head of their Navy.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.402]  Civilian military officer heading up Interpol, which he disappeared last week.
[01:02:20.402 --> 01:02:22.763]  Oh, the Chinese told us five days later they grabbed him.
[01:02:22.763 --> 01:02:39.131]  I guess he wasn't doing everything they said, but the CHICOM officer, he was in control of the code keys to basically everyone's IDs, everyone's social security numbers, everyone's information, just like the personnel management hack.
[01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:40.451]  Interpol's not just the U.S., though.
[01:02:40.451 --> 01:02:42.772]  It's everybody's identity.
[01:02:42.772 --> 01:02:43.933]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:02:48.516 --> 01:02:51.258]  How China detained the head of Interpol.
[01:02:51.258 --> 01:02:53.219]  Oh my goodness!
[01:02:53.219 --> 01:03:03.987]  We let one of their top civilian military commanders, the equivalent of a four-star general, run Interpol the last few years.
[01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:06.629]  What could go wrong?
[01:03:06.629 --> 01:03:17.937]  Just when you check in to a hotel, when you get a rental car, anywhere in the Western world, or many other areas of the planet, it logs into Interpol and tells them everything that's going on under the Patriot Act.
[01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:21.924]  That put us into that.
[01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:23.804]  So you show up to rent a car and you always wonder why.
[01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:24.364]  Where you going?
[01:03:24.364 --> 01:03:24.864]  What you doing?
[01:03:24.864 --> 01:03:25.885]  What's happening?
[01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:31.226]  I'm like, I'm here with my four children and I'm really tired.
[01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:31.726]  Oh, really?
[01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:34.687]  And I go, listen, I know you're putting it in that security database.
[01:03:34.687 --> 01:03:36.127]  You know where that goes?
[01:03:36.127 --> 01:03:36.747]  You know that, huh?
[01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:38.688]  And I'm like, yeah, lady, I know that.
[01:03:38.688 --> 01:03:39.868]  And why don't you ask me 20 questions?
[01:03:41.288 --> 01:03:46.853]  But see, oh, let's have this big database that controls everything!
[01:03:46.853 --> 01:03:56.823]  And then let's put the chat comms in control of the AI, of Apple, of Google, of Facebook, of Twitter, everything, because, again, it's a base.
[01:03:56.823 --> 01:03:59.986]  Everybody always says, oh my God, corrupt people use Israel as a base against America.
[01:03:59.986 --> 01:04:02.068]  And some corrupt people do jump back and forth and use it.
[01:04:02.068 --> 01:04:02.549]  Absolutely!
[01:04:03.933 --> 01:04:08.396]  But I've noticed a lot about China and how the globalists are using it as a base to launch attacks on America.
[01:04:08.396 --> 01:04:13.940]  Now, he went to the, a year and a half ago, to the, uh, President Trump got elected to the Davos and said, I'll stop Trump.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.082]  I'll stop, you know, globalism will, you know, will, will defeat America.
[01:04:17.082 --> 01:04:20.144]  And Juncker said, yes, we'll, we'll, we'll defeat America in a trade war.
[01:04:20.144 --> 01:04:21.585]  And they shook hands on that.
[01:04:21.585 --> 01:04:23.266]  That was a declaration of war against us.
[01:04:23.266 --> 01:04:25.008]  Remember, I covered it at the time.
[01:04:25.008 --> 01:04:25.968]  Pretty big deal.
[01:04:25.968 --> 01:04:28.190]  That's how arrogant these guys are.
[01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:31.532]  And people didn't think that was an issue.
[01:04:31.532 --> 01:04:32.493]  Oh, Alex, come on.
[01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:40.120]  But it's Juncker and Soros and the Qaikom leader and all of them, and they just think they're going to get away with all this because our own elite sold us out to it.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.880]  Well, guess what?
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.301]  They didn't have a right to do that!
[01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:49.564]  So Obama and Hillary and Soros and all you that sold us out and Apple, we're evicting your deal with China.
[01:04:49.564 --> 01:04:50.565]  It's a fraud.
[01:04:50.565 --> 01:04:51.465]  It's null and void.
[01:04:51.465 --> 01:04:53.166]  And we're tearing it up.
[01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:56.008]  And a lot of you are in for a big treat.

[01:06:01.926 --> 01:06:04.609]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:09.735]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:32.618]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.393 --> 01:06:40.874]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:06:40.874 --> 01:06:49.396]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:06:49.396 --> 01:07:00.858]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:02.378]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:07:03.178 --> 01:07:19.129]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:07:19.129 --> 01:07:21.851]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:28.235]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:07:30.925 --> 01:07:33.587]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:33.587 --> 01:07:41.615]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:07:41.615 --> 01:07:50.383]  Yeah, my reputation is amazing with the patriots in corporate America, at the Pentagon, and at the patriots at the CIA, and with the President.
[01:07:51.653 --> 01:07:57.974]  Not the whole CIA, not the whole Pentagon, but the people that know the score and who want to sabotage this country.
[01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:58.554]  Guess what?
[01:07:58.554 --> 01:08:00.095]  I'm the test pilot.
[01:08:00.095 --> 01:08:05.636]  I've been volunteering for this mission, never involved with any agencies, any groups.
[01:08:05.636 --> 01:08:07.316]  I knew the globalist threat.
[01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:08.196]  I read their books.
[01:08:08.196 --> 01:08:09.657]  I saw their reports.
[01:08:09.657 --> 01:08:10.717]  I saw their plan building.
[01:08:10.717 --> 01:08:13.857]  Everybody else was scared to take them on.
[01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:16.178]  No one was willing to do it in a high-tech, modern manner.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.721]  And so, we did it.
[01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:21.102]  And you were willing to take them on.
[01:08:21.102 --> 01:08:34.930]  And now, once it's realized that the Clintons and the globalists and the Bushes sold us out to China in a world government plan, and the CFR decades ago said the Chinese century's coming and did everything to sabotage us.
[01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:39.093]  Once people realize that, it's over!
[01:08:39.093 --> 01:08:41.895]  You ask, how could they do this?
[01:08:41.895 --> 01:08:45.997]  Well, you see, America was conquered by the people when they stood up in 1776.
[01:08:48.146 --> 01:09:03.636]  And then by 1789 and the official establishment of the nation, the ideas of rule by the people and due process and checks and balances threatened all the other imperial corrupt systems in the world.
[01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:15.243]  And that's why the big mega banks and the robber barons fund communism and fund socialism and fund the UN and fund all the radical Islam, because they are at odds with the American system, which is really the Renaissance.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:28.524]  And the expression of the Magna Carta in 1215, and the Gutenberg Press 300 years later, and where we are today.
[01:09:28.524 --> 01:09:32.285]  This is all the arc of humanity going to the next level.
[01:09:32.285 --> 01:09:36.966]  We're going to hit some bumps, we're going to go into some valleys, but the arc overall is up, up, up.
[01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:38.867]  And now, the last 200 years, we are...
[01:09:40.217 --> 01:09:40.637]  Leading.
[01:09:40.637 --> 01:09:43.498]  America is leading straight up.
[01:09:43.498 --> 01:09:44.998]  We've already hit escape velocity.
[01:09:44.998 --> 01:09:49.159]  We're already a Type 1 civilization, I can tell you.
[01:09:49.159 --> 01:09:52.099]  But the globalists do not want you to know that.
[01:09:52.099 --> 01:09:53.219]  They want to suppress it.
[01:09:53.219 --> 01:09:54.180]  They want to steal the future.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.020]  And when I say this, it's not hyperbole.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.981]  You see it all over the news now.
[01:09:59.981 --> 01:10:05.522]  Communist China was chosen by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others.
[01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:06.662]  Mao was put into power.
[01:10:08.052 --> 01:10:13.257]  Congress passed laws to give billions of dollars of weapons to Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.
[01:10:13.257 --> 01:10:18.041]  Imagine China if they were a Nationalist country today and really free market, they'd be even more powerful than our friend.
[01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.543]  Then it'd be great!
[01:10:19.543 --> 01:10:19.983]  No.
[01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:31.094]  The Globalists wanted to manage Communist Party, they could control, and then they would make deals to build them up and transfer our industrial might and then maneuver us into a checkmate position.
[01:10:32.648 --> 01:10:39.053]  And Trump understands this, that they had a $900 million trade deficit on us, and all these other things, and he's saying it's wrong.
[01:10:39.053 --> 01:10:55.025]  And now, he's coming out saying China's meddling in our elections, and he gives real, concrete examples of them buying four-page ads and double-spread ads in hundreds of newspapers in battleground states like Ohio, and Michigan, and Florida, and they've got
[01:10:56.462 --> 01:11:02.545]  Paid infomercials on television putting down Trump and they're financing books and movies.
[01:11:02.545 --> 01:11:06.247]  You want to make a movie about Trump being bad or white people being bad?
[01:11:06.247 --> 01:11:09.509]  It will get financed in 10 seconds.
[01:11:09.509 --> 01:11:10.550]  And guess who does it?
[01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.211]  Chinese holding companies.
[01:11:13.211 --> 01:11:18.014]  Why do you think there's hundreds of shows on Netflix about race rioting and whites being bad?
[01:11:18.014 --> 01:11:21.396]  Or hundreds of shows about men being bad?
[01:11:21.396 --> 01:11:23.297]  It's how China divides and conquers!
[01:11:27.045 --> 01:11:39.375]  So the Chinese Communists are allied with the big think tanks, the psychological warfare professors, to give China the intel to understand how to propagandize here in America.
[01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:50.524]  So when you hear Hillary say, Jones gave Russia the American know-how they needed to steal the election, that's her telling you what she did with China.
[01:11:50.524 --> 01:11:54.808]  But they're giving it from the perspective of weird, mentally ill, chip on their shoulder,
[01:11:57.426 --> 01:12:10.488]  Harvard and Yale and Stanford and UT psychology department people and Chicago business school people who are just in their own world.
[01:12:10.488 --> 01:12:13.009]  They don't get what's happened in the world.
[01:12:13.009 --> 01:12:15.249]  And they thought Hillary could win.
[01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:18.330]  She looks like a vampire out of a movie mixed with a joker.
[01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:21.630]  It's a joke to them, but the joke's on them.
[01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:25.951]  So her and her pedophile husband and the rest of them just don't know even what universe they're fighting in.
[01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:29.033]  And so they made the deal with China.
[01:12:29.033 --> 01:12:30.013]  They bragged about it.
[01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.474]  They thought you were idiots.
[01:12:31.474 --> 01:12:35.194]  And then Trump got in because the American people were hungry for it.
[01:12:35.194 --> 01:12:38.135]  Patriots in the government pushed for it.
[01:12:38.135 --> 01:12:43.096]  Matt Drudge, myself, and many others were willing to be attacked and demonized to get the truth out.
[01:12:43.096 --> 01:12:44.236]  You were willing to do it.
[01:12:44.236 --> 01:12:49.457]  And we are kicking the living snot out of them.
[01:12:49.457 --> 01:12:54.378]  We're kicking the living, holy details out of them.
[01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:56.118]  We are stomping their guts out.
[01:12:57.079 --> 01:13:02.181]  We opened a gigantic can of Yosemite Sam on them.
[01:13:02.181 --> 01:13:04.422]  And, I hate globalists.
[01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:08.004]  And they don't know what to do.
[01:13:08.004 --> 01:13:10.625]  InfoWars is where the fuse got lit.
[01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:12.086]  The bomb already blew up.
[01:13:12.086 --> 01:13:18.289]  They're over InfoWars trying to piss on us, thinking that, again, that's how far behind they are.
[01:13:18.289 --> 01:13:22.251]  That's why it's a sick joke.
[01:13:22.251 --> 01:13:22.471]  I mean,
[01:13:24.048 --> 01:13:25.632]  Let me tell the listeners something.
[01:13:25.632 --> 01:13:29.863]  Supporting them for spreading the word, we've already devastated them.
[01:13:29.863 --> 01:13:33.451]  Nationalists are winning all over the world, from Italy to Brazil.
[01:13:37.992 --> 01:13:40.613]  It's going to be tough on those of us that have been on the front line.
[01:13:40.613 --> 01:13:43.795]  We've been singled out for retaliation.
[01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:49.718]  But the tree of liberty gets watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants, jackasses.
[01:13:49.718 --> 01:13:51.399]  And that's what these globalists don't get.
[01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:59.023]  They keep thinking I'm like them and just holding on to life and holding on to power and trying to get on top of people and scheming.
[01:13:59.023 --> 01:14:00.244]  I'm already on top of you!
[01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:02.166]  Spiritually.
[01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:04.108]  I don't even want power.
[01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:06.351]  You get real power, you don't want power.
[01:14:06.351 --> 01:14:07.312]  You people are falling.
[01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:08.534]  I'm talking to the globalists right now.
[01:14:08.534 --> 01:14:10.497]  You're a joke.
[01:14:10.497 --> 01:14:14.822]  So here's the big giant announcement to everybody.
[01:14:14.822 --> 01:14:16.345]  We're winning.
[01:14:16.345 --> 01:14:17.246]  We're going through hell.
[01:14:17.246 --> 01:14:18.768]  We got even bigger challenges down the road.
[01:14:21.596 --> 01:14:25.699]  But don't let anybody demoralize you because you are kicking butt.
[01:14:25.699 --> 01:14:28.361]  And who cares when mainstream media lies about your attacks?
[01:14:28.361 --> 01:14:39.709]  These are all the sellouts and all the scum and all the traitors and all the yes-men who are just groveling and trying to get ahead by how low they can lay on their belly like fat little snakes.
[01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:40.269]  We're men.
[01:14:40.269 --> 01:14:42.531]  We walk on our legs.
[01:14:42.531 --> 01:14:43.772]  We don't bow down in ditches.
[01:14:45.196 --> 01:14:46.157]  We build a world.
[01:14:46.157 --> 01:14:47.237]  We're farmers.
[01:14:47.237 --> 01:14:47.958]  We're engineers.
[01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:49.179]  We're scientists.
[01:14:49.179 --> 01:14:49.759]  We're fathers.
[01:14:49.759 --> 01:14:50.840]  We're mothers.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.280]  We're brothers.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.141]  We're sisters.
[01:14:52.141 --> 01:14:52.661]  We're husbands.
[01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:53.442]  We're wives.
[01:14:53.442 --> 01:14:55.883]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:14:55.883 --> 01:15:03.589]  We're also very, very vicious and very, very destructive and very, very wicked when we need to be.
[01:15:03.589 --> 01:15:06.651]  And the globalists have been finding that out, you see.
[01:15:06.651 --> 01:15:10.434]  All they've got is throngs of mindless zombies that can't even find their butt with both hands.
[01:15:10.434 --> 01:15:11.935]  We have all the tools
[01:15:13.484 --> 01:15:21.854]  If you simply get off the bench and start becoming political and cultural and economic in the fight, and nothing can stop you, you are invincible.
[01:15:21.854 --> 01:15:24.998]  With God's help.
[01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:27.061]  And it's here, and it's now, but I'm going to say it again.
[01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:28.302]  The Big News.
[01:15:29.352 --> 01:15:32.914]  They made a deal to sell us out to China and bring in world government collapses.
[01:15:32.914 --> 01:15:35.736]  In the 11th hour, 58 minutes, it's begun to reverse.
[01:15:35.736 --> 01:15:39.878]  That's why they're in panic mode, it's why they're so criminal, and why they're so dangerous.
[01:15:39.878 --> 01:15:41.719]  It's because they're willing to do anything.
[01:15:41.719 --> 01:15:47.783]  But now they're exposed, and they don't have control of the executive, and that's why we're going to win.
[01:15:47.783 --> 01:15:54.447]  The problem is, they're gonna stage false flags, and some really nasty stuff soon, and our biggest challenges are about to happen.
[01:15:57.307 --> 01:15:59.188]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[01:20:01.116 --> 01:20:03.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:30.551]  Welcome back.
[01:20:30.551 --> 01:20:43.807]  Okay, I have so much news I could do 10 hours of broadcast, but I keep harping on China because it's in the news that the President, the Pentagon, even Congress, big corporations admit, okay, it's been a one-sided deal with China.
[01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:46.069]  It's been a giant crime against our country.
[01:20:46.069 --> 01:20:49.874]  They've been totally and completely sold out.
[01:20:51.454 --> 01:21:02.701]  And now they're transferring the internet control keys over there so that they can run censorship against the rest of the world out of there with a government that supports total tyranny.
[01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:07.884]  And then they've loaded spy chips into all the Chinese appliances, their phones, you name it.
[01:21:07.884 --> 01:21:11.006]  That's Bloomberg Businessweek.
[01:21:11.006 --> 01:21:16.970]  And now, this is from Yahoo News, Associated Press, Reuters is all picking it up.
[01:21:18.283 --> 01:21:21.145]  Stay away from China, White House top economist tells U.S.
[01:21:21.145 --> 01:21:22.085]  business.
[01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:23.686]  As trade tensions escalate between the U.S.
[01:21:23.686 --> 01:21:25.687]  and China, Washington is sending a warning to U.S.
[01:21:25.687 --> 01:21:26.347]  companies.
[01:21:26.347 --> 01:21:28.729]  Think twice about doing business in China.
[01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:33.091]  If I were in business, I would basically just stay away from China right now.
[01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:35.952]  Their misbehavior is so terrible.
[01:21:35.952 --> 01:21:41.956]  Kevin Hassert, chairman of the Economic Council Advisors, said on Yahoo Finance Market Show Friday.
[01:21:41.956 --> 01:21:44.017]  That's why President Trump is taking a hard line with them.
[01:21:44.909 --> 01:21:50.232]  They've got to change the way they behave if they want to be part of the modern world global economy.
[01:21:50.232 --> 01:21:55.895]  No, instead they just do whatever they want because they're a bunch of mad dog communists that have been in power since 1949.
[01:21:55.895 --> 01:22:07.562]  And the children of all the party officials are all billionaires and are just allied with insane anti-American Silicon Valley and again are
[01:22:08.874 --> 01:22:19.802]  Google, all of them are helping censor, they're helping round people up, and they're helping create AI weapon control systems, but won't even work with the Pentagon.
[01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:22.584]  I'd respect the company if they said, I'm not going to work with anybody.
[01:22:22.584 --> 01:22:25.186]  But no, no, no, we're not.
[01:22:25.186 --> 01:22:26.307]  We're America haters.
[01:22:26.307 --> 01:22:29.269]  We won't work with America.
[01:22:29.269 --> 01:22:33.272]  Hazzard also cited the bombshell story from Bloomberg Businessweek, which claims, which claims?
[01:22:34.778 --> 01:22:42.722]  China's military deployed a microchip, and they're in all the devices, to attack hardware and supply chain at an infiltrated U.S.
[01:22:42.722 --> 01:22:44.162]  Tech giants like Amazon and Apple.
[01:22:44.162 --> 01:22:46.243]  Both companies have denied the report.
[01:22:46.243 --> 01:22:48.624]  Oh, and they deny, they censor, they deny their leftists.
[01:22:48.624 --> 01:22:52.706]  But it still raised many concerns about Chinese electronic manufacturers.
[01:22:52.706 --> 01:22:57.929]  Hong Kong listed Lenovo, and ZTA saw share prices drop 15%.
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:05.303]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Zuckerberg, let's pull him up in China.
[01:23:05.303 --> 01:23:07.305]  He agrees with censorship, so does Tim Cook.
[01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:09.186]  Tim Cook, I did a special report on him last week.
[01:23:09.186 --> 01:23:12.309]  Tim Cook, the most dangerous man in the world.
[01:23:12.309 --> 01:23:27.262]  Because he's the bridge, the Trojan horse, and he says, oh, we need to let China censor, it's called curation, curating, like a museum, and I'll want to do that in America.
[01:23:28.786 --> 01:23:36.473]  So he thinks they demonize me, they lie about me, and they pick me as a straw man, then they do it.
[01:23:36.473 --> 01:23:38.195]  So, they're all moving back in.
[01:23:38.195 --> 01:23:41.417]  Big Tech made the decision a few years ago under Obama to move back in.
[01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:42.859]  They've done it, and they never left.
[01:23:42.859 --> 01:23:45.601]  This is the truth.
[01:23:45.601 --> 01:23:48.824]  So, the globalists made a deal to sell us out.
[01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:49.865]  We pointed it out.
[01:23:49.865 --> 01:23:50.966]  Others pointed it out.
[01:23:50.966 --> 01:23:53.408]  Trump got in.
[01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:54.990]  The Russia distraction isn't working.
[01:23:56.897 --> 01:24:00.500]  And it's all coming out and the Democrats are scared.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.044]  How a Pentagon contract became an identity crisis for Google.
[01:24:04.044 --> 01:24:07.827]  New York Times won't work with the Pentagon.
[01:24:07.827 --> 01:24:10.790]  That's Google.
[01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:11.931]  You see?
[01:24:11.931 --> 01:24:17.176]  And now they're going to meet with the Pentagon and say, oh, we're not discriminating against America.
[01:24:17.176 --> 01:24:18.737]  No, the sky's not blue.
[01:24:18.737 --> 01:24:19.578]  No, no, no.
[01:24:23.263 --> 01:24:35.296]  Unbelievable, because China has a billion, 400 million slaves who have high IQs and work hard, and they can be used to leverage out the whole planet if they can have unfair trade advantage.
[01:24:35.296 --> 01:24:37.258]  And that's the plan, and that's why they did it.
[01:24:37.258 --> 01:24:38.380]  I'm done talking about China.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.342]  I've got an hour and 24 minutes on it.
[01:24:40.342 --> 01:24:41.723]  I'm done.
[01:24:41.723 --> 01:24:43.946]  It's just now you see it coming into view.
[01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:46.771]  China is attacking the U.S.
[01:24:46.771 --> 01:24:49.472]  infrastructure and infiltrating it with the help of big tech.
[01:24:49.472 --> 01:24:54.954]  This was a plan under Hillary and Obama to put us into checkmate, to make us capitulate, to capture America.
[01:24:54.954 --> 01:24:56.375]  They're globalist.
[01:24:56.375 --> 01:24:57.955]  China is the globalist stronghold.
[01:24:57.955 --> 01:24:58.856]  They said it Davos.
[01:24:58.856 --> 01:25:02.317]  That's the plan.
[01:25:02.317 --> 01:25:04.578]  Now let's just show images of Zuckerberg with the Chinese president.
[01:25:06.164 --> 01:25:07.985]  So, that's what's going on.
[01:25:07.985 --> 01:25:12.086]  They've got a pliant group, the left thinks they can leverage into global domination.
[01:25:12.086 --> 01:25:16.387]  Well, not if we're aware of it, and not if we start cutting China off.
[01:25:16.387 --> 01:25:19.308]  Who wrote the TPP deal, Hillary?
[01:25:19.308 --> 01:25:21.028]  Who, it turned out, helped write it?
[01:25:21.028 --> 01:25:22.469]  Dianne Feinstein.
[01:25:22.469 --> 01:25:29.250]  And who gave advice in what they wanted if China was going to join TPP, which they never even ended up doing?
[01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:34.552]  Because they just got us to go to the agreement, but then they didn't have to enter it.
[01:25:35.543 --> 01:25:39.368]  And that was the Chinese Chief of Staff she had.
[01:25:39.368 --> 01:25:42.071]  It was her personal aide for over a decade.
[01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:44.694]  A high-level Chinese intelligence operative.
[01:25:44.694 --> 01:25:45.915]  Now confirmed.
[01:25:45.915 --> 01:25:47.036]  Of course!
[01:25:47.036 --> 01:25:49.319]  That's a Chinese seat in the Senate!
[01:25:49.319 --> 01:25:52.503]  They paid for it!
[01:25:52.503 --> 01:25:54.185]  They believe they own us!
[01:25:54.185 --> 01:25:55.446]  They think we're idiots!
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:14.828]  Because when you are brought up like Dianne Feinstein to hate America, and her whole world is hating America, hating Western culture, she's taught to feel inferior, she's taught that she's been put down, and she's an underdog, so if she can metaphysically piss all over America, and run us into the ground with a bunch of soulless chi-com murderers, she'll be a real girl!
[01:26:14.828 --> 01:26:17.069]  Well guess what, you old hunchback witch?
[01:26:17.069 --> 01:26:21.992]  Get ready, because everybody hates you.
[01:26:21.992 --> 01:26:22.532]  So there you go!
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:33.307]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back with the head of Gab that they're trying to take off the internet as well and trying to take their processing away from to get into the censorship wars when he thinks Andrew Torba thinks we should do to fight this.
[01:26:33.307 --> 01:26:36.430]  Then we're going to open the phones up as well after that.
[01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:41.554]  Then I have Conrad Padilla here in studio, Millie Weaver and so much more.
[01:26:43.797 --> 01:26:46.699]  We're also going to play this compilation, part of the compilation.
[01:26:46.699 --> 01:26:49.101]  I've got a bigger one coming up when Millie Weaver joins us.
[01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:51.203]  I'm going to host the fourth hour today.
[01:26:51.203 --> 01:26:54.205]  When Millie Weaver joins us, incredible footage.
[01:26:54.205 --> 01:26:58.609]  She and her crew, she's got two crew members now, not just Gavin, one other fellow.
[01:26:58.609 --> 01:27:00.590]  Just the most amazing stuff.
[01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.533]  Now we're on broadcast TV, so we have to blur out all the even
[01:27:04.742 --> 01:27:08.527]  The shirts that say F this and people flipping the bird.
[01:27:08.527 --> 01:27:11.350]  So you'll see a lot of black cubes and stuff everywhere.
[01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:12.792]  But that's what's happening there.
[01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:15.294]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:27:15.294 --> 01:27:17.477]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:27:17.477 --> 01:27:19.659]  I cannot stress enough how they're trying to shut us down.
[01:27:19.659 --> 01:27:24.765]  I cannot stress enough that because they've taken our payment processor
[01:27:26.786 --> 01:27:35.632]  PayPal, and then we've got some backups, but they are just, like we're a foreign country, the globalists are persecuting us like sanctions, because we're Americans.
[01:27:35.632 --> 01:27:37.714]  Globalism is a sanction on America.
[01:27:37.714 --> 01:27:41.496]  So, I'm seen as Americana, I'm under massive attack, as you know.
[01:27:41.496 --> 01:27:46.880]  Trump now, they say, has lost $2 billion in his businesses since he ran for president and won, with all the persecution.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.500]  Well, guess what?
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.844]  I don't have one-tenth of what he's lost, one-one-hundredth of that.
[01:27:51.844 --> 01:27:53.465]  So, we don't have the money to operate under that.
[01:27:54.332 --> 01:27:59.534]  We've still got shopping carts, you're still able to get orders through, and whatever orders go through will be shipped out.
[01:27:59.534 --> 01:28:06.257]  That's why we're wrapping Christmas and Black Friday and Cyber Monday all into one now, and saying get your products now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:07.762 --> 01:28:10.404]  And go ahead and order the Christmas stuff you're going to need.
[01:28:10.404 --> 01:28:15.528]  You know, some X2, some Colloil Silver, Silver Bullet, some real Red Pill Plus.
[01:28:15.528 --> 01:28:24.874]  Even though X2 is going to sell out, even though Brain Force is going to sell out, it's our last run of that, Super Metal Vitality, we're still going to do 50% off just to get the inventory out the door.
[01:28:24.874 --> 01:28:25.895]  We know our numbers.
[01:28:25.895 --> 01:28:28.217]  We're sure to sell all this by Christmas, but you know what?
[01:28:29.332 --> 01:28:31.593]  I'm not going to wait till then and then sell it then.
[01:28:31.593 --> 01:28:32.934]  We're going to get it out the door.
[01:28:32.934 --> 01:28:37.837]  Help us now get the money in to make sure we can continue on for a while, no matter what they pull on us.
[01:28:37.837 --> 01:28:39.918]  But don't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:39.918 --> 01:28:40.639]  Take action.
[01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:44.881]  50% off, super sale and free shipping store-wide.
[01:28:44.881 --> 01:28:49.044]  Free shipping store-wide, 50% off on all the supplements, a bunch of other big specials as well.
[01:28:49.044 --> 01:28:50.525]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:51.485]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:51.485 --> 01:28:55.448]  They absolutely hate the fact that you're able to support us and get great products.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.781]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.781 --> 01:29:04.165]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.165 --> 01:29:07.068]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.068 --> 01:29:10.671]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:10.671 --> 01:29:18.237]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:18.237 --> 01:29:22.841]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:22.841 --> 01:29:25.263]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:29:25.263 --> 01:29:25.703]  Faketv.com
[01:29:27.333 --> 01:29:31.194]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.194 --> 01:29:36.195]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:36.195 --> 01:29:41.016]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:41.016 --> 01:29:42.357]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:42.357 --> 01:29:46.117]  Check out all of the success stories at HBExtract.com.
[01:29:46.117 --> 01:29:47.118]  Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:29:47.118 --> 01:29:47.498]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:29:47.498 --> 01:29:48.038]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:48.038 --> 01:29:50.538]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.144 --> 01:29:58.164]  X2.
[01:30:28.744 --> 01:30:31.165]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[01:30:31.165 --> 01:30:32.886]  Ordered it six months ago.
[01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:33.886]  So I get the price down.
[01:30:33.886 --> 01:30:35.607]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:30:35.607 --> 01:30:36.867]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:30:36.867 --> 01:30:38.828]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:30:38.828 --> 01:30:41.208]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:42.969]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[01:30:42.969 --> 01:30:45.010]  The Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:46.490]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:48.471]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:51.192]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.
[01:30:51.192 --> 01:30:53.032]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.493]  I suggest you stock up on it.
[01:30:54.493 --> 01:30:56.174]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[01:30:56.174 --> 01:30:57.414]  InfoWarshore.com right now.
[01:30:57.958 --> 01:31:02.819]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:31:02.819 --> 01:31:12.261]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:31:12.261 --> 01:31:17.062]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:31:17.062 --> 01:31:25.324]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:31:25.444 --> 01:31:25.764]  I think so.
[01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.339]  Calm.
[01:32:02.907 --> 01:32:05.249]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:05.249 --> 01:32:08.692]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[01:32:08.692 --> 01:32:15.057]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan-favorite products, The Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:32:15.057 --> 01:32:20.561]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse preglanone product.
[01:32:20.561 --> 01:32:28.267]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain, healthy aging process, with an all-new natural caffeine boost included.
[01:32:28.707 --> 01:32:35.152]  A powerful, pregnant-owned base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow InfoWarriors' favorite products.

[01:32:48.303 --> 01:32:50.245]  It's also got the boost that it.
[01:32:50.245 --> 01:32:53.507]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:33:01.113 --> 01:33:13.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.026 --> 01:33:19.273]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.375 --> 01:33:24.716]  By the way, Tucker Carlson defended us twice last week.
[01:33:24.716 --> 01:33:25.556]  I never even got this clip.
[01:33:25.556 --> 01:33:32.619]  I want to play this ahead of our guests joining us, because slowly but surely, free speech is being very quickly strangled.
[01:33:32.619 --> 01:33:35.901]  And now they're going after your ability to even be in the free market.
[01:33:35.901 --> 01:33:50.187]  And the Democrats are using people inside the Justice Department, inside the CIA, to dox folks, as you're now seeing, criminal charges, with intel that only insiders could have, to actually shut down our ability to even have our own platforms.
[01:33:51.785 --> 01:33:58.153]  The head of Gab, which is a true free speech social network, is facing oblivion right now.
[01:33:58.153 --> 01:34:05.081]  Many authors that were best sellers on Amazon have had their payment processors taken and Amazon taken, so they're just going dark.
[01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:06.443]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:34:06.443 --> 01:34:08.445]  We need the President and Congress to act first.
[01:34:09.929 --> 01:34:10.990]  He had to turn the economy on.
[01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:17.633]  He had to point out that the Chi-Coms are the real enemy that the globalists are using as an attack base against us.
[01:34:17.633 --> 01:34:21.095]  And he had to get the Supreme Court in place to move forward.
[01:34:21.095 --> 01:34:21.935]  But guess what?
[01:34:21.935 --> 01:34:26.637]  Trump is about to go on the attack after the midterms.
[01:34:26.637 --> 01:34:32.320]  So all the globalists and AI pushers at Google and all the rest of the censors, get ready.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.961]  Here is Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:42.434]  Previous on this show, we've told you how employees at Google discussed altering search results to undermine the White House's immigration policies.
[01:34:42.434 --> 01:34:47.277]  At the time, Google said it has never changed search results for political reasons, and it never will.
[01:34:47.277 --> 01:34:50.219]  We knew it was untrue then, now we can prove that it is untrue.
[01:34:50.219 --> 01:34:59.244]  The show has obtained internal Google emails in which an employee discusses editing YouTube search results to suppress videos based on their political content.
[01:34:59.804 --> 01:35:00.465]  Here's one example.
[01:35:00.465 --> 01:35:12.037]  Last March, Google engineer Dong Zhao sent an email saying the company wanted to, and we're quoting, demote low authoritative content on controversial queries to fight against fake news.
[01:35:12.037 --> 01:35:13.478]  This was not hypothetical.
[01:35:13.478 --> 01:35:22.107]  He said the company had already succeeded in suppressing unwanted videos, videos for searchers like Hillary and, we're flattered here, Tucker.
[01:35:22.808 --> 01:35:31.794]  It's not clear which videos were suppressed because Google won't admit it or tell us, but the email does indicate that Alex Jones and InfoWars were a major target of this.
[01:35:31.794 --> 01:35:41.900]  Google says their efforts are not political and meant to fight conspiracy theories, though for the record we have never endorsed any kind of conspiracy theory on this show and never would.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:44.162]  And by the way, how does Google define a conspiracy theory?
[01:35:44.162 --> 01:35:45.382]  They haven't told us that either.
[01:35:46.403 --> 01:35:53.972]  Or why a superpower global monopoly ought to be making that decision in the first place since they have a congressional exemption in which they promised not to.
[01:35:53.972 --> 01:36:00.040]  They promised to be a conduit through which information flows and not a news site that edits it.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.083]  Congress might want to rethink that agreement.
[01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:04.225]  Yeah, that's about to happen.
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:08.664]  Conspiracy theory means questioning the official story.
[01:36:08.664 --> 01:36:12.408]  They mix them with Bigfoot space aliens, but that's not the stuff that hurts them.
[01:36:12.408 --> 01:36:16.734]  They have censored me saying Jones claims Big Tech censoring conservatives.
[01:36:16.734 --> 01:36:18.476]  We have Project Veritas videos.
[01:36:18.476 --> 01:36:23.301]  We have internal documents, hundreds of them, where they say our main enemy is Alex Jones.
[01:36:23.301 --> 01:36:24.843]  Our next enemy is Paul Austin.
[01:36:25.578 --> 01:36:27.419]  Our next enemy is Donald Trump.
[01:36:27.419 --> 01:36:29.000]  And yes, Tucker Carlson.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.681]  His videos would all get 20 million views.
[01:36:30.681 --> 01:36:34.384]  You can't have his show, you know, on YouTube have 20 million views.
[01:36:34.384 --> 01:36:40.588]  Before they put shadowbanning on him about a year and a half ago, I noticed every Tucker Carlson video had like 5 million views.
[01:36:40.588 --> 01:36:42.089]  Now they're a half million.
[01:36:42.089 --> 01:36:45.191]  Because they shadowban the things.
[01:36:45.191 --> 01:36:46.172]  Okay?
[01:36:46.172 --> 01:36:46.672]  It's simple.
[01:36:46.672 --> 01:36:47.373]  They admit it.
[01:36:47.373 --> 01:36:49.594]  I have their executives on hidden camera.
[01:36:49.594 --> 01:36:53.117]  I'm gonna spare you and go to our guest, Andrew Torba of Gab.com.
[01:36:55.097 --> 01:36:57.918]  You know, Andrew obviously launched a successful site.
[01:36:57.918 --> 01:36:59.699]  Millions of people use it.
[01:36:59.699 --> 01:37:01.960]  And they've... Google's delisted it.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.801]  They've gone up as payment processing.
[01:37:03.801 --> 01:37:04.961]  They're trying to shut him down right now.
[01:37:04.961 --> 01:37:06.802]  So they say, oh, go do your own thing.
[01:37:06.802 --> 01:37:07.663]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:07.663 --> 01:37:10.244]  That's when they really come after you.
[01:37:10.244 --> 01:37:11.644]  So it's good to have you here.
[01:37:11.644 --> 01:37:19.548]  I wanted to get your view on where we are right now in this purge, 29 days out from the election, because it's hurting those of us that run these operations, but
[01:37:20.488 --> 01:37:27.112]  I think the intimidation and the censoring is actually waking a lot of people up, but will it be too little too late?
[01:37:27.112 --> 01:37:30.094]  Where would you say we are right now in this fight?
[01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:32.455]  Well, Alex, I think a lot of people are waking up.
[01:37:32.455 --> 01:37:48.945]  Today, actually, just within the past half hour, we had a breaking news report that Google Plus, Google's social network, exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users to developers, just like Facebook had millions of users' data exposed to developers for years.
[01:37:48.945 --> 01:37:49.646]  This is going on.
[01:37:50.046 --> 01:37:54.668]  And finally, people are starting to wake up and say, wait a minute, why do we have all of our data?
[01:37:54.668 --> 01:38:01.392]  Why do we share all of our most intimate private moments, all of our most intimate private conversations with these two or three companies?
[01:38:01.392 --> 01:38:07.095]  And that's really why we started Gab, is I was out in Silicon Valley and I said, why is there no real alternative?
[01:38:07.095 --> 01:38:15.619]  Like, we have this illusion of choice where all of these companies own every single app that we use to communicate, every single app that we use to get news, to get information.
[01:38:15.619 --> 01:38:17.000]  Why is there no real alternative?
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.081]  So that's why we started Gab.
[01:38:18.641 --> 01:38:29.225]  You know, I saw this stuff coming, and I've seen it for years, I've been talking about it for years, you've been talking about it for years, and I think people are finally starting to wake up, thankfully, and I hope it's not too late.
[01:38:29.225 --> 01:38:36.208]  Like you said, you know, they told us to go and build our own, which is exactly what we did, and now we're being attacked at every single level.
[01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:44.191]  We're being banned from app stores, we have payment processors no-platforming us and saying we can't use them anymore, we have our hosting provider telling us to censor things,
[01:38:44.511 --> 01:38:50.494]  We even have our domain registrar threatening to seize our domain because they don't like the content on our site.
[01:38:50.494 --> 01:38:52.215]  Now, this is ridiculous.
[01:38:52.215 --> 01:38:53.416]  This is not a free market.
[01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:54.536]  This is a rigged market.
[01:38:54.536 --> 01:39:03.721]  And let's be clear, because Congress and the President haven't acted yet, because it takes time, everything they've done to me and you is being green-lighted against everybody else, from James Woods to Ann Coulter.
[01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:06.102]  They're moving against everyone right now.
[01:39:06.102 --> 01:39:08.443]  This is serious authoritarianism.
[01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:09.524]  It's cartel.
[01:39:09.524 --> 01:39:10.845]  When you get all these companies together,
[01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:14.470]  Notice Tim Cook came out and said, oh we didn't get together, he admitted it earlier.
[01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:17.695]  That's the real crime, is that they're getting together and targeting groups.
[01:39:18.866 --> 01:39:21.588]  Right, and Tim Cook talks about curating content.
[01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:23.790]  Well, curation is just another word for censorship.
[01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:31.215]  It's him, it's Apple, it's Google, it's Facebook, picking and choosing what news sources are quote-unquote real and what are fake news.
[01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:33.597]  Oh my God, Alex Jones had 2 million downloads in a month of his app.
[01:39:33.597 --> 01:39:36.679]  It's number one with five stars, 20,000 reviews.
[01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:39.541]  Oh, I'm gonna curate this turd in the punch bowl.
[01:39:39.541 --> 01:39:40.482]  No one wants it.
[01:39:40.482 --> 01:39:43.945]  It'd be one thing if it was some scam app that didn't work and had, you know,
[01:39:44.565 --> 01:39:45.326]  Half a star.
[01:39:45.326 --> 01:39:48.229]  But no, five perfect stars.
[01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:51.031]  I was censored for winning the Indy 500.
[01:39:51.031 --> 01:39:52.673]  I was censored for winning the Super Bowl.
[01:39:52.673 --> 01:39:56.736]  I was censored because we're number one, even with their damn censorship.
[01:39:56.736 --> 01:40:00.360]  And they can't compete with our ideas, so they're a bunch of authoritarian scum.
[01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:02.331]  Absolutely.
[01:40:02.331 --> 01:40:08.636]  And you know, we just raised $630,000 in our latest funding round directly from the people.
[01:40:08.636 --> 01:40:10.898]  And they see us doing things like this.
[01:40:10.898 --> 01:40:11.899]  They see us winning.
[01:40:11.899 --> 01:40:15.401]  They see the InfoWars app being downloaded like crazy with five-star reviews.
[01:40:15.401 --> 01:40:23.028]  They see Gab raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from the people, not from Silicon Valley venture capitalists or from Saudi princes like Twitter did.
[01:40:23.388 --> 01:40:23.968]  And I totally agree.
[01:40:23.968 --> 01:40:24.929]  And for folks that don't know,
[01:40:48.345 --> 01:40:50.226]  It's the best of worlds, worst of worlds.
[01:40:50.226 --> 01:40:51.787]  Best of times, worst of times.
[01:40:51.787 --> 01:41:00.133]  Okay, we got censored on all these platforms, that cut a lot of traffic, but the fact that there's the Streisand effect, video-wise, four or five times the views on our own platform.
[01:41:00.133 --> 01:41:04.116]  The problem is, instead of a $50,000 bill, it went up $100,000 to $150,000 if you count the different bills just for video.
[01:41:08.519 --> 01:41:13.483]  And then we've even got those companies saying, we may kick you off and not let you buy the video from us.
[01:41:13.483 --> 01:41:16.106]  And so we then had to leave one company.
[01:41:16.106 --> 01:41:19.529]  I mean, this is literally total whack-a-mole.
[01:41:19.529 --> 01:41:21.690]  And all we're doing is sitting here defending free speech.
[01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:24.333]  So you sound like a lot of money, 600 something thousand.
[01:41:25.223 --> 01:41:27.345]  The software, the bandwidth, all of it.
[01:41:27.345 --> 01:41:28.646]  You need millions.
[01:41:28.646 --> 01:41:29.327]  So do we.
[01:41:29.327 --> 01:41:31.329]  I mean, folks, this is a war.
[01:41:31.329 --> 01:41:33.591]  Google has hundreds of billions.
[01:41:33.591 --> 01:41:34.832]  Apple has a trillion.
[01:41:34.832 --> 01:41:40.317]  But literally a million against each of their billion trumps them like David versus Goliath.
[01:41:40.317 --> 01:41:42.299]  But we still got to have that support, folks.
[01:41:43.712 --> 01:41:44.512]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:41:44.512 --> 01:41:48.773]  And I think, you know, it's important to keep in mind that, you know, we are playing whack-a-mole.
[01:41:48.773 --> 01:41:57.555]  So it prevents us from building out and improving the platform because we have to constantly change providers and find a provider that will support what we're doing and support our mission.
[01:41:57.555 --> 01:41:59.516]  And inevitably, we have to build our own.
[01:41:59.516 --> 01:42:02.897]  We have to start from scratch and build out our own infrastructure from the ground up.
[01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:06.258]  Or just common sense people.
[01:42:06.258 --> 01:42:08.099]  We never target them with boycotts and stuff.
[01:42:08.099 --> 01:42:14.281]  I mean, these damn domain companies and these bandwidth people and all of them, they lie about who you are.
[01:42:14.281 --> 01:42:15.201]  You've been there for years.
[01:42:15.201 --> 01:42:16.382]  You have all this money.
[01:42:16.382 --> 01:42:18.923]  They treat you like crap and kick you off or threaten to.
[01:42:18.923 --> 01:42:21.324]  It's literally like we're Jews in Nazi Germany.
[01:42:22.802 --> 01:42:24.544]  You know, I think we need to start to do the boycott.
[01:42:24.544 --> 01:42:30.089]  I think we need to start to maybe pick up the tactics of the left and start to boycott some of these companies and call them out.
[01:42:30.089 --> 01:42:32.311]  And again, we have to build our own infrastructure.
[01:42:32.311 --> 01:42:33.292]  We have to keep fighting.
[01:42:33.292 --> 01:42:34.754]  We have to keep building.
[01:42:34.754 --> 01:42:36.956]  Otherwise, we're going to have no voice left on the Internet.
[01:42:38.442 --> 01:42:39.423]  You're right, my friend.
[01:42:39.423 --> 01:42:43.686]  We'll be right back with Andrew Korba of Gab.com and Gab.ai.
[01:42:43.686 --> 01:42:47.028]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:42:47.028 --> 01:42:48.789]  We are here literally because of you.
[01:42:48.789 --> 01:42:50.150]  We are in your hands.
[01:42:50.150 --> 01:42:56.375]  And when you share our links and our videos and our articles, you put it in the face of the globalists and deliver victory to humanity.
[01:42:56.994 --> 01:43:03.359]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:03.359 --> 01:43:06.581]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:06.581 --> 01:43:10.284]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:14.988]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:18.250]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:19.131 --> 01:43:30.138]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:30.138 --> 01:43:38.664]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:43:40.305 --> 01:43:49.349]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[01:43:49.349 --> 01:43:57.212]  Try Bodies today at Infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:43:57.212 --> 01:44:01.134]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:11.164]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:44:11.164 --> 01:44:13.145]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:44:13.145 --> 01:44:16.586]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:44:16.586 --> 01:44:19.227]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:44:19.227 --> 01:44:21.508]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:44:21.508 --> 01:44:28.451]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[01:44:28.951 --> 01:44:38.796]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:44:38.796 --> 01:44:39.977]  We'll win.
[01:44:39.977 --> 01:44:42.878]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[01:44:42.878 --> 01:44:50.042]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:44:50.042 --> 01:44:53.724]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Global Spain win.
[01:44:53.724 --> 01:44:55.285]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:44:55.285 --> 01:44:56.146]  We need your support.
[01:44:56.146 --> 01:44:56.706]  I'm counting on you.
[01:44:58.450 --> 01:45:04.725]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:18.692]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[01:45:18.692 --> 01:45:29.182]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[01:45:29.742 --> 01:45:37.127]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[01:45:37.127 --> 01:45:51.778]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:54.460]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:57.950 --> 01:46:05.662]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:46:05.662 --> 01:46:06.143]  It's you!
[01:46:07.253 --> 01:46:09.434]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:46:09.434 --> 01:46:18.177]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:46:18.177 --> 01:46:22.738]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:46:22.738 --> 01:46:24.179]  You are the info war.
[01:46:24.179 --> 01:46:27.700]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:39.786]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:39.786 --> 01:46:47.749]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:47.749 --> 01:46:54.793]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:54.793 --> 01:46:57.534]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:00.655 --> 01:47:19.061]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.061 --> 01:47:23.842]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:23.842 --> 01:47:25.183]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:33.307 --> 01:47:47.353]  I've been on air 23 years, and you guys, the audience, has been awesome, and we've changed the world together, and I love you all, and so I'm not bitching and complaining at you.
[01:47:47.353 --> 01:47:52.615]  And I tend, when stuff's really serious, to joke around and have fun.
[01:47:52.615 --> 01:47:53.955]  Because that's just how my brain works.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.883]  Here's the problem.
[01:47:58.883 --> 01:48:00.784]  I'm not a propagandist.
[01:48:00.784 --> 01:48:08.131]  I promote what I promote because I believe in it passionately, but I don't engage in trying to doll it up or even think about what I'm going to say.
[01:48:08.131 --> 01:48:13.556]  But then, at the same time, I talk to a lot of smart folks and they're like, man, you do not want to encourage the enemy.
[01:48:13.556 --> 01:48:17.560]  The enemy's tapping my phone and knows every damn thing about me.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.183]  And I'm not at liberty to get into all this, and I'm not complaining.
[01:48:21.186 --> 01:48:24.049]  But let me tell you, folks, you've seen spy movies and stuff?
[01:48:24.049 --> 01:48:24.869]  It's way beyond that.
[01:48:24.869 --> 01:48:29.113]  These people are sick.
[01:48:29.113 --> 01:48:37.021]  And they've got Justice Department-level stuff on us.
[01:48:37.021 --> 01:48:38.222]  Nothing corrupt.
[01:48:38.222 --> 01:48:45.769]  They're using the databases, like you see in the news, that the Justice Department and Congress and all these communists and globalists they've hired out of the colleges.
[01:48:46.906 --> 01:48:52.428]  Who literally don't want to work with the Pentagon in AI, but want to work with China suppressing their people.
[01:48:52.428 --> 01:48:56.770]  And so I am literally under attack by a bunch of Maoists.
[01:48:56.770 --> 01:49:01.972]  And I can't even talk about business stuff on the telephone now.
[01:49:01.972 --> 01:49:07.514]  I have to meet with people, and because we've even done disinfo before on the phone, and then they act on it.
[01:49:09.637 --> 01:49:14.080]  And off record, I've even been to the FBI twice and said, knock it off, okay?
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:26.126]  Because we even did some counter stuff and have watched and done some things, and it's like, my God, man, they have hired like 30 years of FBI agents and people that are whacked out leftists, man.
[01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:28.588]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but let me tell you something.
[01:49:28.588 --> 01:49:33.951]  They have built a secret police army in this country, and they are at war with Infowars and the President.
[01:49:34.631 --> 01:49:38.672]  And all I can tell you is thank God for President Trump because we've come a long way.
[01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.373]  I'm gonna go back to Andrew.
[01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:46.695]  It's just this.
[01:49:46.695 --> 01:49:54.077]  If I've called for your help before and said things are serious, this is urgent and it's 10 times the threat we've ever faced.
[01:49:54.077 --> 01:49:55.398]  You can see it all over the news.
[01:49:55.398 --> 01:49:56.678]  They're in Politico.
[01:49:56.678 --> 01:49:59.059]  I've got the quotes right here.
[01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:02.420]  After failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[01:50:03.214 --> 01:50:04.695]  See, they're just going to double down.
[01:50:04.695 --> 01:50:07.977]  And they're going to stage a false flag and blame it on me.
[01:50:07.977 --> 01:50:09.438]  I'm totally sure of it.
[01:50:09.438 --> 01:50:11.220]  I'm totally sure of it now.
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:13.441]  I mean, they've got big stuff coming, so we think we're winning.
[01:50:13.441 --> 01:50:15.223]  Get ready.
[01:50:15.223 --> 01:50:17.924]  We're going to make it through this storm, because people are aware of their scams now.
[01:50:17.924 --> 01:50:19.205]  Kavanaugh was a big example of that.
[01:50:19.205 --> 01:50:28.672]  But we need your financial support to not just expand, but to hold the line and let the enemy know that you're standing with us.
[01:50:28.672 --> 01:50:31.054]  Because what happens if they get all our payment processors, which they're trying to do?
[01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:33.491]  Then you want to be able to buy the product.
[01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:35.252]  We have sponsors for the radio network.
[01:50:35.252 --> 01:50:36.933]  I don't, that doesn't fund us.
[01:50:36.933 --> 01:50:40.195]  They've taken all our, I can't even advertise online on big platforms.
[01:50:40.195 --> 01:50:41.757]  They've taken that from us.
[01:50:41.757 --> 01:50:45.459]  And then I sure as hell can't, they do this, sell stuff to make money to fund us.
[01:50:45.459 --> 01:50:48.901]  I'm a free market guy.
[01:50:48.901 --> 01:50:55.246]  So, you know, George Washington robbed British ships to fund his revolution.
[01:50:55.246 --> 01:50:56.907]  So I'm just selling products to fund ours.
[01:50:58.172 --> 01:51:02.233]  And you know, maybe they'll shut down our capability to do that, and people have to do other stuff.
[01:51:02.233 --> 01:51:05.294]  I'm not saying we're going to rob any banks here, but we're not the weather underground.
[01:51:05.294 --> 01:51:06.995]  We're just trying to be Americans and promote things.
[01:51:06.995 --> 01:51:09.716]  So, we've got the biggest sales.
[01:51:09.716 --> 01:51:14.417]  In case they shut us down financially before Christmas, or Black Friday, or whatever they're trying to do.
[01:51:14.417 --> 01:51:18.798]  I mean, if you see them on the news, saying they want us destroyed, you can get your orders in right now.
[01:51:18.798 --> 01:51:23.520]  50% off, InfoWars, SuperSale, and free shipping on all the great supplements.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.820]  BrainForce X2, even though they're all about to sell out.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:26.921]  This is the last run of X2.
[01:51:28.743 --> 01:51:31.364]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, everything.
[01:51:31.364 --> 01:51:37.027]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:51:37.027 --> 01:51:39.809]  Everything is 50% off of the supplements.
[01:51:39.809 --> 01:51:43.291]  A lot of other products are already so discounted, there's only 50% to discount.
[01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:44.191]  Maybe 25, 30% you could.
[01:51:44.191 --> 01:51:47.773]  So there's a bunch of other big specials, free shipping, store wide on everything.
[01:51:47.773 --> 01:51:51.455]  So on top of 50%, the free shipping on those is a, some of these are lost liters.
[01:51:53.519 --> 01:51:58.628]  We've got to move the inventory off the shelves in case the enemy shuts us down financially for a while, which is the move they're making.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.322]  So again, FloodInfoWarStore.com today.
[01:52:02.322 --> 01:52:03.443]  Now is the time, folks.
[01:52:03.443 --> 01:52:05.064]  Now we need provision for this war.
[01:52:05.064 --> 01:52:06.345]  We need to be strong.
[01:52:06.345 --> 01:52:11.829]  I want to expand live broadcast right through every night, through the election, and then on after.
[01:52:11.829 --> 01:52:12.849]  We're getting the people in place.
[01:52:12.849 --> 01:52:14.250]  We're getting the crews in place.
[01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:15.231]  It's very expensive.
[01:52:15.231 --> 01:52:18.713]  Our bandwidth bills have tripled because everybody came to InfoWars.
[01:52:18.713 --> 01:52:19.674]  Everybody came to Prison Planet.
[01:52:19.674 --> 01:52:20.715]  Everybody came to NewsWorks.
[01:52:20.715 --> 01:52:23.396]  Yes, we're actually bigger than we were.
[01:52:23.396 --> 01:52:24.777]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:52:24.777 --> 01:52:26.098]  We were already under shadow banning.
[01:52:27.159 --> 01:52:31.781]  Throw me in the briar patch, but there's the other problems of the expenses skyrocketing.
[01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:34.402]  So, thank you for being financially supportive.
[01:52:34.402 --> 01:52:35.442]  Get great products at the same time.
[01:52:35.442 --> 01:52:36.703]  Go to InfoWareStore.com.
[01:52:36.703 --> 01:52:39.124]  There's a Donate button as well right there in the Support Us.
[01:52:39.124 --> 01:52:42.985]  If you want to give a pure donation, that really helps because there's not much profit in these products.
[01:52:42.985 --> 01:52:46.246]  When we do big sales, though, we sell a ton of them, so it kind of evens out.
[01:52:46.246 --> 01:52:48.087]  Plus, I've got to move it off the inventory shelves.
[01:52:48.902 --> 01:52:53.187]  So I'm out here dead in the water with a ton of Christmas inventory, and they've shut us down, which is their plan.
[01:52:53.187 --> 01:52:55.169]  So I need you to come to Paul Revere's rescue.
[01:52:55.169 --> 01:52:57.672]  You're Paul Revere as well, financially.
[01:52:57.672 --> 01:53:00.195]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:53:00.195 --> 01:53:01.977]  Now, going back to Andrew Torba.
[01:53:09.818 --> 01:53:15.768]  Explain to me your view on where this is going and what Congress, what the President needs to do because this is incredibly authoritarian.
[01:53:15.768 --> 01:53:18.633]  It's the Chinese model of cutting people off financially.
[01:53:18.633 --> 01:53:23.822]  And talk about what they're trying to do to your payment processors because, I mean, like you said, this is just incredible.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:25.660]  Sure, Alex.
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:29.323]  Well, I think what you just said is so crucial and so important.
[01:53:29.323 --> 01:53:33.565]  The people are really funding us just as they're funding InfoWars.
[01:53:33.565 --> 01:53:35.526]  And that's what makes these people so mad.
[01:53:35.526 --> 01:53:40.749]  And that's why they're trying to cut off our payment processors and your payment processors and your hosting providers.
[01:53:40.749 --> 01:53:46.933]  And I think a lot of folks don't realize how much it costs to run a website, how much it costs to run a social network.
[01:53:47.273 --> 01:53:51.256]  The bandwidth required to live stream your videos, to host your videos.
[01:53:51.256 --> 01:53:54.699]  The bandwidth required to host our content on our site.
[01:53:54.699 --> 01:53:55.739]  People don't realize this.
[01:53:55.739 --> 01:53:59.442]  It costs money and we don't have the luxury like big social networks.
[01:53:59.442 --> 01:54:04.486]  We're not mass collecting your data like Facebook and selling it to advertisers for billions of dollars.
[01:54:04.486 --> 01:54:07.148]  We're completely powered by the people just like InfoWars is.
[01:54:07.148 --> 01:54:07.468]  And I think
[01:54:07.868 --> 01:54:16.853]  What Congress needs to do, what President Trump needs to do is take anti-trust action against these companies because they're doing anti-competitive behavior in the marketplace.
[01:54:16.853 --> 01:54:18.914]  The free market is not free.
[01:54:18.914 --> 01:54:25.377]  It is rigged by an oligarchy in Silicon Valley that decides who can participate in the free market and who cannot.
[01:54:25.377 --> 01:54:37.103]  And I think it's so crucial that the people understand that they really are powering this revolution and this information war and alternative platforms like us and alternative sources of news like Infowars
[01:54:37.583 --> 01:54:41.267]  And again, I don't like Nazis, but first they take Stormfront, or whatever it's called, away, and then the next it's...
[01:54:56.394 --> 01:54:58.195]  They're trying to take Donald Trump's banking away.
[01:54:58.195 --> 01:55:00.016]  They're trying to take the NRA's banking away.
[01:55:00.016 --> 01:55:01.116]  They're trying to take ours away.
[01:55:01.116 --> 01:55:01.957]  I mean, they've done it.
[01:55:01.957 --> 01:55:07.019]  And we have to, like, run around like chickens with our heads cut off, you know, just deal with this all weekend.
[01:55:07.019 --> 01:55:08.340]  And it's just never-ending.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.640]  And it's so criminal.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:12.421]  If we were doing this to them, they would completely go insane.
[01:55:12.421 --> 01:55:13.562]  Let me ask you this.
[01:55:13.562 --> 01:55:19.865]  The alliance between Big Tech, you were, you know, a mid-level out in Silicon Valley who worked with some of the high-level guys, and they were a successful programmer.
[01:55:21.267 --> 01:55:24.449]  The merger with China, the way they'll work with China but not the Pentagon.
[01:55:24.449 --> 01:55:29.872]  The way Google and Twitter and Facebook are helping, and Apple especially, suppress the Chinese people.
[01:55:29.872 --> 01:55:33.795]  This authoritarianism, and how they've gotten away with so much.
[01:55:33.795 --> 01:55:37.897]  I think that's why they're so arrogant, is no one's ever said no to big tech.
[01:55:37.897 --> 01:55:38.858]  They're just out of control.
[01:55:40.302 --> 01:55:40.863]  Absolutely.
[01:55:40.863 --> 01:55:44.947]  It's absolutely insane that they refuse to work as U.S.
[01:55:44.947 --> 01:55:45.607]  corporations.
[01:55:45.607 --> 01:55:55.076]  They refuse to work with our own government, our own military, and they choose to instead work with the Communist Chinese and help them censor their version of the Internet.
[01:55:55.076 --> 01:55:56.478]  It's absolute madness.
[01:55:56.838 --> 01:56:01.441]  This is something you would never think of from an American corporation, and yet here we are.
[01:56:01.441 --> 01:56:07.905]  This new portal technology, this hardware device that Facebook just put out today, they want to be in your living room.
[01:56:07.905 --> 01:56:11.168]  This camera actually tracks you around your home.
[01:56:11.168 --> 01:56:13.849]  It has a microphone that listens to everything that you do.
[01:56:13.849 --> 01:56:22.615]  So not only are they tracking us and collecting all of our data, every single click, every single move we make on the internet, but now they want to do it in our homes.
[01:56:22.615 --> 01:56:23.916]  I don't think so.
[01:56:23.916 --> 01:56:26.218]  I don't think I'm going to allow Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook.
[01:56:26.758 --> 01:56:27.498]  It's absolutely insanity.
[01:56:27.498 --> 01:56:28.819]  This camera actually literally tracks you around your home.
[01:56:28.819 --> 01:56:30.320]  They have a microphone on you 24-7.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.083]  It's dialed to your voice print to dial everything else out but your voice which means it can listen through walls.
[01:56:49.767 --> 01:56:50.947]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:50.947 --> 01:56:53.908]  And this thing will be on 24-7.
[01:56:53.908 --> 01:56:57.249]  I guarantee developers will be able to exploit it and get into it.
[01:56:57.249 --> 01:57:01.150]  You know, as we've seen, Facebook is not to be trusted with our data.
[01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:03.611]  So anybody that buys this, I really feel bad for them.
[01:57:03.611 --> 01:57:05.651]  They are insane if you put this in your home.
[01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:08.612]  What estimates do you have from Silicon Valley?
[01:57:08.612 --> 01:57:17.055]  I'm told hundreds of thousands of developers have full access to everybody's cloud, everybody's code keys, photos of your wife naked.
[01:57:17.055 --> 01:57:18.395]  I mean, I'm told they've got everything.
[01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:24.333]  Alex, the information I've heard from some of my friends in Silicon Valley, you would be appalled.
[01:57:24.333 --> 01:57:30.959]  Absolutely appalled at the level of information, the level of access that people who hate us, who want us dead, have access to.
[01:57:30.959 --> 01:57:35.864]  So be very mindful of what you're saying on these platforms and what you're talking about as well.
[01:57:47.122 --> 01:57:55.511]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.511 --> 01:57:56.973]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:56.973 --> 01:58:01.678]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.678 --> 01:58:06.683]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:06.903 --> 01:58:27.058]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.558 --> 01:58:31.560]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:59:51.648 --> 01:59:54.258]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:11.345 --> 02:00:12.926]  All right, Andrew Torb is our guest.
[02:00:12.926 --> 02:00:15.507]  Did a lot of big development out in Silicon Valley a few years ago.
[02:00:15.507 --> 02:00:17.087]  Decided it was a censorship start.
[02:00:17.087 --> 02:00:18.848]  Gab.com.
[02:00:18.848 --> 02:00:27.852]  And now, boy, I mean, if you went through all the stuff Google and Facebook and Twitter have done to him and going after his banking and trying to get his URL shut down and his servicing shut down.
[02:00:28.772 --> 02:00:29.853]  Same stuff we're dealing with.
[02:00:29.853 --> 02:00:34.436]  And it's just, it's organized, it's focused, and it's so authoritarian.
[02:00:34.436 --> 02:00:40.140]  And then to watch the Google executives play dumb to Congress and Facebook and Twitter play dumb.
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:47.765]  And like you mentioned, they're now launching this portal that sits there and tracks and watches everything you do in your house.
[02:00:47.765 --> 02:00:50.067]  They just think we're complete idiots.
[02:00:50.067 --> 02:00:51.708]  Andrew, what do you expect them to do next?
[02:00:54.716 --> 02:00:58.118]  Well, Alex, I never expected it to get to this level as fast as it did.
[02:00:58.118 --> 02:01:02.280]  I knew this censorship wave was coming, but I never anticipated that it would be this fast.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:08.663]  And I think what to look for next is during the 2020 election cycle, that's when things are really going to get crazy.
[02:01:08.663 --> 02:01:10.804]  You're going to see a lot of influencers on the right.
[02:01:11.284 --> 02:01:14.006]  Uh, that are going to get shut down, that are going to get suspended.
[02:01:14.006 --> 02:01:19.090]  And one by one, it's like a death by a thousand cuts campaign by big tech.
[02:01:19.090 --> 02:01:27.637]  You know, they take out one influencer this week, they wait a couple weeks, they take out another one, people talk about it for 48 hours and then they get over it and they forget about it and that's what they want.
[02:01:27.637 --> 02:01:34.522]  They're using the same psychology like we're a bunch of little fish that kind of school together hoping we don't get hit next and they're predators.
[02:01:34.522 --> 02:01:37.405]  We have to organize against them instead of acting like idiots.
[02:01:38.732 --> 02:01:42.654]  Absolutely, and the thing to note is that this is not only happening in the United States.
[02:01:42.654 --> 02:01:51.659]  You know, we just had the Brazilian election yesterday and Gab had over 175,000 users join from Brazil because they're being censored as well.
[02:01:51.659 --> 02:02:03.966]  It's everybody that's on the right, everybody that's a part of this populist movement that's happening around the world, is being silenced, is being suppressed, is being shut up, is being suspended, is being no platform, is being shadow banned, is being demonetized.
[02:02:04.366 --> 02:02:08.429]  And it's been happening now for, you know, years and it's going to continue to happen.
[02:02:08.429 --> 02:02:09.370]  They're doubling down.
[02:02:09.370 --> 02:02:15.774]  They're going to use artificial intelligence to automatically ban hate speech before it even gets posted now.
[02:02:15.774 --> 02:02:18.276]  And they can expand that definition out to infinity.
[02:02:19.526 --> 02:02:20.066]  Exactly.
[02:02:20.066 --> 02:02:23.167]  Hate speeches, anything that they don't like, any news that they don't like.
[02:02:23.167 --> 02:02:38.071]  Facebook went so far as to censor links from AP, from Bloomberg, from, now we're talking mainstream media outlets that are normally, you know, friends to leftists, but Facebook actually censored leaks about their latest data breach, right?
[02:02:38.071 --> 02:02:45.833]  And then they pushed their PR spin version of it in the face of the user as they were trying to share this AP article.
[02:02:45.833 --> 02:02:46.953]  Absolute insanity!
[02:02:47.313 --> 02:02:48.154]  You know, we're talking about 1984.
[02:02:48.154 --> 02:02:48.734]  Say that again.
[02:02:48.734 --> 02:02:49.414]  Say that again.
[02:02:49.414 --> 02:02:50.795]  You had tens of millions of people.
[02:02:50.795 --> 02:02:51.656]  Well, what was the total number?
[02:02:51.656 --> 02:02:52.016]  It was huge.
[02:02:52.016 --> 02:02:55.418]  I forgot last week, a few weeks ago, because they shut down the news.
[02:02:55.418 --> 02:02:56.659]  They steal massive amounts.
[02:02:56.659 --> 02:02:57.780]  They give it away.
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:01.302]  They always call it a breach, but they gave it away.
[02:03:01.302 --> 02:03:05.264]  And then when AP and others reported on it and did their job, they blocked that post.
[02:03:05.264 --> 02:03:06.805]  New people were reading it.
[02:03:06.805 --> 02:03:08.426]  And so hit them with propaganda back.
[02:03:08.426 --> 02:03:09.187]  Because that's the thing.
[02:03:09.187 --> 02:03:13.129]  They don't just ban InfoWars or you off their platforms.
[02:03:13.129 --> 02:03:14.610]  They then lie about us on top of it.
[02:03:15.712 --> 02:03:31.298]  Absolutely, and again, it was a direct link from the AP, and if you tried to share this on Facebook to your friends, they would call it spam and not allow you to actually post it, and then they'd shove their propaganda PR spin version of that story in your face immediately after.
[02:03:31.298 --> 02:03:33.499]  You want to talk about 1984-level stuff?
[02:03:33.499 --> 02:03:40.161]  The telescreen from the 1984 novel is this new portal thing that they just released.
[02:03:40.161 --> 02:03:41.462]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:03:42.382 --> 02:03:48.465]  People like to talk about this, we always like to bring up 1984, but we are literally, this is literally what 1984 is.
[02:03:48.465 --> 02:03:50.906]  Yeah, we're way past it, way past it.
[02:03:50.906 --> 02:03:56.689]  That's it, I mean, Facebook openly rolls out 1984 telescreens, and they want you to pay for them!
[02:03:56.689 --> 02:03:57.329]  Everybody in 1984 hates them!
[02:03:59.429 --> 02:04:24.399]  Right, that's the funny part, is they want you to pay to have these listening devices, these tracking devices, these cameras that follow you around your home, these microphones that can hear through walls and block out other random noises in your home to listen directly to what you're saying 24-7, to then sell that information to advertisers, to push ads in your face, to have that data potentially exposed as it has been in the past and hacked,
[02:04:24.799 --> 02:04:28.540]  By foreign actors, by other corporations, by individuals.
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:29.421]  Who knows?
[02:04:29.421 --> 02:04:31.761]  You're absolutely nuts if you trust this company.
[02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:39.224]  You're absolutely nuts if you continue to use these applications and give all your personal and private data to these companies.
[02:04:39.224 --> 02:04:40.264]  Gab.com.
[02:04:40.264 --> 02:04:40.804]  Andrew Torba.
[02:04:40.804 --> 02:04:41.844]  Thank God you're there.
[02:04:41.844 --> 02:04:43.105]  Thank God Gab is exploding.
[02:04:43.105 --> 02:04:44.005]  We're on there as well.
[02:04:44.005 --> 02:04:44.745]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:44.745 --> 02:04:47.706]  Great job.
[02:04:47.706 --> 02:04:48.507]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:48.507 --> 02:04:49.507]  We'll give out the number.
[02:04:49.507 --> 02:04:50.187]  Take your calls.
[02:04:50.187 --> 02:04:52.308]  We have special guests joining us in the studio as well.
[02:04:52.308 --> 02:04:52.828]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.144 --> 02:05:03.626]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[02:05:03.626 --> 02:05:12.869]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:12.869 --> 02:05:21.932]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:05:22.899 --> 02:05:34.325]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[02:05:34.325 --> 02:05:43.489]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:43.909 --> 02:05:46.650]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.
[02:05:46.650 --> 02:05:50.311]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:05:50.311 --> 02:05:58.894]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:58.894 --> 02:06:01.554]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:01.554 --> 02:06:06.696]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:17.077 --> 02:06:22.243]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:22.243 --> 02:06:36.338]  And I want to give the number out in this segment and the next specifically on what do you think about Kavanaugh getting confirmed and what do you make of the Democrats and Politico saying after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[02:06:38.817 --> 02:06:46.603]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:46.603 --> 02:06:53.308]  I'm also doing fundraising today, because you see it all over the news.
[02:06:53.308 --> 02:07:02.715]  They've put out hundreds of thousands of articles about me, all of it lies, all of it twisted, all of it disinfo, to then set up the precedent and shut everybody down.
[02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:03.396]  That's what's going on.
[02:07:07.526 --> 02:07:09.126]  And it's not working so far for them.
[02:07:09.126 --> 02:07:11.567]  So they're just increasing the tyranny.
[02:07:11.567 --> 02:07:19.628]  Which is what the Democrats are quoted in Politico, in the Washington Post, and other publications saying.
[02:07:19.628 --> 02:07:20.848]  And so they're doxing Congress.
[02:07:20.848 --> 02:07:22.349]  They're threatening to kill people's wives.
[02:07:22.349 --> 02:07:25.609]  They're harassing people en masse.
[02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:30.250]  They're getting more and more out of control.
[02:07:30.250 --> 02:07:32.991]  What do you think, with 29 days out, they're going to pull next? 877.
[02:07:37.046 --> 02:07:39.709]  789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:42.672]  I want to air a Millie Weaver compilation.
[02:07:42.672 --> 02:07:45.274]  We're going to have more of this when she joins us.
[02:07:45.274 --> 02:07:46.415]  I'm hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:07:46.415 --> 02:07:50.980]  I want to go to this little short compilation.
[02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:57.066]  Some of the stuff she shot, some of the things that others shot, just of the insanity, the SJWs,
[02:07:58.601 --> 02:08:02.604]  Training for Kung Fu by the Capitol to fight Republicans.
[02:08:02.604 --> 02:08:06.627]  People attacking elderly folks with signs that are pro-life.
[02:08:06.627 --> 02:08:09.469]  People howling and chanting and acting like maniacs.
[02:08:09.469 --> 02:08:11.110]  People crying.
[02:08:11.110 --> 02:08:13.231]  I mean, this is what college turns out.
[02:08:13.231 --> 02:08:19.996]  A bunch of broke-back, chip-on-the-shoulder, neurotic, weirdo liars.
[02:08:19.996 --> 02:08:23.318]  In every statistic, way more likely to steal, way more likely to lie.
[02:08:23.318 --> 02:08:26.961]  They're way more likely to virtue signal about charity, but way less likely to give to charity.
[02:08:29.059 --> 02:08:30.620]  And they just want power.
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:31.641]  It's like every other loser.
[02:08:31.641 --> 02:08:35.604]  They want to run your life because they don't have a life.
[02:08:35.604 --> 02:08:36.885]  And so what are they going to do?
[02:08:36.885 --> 02:08:38.747]  What are they going to pull?
[02:08:38.747 --> 02:08:39.888]  Here's that short compilation.
[02:09:03.198 --> 02:09:06.743]  Again, these are women training for combat.
[02:09:06.743 --> 02:09:11.430]  Because they're calling for violence, the left's been calling for violence.
[02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:15.075]  They're playing...
[02:09:19.116 --> 02:09:20.617]  I'll tell you one thing, I'm pretty shook up right now.
[02:09:20.617 --> 02:09:21.418]  They're crying.
[02:09:21.418 --> 02:09:22.258]  The patriarchy of the white race.
[02:09:22.258 --> 02:09:23.959]  We all want to get into America as quickly as possible, but it's evil.
[02:09:23.959 --> 02:09:24.760]  No, they're almost all white.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:24.880]  Shame!
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.020]  Shame!

[02:09:43.694 --> 02:09:43.854]  Shame!
[02:09:43.854 --> 02:09:43.974]  Shame!
[02:09:43.974 --> 02:09:44.174]  Shame!
[02:09:44.494 --> 02:09:45.275]  Shame!
[02:09:45.275 --> 02:09:46.016]  Shame!
[02:09:46.016 --> 02:09:46.496]  Shame!
[02:09:46.496 --> 02:09:47.397]  Shame!
[02:09:47.397 --> 02:09:48.379]  Shame!
[02:09:48.379 --> 02:09:48.979]  Shame!
[02:09:48.979 --> 02:09:49.740]  Shame!
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:50.541]  Shame!
[02:09:50.541 --> 02:09:51.182]  Shame!
[02:09:51.182 --> 02:09:51.482]  Shame!
[02:09:59.048 --> 02:10:00.609]  Why should they say no?
[02:10:00.609 --> 02:10:02.550]  He lied under oath.
[02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:04.691]  He lied under oath.
[02:10:04.691 --> 02:10:06.171]  We can't have a Supreme Court- Really?
[02:10:06.171 --> 02:10:07.732]  Ford was the biggest liar we saw.
[02:10:07.732 --> 02:10:16.316]  Clearly untruthful, who does not have a respect for the basic truth.
[02:10:16.316 --> 02:10:21.259]  And they all cover their mouths like they're being silenced.
[02:10:21.259 --> 02:10:24.800]  What's the left running around silencing everyone?
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.021]  He's lying.
[02:10:27.021 --> 02:10:27.902]  He's a rapist.
[02:10:28.857 --> 02:10:32.000]  So, gang rapes.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.502]  So he hasn't been proven in a court of law.
[02:10:34.502 --> 02:10:37.104]  Well, you know what?
[02:10:37.104 --> 02:10:38.925]  He has perjured himself.
[02:10:38.925 --> 02:10:40.647]  I like beer.
[02:10:40.647 --> 02:10:43.429]  What about his yearbook, Devil's Triangle?
[02:10:43.429 --> 02:10:46.351]  These people are unbelievable.
[02:10:46.351 --> 02:10:47.232]  4th of July.
[02:10:47.232 --> 02:10:49.714]  But he said he likes beer on the stand.
[02:10:49.714 --> 02:10:51.956]  He does like beer, but he likes more than beer.
[02:10:51.956 --> 02:10:54.197]  How is that a lie to say he likes beer?
[02:10:54.197 --> 02:10:56.900]  In high school, he liked beer.
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.201]  Well, my God, execute him.
[02:11:01.421 --> 02:11:02.322]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:02.322 --> 02:11:04.262]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:04.262 --> 02:11:05.502]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:05.502 --> 02:11:06.663]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:06.663 --> 02:11:07.703]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:07.703 --> 02:11:09.543]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:09.543 --> 02:11:11.244]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:11.244 --> 02:11:12.924]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:12.924 --> 02:11:14.105]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:14.105 --> 02:11:15.285]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:24.082 --> 02:11:24.562]  She's okay.
[02:11:24.562 --> 02:11:29.606]  Meanwhile, thousands of times more blacks kill blacks than the police kill blacks.
[02:11:29.606 --> 02:11:33.629]  This is the hate, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:37.512]  This is what you send your kids to college for.
[02:11:37.512 --> 02:11:43.276]  They all just virtue signal and all get hysterical.
[02:11:53.985 --> 02:11:59.311]  They just say Black Lives Matter like people don't think that and like it makes you racist.
[02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:03.355]  The Supreme Court, see they worship the government.
[02:12:03.355 --> 02:12:08.240]  So the fact we're taking it back is like their God is being taken.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:16.228]  We're going to have more of this when Millie Weaver joins us coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:12:17.335 --> 02:12:19.476]  And we're going to take some of your calls right now.
[02:12:19.476 --> 02:12:22.756]  Let's talk to Dean in Richmond, Virginia.
[02:12:22.756 --> 02:12:24.337]  Dean, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:12:24.337 --> 02:12:31.178]  Thanks for joining InfoWars.
[02:12:31.178 --> 02:12:35.419]  Are we back to our old phone system issues?
[02:12:35.419 --> 02:12:36.119]  Hello, Dean.
[02:12:36.119 --> 02:12:38.320]  All right.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.380]  I know when to cut them.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.620]  I know when to fold them.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.141]  I know when to walk away.
[02:12:42.141 --> 02:12:42.821]  I know when to run.
[02:12:45.930 --> 02:12:48.731]  You know, we've had incredible calls lately.
[02:12:48.731 --> 02:12:52.152]  And then sometimes the phone system glitches.
[02:12:52.152 --> 02:12:54.693]  And no one talks when I go to them.
[02:12:54.693 --> 02:12:56.934]  And then my blood pressure goes up.
[02:12:56.934 --> 02:12:59.695]  Should I even dare?
[02:12:59.695 --> 02:13:02.436]  I shall not dare where eagles dare.
[02:13:02.436 --> 02:13:03.436]  I shall not take calls.
[02:13:03.436 --> 02:13:04.096]  Maybe next time.
[02:13:04.096 --> 02:13:04.736]  Who knows?
[02:13:04.736 --> 02:13:08.758]  Now, there's a lot I haven't gotten to yet as well here.
[02:13:10.017 --> 02:13:17.824]  And I really want to drill into this attack on free speech as well, because they're attacking the very bedrock of communication now.
[02:13:17.824 --> 02:13:21.026]  People are apologizing for Winston Churchill support.
[02:13:21.026 --> 02:13:23.869]  Columbus State no longer a holiday for the namesake city.
[02:13:23.869 --> 02:13:27.132]  Austin didn't rename the name or something else.
[02:13:27.132 --> 02:13:28.993]  This is what I want to get to when we come back.
[02:13:28.993 --> 02:13:30.034]  Meanwhile, video.
[02:13:30.034 --> 02:13:32.196]  Male feminist kicks pro-life woman in the face.
[02:13:32.196 --> 02:13:32.776]  That's okay.
[02:13:32.776 --> 02:13:35.439]  Asylum seeker brutally rapes child who was teaching in German.
[02:13:36.425 --> 02:13:39.808]  They just cover all that up because it's all part of this big utopia.
[02:13:39.808 --> 02:13:40.929]  No, it's not a utopia.
[02:13:40.929 --> 02:13:43.731]  It's total domination.
[02:13:43.731 --> 02:13:45.933]  Now, I'll get back to this again.
[02:13:45.933 --> 02:13:50.097]  The globalists are trying to shut us down with everything they've got.
[02:13:50.097 --> 02:13:51.758]  We make it a 360 win.
[02:13:51.758 --> 02:13:59.605]  I sell great products that are high quality, whether they're non-GMO heirloom seeds, or water filtration, or L-filtration, or supplements, or T-shirts.
[02:13:59.605 --> 02:14:01.667]  It's about getting the word out and about making your life better.
[02:14:01.667 --> 02:14:02.848]  We've got the best supplements.
[02:14:03.717 --> 02:14:06.800]  They're all free shipping and 50% off.
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:11.344]  That was going to be the Christmas and the Black Friday special and the Cyber Monday special.
[02:14:11.344 --> 02:14:14.527]  And we had the warehouse in with the product to do it.
[02:14:14.527 --> 02:14:15.848]  Some of the products were about to sell out.
[02:14:15.848 --> 02:14:17.069]  More was coming in later.
[02:14:17.069 --> 02:14:20.552]  I'm just selling it all out of 50% off.
[02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:25.457]  So they are successful shutting down all our payment processors for a while.
[02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:26.378]  We won't be dead in the water.
[02:14:27.705 --> 02:14:28.986]  And we'll have funds to continue on.
[02:14:28.986 --> 02:14:32.148]  So get the products you already need and get the Christmas gifts.
[02:14:32.148 --> 02:14:35.230]  Christmas is only a couple months away.
[02:14:35.230 --> 02:14:40.554]  So instead of battling the big lines and all the rest of it when that comes, give your family some colloidal silver.
[02:14:40.554 --> 02:14:45.037]  Give them some bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcumin level, 50% off.
[02:14:45.037 --> 02:14:46.198]  And that's off the regular price.
[02:14:46.198 --> 02:14:49.640]  That's not like we raise the price like they do on fake Black Friday and then lower it.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:52.182]  No, it's lowered from its regular low price.
[02:14:52.182 --> 02:14:53.503]  Alpha power is amazing.
[02:14:53.503 --> 02:14:54.683]  DNA force.
[02:14:54.683 --> 02:14:55.964]  All of it is incredible.
[02:14:55.964 --> 02:14:56.545]  A real red pill.

[02:15:30.535 --> 02:15:32.496]  X2 is always going to sell out on its last run.

[02:17:06.215 --> 02:17:07.115]  Remember?
[02:17:07.115 --> 02:17:09.957]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[02:17:09.957 --> 02:17:15.760]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:17:45.159 --> 02:17:45.519]  Others don't.
[02:17:56.098 --> 02:17:58.840]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:05.144]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.

[02:19:59.116 --> 02:20:14.189]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.189 --> 02:20:22.256]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:22.256 --> 02:20:24.538]  There must be some way out of here.
[02:20:26.611 --> 02:20:27.992]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:20:27.992 --> 02:20:30.234]  You know, I knew that world government was real.
[02:20:30.234 --> 02:20:33.177]  I knew it planned to transfer U.S.
[02:20:33.177 --> 02:20:36.801]  assets and control to the globalists in China, mainly.
[02:20:36.801 --> 02:20:42.867]  But I didn't know how far along it was until Trump got in and then they revealed themselves.
[02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:45.630]  At Davos and everywhere, literally worshipping the Chinese dictator.
[02:20:46.491 --> 02:20:48.913]  Him saying, don't worry, I'll defeat Trump in America.
[02:20:48.913 --> 02:20:51.855]  And Juncker taking his hand and saying, we'll crush America together.
[02:20:51.855 --> 02:20:53.136]  I mean, this was quoted.
[02:20:53.136 --> 02:20:54.757]  We will crush the U.S.
[02:20:54.757 --> 02:20:55.378]  in a trade war.
[02:20:55.378 --> 02:20:57.339]  We will crush Trump.
[02:20:57.339 --> 02:21:01.482]  Because Trump said, no more one-sided deals, jerks.
[02:21:01.482 --> 02:21:07.267]  And so they just have this giant metaphysical hard-on for us.
[02:21:07.267 --> 02:21:10.329]  And we're in World War IV.
[02:21:10.329 --> 02:21:13.351]  The Pentagon rightfully calls the Cold War World War III.
[02:21:14.383 --> 02:21:15.384]  This is World War 4.
[02:21:15.384 --> 02:21:33.973]  It's asymmetrical, using Arab Spring, using jihadis, using economic war, using the chi-coms, using the EU, using Hollywood, using all of the traitorous anti-American scum trained and hypnotically programmed to hate this country and to hate themselves.
[02:21:33.973 --> 02:21:35.013]  And now they're making their move.
[02:21:35.013 --> 02:21:42.697]  So I open the phones up to ask callers specifically when Democrats are in the Washington Post and they're in
[02:21:44.377 --> 02:21:50.007]  Politico and others saying, after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[02:21:50.007 --> 02:21:54.436]  They've got quotes by top Democrats saying, we're going to get more vicious, more aggressive, more violent.
[02:21:57.776 --> 02:22:00.818]  Top Dem, Trump, GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh.
[02:22:00.818 --> 02:22:04.121]  And then I've got all the beheading videos and threatens to murder everybody.
[02:22:04.121 --> 02:22:11.366]  And then Twitter and Facebook just lets Democrats run around saying, chop Kavanaugh's testicles off, murder Congress, murder their families.
[02:22:11.366 --> 02:22:13.928]  And the left's like, yeah, murder, murder, death.
[02:22:15.592 --> 02:22:20.356]  And then I'm like, man, Antifa says they're doxing Congress' homes and law enforcement's homes.
[02:22:20.356 --> 02:22:27.161]  If you've been doxed and you're in the federal law enforcement or you're in Congress, you better have a battle rifle next.
[02:22:27.161 --> 02:22:29.983]  Jones says murder the media with guns!
[02:22:29.983 --> 02:22:32.765]  Then I talked to some folks this weekend that talked to some FBI people.
[02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:39.586]  In Florida, and they found out that they worked with Infowars, and literally got scared, went, Alex Jones!
[02:22:39.586 --> 02:22:42.089]  You think I want the FBI to be scared of me?
[02:22:42.089 --> 02:22:43.851]  But these aren't normal FBI people.
[02:22:43.851 --> 02:22:50.297]  These are weird, whacked-out leftists, man, who literally believe I'm like Hitler.
[02:22:50.297 --> 02:22:54.922]  So they believe in all the craziness they're doing that they're fighting evil people.
[02:22:54.922 --> 02:22:55.963]  Doesn't mean it's the whole FBI.
[02:22:57.509 --> 02:23:10.695]  I was talking to this well-known person that ran into some FBI folks, and they, when they found out that the person worked at Infowars, literally got scared.
[02:23:10.695 --> 02:23:12.515]  I'm not killing political dissidents.
[02:23:12.515 --> 02:23:14.336]  I don't have any criminal record.
[02:23:14.336 --> 02:23:17.697]  I just believe in America and free market and the Second Amendment and mom and apple pie.
[02:23:17.697 --> 02:23:23.480]  And I'm informed about what's happening, so I'm sorry it's scary that the New World Order is so evil.
[02:23:24.758 --> 02:23:36.627]  And that you think it's so scary that someone would stand up against him, but just because you guys put out a couple hundred thousand articles saying I'm the most evil thing since Godzilla, it's not true!
[02:23:36.627 --> 02:23:47.715]  And that's what really freaks me out, is that it's so cut and dry that Trump's loving, but standing up for himself, and then he's trying to fix the country, and then he cares about everybody, and then he's being pragmatic.
[02:23:54.662 --> 02:23:55.463]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:23:55.463 --> 02:23:56.283]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:23:56.283 --> 02:23:57.464]  And we have a special guest joining us.
[02:23:57.464 --> 02:24:02.947]  We'll intersperse what he's going to cover with your calls about how they've escalated this whole situation.
[02:24:02.947 --> 02:24:06.309]  But I just want you to understand something.
[02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:17.797]  This is a power grab by ruthless globalists who believe that they are invincible and who believe they can get away with anything they want.
[02:24:19.873 --> 02:24:23.615]  And who believe they can just bully everybody, and they don't have any basement.
[02:24:23.615 --> 02:24:27.737]  You know, Lee Stranahan was on yesterday, co-hosting with me, and he made a really good point.
[02:24:27.737 --> 02:24:28.898]  We ought to queue up.
[02:24:28.898 --> 02:24:40.384]  It was about 10 minutes into his talk, or 8 minutes into his talk, because I marked it last night when I was in the rebroadcast of him.
[02:24:40.384 --> 02:24:47.308]  He talked about when his baby daughter died, and because he had gone from being a big liberal to working with Breitbart,
[02:24:49.011 --> 02:24:53.695]  And they made a joke about his dead daughter in a bunch of big leftist publications.
[02:24:53.695 --> 02:24:55.636]  That's what they do.
[02:24:55.636 --> 02:25:01.040]  How he realized, Republicans have their issues, but they've got a basement.
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:03.342]  There's only so far they'll sink.
[02:25:03.342 --> 02:25:08.366]  And Democrats claim they're all moral, but they're not Democrats like your grandpa.
[02:25:08.366 --> 02:25:12.189]  They are a whacked out group of crazies.
[02:25:12.189 --> 02:25:13.510]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:14.531]  I've never been against police.
[02:25:15.666 --> 02:25:21.948]  But I don't like the police state that the government was trying to turn police into, and no due process.
[02:25:21.948 --> 02:25:32.370]  But when I saw them, when I noticed YouTube wouldn't shadow ban us like five years ago when I'd bash police sometimes, then they would promote everywhere to get like 10 million views.
[02:25:32.370 --> 02:25:36.611]  But if I said something good about cops, you could see it would be demonetized and shadow banned.
[02:25:36.611 --> 02:25:38.412]  This was about six years ago, and I went, man, that's weird.
[02:25:39.878 --> 02:25:49.861]  I'm showing cops that helped somebody, did something good, saved a woman in a drowning in a car, and the cop almost died, and you know, one cop did die, and then they banned that.
[02:25:49.861 --> 02:25:51.302]  They blocked it.
[02:25:51.302 --> 02:25:57.844]  That's when I started to get more sophisticated, and I went, they want us to fight with the police so they get more radicalized, so they can come in and federalize them.
[02:25:58.834 --> 02:26:01.076]  And I said, we've got to do something.
[02:26:01.076 --> 02:26:02.217]  And I started to get more sophisticated.
[02:26:02.217 --> 02:26:03.658]  Then I saw Strong Cities.
[02:26:03.658 --> 02:26:05.239]  They wanted the UN to run the police.
[02:26:05.239 --> 02:26:10.102]  And I saw CNN, MSNBC, when they shot those five cops in Dallas.
[02:26:10.102 --> 02:26:14.286]  Then they shot some more cops in Louisiana the next week, two weeks later.
[02:26:14.286 --> 02:26:16.427]  And I saw the same talking point.
[02:26:16.427 --> 02:26:18.929]  Well, cops are bad and they better learn.
[02:26:18.929 --> 02:26:22.752]  Until they stop being brutal and evil, they're going to get killed.
[02:26:22.752 --> 02:26:25.974]  Now, I mean, one thing, if you thought a cop really killed your family member and you had proof,
[02:26:27.114 --> 02:26:29.077]  And you knew something happened and you went after him.
[02:26:29.077 --> 02:26:33.061]  I'm not saying do that, but I could see it.
[02:26:33.061 --> 02:26:39.009]  But when cops do something wrong in Missouri, which it turned out they didn't, and then you go kill cops in Dallas,
[02:26:42.250 --> 02:26:43.350]  Randomly.
[02:26:43.350 --> 02:26:50.692]  Or you go shoot cops in the back of the head in Houston, or in Oakland, and then CNN is, well, this is what you get.
[02:26:50.692 --> 02:26:58.153]  At that point I went, oh my God, like four or five years ago I went, they're worse than I thought.
[02:26:58.153 --> 02:27:04.655]  How does shooting a sheriff's deputy in the back of the head, because the CNN's saying cops are bad, what does that do?
[02:27:05.694 --> 02:27:07.095]  Where's the due process there?
[02:27:07.095 --> 02:27:09.136]  Where's the innocence until proven guilty?
[02:27:09.136 --> 02:27:10.476]  Where's the statute of limitations?
[02:27:10.476 --> 02:27:12.177]  Because it's not even in debate.
[02:27:12.177 --> 02:27:14.298]  They did nothing.
[02:27:14.298 --> 02:27:19.061]  And it's like, oh, you're kissing the pig's ass now.
[02:27:19.061 --> 02:27:27.265]  And it made me realize how I used to take the little guy view, the underdog view, the left poses that it was still by a lot of leftist propaganda, even though I was more of a libertarian.
[02:27:28.626 --> 02:27:29.827]  The left never liked me.
[02:27:29.827 --> 02:27:33.009]  I was pro-life, pro-gun, but I would buy their Antifa crap.
[02:27:33.009 --> 02:27:48.939]  And when Antifa tried to pipe bomb and kill people and tried to firebomb a place where they thought I worked, I bought the left's propaganda that it was a setup and actually went with their crap on air, talking about Brandon Darby, who's, I know people that know him, he's a great, hardworking guy.
[02:27:48.939 --> 02:27:57.084]  And I literally, 10 years ago, repeated crap that wasn't true by people that are founding members of Antifa that is sworn to destroy me.
[02:27:59.036 --> 02:28:00.057]  Think about that.
[02:28:00.057 --> 02:28:14.428]  The left could spin planned attacks on me and on a bookstore that I was affiliated with, and someone tries to expose it, and then the left spins it and turns it into the person exposing it's the bad guy, and I bought it.
[02:28:14.428 --> 02:28:19.412]  So yeah, I've done a lot of stuff, but I get smarter every year just like you do.
[02:28:19.412 --> 02:28:21.574]  And it's that hindsight.
[02:28:23.046 --> 02:28:29.927]  That we now look at where it just totally flips the script and you're like, oh my god, these people don't care about justice.
[02:28:29.927 --> 02:28:34.368]  All they do is manipulate those of us that have a conscience.
[02:28:34.368 --> 02:28:37.289]  And they just had me eating out of their hand.
[02:28:37.289 --> 02:28:41.730]  And I was a leftist at many levels and didn't even know it.
[02:28:41.730 --> 02:28:45.711]  Because they say a lot of stuff that sounds good.
[02:28:45.711 --> 02:28:48.191]  But now they've shown who they really are.
[02:28:48.191 --> 02:28:52.712]  A bunch of race war pushing authoritarians who want to overthrow local government for the globalists.
[02:28:55.071 --> 02:29:01.414]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:29:01.414 --> 02:29:04.456]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:29:04.456 --> 02:29:10.379]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:29:10.379 --> 02:29:14.161]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:29:14.161 --> 02:29:15.441]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:29:15.441 --> 02:29:16.782]  Who do we fight for?
[02:29:16.782 --> 02:29:22.985]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:29:22.985 --> 02:29:24.406]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:29:24.986 --> 02:29:25.886]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:29:25.886 --> 02:29:28.307]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:29:28.307 --> 02:29:36.431]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:29:36.431 --> 02:29:38.371]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:30:56.325 --> 02:30:58.687]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[02:31:55.996 --> 02:31:56.016]  X2.
[02:32:26.616 --> 02:32:31.738]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[02:32:31.738 --> 02:32:33.498]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:32:33.498 --> 02:32:34.718]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:32:34.718 --> 02:32:39.080]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:44.361]  In fact, right now, it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:32:44.361 --> 02:32:46.081]  It'll be gone in a couple months.

[02:32:49.062 --> 02:32:50.903]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[02:32:50.903 --> 02:32:52.343]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[02:32:52.343 --> 02:32:53.724]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[02:32:53.724 --> 02:32:55.284]  InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:32:59.092 --> 02:33:01.726]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:45.464 --> 02:33:55.493]  Conrad Padilla is going to ride shotgun with us for about an hour and then Millie Weaver is going to be joining us with a lot of exclusive video of the leftist insanity during the Kavanaugh situation.
[02:33:55.493 --> 02:34:04.001]  Infowarsyes.com and yes, I am going to be in between taking calls on what do you think the globalists are going to do next to destabilize the country and a bunch of clips that are coming up.
[02:34:04.001 --> 02:34:04.902]  We're going to take your calls.
[02:34:06.483 --> 02:34:12.987]  I am going to be up here infomercialing, something I do to fund our operation, and something I would encourage our radio affiliates to get involved with.
[02:34:12.987 --> 02:34:21.071]  Yes, with your own affiliates, because this is a great business, especially for media companies to be involved in, and it's great for our listeners to be involved in.
[02:34:21.071 --> 02:34:22.532]  Business is one side of it.
[02:34:22.532 --> 02:34:24.493]  We talked about that last time Conrad was here.
[02:34:25.612 --> 02:34:33.135]  Uh, this time I want to get into the products themselves, because listen, I'm not a big metrosexual type guy, even though I probably should be.
[02:34:33.135 --> 02:34:34.816]  Those guys take care of themselves.
[02:34:34.816 --> 02:34:39.358]  I showed up here about two weeks ago to shoot news, and Rob Doo goes,
[02:34:40.626 --> 02:34:42.326]  Why don't you try the eye cream?
[02:34:42.326 --> 02:34:44.147]  Conrad really wants you to do that.
[02:34:44.147 --> 02:34:46.627]  You know, you want to boost sales over at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:34:46.627 --> 02:34:48.468]  This is rated the best eye cream in the world.
[02:34:48.468 --> 02:34:50.388]  I go, yeah, I've already heard that from my wife.
[02:34:50.388 --> 02:34:52.268]  When we got them as a sponsor, I already know that.
[02:34:52.268 --> 02:34:56.569]  So when you purchase stuff at InfoWarsYes.com, you get the best deals, and part of it goes to funder operation.
[02:34:56.569 --> 02:34:58.370]  So they even shut us down in our shopping cart.
[02:34:58.370 --> 02:35:00.630]  You know, we have sponsors like this.
[02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:01.330]  And I did it.
[02:35:01.330 --> 02:35:02.810]  We're going to play this later.
[02:35:02.810 --> 02:35:04.291]  Radio listeners have got to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:10.105]  So, they set up the camera real quick, because I was going to shoot somewhere else.
[02:35:10.105 --> 02:35:12.488]  I was going out to do a shoot.
[02:35:12.488 --> 02:35:14.371]  And I literally just go, okay.
[02:35:14.371 --> 02:35:17.295]  And they barely have the cameras even focused, and they get it going.
[02:35:17.295 --> 02:35:19.859]  Three minutes later, my bags, which are big.
[02:35:21.696 --> 02:35:24.697]  Uh, that's part of an Anglo-Saxon skull anyways.
[02:35:24.697 --> 02:35:27.477]  There's big, large, you know, eye holes that go down further.
[02:35:27.477 --> 02:35:30.898]  That's how you can tell a skull, whether it's a white skull or an Asian skull or whatever.
[02:35:30.898 --> 02:35:33.379]  They have kind of a shape like that, sort of like that.
[02:35:33.379 --> 02:35:36.360]  Because that's part of the deal, is that large eye holes.
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:39.681]  And both eyes have been in a lot of fights back in high school, so they've been beat in pretty good.
[02:35:39.681 --> 02:35:41.001]  But they were really, really puffy.
[02:35:41.681 --> 02:35:50.446]  And so now when I do a video shoot or I'm going to do an ad, one of them would really look good for anything or going on national TV, I don't put makeup on, but I do put this on because the bags go away.
[02:35:50.446 --> 02:35:51.326]  I should have put it on today.
[02:35:51.326 --> 02:35:53.127]  In fact, I didn't think of this later.
[02:35:53.127 --> 02:35:57.550]  I should probably do it again, maybe next hour, just live on TV.
[02:35:57.550 --> 02:35:59.291]  Next hour, we'll do it.
[02:35:59.291 --> 02:36:01.232]  If we have any of the eye creams, mine said, oh, there it is.
[02:36:01.232 --> 02:36:02.192]  Ageless.
[02:36:02.192 --> 02:36:02.833]  Instantly ageless.
[02:36:03.723 --> 02:36:06.365]  So you can see, because my wife has tried three or four other brands.
[02:36:06.365 --> 02:36:11.289]  When she saw this, she said, oh, I got some of that from my cousin when I was in Omaha last year.
[02:36:11.289 --> 02:36:12.730]  Can you get me more?
[02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:14.132]  That works the best.
[02:36:14.132 --> 02:36:15.593]  Not that my wife has much bags.
[02:36:15.593 --> 02:36:18.015]  She's gorgeous, but she thinks she does.
[02:36:18.015 --> 02:36:18.795]  And I said, yeah.
[02:36:18.795 --> 02:36:20.817]  And I tried the stuff she has.
[02:36:20.817 --> 02:36:22.218]  Didn't really do much.
[02:36:22.218 --> 02:36:24.820]  So it is rated out there as the best eye cream.
[02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:25.901]  That's only one product.
[02:36:25.901 --> 02:36:27.122]  I didn't mean to go right into it.
[02:36:27.122 --> 02:36:28.003]  He's here.
[02:36:28.003 --> 02:36:28.784]  But the fact is,
[02:36:29.943 --> 02:36:38.069]  A whole family of products at InfoWarsYes.com from the Jeunesse line, and the reason they're great is they're bigger outside the U.S.
[02:36:38.069 --> 02:36:39.129]  than they even are here.
[02:36:39.129 --> 02:36:40.751]  They're now coming here to the U.S.
[02:36:40.751 --> 02:36:49.837]  They've been here for a while, but the great part is we can then use them to sponsor some very exciting things that Little Birdies told me about that are going to be happening in Europe very, very soon.
[02:36:49.837 --> 02:36:50.737]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[02:36:51.738 --> 02:36:52.959]  These are amazing products.
[02:36:52.959 --> 02:36:54.521]  Conrad, thanks for coming.
[02:36:54.521 --> 02:36:57.763]  This time, let's pitch them the products here, and then we'll get to calls and news and the rest of it.
[02:36:57.763 --> 02:36:59.245]  But we're self-funding.
[02:36:59.245 --> 02:37:02.808]  The whole name of the game is, shut us down, take us off air.
[02:37:02.808 --> 02:37:04.009]  Well, what do I do?
[02:37:04.009 --> 02:37:05.810]  I go out and I find the very best products.
[02:37:05.810 --> 02:37:08.292]  I know you guys have the best line.
[02:37:08.292 --> 02:37:12.596]  The whole stay-at-home business, MLM, is just one angle, because it is.
[02:37:12.596 --> 02:37:14.598]  If you're going to be selling something, you want to sell the best.
[02:37:14.598 --> 02:37:15.278]  It sells itself.
[02:37:15.999 --> 02:37:17.200]  We already promoted that before.
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:18.160]  People should get involved.
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:19.261]  It's amazing.
[02:37:19.261 --> 02:37:21.222]  Because the name of Jeunesse is so good.
[02:37:21.222 --> 02:37:25.264]  But regardless, the products are unbelievable.
[02:37:25.264 --> 02:37:28.146]  So thanks for joining us and just give us an overview of these products.
[02:37:28.146 --> 02:37:32.188]  Okay, so the key to the product you were talking about is Instantly Ageless.
[02:37:32.188 --> 02:37:33.189]  So what that basically is, is
[02:37:33.829 --> 02:37:36.071]  I mean, who out there wants bags underneath your eyes?
[02:37:36.071 --> 02:37:38.753]  Whether you're a female, male, it doesn't really matter.
[02:37:38.753 --> 02:37:40.694]  At the end of the day, nobody wants bags.
[02:37:40.694 --> 02:37:48.921]  What's great about this product, and this product's been highlighted all on, you know, all types of top shows and everything else, is that it works within about two minutes.
[02:37:48.921 --> 02:37:52.524]  About two minutes, what it does is the bags literally go away.
[02:37:52.524 --> 02:37:54.225]  In fact, I could even use some myself today.
[02:37:54.225 --> 02:37:55.346]  Geez, I'm looking at myself right now.
[02:37:55.666 --> 02:37:58.750]  But within two minutes, and it works up to eight hours, okay?
[02:37:58.750 --> 02:38:01.633]  So it works up to eight hours with respect to taking bags away.
[02:38:01.633 --> 02:38:03.335]  So male, female, doesn't really matter.
[02:38:03.335 --> 02:38:04.336]  It works for that.
[02:38:04.336 --> 02:38:10.042]  Now the other thing is, I want you guys to understand too, most, I mean, look at this picture of Alex, okay?
[02:38:10.042 --> 02:38:11.404]  And he didn't even use that much.
[02:38:11.404 --> 02:38:15.688]  What's really cool about it, he didn't even use that much of the product, and look at this, within two minutes.
[02:38:16.289 --> 02:38:22.232]  So male, female, this is a product that works, like I said, in about two minutes up to eight hours, okay, called Instantly Ageless.
[02:38:22.232 --> 02:38:26.275]  Okay, so go to Infowarsyes.com and you can go on there and order this stuff.
[02:38:26.275 --> 02:38:31.838]  This stuff, you know, bags are a global problem, so it's not something that just happens in, you know, here in the United States or anything like that.
[02:38:31.838 --> 02:38:35.120]  So this product is one of the top selling products in the world.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:40.703]  You can see some of the other things that it obviously does as well, but what's great about all these products is
[02:38:41.343 --> 02:38:41.423]  Yeah.
[02:38:56.681 --> 02:38:57.561]  There's so much stress.
[02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:58.702]  There's so many toxins.
[02:38:58.702 --> 02:39:00.323]  People are aging at rapid levels.
[02:39:00.323 --> 02:39:01.423]  An article right here.
[02:39:01.423 --> 02:39:05.305]  Human race faces extinction if male sperm count continues to fall worldwide.
[02:39:05.305 --> 02:39:07.866]  In major studies, people are missing iodine.
[02:39:07.866 --> 02:39:09.467]  You can't produce sperm.
[02:39:09.467 --> 02:39:10.707]  I mean, a lot of this is very simple.
[02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:11.808]  So you're taking care of the inside.
[02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:13.548]  You're taking care of the outside.
[02:39:13.548 --> 02:39:16.110]  And that's why it's so exciting.
[02:39:16.110 --> 02:39:20.251]  And then again, we're not funded by George Soros or taxpayers or Democratic money.
[02:39:20.251 --> 02:39:23.793]  We're funded good old fashioned, bringing products to the listeners.
[02:39:23.953 --> 02:39:28.277]  Yeah, that's actually a guy who can use like a few boxes of this stuff actually.
[02:39:28.277 --> 02:39:29.598]  He can use a whole tub of Ageless.
[02:39:29.598 --> 02:39:30.800]  You talking about George Soros?
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:32.782]  Yeah, yeah, a big tub of that stuff.
[02:39:32.782 --> 02:39:34.804]  I mean, he's got some serious bags.
[02:39:34.804 --> 02:39:36.525]  Might want to consider sleeping.
[02:39:36.525 --> 02:39:38.027]  But let's get back to Ageless just briefly.
[02:39:38.027 --> 02:39:41.130]  Why is it the best, I mean, literal eye cream product out there?
[02:39:41.130 --> 02:39:42.131]  I mean, even online people say...
[02:39:43.031 --> 02:39:43.711]  It's the rage.
[02:39:43.711 --> 02:39:45.672]  People go, oh you're with Jeunesse now.
[02:39:45.672 --> 02:39:46.912]  Oh my god, have you seen the videos?
[02:39:46.912 --> 02:39:48.332]  I tried it, it's real.
[02:39:48.332 --> 02:39:50.913]  I run into women that come up and go, I didn't believe it.
[02:39:50.913 --> 02:39:52.894]  I've been using it for two years.
[02:39:52.894 --> 02:39:54.514]  You're right Alex, isn't it great?
[02:39:54.514 --> 02:39:56.154]  Women have tried it all.
[02:39:56.154 --> 02:39:58.955]  It is the best.
[02:39:58.955 --> 02:40:05.177]  There's quite a few products on the market, but the thing about it though is most of them don't work for very long.
[02:40:05.177 --> 02:40:07.237]  Look at this product within just a short period of time.
[02:40:07.237 --> 02:40:08.097]  You said four hours.
[02:40:08.097 --> 02:40:11.118]  I went back on TV like eight hours later, my bags were gone.
[02:40:11.198 --> 02:40:12.778]  Yeah, it'll go up to 10 hours.
[02:40:12.778 --> 02:40:14.859]  So this will work up to 10 hours.
[02:40:14.859 --> 02:40:18.080]  Works on, you know, a little bit of crow's feet, other things like that.
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:23.561]  But what's great about this product, you guys, is look around right now as far as who you are.
[02:40:23.561 --> 02:40:26.661]  I mean, how many people can benefit just from this one product, okay?
[02:40:26.661 --> 02:40:30.642]  But you also have to look at the fact, like, even the Nevo product, okay?
[02:40:30.642 --> 02:40:32.283]  Who doesn't have energy challenges?
[02:40:32.283 --> 02:40:33.763]  Everybody has energy challenges.
[02:40:33.763 --> 02:40:37.044]  I mean, we live in a society where everybody has a phone glued to their face.
[02:40:37.044 --> 02:40:38.144]  I mean, it's been proven
[02:40:38.624 --> 02:40:41.005]  That people are sleeping less and less again.
[02:40:41.005 --> 02:40:45.626]  And I think what's happening right now is you have an energy drink that's actually good for you.
[02:40:45.626 --> 02:40:46.886]  Okay, like Nevo.
[02:40:46.886 --> 02:40:49.086]  Then you have some of the other products like AM, PM.
[02:40:49.086 --> 02:40:57.108]  You have some of the other products that, you know, Reserve product, which is a super high antioxidant product with acai in it.
[02:40:57.108 --> 02:41:00.129]  You know, it's interesting because in the... Can I have an ounce of that genius, please?
[02:41:00.549 --> 02:41:01.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:02.370]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:02.370 --> 02:41:03.971]  This is my favorite.
[02:41:03.971 --> 02:41:05.052]  I love Rainforest.
[02:41:05.052 --> 02:41:06.813]  This has got some of the same stuff in Rainforest.
[02:41:06.813 --> 02:41:10.595]  But it's got some other things, and it just... Talk about clean energy, man.
[02:41:10.595 --> 02:41:12.556]  I was going to do Coast to Coast AM like a month ago.
[02:41:12.556 --> 02:41:13.697]  Totally exhausted.
[02:41:13.697 --> 02:41:14.837]  It's like 9 o'clock.
[02:41:14.837 --> 02:41:15.738]  Coffee doesn't work.
[02:41:15.738 --> 02:41:16.458]  Boom.
[02:41:16.458 --> 02:41:18.900]  Had a mind from Janesse from InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:20.121]  Boom!
[02:41:20.121 --> 02:41:24.626]  Yeah, so the thing about the Mind product is everybody has a cell phone, right?
[02:41:24.626 --> 02:41:32.475]  I mean, have you ever been to dinner or lunch with somebody and they're having a conversation with you and they're looking at their phone at the same time?
[02:41:32.475 --> 02:41:36.881]  I mean, our attention span and our focus has gone to the toilet, to be honest with you.
[02:41:37.581 --> 02:41:42.164]  I mean, I just had one on before I got on right now and it really does help with focus.
[02:41:42.164 --> 02:41:49.708]  If you lack focus from technology or you need, you know, maybe you're in college and you need to take an exam coming, this stuff works.
[02:41:49.708 --> 02:41:56.272]  It really, really does help with focus and some of the other things that people have issues with, which is just dialing it in.
[02:41:56.272 --> 02:41:57.933]  And here's the bottom line.
[02:41:57.933 --> 02:42:00.695]  I could have had 200 MLM companies.
[02:42:00.695 --> 02:42:01.556]  You're not an MLM company.
[02:42:01.556 --> 02:42:05.858]  That's just one vehicle you've got for people to have it as a business and then also make money when they sign others up.
[02:42:05.858 --> 02:42:06.519]  It sells itself.
[02:42:07.299 --> 02:42:08.981]  You have such great word of mouth.
[02:42:08.981 --> 02:42:10.624]  You started in Europe and Asia.
[02:42:10.624 --> 02:42:12.126]  Now it's exploding in the U.S.
[02:42:12.126 --> 02:42:14.589]  So a business model is great for our listeners to get involved in.
[02:42:14.589 --> 02:42:16.352]  But as a product, it's even better.
[02:42:16.352 --> 02:42:19.796]  So that's why I bring it, even though I'm a big supplement seller myself.
[02:42:19.796 --> 02:42:21.198]  It's mainly we fund ourselves.
[02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:23.922]  Your stuff's so good that I wanted to be involved in it.
[02:42:24.062 --> 02:42:40.918]  Yeah, well the products are, the great part about this is what's interesting too is, you know, what I love about what Alex is doing is you're empowering people with InfoWarsYes.com and we'll come back and talk about that because I really want to talk about how you're empowering people around the globe because people are buying this product from all over the world from you since you launched InfoWarsYes.
[02:42:41.138 --> 02:42:41.899]  And that's another good thing.
[02:42:41.899 --> 02:42:48.170]  You guys have warehouses in other parts of the world, so that doesn't have the huge shipping cost of getting InfoWars live products around the world.
[02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.831]  Right, exactly.
[02:42:48.831 --> 02:42:49.832]  So that's really smart.
[02:42:49.832 --> 02:42:50.454]  Well, that's exciting.
[02:42:50.454 --> 02:42:53.959]  From Australia, to China, to Europe, Malaysia.
[02:42:55.217 --> 02:43:03.600]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:05.060]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:09.761]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.761 --> 02:43:14.763]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.003 --> 02:43:35.150]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:39.655]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:43:39.655 --> 02:43:43.339]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:43:43.339 --> 02:43:48.324]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:43:48.324 --> 02:43:51.067]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:43:51.067 --> 02:43:53.510]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:55.126 --> 02:44:00.391]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.391 --> 02:44:08.440]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:10.341]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:11.042 --> 02:44:14.504]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.504 --> 02:44:17.105]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.105 --> 02:44:19.407]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.407 --> 02:44:31.814]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[02:44:32.990 --> 02:44:36.693]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:44:36.693 --> 02:44:37.874]  We'll win.
[02:44:37.874 --> 02:44:40.796]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[02:44:40.796 --> 02:44:46.100]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:47.942]  And you're right, to the market.
[02:44:47.942 --> 02:44:51.645]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[02:44:51.645 --> 02:44:52.845]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:44:52.845 --> 02:44:53.866]  We need your support.
[02:44:53.866 --> 02:44:54.607]  I'm counting on you.
[02:44:56.912 --> 02:44:59.914]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[02:44:59.914 --> 02:45:02.495]  And Survival Silodex 2 is the pure iodine.
[02:45:02.495 --> 02:45:03.375]  No one else has this.
[02:45:03.375 --> 02:45:06.437]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[02:45:06.437 --> 02:45:07.918]  It's very hard for me to get.
[02:45:07.918 --> 02:45:09.779]  It's the good halogen.
[02:45:09.779 --> 02:45:11.940]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:18.463]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[02:45:18.463 --> 02:45:21.065]  BioTruth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[02:45:21.065 --> 02:45:22.486]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[02:45:23.787 --> 02:45:29.511]  It's needed as well in all activity of the body, particularly neurons.
[02:45:29.511 --> 02:45:31.313]  So these go incredibly well together.
[02:45:31.313 --> 02:45:32.874]  We have a combo of those.
[02:45:32.874 --> 02:45:34.255]  Just experience it for yourself.
[02:45:34.255 --> 02:45:36.978]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[02:45:36.978 --> 02:45:38.018]  Very simple stuff.
[02:45:38.018 --> 02:45:39.660]  Filter your water.
[02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:41.742]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[02:45:41.742 --> 02:45:43.203]  Best out there for the price.
[02:45:43.203 --> 02:45:44.284]  When I say it's the last run,
[02:45:45.492 --> 02:45:47.074]  I think it'll be six bucks a year until we get more.
[02:45:47.074 --> 02:45:47.895]  I hope we get more.
[02:45:47.895 --> 02:45:49.216]  This is the last run it looks like.
[02:45:49.216 --> 02:45:50.097]  Survival Short Exit 2.
[02:45:50.097 --> 02:45:55.803]  Infowars.com or Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:55.803 --> 02:45:59.948]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:45:59.948 --> 02:46:06.515]  Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[02:46:59.159 --> 02:47:01.801]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:09.318 --> 02:47:11.819]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:11.819 --> 02:47:14.279]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:14.279 --> 02:47:19.660]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:21.881]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[02:47:21.881 --> 02:47:29.442]  Friend as in any wonder lightning strikes me.
[02:47:29.442 --> 02:47:32.783]  I fought with the devil.
[02:47:32.783 --> 02:47:34.423]  Got down on his neck.
[02:47:34.423 --> 02:47:35.483]  Well, ain't that the truth.
[02:47:35.483 --> 02:47:37.024]  But I never gave in.
[02:47:37.024 --> 02:47:38.704]  So he gave up on me.
[02:47:41.683 --> 02:47:45.108]  Conrad Padilla with InfoWarsYes.com is riding shotgun with us.
[02:47:45.108 --> 02:47:51.096]  I'm going to get your calls about what do you think the Democrats are planning next now that they've lost as soon as we start the next hour.
[02:47:51.096 --> 02:47:53.700]  He'll ride shotgun with us and Millie Weaver's joining us.
[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:57.225]  And I know we've talked privately, you're a libertarian guy, but I want to talk about Jeunesse because
[02:47:58.446 --> 02:48:07.811]  You guys, when you ended up basically seeking me out as well, and I'd already been talking about you with George Norrie, it was synchronicity.
[02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:09.111]  It was really strange.
[02:48:09.111 --> 02:48:21.277]  And then to find out that my wife knew who you were and liked you, and I talked to other people that were into your energy drink, and then I went and looked you up, just your great name, that's why I'm really proud to have you guys working with us to help support the broadcast.
[02:48:21.277 --> 02:48:26.180]  And if our local radio affiliates, next we should probably find some way to
[02:48:27.262 --> 02:48:34.367]  Set it up for them as well, so that they can become direct promoters of this and sellers of this.
[02:48:34.367 --> 02:48:44.575]  Because more and more, that's the model on TV and radio that is successful with the sponsorship, is just to direct sell to your listeners and then help fund the industry.
[02:48:44.575 --> 02:48:47.437]  But so many people shy away from that, but I think that's really the future.
[02:48:47.797 --> 02:48:49.819]  Well, it is, and that's why we call it the perfect business.
[02:48:49.819 --> 02:48:54.482]  I mean, where are you going to go out there to be able to get involved in a business?
[02:48:54.482 --> 02:49:01.228]  I mean, if you look at most businesses that are out there today, like even a franchise, people go spend several hundred thousand dollars on buying a franchise.
[02:49:01.228 --> 02:49:03.409]  I mean, the reality is, is they got to have the building.
[02:49:03.409 --> 02:49:04.310]  They got to have the building.
[02:49:04.310 --> 02:49:05.371]  They got to have the.
[02:49:05.371 --> 02:49:06.772]  But who has several hundred thousand dollars?
[02:49:06.872 --> 02:49:07.232]  We're good to go.
[02:49:22.768 --> 02:49:23.028]  That's great.
[02:49:38.564 --> 02:49:40.726]  That is a pyramid that I don't want to be part of.
[02:49:40.726 --> 02:49:42.388]  That's traditional America.
[02:49:42.388 --> 02:49:43.809]  That's what it was like on Wall Street.
[02:49:43.809 --> 02:49:48.914]  When I worked on Wall Street, this is the way that it was, and this is the way it is for most companies that are out there today.
[02:49:48.914 --> 02:49:54.760]  What's great about the network marketing profession, because people say sometimes, well, it's a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.442]  This is a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:56.442 --> 02:49:58.844]  When people work for a traditional company, that's a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:58.844 --> 02:49:59.525]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:49:59.525 --> 02:50:01.927]  Some of the MLMs, like Ponzi,
[02:50:02.808 --> 02:50:06.270]  Pay out more money up front than they're really bringing in and get more people to join.
[02:50:06.270 --> 02:50:07.151]  There have been some.
[02:50:07.151 --> 02:50:10.573]  Any business, any investment could turn into a pyramid scheme.
[02:50:10.573 --> 02:50:14.095]  They're afraid of people using real MLMs.
[02:50:14.095 --> 02:50:17.358]  Even though you're not even an MLM, that's just a model for people to sell if they want.
[02:50:17.358 --> 02:50:20.640]  You're all about the incredible products at Genes, that's why I did it.
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:25.463]  I can do hundreds of MLMs that are legitimate, they're just not the best products, so I'm not doing it.
[02:50:25.463 --> 02:50:26.624]  This is so kick-butt.
[02:50:27.384 --> 02:50:31.647]  And then it's got the business angle on top of it is why I love it and why I'm supporting it.
[02:50:31.647 --> 02:50:33.269]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[02:50:33.269 --> 02:50:33.909]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.909 --> 02:50:36.331]  So you have really good products that people reorder.
[02:50:36.331 --> 02:50:41.075]  And what's cool about this is people are ordering products from around the globe from you guys.
[02:50:41.075 --> 02:50:47.400]  I mean, you have sales, you have people buying products from Sweden, Canada, Malaysia, Australia, obviously North America.
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:50.162]  So people are buying products from you guys all over the world.
[02:50:50.162 --> 02:50:53.985]  But you also have a lot of people around the globe that are also partnering with you because
[02:50:54.645 --> 02:50:56.647]  You have essentially empowered a lot of people.
[02:50:56.647 --> 02:51:05.736]  You've empowered people with InfoWars and you've empowered a lot of people with the opportunity as well with InfoWarsYes.com and you've empowered some people who want to take advantage of the opportunity.
[02:51:05.736 --> 02:51:14.765]  So for some of the people that are out there today, what you're essentially doing is you're allowing them to be able to create an income stream alongside potentially what they're doing in their job.
[02:51:14.765 --> 02:51:15.826]  And again, I look at the numbers.
[02:51:16.767 --> 02:51:18.008]  A, I've already heard about these products.
[02:51:18.008 --> 02:51:19.209]  A, they're top-rated everywhere.
[02:51:19.209 --> 02:51:21.651]  When I go look it up, I keep hearing about it everywhere.
[02:51:21.651 --> 02:51:24.993]  And then, I enjoy the products, and so it's a win-win.
[02:51:24.993 --> 02:51:28.236]  I mean, if this stuff's already exploding, but that's another question.
[02:51:28.236 --> 02:51:29.557]  Why'd you guys start in Asia?
[02:51:29.557 --> 02:51:31.578]  Tell us about the company instead of North America.
[02:51:31.578 --> 02:51:38.143]  Yeah, so the reason the company started in Asia, because the thing about the Asian community, they're really into skincare.
[02:51:38.143 --> 02:51:42.707]  I mean, skincare for the Asian community, it's up there with like oxygen.
[02:51:42.827 --> 02:51:45.128]  It's all about the class.
[02:51:45.128 --> 02:51:46.669]  But they also embrace network marketing.
[02:51:46.669 --> 02:51:53.553]  Oh, and I'm in Hawaii or somewhere, like the Japanese and the Koreans have big hats and they have like veils and they're just all into their skin.
[02:51:53.553 --> 02:51:54.554]  Yeah, they're all into it.
[02:51:54.554 --> 02:51:57.116]  So in North America, it's a little bit different.
[02:51:57.116 --> 02:52:02.659]  So what happened is the company focus there, but what's happened now is they've come to North America right now.
[02:52:02.659 --> 02:52:05.521]  Obviously, Alex, you saw the opportunity with InfoWars, yes?
[02:52:06.161 --> 02:52:11.483]  And I think the key here now is what's happening in North America now is a lot of people are getting involved here.
[02:52:11.483 --> 02:52:14.964]  But the cool part is it's still very early here in North America.
[02:52:14.964 --> 02:52:15.484]  Well, exactly.
[02:52:15.484 --> 02:52:17.224]  I want the opposite of a Ponzi scheme.
[02:52:17.224 --> 02:52:24.267]  I want people to have great products, fund the show, and then I want them to get in when you guys are now coming into the U.S.
[02:52:24.267 --> 02:52:26.667]  and already exploding and rocketing towards the top.
[02:52:26.667 --> 02:52:28.428]  That's the time from the business angle to get in.
[02:52:29.008 --> 02:52:31.890]  I want my hardcore listeners to be in on the ground level.
[02:52:31.890 --> 02:52:32.330]  Right.
[02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:39.475]  Well, the beautiful part is most people don't realize that your income is the most powerful thing that you could possibly have for you and your family.
[02:52:39.475 --> 02:52:41.356]  Your income is your most powerful wealth building tool.
[02:52:41.356 --> 02:52:41.937]  That's the truth.
[02:52:41.937 --> 02:52:46.340]  I mean, the reality is the more income that you have coming into your household, the better.
[02:52:46.340 --> 02:52:46.900]  Right.
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:49.582]  Because, you know, a lot of people don't realize that you have residual bills.
[02:52:49.582 --> 02:52:51.363]  Your bills come in no matter what.
[02:52:51.363 --> 02:52:53.064]  No matter what happens, your bills come in.
[02:52:53.064 --> 02:52:56.066]  What if you could have potentially one more than one income stream?
[02:52:56.066 --> 02:52:58.348]  And that's what this opportunity that you had put out there.
[02:52:58.948 --> 02:53:04.713]  I mean, Alex, you have put something out there with this incredible platform with respect to InfoWars to empower people.
[02:53:04.713 --> 02:53:12.359]  Now what you've done is you're empowering people with InfoWarsYes.com to be able to go out there and create another income stream to be able to bring into their household.
[02:53:12.359 --> 02:53:15.421]  Well, listen, my philosophy is the 360 win.
[02:53:15.421 --> 02:53:21.706]  If I like something and it's good, and I know it's a good product, and it's going to help me and it's going to help them, that's what I go for.
[02:53:21.706 --> 02:53:22.146]  Right.
[02:53:22.146 --> 02:53:25.069]  It's got to be, because quite frankly, I've turned down hundreds of these.
[02:53:25.069 --> 02:53:27.350]  A lot of them were good deals, but they were already huge in the US.
[02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:33.818]  Why not get people involved in something that's been huge everywhere else, but it's coming here last?
[02:53:33.818 --> 02:53:41.146]  It's the ground floor chain reaction angle is why I want to tell my listeners, I think, like here's an example.
[02:53:41.146 --> 02:53:42.488]  I told folks to get into gold when it was at 300.
[02:53:43.749 --> 02:53:45.010]  And I wrote it all the way up to 2,000.
[02:53:45.010 --> 02:53:49.433]  And I said, I think it'll go back to like 5,000, maybe 10, 15 years from now.
[02:53:49.433 --> 02:53:53.316]  But I started telling people when it was 1,900, I said, get out of it.
[02:53:53.316 --> 02:53:54.677]  And I had a lot of sponsors get mad.
[02:53:54.677 --> 02:53:56.318]  A lot of people get pissed at me.
[02:53:56.318 --> 02:53:58.600]  And I said, no, I'm not promoting gold anymore.
[02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:04.344]  I said, maybe silver, because I think gut level, that for a while, it's not going to go back up.
[02:54:04.344 --> 02:54:06.266]  Now, everybody appreciated that.
[02:54:06.266 --> 02:54:11.970]  So that's basically what I do is, if I'm gut level and do my research, then that's when I go for something.
[02:54:11.970 --> 02:54:12.550]  And gut level,
[02:54:13.852 --> 02:54:22.882]  Well, you're right.
[02:54:22.882 --> 02:54:24.583]  And a lot of people are joining you, by the way.
[02:54:24.583 --> 02:54:31.491]  Because a lot of these countries I talked about, you have a lot of people that are actually joining you from around the globe because they know that you know what you're talking about.
[02:54:31.491 --> 02:54:32.953]  But the second part of that too, though, is
[02:54:33.453 --> 02:54:45.225]  You guys have to remember that one of the things that you can do for you and your family though is, and I said this earlier, is you can have another income stream that comes into you for you and your household that you maybe don't have.
[02:54:45.225 --> 02:54:49.490]  If you lost your job tomorrow, what are you going to do to pay your residual bills, right?
[02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:52.571]  Oh, they're trying to take our payment processors right now.
[02:54:52.571 --> 02:54:54.672]  So I didn't even bring you guys on board because I was worried about that.
[02:54:54.672 --> 02:54:55.833]  But I'm like, well, great.
[02:54:55.833 --> 02:54:57.393]  Thank God they shut us down.
[02:54:57.393 --> 02:54:59.174]  Well, you know, hopefully you guys can fund this.
[02:54:59.174 --> 02:54:59.534]  I mean, right.
[02:54:59.534 --> 02:55:01.375]  I mean, it's that common sense.
[02:55:01.375 --> 02:55:03.696]  You don't you always want to have an ace in the hole.
[02:55:03.696 --> 02:55:04.236]  Yeah.
[02:55:04.236 --> 02:55:08.298]  Well, and that's the thing about about Janus is Janus is in 141 countries.
[02:55:08.298 --> 02:55:10.879]  They're a proven global company.
[02:55:10.879 --> 02:55:12.200]  And, you know, tell people how big it is.
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:12.720]  Yeah.
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:14.641]  So so they're a multibillion dollar company.
[02:55:14.821 --> 02:55:15.001]  Yeah.
[02:55:33.408 --> 02:55:37.770]  If you look at these sales right here, look at this, and they're doing it primarily without North America.
[02:55:37.770 --> 02:55:38.831]  And so what's the trending now?
[02:55:38.831 --> 02:55:40.512]  Because I know everything's always a few years back.
[02:55:40.512 --> 02:55:41.212]  Yeah.
[02:55:41.212 --> 02:55:41.572]  Yeah.
[02:55:41.572 --> 02:55:45.174]  So, so 2017, they did 1.4 billion, somewhere in that area.
[02:55:45.174 --> 02:55:49.036]  Now 2000 and, you know, this year they're projected to do a billion plus.
[02:55:49.036 --> 02:55:50.417]  That's just in one year, you guys.
[02:55:50.417 --> 02:55:51.477]  And here's the cool part.
[02:55:51.477 --> 02:55:54.079]  They're doing it primarily without the sales in North America.
[02:55:54.079 --> 02:55:56.100]  These are sales primarily from outside the U.S.
[02:55:56.100 --> 02:55:59.982]  So the opportunity... Yeah, if you look at the circles where the profits are, it's not in the U.S.
[02:56:00.422 --> 02:56:01.764]  Right, exactly.
[02:56:01.764 --> 02:56:12.078]  So with InfoWarsYes, when you go to InfoWarsYes.com, and I think the key for you is that you're able to join Alex in creating a movement here in North America.
[02:56:12.078 --> 02:56:13.620]  And by the way, people are already doing that.
[02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:17.926]  Like I said, lots and lots of people from around the globe right now are joining InfoWarsYes.
[02:56:18.166 --> 02:56:19.106]  And that's what I'm trying to do.
[02:56:19.106 --> 02:56:24.869]  I'm trying to get our most hardcore listeners with a great product line and something for them to get in on the first level of.
[02:56:24.869 --> 02:56:28.011]  Right, and that's what you've created, and a lot of people know that.
[02:56:28.011 --> 02:56:32.673]  A lot of people that are involved in this type of profession, they won't even look at a company unless they're at least five years old.
[02:56:32.673 --> 02:56:37.796]  Janessa's about nine, ten years old, and so what's great about it is you're already involved in a company.
[02:56:37.796 --> 02:56:39.617]  That's one of the reasons why... Well, I did another MLM company.
[02:56:39.617 --> 02:56:41.418]  These are great people, great folks.
[02:56:41.418 --> 02:56:43.198]  You know, started out, they're like 15, 20 million.
[02:56:43.198 --> 02:56:46.140]  They went to like 80-something million a year just with my promotion.
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:51.041]  Yeah, so let's talk about... Unfortunately, it just didn't bring in, you know, enough for us to fund our operation.
[02:56:51.041 --> 02:56:51.561]  Right.
[02:56:51.561 --> 02:56:55.682]  Well, let's think about network marketing, the network marketing profession, for example, okay?
[02:56:55.682 --> 02:57:03.184]  You have, you know, you have no alarm clock, you have no boss, you have nobody that you have to report to, you have, you know, low startup.
[02:57:03.184 --> 02:57:07.465]  I mean, who in the world has six figures plus to go start a traditional business out there?
[02:57:07.465 --> 02:57:08.465]  Most people don't.
[02:57:08.465 --> 02:57:15.607]  Most people want to have their own business... Everybody's heard similar pitches, but this is a great company with a proven track record, and I'll say this before we start the next hour and take calls.
[02:57:17.099 --> 02:57:18.139]  It's about the product.
[02:57:18.139 --> 02:57:20.440]  I would tell listeners, go to InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:22.500]  You love the products at InfoWarsStore.com?
[02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:23.801]  Would I bring you stuff?

[02:57:25.221 --> 02:57:27.702]  I'm bringing this because it's a unicorn.

[02:58:45.979 --> 02:58:48.701]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:48.701 --> 02:58:55.025]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:58:55.025 --> 02:58:57.006]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:58:57.006 --> 02:59:03.671]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.

[02:59:14.778 --> 02:59:15.218]  I think so.
[02:59:48.587 --> 03:00:00.201]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.201 --> 03:00:04.546]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[03:00:04.546 --> 03:00:06.428]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.734 --> 03:00:10.535]  All right, some stations don't carry this segment.
[03:00:10.535 --> 03:00:11.395]  Next segment they do.
[03:00:11.395 --> 03:00:17.076]  We're going to get to your calls, get into some politics, get into people that don't want progress versus those that do.
[03:00:17.076 --> 03:00:19.276]  Conrad from Jeunesse is riding shotgun with us.
[03:00:19.276 --> 03:00:25.778]  He heads up InfoWarsYes.com, which is the best discounts you're going to find out there on these products at InfoWars store.
[03:00:25.778 --> 03:00:31.479]  But I wanted to air the video that literally, I guess, two, three weeks ago, I come in here on the weekend.
[03:00:31.479 --> 03:00:35.740]  Rob Due goes, hey, they keep wanting us, you know, just shoot a video with the eye cream.
[03:00:36.813 --> 03:00:39.535]  And he goes, your bags are pretty bad today.
[03:00:39.535 --> 03:00:43.238]  And I said, yeah, I was working late last night.
[03:00:43.238 --> 03:00:45.379]  So we literally, my hair's not even combed.
[03:00:45.379 --> 03:00:46.220]  I was like a zombie.
[03:00:46.220 --> 03:00:47.061]  I just sat down.
[03:00:47.061 --> 03:00:48.622]  It was like nine in the morning.
[03:00:48.622 --> 03:00:50.623]  I barely had a cup of coffee.
[03:00:50.623 --> 03:00:53.606]  And he shoots the video and it's the video they shot.
[03:00:54.645 --> 03:00:56.266]  And this is really what happened.
[03:00:56.266 --> 03:00:59.628]  But we're going to do it again later in this hour.
[03:00:59.628 --> 03:01:01.169]  Millie Weaver's coming up too.
[03:01:01.169 --> 03:01:05.452]  I'm going to, uh, my bags aren't as bad today, but you can see kind of some of the black circles.
[03:01:05.452 --> 03:01:07.293]  That's just cartilage damage permanently.
[03:01:07.293 --> 03:01:13.257]  Uh, but, uh, I'm lucky I can see as much stuff and punch the face, but we're going to zoom in later.
[03:01:13.257 --> 03:01:14.237]  Maybe bring a camera in.
[03:01:14.237 --> 03:01:19.381]  I wasn't planning this and do it live on air to some folks I've seen even on YouTube go,
[03:01:20.776 --> 03:01:24.623]  But the other demonstrations you guys do, you go, that's not real, that's fake, that's not real.
[03:01:24.623 --> 03:01:25.124]  Well, you know what?
[03:01:26.192 --> 03:01:29.214]  We'll do it at, say, 25 after this hour.
[03:01:29.214 --> 03:01:38.562]  The last five minutes of that segment, I'm gonna, whatever camera, because we have these cameras that don't have lenses that zoom in because they're HD, but we can get a camera maybe closer to my face so they can see it.
[03:01:38.562 --> 03:01:40.203]  We're gonna do it live on air.
[03:01:40.203 --> 03:01:44.106]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the video from a few weeks ago of me in the morning.
[03:01:44.106 --> 03:01:46.728]  You'll see my hair's not even combed on the side.
[03:01:46.728 --> 03:01:52.812]  And it, I'd say I got rid of 80%, at least, of the bags under my eyes, which is incredible.
[03:01:52.812 --> 03:01:53.093]  Here it is.
[03:01:53.915 --> 03:02:02.385]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:02:02.385 --> 03:02:07.752]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[03:02:07.752 --> 03:02:11.216]  Mold's been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets.
[03:02:11.216 --> 03:02:13.338]  That makes me get puffy.
[03:02:13.338 --> 03:02:13.499]  But,
[03:02:14.279 --> 03:02:25.793]  If I use just one little container of Ageless, and I can share it with both eyes, within three minutes you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:02:25.793 --> 03:02:30.218]  Because I've got some bad bags with allergies, plus I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[03:02:30.218 --> 03:02:33.461]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[03:02:33.461 --> 03:02:34.623]  So, again, just twist it off.
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:40.481]  Even, you know, a dummy like me can put it under.
[03:02:40.481 --> 03:02:46.543]  I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that.
[03:02:46.543 --> 03:02:54.685]  But when it comes to having bags under your eyes and being on television or just, you know, anybody in regular life, it's something good to do.
[03:02:54.685 --> 03:02:58.606]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[03:02:58.606 --> 03:03:01.287]  I have found that the times I've used it,
[03:03:04.588 --> 03:03:04.908]  I think so.
[03:03:33.229 --> 03:03:34.190]  I'm a human being.
[03:03:34.190 --> 03:03:34.971]  I have dignity.
[03:03:34.971 --> 03:03:36.012]  I'm gonna resist.
[03:03:36.012 --> 03:03:38.254]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[03:03:38.254 --> 03:03:39.875]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[03:03:39.875 --> 03:03:41.236]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[03:03:51.661 --> 03:03:53.142]  So there you go.
[03:03:53.142 --> 03:03:54.904]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would.
[03:03:54.904 --> 03:03:58.087]  Not as good as a woman or somebody that's, you know, good at this stuff.
[03:03:58.087 --> 03:03:59.308]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[03:03:59.308 --> 03:04:00.369]  It already feels good.
[03:04:00.369 --> 03:04:02.251]  It feels cool.
[03:04:02.251 --> 03:04:03.592]  It's pretty much dry now.
[03:04:03.592 --> 03:04:07.355]  And I'll go back, look at the time lapse, and it's pretty dramatic.
[03:04:07.355 --> 03:04:08.356]  At least in the past when I've done it.
[03:04:08.356 --> 03:04:09.177]  We'll see what happens here.
[03:04:09.857 --> 03:04:16.159]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy.
[03:04:16.159 --> 03:04:19.920]  It's all amazing cutting edge at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.781]  When you get the Jeunesse products there, you get big discounts.
[03:04:22.781 --> 03:04:23.861]  There's a lot of different specials.
[03:04:23.861 --> 03:04:32.544]  You can also sign up to be a distributor and that helps fund the war against the globalists and help us continue to try to make America and the planet successful capitalists and free again.
[03:04:33.224 --> 03:04:34.125]  Wars are expensive.
[03:04:34.125 --> 03:04:35.166]  We're fighting one.
[03:04:35.166 --> 03:04:35.946]  We're winning.
[03:04:35.946 --> 03:04:36.987]  Thanks for your support.
[03:04:36.987 --> 03:04:39.489]  We try to bring you great products to make it easy to support us.
[03:04:39.489 --> 03:04:41.170]  And this one is a big winner.
[03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:44.533]  Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse at InfowarsYes.com.
[03:04:44.533 --> 03:04:47.575]  You can also find banners at Infowars.com.
[03:04:47.575 --> 03:04:51.018]  Just say yes to health, vitality, and opportunity.
[03:04:51.018 --> 03:04:52.819]  Only at InfowarsYes.com.
[03:04:54.181 --> 03:04:58.126]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.126 --> 03:05:01.431]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.431 --> 03:05:07.699]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.699 --> 03:05:10.463]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.184 --> 03:05:15.009]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.009 --> 03:05:21.497]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.497 --> 03:05:26.462]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.205 --> 03:05:31.127]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.127 --> 03:05:38.331]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.331 --> 03:05:43.013]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.013 --> 03:05:49.237]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.237 --> 03:05:53.199]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:05.496 --> 03:06:09.098]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[03:06:09.098 --> 03:06:13.581]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:06:13.581 --> 03:06:16.603]  Okay, I didn't plan this today.
[03:06:16.603 --> 03:06:20.046]  Jeff Conrad in here from Genesh with InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:06:20.046 --> 03:06:21.146]  This was set up a few weeks ago.
[03:06:21.146 --> 03:06:25.149]  I didn't plan to launch this emergency super sale today and then do a rare.
[03:06:25.149 --> 03:06:28.711]  I mean, we're talking maybe every two, three months I have a guest in for 30 minutes.
[03:06:28.711 --> 03:06:30.612]  Talk about a product or something we're doing that really excites me.
[03:06:30.612 --> 03:06:32.654]  But he's in there for a full hour because
[03:06:33.194 --> 03:06:37.336]  Genesse is so amazing, M4isYes.com, and you see it all over the news.
[03:06:37.336 --> 03:06:38.897]  I mean, they're trying to shut us down.
[03:06:38.897 --> 03:06:49.103]  The editor of Breitbart points out that Alex Jones is patient zero to end free speech, and that Alex Jones is being banned because he's telling the truth and is exciting and popular.
[03:06:49.103 --> 03:06:49.603]  So what do they do?
[03:06:49.603 --> 03:06:52.365]  They build a straw man of things I never said or did.
[03:06:52.365 --> 03:06:57.608]  I'm a Nazi, all this other crap, and then they want me banned.
[03:06:57.608 --> 03:07:00.109]  So, this is how we fund ourselves, Free Market.
[03:07:00.109 --> 03:07:01.530]  If you're listening to local radio station,
[03:07:02.301 --> 03:07:03.322]  Become a sponsor.
[03:07:03.322 --> 03:07:04.622]  Thank the sponsors.
[03:07:04.622 --> 03:07:05.903]  Send the station $100.
[03:07:05.903 --> 03:07:10.445]  They are just as important as I am in the whole chain of fighting the globalists.
[03:07:10.445 --> 03:07:21.491]  Now, Conrad, I want to continue, and we're going to do it on air, with the bags, next segment, where I'm going to put on... I mean, I know one little tube does both eyes.
[03:07:21.491 --> 03:07:23.132]  I did like half a tube in my eyes.
[03:07:23.132 --> 03:07:23.732]  We showed it earlier.
[03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:27.354]  But I'm going to do it live on air, because some people didn't believe what they saw.
[03:07:27.354 --> 03:07:29.055]  It was so amazing.
[03:07:29.055 --> 03:07:29.755]  We're on air.
[03:07:29.755 --> 03:07:30.776]  It's 2.07 Central.
[03:07:31.636 --> 03:07:36.760]  At like 225 Central, I'm going to apply it with a camera on my ugly face up close, sorry.
[03:07:36.760 --> 03:07:39.122]  You're going to see it for yourself.
[03:07:39.122 --> 03:07:41.044]  And so it is extremely dramatic.
[03:07:41.044 --> 03:07:43.245]  So that is coming up.
[03:07:43.245 --> 03:07:44.306]  I want to take calls though.
[03:07:44.306 --> 03:07:56.256]  We got Alex and Tom and Pastor Sam and Nate and Alex and George and Brandon in California and Indiana and Julie and Adam and Danae and Robert and we got Millie Weaver coming up.
[03:07:56.256 --> 03:07:57.577]  But I'll get to all your calls.
[03:07:57.577 --> 03:07:58.938]  And I'm hosting the fourth hour.
[03:08:00.106 --> 03:08:04.157]  And I'm hosting the fourth hour, ladies and gentlemen, which we're now into here today.
[03:08:04.157 --> 03:08:05.821]  And the war room's coming up after that.
[03:08:05.821 --> 03:08:07.867]  But I do want to take some phone calls right now because here's the deal.
[03:08:08.732 --> 03:08:15.837]  You know, Conrad, you're a smart guy, I've gotten to know you, but let me guess, you're just more of a pragmatic, common sense, what, like, libertarian?
[03:08:15.837 --> 03:08:17.258]  I wouldn't even say Republican, Democrat.
[03:08:17.258 --> 03:08:20.761]  I know you like Trump, but it's kind of dangerous to even say that.
[03:08:20.761 --> 03:08:26.905]  But the fact that Jeunesse wants me to be a spokesperson, they're a great big multi-billion dollar company, you know, a billion dollars every year.
[03:08:26.905 --> 03:08:29.387]  I like the fact that you're not cowards on top of it.
[03:08:29.387 --> 03:08:34.511]  Yeah, well, you know, if you were to ask me, you know, what I'm all about, it's really entrepreneurship.
[03:08:35.516 --> 03:08:47.761]  I'm an entrepreneur and I, you know, like you're an entrepreneur and, you know, the thing about, the thing about the, the opportunity, the, the Jeunesse opportunity for most people though is that it really empowers people to go out there and be an entrepreneur.
[03:08:47.761 --> 03:08:54.563]  That's what I love about it more than anything else is it teaches a person to say, look, if you want something to happen, don't count on the government, don't count on anybody else.
[03:08:54.563 --> 03:08:58.905]  Don't, don't think that your degree is going to make it all happen for you because there's a lot more to it than that.
[03:08:58.905 --> 03:09:02.526]  And that's what I love about the model is the model has been proven over a hundred years.
[03:09:03.146 --> 03:09:03.326]  Thank you.
[03:09:21.178 --> 03:09:22.858]  You know, the thing about this is, this does work.
[03:09:22.858 --> 03:09:25.619]  No, if I was going to sell cars, I want to sell whatever the hottest and best was.
[03:09:25.619 --> 03:09:26.339]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:09:26.339 --> 03:09:27.339]  The one that sells themselves.
[03:09:27.339 --> 03:09:32.580]  Yeah, and the great part about it is, if you look at the richest people in the world, they have global businesses.
[03:09:32.580 --> 03:09:34.200]  They don't have businesses that are just in one area.
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:34.680]  No, and I agree.
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:35.761]  Let me ask you, you've got the network.
[03:09:35.761 --> 03:09:37.701]  Let me ask this question.
[03:09:37.701 --> 03:09:48.163]  Why, with the economy at 4.8% growth, and everything turning around, why can they get so many people, particularly college students, you talked about this last time we were going to calls,
[03:09:48.982 --> 03:09:58.304]  I look at it, they're talking about white patriarchy and all this crap, when I watch these videos that our crew shot live this weekend with Kavanaugh's confirmation, and they're like almost all white.
[03:09:58.304 --> 03:09:59.544]  And they're almost all white women.
[03:09:59.544 --> 03:10:10.607]  And my mom's a white woman, my wife's a white woman, I love white people, my daughters, I'm not against white people, but it's like white people going, racist patriarchy, racist whites, whites rule, racism, America sucks!
[03:10:10.607 --> 03:10:12.207]  But everybody's trying to get into America.
[03:10:12.207 --> 03:10:15.068]  It doesn't mean America's perfect, but the idea's great.
[03:10:15.068 --> 03:10:16.128]  And what is it about college?
[03:10:16.128 --> 03:10:16.488]  Well, I know.
[03:10:17.954 --> 03:10:18.835]  90% of degrees are worthless.
[03:10:18.835 --> 03:10:20.036]  You'll never pay them back.
[03:10:20.036 --> 03:10:21.137]  You'll end up bagging groceries.
[03:10:21.137 --> 03:10:21.577]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:21.577 --> 03:10:25.520]  And then they've got a chip on their shoulder thinking, oh, we didn't take over.
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:27.141]  The socialism didn't take over.
[03:10:27.141 --> 03:10:30.004]  If we take over, then my degree will be worth something.
[03:10:30.004 --> 03:10:38.630]  It's like folks that buy into the Nigerian phone scams or, you know, the scams they do where they're saving, you know, sex trafficked women or whatever it is.
[03:10:39.611 --> 03:10:44.898]  And once people have already invested $5,000, they don't want to admit they got scammed, then it's $100,000.
[03:10:44.898 --> 03:10:46.861]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[03:10:46.861 --> 03:10:50.966]  The left has like invested in the ultimate socialist Ponzi scheme.
[03:10:50.966 --> 03:10:54.570]  Yeah, well the problem is that everybody's taught to live in a box.
[03:10:55.171 --> 03:11:01.117]  The reason people want to come to the United States of America is because they know there's no limitations on living in a box.
[03:11:01.117 --> 03:11:12.108]  And so what's great about this business model is that it allows a person to be able to say, you know what, I want to be an entrepreneur and I can go into and be involved with a company that's proven they supply everything for me.
[03:11:12.108 --> 03:11:13.830]  I don't have to... Well, that's why it's so good.
[03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:15.572]  Almost all women have heard of this eye cream.
[03:11:16.955 --> 03:11:18.558]  But they don't take the action to go get it.
[03:11:18.558 --> 03:11:21.823]  If you've got it, you can sign folks up like hotcakes for the eye cream.
[03:11:21.823 --> 03:11:23.446]  I just personally think the eye cream is the way to go.
[03:11:23.446 --> 03:11:25.209]  Let me tell you right now.
[03:11:26.621 --> 03:11:30.742]  If I was in college or whatever, I could go shell every female I know and then get them to shell it.
[03:11:30.742 --> 03:11:32.183]  And that's the MLM level.
[03:11:32.183 --> 03:11:33.944]  You're getting them to then sell the women they know.
[03:11:33.944 --> 03:11:34.144]  Right.
[03:11:34.144 --> 03:11:35.844]  Just the eye cream alone is dynamite.
[03:11:35.844 --> 03:11:37.665]  Well, the new economy is word of mouth, Alex.
[03:11:37.665 --> 03:11:39.325]  That's the thing about it is that most people don't realize.
[03:11:39.325 --> 03:11:40.046]  The internet's burned out.
[03:11:40.046 --> 03:11:41.486]  Yeah, the internet's burned out.
[03:11:41.486 --> 03:11:46.388]  The most powerful form of marketing today is somebody saying, hey, I like this and you should check it out.
[03:11:46.388 --> 03:11:47.968]  Or I like that and you should check it out.
[03:11:47.968 --> 03:11:53.250]  I mean, when was the last time you recommended something and you didn't get paid for it, like a movie or something?
[03:11:53.250 --> 03:11:54.071]  Hey, go watch this movie.
[03:11:54.071 --> 03:11:54.551]  Did you get paid?
[03:11:55.171 --> 03:11:55.732]  Go read this book.
[03:11:55.732 --> 03:11:56.692]  And that's the number one thing.
[03:11:56.692 --> 03:11:59.475]  I don't go off reviews because they admit Rotten Tomatoes is bought up and fake now.
[03:11:59.475 --> 03:12:02.797]  I literally call people I know and say, have you seen movies lately?
[03:12:02.797 --> 03:12:05.279]  The reviews are all, this one sucks, that one's good.
[03:12:05.279 --> 03:12:06.640]  I call people.
[03:12:06.640 --> 03:12:06.821]  Right.
[03:12:06.821 --> 03:12:08.402]  Because I won't go off reviews now.
[03:12:08.402 --> 03:12:08.982]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:08.982 --> 03:12:11.104]  Well, no, the reviews only went bad the last five years.
[03:12:11.104 --> 03:12:11.725]  Right, right.
[03:12:11.725 --> 03:12:12.265]  Have you noticed?
[03:12:12.265 --> 03:12:13.606]  Yeah, yeah, I have.
[03:12:13.606 --> 03:12:15.027]  I mean, you have to call people.
[03:12:15.027 --> 03:12:16.248]  You have to call people.
[03:12:16.248 --> 03:12:19.091]  I mean, the thing about the thing about any product that's out there.
[03:12:19.091 --> 03:12:21.272]  OK, so like it's like it's like with this product right here.
[03:12:21.272 --> 03:12:21.372]  OK.
[03:12:22.473 --> 03:12:23.354]  It's pretty simple.
[03:12:23.354 --> 03:12:24.754]  You drink it, you get energy.
[03:12:24.754 --> 03:12:25.875]  It's not real complicated.
[03:12:25.875 --> 03:12:29.097]  So if you go out there and you like a product, you tell somebody about it.
[03:12:29.097 --> 03:12:32.558]  See, celebrities and athletes have been doing this forever.
[03:12:32.558 --> 03:12:34.199]  But they get paid for it, right?
[03:12:34.199 --> 03:12:36.440]  Here, you get paid for it, and then Jeanette pays you.
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:37.561]  Let's expand on that.
[03:12:37.561 --> 03:12:39.202]  So many of these other supplement companies
[03:12:40.438 --> 03:12:44.821]  They mark stuff up seven times, they put crap in it, and it's all marketing, and it's... No.
[03:12:44.821 --> 03:12:50.285]  I happen to know, you guys, like, half the cost is literally the... That's what I like, is it's really good.
[03:12:50.285 --> 03:12:52.386]  People go, why would you want to sell something really good?
[03:12:52.386 --> 03:12:53.887]  They just think people are idiots.
[03:12:53.887 --> 03:12:56.769]  They think they want the marketing instead of the quality ingredients.
[03:12:56.769 --> 03:12:58.010]  Well, they do.
[03:12:58.010 --> 03:12:58.330]  They do.
[03:12:58.330 --> 03:13:00.792]  The key is that you have to have products that people want to rebuy.
[03:13:00.792 --> 03:13:01.752]  I know.
[03:13:01.752 --> 03:13:04.114]  So then why are most supplements marked up seven times in crap?
[03:13:05.070 --> 03:13:08.455]  Because what happens is people go out and they market it, market it, market it.
[03:13:08.455 --> 03:13:11.238]  Because the corporate dudes are real... you know what?
[03:13:11.238 --> 03:13:11.799]  Yeah, they are.
[03:13:11.799 --> 03:13:12.320]  They are.
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:14.783]  Or they'll get a celebrity who doesn't even use the product.
[03:13:14.783 --> 03:13:16.145]  There's products out there... No, that's what I'm saying.
[03:13:16.145 --> 03:13:20.270]  They spend it all on the advertising and the celebrity instead of like knocking your socks off.
[03:13:20.370 --> 03:13:21.331]  Right, exactly.
[03:13:21.331 --> 03:13:30.380]  When people see the bags underneath Alex go away within just, within two minutes or less, how can, how could that, and you're going to see this live by the way, okay?
[03:13:30.380 --> 03:13:31.120]  You get what I'm saying?
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:35.685]  You're seeing something work first hand, then you're going to go buy it, and then that's what, that's the game plan.
[03:13:35.685 --> 03:13:37.186]  And then George Soros can go fly a kite.
[03:13:37.907 --> 03:13:41.089]  Because we're going to still be on the air and be funded selling stuff that works like hotcakes.
[03:13:41.089 --> 03:13:44.230]  Well, I still think we should send maybe George Soros a whole pallet of this.
[03:13:44.230 --> 03:13:48.172]  You know, that'd be a good stunt to mail this to him because he's got the biggest bags I've ever seen.
[03:13:48.172 --> 03:13:50.314]  He does, and he needs about a whole pallet of this stuff.
[03:13:50.314 --> 03:13:53.715]  I'm going to be honest, he looks like he has two scrotums under his eyes.
[03:13:53.715 --> 03:13:55.216]  Sorry, I'm being mean.
[03:13:55.216 --> 03:13:56.717]  Let's go to Alex in Minnesota.
[03:13:56.717 --> 03:13:57.957]  Alex, thanks for calling.
[03:13:57.957 --> 03:14:01.259]  What do you think the Democrats and the Globals are going to pull?
[03:14:01.259 --> 03:14:03.981]  They say they're going to go completely ape now that Kavanaugh has been confirmed.
[03:14:03.981 --> 03:14:04.421]  What do you think?
[03:14:06.249 --> 03:14:15.077]  Well, Alex, yeah, I mean, I've even seen it firsthand in my home state of Minnesota, which unfortunately is a pretty liberal place if you're in the metro.
[03:14:15.077 --> 03:14:17.559]  But, you know, I started listening to you in 2016.
[03:14:17.559 --> 03:14:23.725]  I know a lot of other people did around that time, too, because, you know, you give an angle that you're just not going to hear in the mainstream media.
[03:14:23.725 --> 03:14:28.249]  So that's why I wanted to ask you, you know, what do you think is going to happen during the midterms?
[03:14:28.249 --> 03:14:30.671]  Because I know, you know, if you go to any of the typical polls,
[03:14:31.417 --> 03:14:34.421]  They say it's gloom and doom, it's game over for the Liberty Movement.
[03:14:34.421 --> 03:14:39.407]  But, you know, in 2016 we saw the exact opposite of their narrative come true.
[03:14:39.407 --> 03:14:41.870]  So what do you think is going to happen and where do we go from here?
[03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:46.075]  Well, I saw a headline two days ago on CNN saying, believe the polls.
[03:14:47.290 --> 03:14:51.072]  And I know, I didn't just say Trump was going to win because I magically thought that.
[03:14:51.072 --> 03:14:55.234]  I said, there's a huge wave of election fraud coming, which is confirmed.
[03:14:55.234 --> 03:15:05.278]  There's a huge wave of populist sentiment, just like the Donald Trump they tried to kill of Brazil just won the first round by a huge margin.
[03:15:05.278 --> 03:15:13.902]  And just like all the world, populists are being elected from Germany, to Sweden, to Greece, to areas of Asia, to Africa, to Latin America.
[03:15:13.902 --> 03:15:15.122]  So you've got that.
[03:15:15.122 --> 03:15:15.363]  And then
[03:15:16.563 --> 03:15:22.131]  They add 10 to 15 to 20 points being on the poll over sampling of Democrats claiming, oh, they're more Democrats.
[03:15:22.131 --> 03:15:22.852]  So that's skewed.
[03:15:22.852 --> 03:15:29.181]  So saying in polls in battleground states that Republicans are five points behind, well, that means Republicans are 10 points ahead.
[03:15:29.181 --> 03:15:31.785]  But you add election fraud in, I'd say it's a dead heat.
[03:15:32.626 --> 03:15:36.768]  And I think them being so bullying during Kavanaugh is going to backfire.
[03:15:36.768 --> 03:15:39.569]  And I believe they're going to barely hold the House.
[03:15:39.569 --> 03:15:43.331]  And I believe they're going to hold the Senate if we stay the course.
[03:15:43.331 --> 03:15:44.892]  There may be a false flag that changes that.
[03:15:44.892 --> 03:15:48.874]  But right now, I am predicting a red wave goes over the blue seawall.
[03:15:48.874 --> 03:15:49.594]  Stay there, Alex.
[03:15:49.594 --> 03:15:50.795]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[03:15:53.078 --> 03:15:56.539]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.

[03:19:57.588 --> 03:20:00.229]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.901 --> 03:20:18.343]  Conrad the Constitution Padilla is our guest with M4sYes.com.
[03:20:18.343 --> 03:20:32.531]  I'm gonna go back to your calls here in just a moment and then live on air I'm gonna put some of this great product from Jeunesse instantly ageless on my metrosexual bags.
[03:20:32.531 --> 03:20:33.351]  If you leave me.
[03:20:33.351 --> 03:20:36.093]  Alright we're gonna go ahead and go back to your calls.
[03:20:36.093 --> 03:20:37.914]  Alex you're asking some serious questions though.
[03:20:39.454 --> 03:20:49.364]  I don't just get up here and cheerlead that I think Trump was going to win 20 months ago, or I thought that he would actually do good on TPP and all this.
[03:20:49.364 --> 03:20:54.690]  I knew by what they were doing and how angry they were, and by who was behind Trump, that he was for real.
[03:20:54.690 --> 03:21:02.058]  Doesn't mean he's perfect, doesn't mean the Pentagon and the Patriots and some of the corporations, the American people are perfect, but we want to run our own country.
[03:21:03.365 --> 03:21:08.526]  And Trump represents that insurgency to take our government back and our country back.
[03:21:08.526 --> 03:21:10.887]  And so that's why those that are fighting against it are traitors.
[03:21:10.887 --> 03:21:21.750]  And now, 20 months later, 21 months almost, yes it is 21 months, he's saying 21 months later, we are so close to the economy coming back from the dead, that's what frightens the globalists.
[03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:23.731]  So my prediction is
[03:21:24.858 --> 03:21:31.679]  They have a four to five point lead, CNN and others tell us, in all of these battleground states.
[03:21:31.679 --> 03:21:42.802]  And that shows they don't want it to be as ridiculous as two years ago, where they're like, 98% chance scientific algorithm, Hillary wins, and all the rest of that garbage.
[03:21:42.802 --> 03:21:45.642]  So now they're just saying, oh, there's a five point lead.
[03:21:45.642 --> 03:21:49.263]  Okay, well, then they're sampling more Democrats than Republicans, it evens out.
[03:21:49.263 --> 03:21:52.084]  I think it's up to all of us to get everyone we know to go vote for sure.
[03:21:53.266 --> 03:21:59.289]  And to not, you know, vote twice as the Democrats do, but to really just get the word out and stand up against this bullying.
[03:21:59.289 --> 03:22:02.350]  What do you think is going to happen, Alex?
[03:22:02.350 --> 03:22:07.592]  Well, I think we really can win, but I think it's going to have to be a grassroots movement just like it was in 2016.
[03:22:07.592 --> 03:22:14.775]  And, you know, I think the best thing for us to do is to just shut off the corporate media and turn to people like you.
[03:22:14.775 --> 03:22:16.696]  And I think that's why you've become so popular.
[03:22:16.696 --> 03:22:18.517]  You know, I heard about you just by word of mouth.
[03:22:19.281 --> 03:22:20.102]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:22:20.102 --> 03:22:20.742]  Let me say this.
[03:22:20.742 --> 03:22:24.384]  I'm all for corporations and free market and profit.
[03:22:24.384 --> 03:22:28.547]  But these big corporations get together, they create a consensus, and the voter they see is an enemy.
[03:22:43.564 --> 03:22:46.367]  They've all made even more money under Trump, but they still hate him.
[03:22:46.367 --> 03:22:48.009]  Because they want the power.
[03:22:48.009 --> 03:22:48.630]  Yeah.
[03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:50.132]  Got any comments on that, Conrad?
[03:22:50.132 --> 03:22:50.732]  Yeah, they do.
[03:22:50.732 --> 03:22:54.317]  They want the power, but they also want everybody to live in their boxes.
[03:22:54.317 --> 03:22:55.738]  And I think that's the thing.
[03:22:55.738 --> 03:22:59.663]  I think if you were to ask me about Trump, why has he done so well, and why are people
[03:23:00.284 --> 03:23:00.664]  I don't know.
[03:23:16.181 --> 03:23:29.407]  That if he hadn't delivered, he'd be in trouble, but he's delivered now, and people get like, the whole establishment we're sick of, and Bill and Hillary Clinton, they're all telling us we're bad, but, I mean, I think they've really pushed too far.
[03:23:29.407 --> 03:23:32.208]  Yeah, well, they pushed too far, and people are smarter now.
[03:23:32.788 --> 03:23:36.009]  See, people are tired of being tired, and they're like, you know what?
[03:23:36.009 --> 03:23:41.872]  You guys aren't delivering in Washington anymore, and so you guys don't do what you say you're going to do.
[03:23:41.872 --> 03:23:46.233]  And so what they're doing is, they're all flocking to Trump now, because Trump is delivering.
[03:23:46.233 --> 03:23:48.294]  I mean, it's amazing what he's done in two years.
[03:23:48.294 --> 03:23:49.275]  And I agree.
[03:23:49.275 --> 03:23:51.355]  What happens if they were successful to remove him?
[03:23:51.355 --> 03:23:52.236]  Have they thought about that?
[03:23:53.140 --> 03:23:54.801]  I mean, people would be pissed.
[03:23:54.801 --> 03:23:57.462]  Well, they'd be pissed, but good luck.
[03:23:57.462 --> 03:23:57.842]  Good luck.
[03:23:57.842 --> 03:24:05.265]  In my personal opinion, I think that you have more people right now that are even Democrats right now, especially after this whole mess with this Kavanaugh thing.
[03:24:05.265 --> 03:24:07.886]  I mean, they really embarrassed themselves, the Democratic Party.
[03:24:07.886 --> 03:24:13.208]  I think what they're basically going to do now is they pushed even people more to the Republican Party and the Republican Party stronger than ever.
[03:24:13.208 --> 03:24:17.550]  No, I agree, because Republicans were going to win the midterms.
[03:24:18.584 --> 03:24:20.586]  But because of election fraud, they might have lost.
[03:24:20.586 --> 03:24:22.167]  But I think real numbers, they were gonna win.
[03:24:22.167 --> 03:24:24.229]  That's the sense of the country, the numbers.
[03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:28.052]  But because of the Kavanaugh and the bullying, I think it pushed it over the edge.
[03:24:28.052 --> 03:24:30.254]  So I think narrow victory.
[03:24:30.254 --> 03:24:34.357]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be a narrow victory, but I agree with your caller.
[03:24:34.357 --> 03:24:35.618]  I completely agree, man.
[03:24:35.618 --> 03:24:37.259]  Don't listen to what a lot of the media says.
[03:24:37.259 --> 03:24:38.240]  Go vote.
[03:24:38.240 --> 03:24:39.341]  Everybody needs to go vote.
[03:24:39.341 --> 03:24:40.382]  Don't think it's a done deal.
[03:24:40.382 --> 03:24:41.703]  And spread the word about independent media.
[03:24:41.883 --> 03:24:43.724]  They have absolute independent media.
[03:24:43.724 --> 03:24:47.505]  What I agree with what you're doing, Alex, here is proof.
[03:24:47.505 --> 03:24:52.367]  It proves the network marketing model as well, which is that word of mouth marketing works.
[03:24:52.367 --> 03:24:59.969]  Oh, they want to shut down because we're a media institution that's reached billions of people every year, literally, that isn't funded by the big corporates.
[03:24:59.969 --> 03:25:03.110]  So if people adopt this model, it's over for them.
[03:25:03.110 --> 03:25:04.531]  We've got a few minutes to break.
[03:25:04.531 --> 03:25:05.431]  Three minutes to break.
[03:25:05.431 --> 03:25:05.971]  Boom.
[03:25:05.971 --> 03:25:06.571]  Three and a half minutes.
[03:25:06.571 --> 03:25:07.632]  Let me get this on.
[03:25:07.632 --> 03:25:09.652]  This is the amazing product at InfoWars.
[03:25:09.652 --> 03:25:10.373]  Yes.com.
[03:25:10.373 --> 03:25:11.033]  Instantly ageless.
[03:25:11.553 --> 03:25:14.815]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't even have to use a full deal of it.
[03:25:14.815 --> 03:25:17.597]  Last time I did this live, it was incredible.
[03:25:17.597 --> 03:25:19.558]  So I'm getting that on right there.
[03:25:19.558 --> 03:25:22.380]  Again, I'm not a big guy at applying stuff.
[03:25:22.380 --> 03:25:23.521]  And it's all natural.
[03:25:23.521 --> 03:25:26.763]  It gets on there and it does an incredible job.
[03:25:26.763 --> 03:25:27.423]  I'll get this on.
[03:25:27.423 --> 03:25:29.845]  And it lasts 10 hours.
[03:25:29.845 --> 03:25:31.146]  And you saw what it did last time.
[03:25:31.146 --> 03:25:32.947]  I didn't even use the full tube.
[03:25:32.947 --> 03:25:33.928]  That's good for two eyes.
[03:25:35.245 --> 03:25:37.626]  Some of us have more than two eyes, but three or four.
[03:25:37.626 --> 03:25:39.827]  Yeah, let it dry and it'll start working.
[03:25:39.827 --> 03:25:40.987]  You think I got enough on there now?
[03:25:40.987 --> 03:25:41.907]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:25:41.907 --> 03:25:43.028]  All right, then just do this?
[03:25:43.028 --> 03:25:43.168]  Yeah.
[03:25:43.168 --> 03:25:43.728]  All right, let's start.
[03:25:43.728 --> 03:25:44.788]  We're three minutes to break.
[03:25:44.788 --> 03:25:45.869]  Let's do it.
[03:25:45.869 --> 03:25:47.429]  As it dries, it works.
[03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:48.309]  I declare!
[03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:50.090]  I declare!
[03:25:55.214 --> 03:25:56.996]  So there you go.
[03:25:56.996 --> 03:26:02.281]  And then after it dries a little bit extra, you put a little water there, kind of wipe it off.
[03:26:02.281 --> 03:26:03.382]  It's already working.
[03:26:03.382 --> 03:26:05.604]  I'm learning how to put makeup on.
[03:26:05.604 --> 03:26:09.007]  So beautiful.
[03:26:09.007 --> 03:26:09.627]  That's a joke.
[03:26:09.627 --> 03:26:13.711]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26:13.711 --> 03:26:15.392]  Stopwatch is going.
[03:26:15.392 --> 03:26:16.934]  We got like two and a half minutes left here.
[03:26:16.934 --> 03:26:21.318]  Again, if you're a radio listener, we're talking about
[03:26:22.935 --> 03:26:26.278]  Instantly Ageless and InfoWarsYes.com that is rated out there.
[03:26:26.278 --> 03:26:27.018]  Look it up yourself.
[03:26:27.018 --> 03:26:31.141]  The best bags under the eyes eye cream out there.
[03:26:31.141 --> 03:26:32.022]  It works amazing.
[03:26:32.022 --> 03:26:34.084]  Look, we're only a minute.
[03:26:34.084 --> 03:26:39.928]  We're 45 seconds in and unbelievable.
[03:26:39.928 --> 03:26:42.230]  I mean, do people see what I'm seeing right there?
[03:26:42.230 --> 03:26:43.551]  Yeah, especially live.
[03:26:43.551 --> 03:26:45.352]  What's great about this, people are seeing it live.
[03:26:45.352 --> 03:26:47.494]  You know, I should have put it on my crow's feet too.
[03:26:47.494 --> 03:26:48.555]  I know it does that too here.
[03:26:48.555 --> 03:26:49.215]  We don't have enough time.
[03:26:49.215 --> 03:26:49.696]  We got a break.
[03:26:49.696 --> 03:26:50.096]  Let's try it.
[03:26:51.889 --> 03:26:54.390]  I kind of like my cross feet though.
[03:26:54.390 --> 03:26:56.832]  Yeah, it's a sign of wisdom.
[03:26:56.832 --> 03:26:58.933]  Well, let's just say the ladies don't dislike it.
[03:26:58.933 --> 03:27:00.634]  Don't think anything about that.
[03:27:00.634 --> 03:27:03.395]  Anyways, the point is, I'm going to try to get rid of my wrinkles.
[03:27:03.395 --> 03:27:04.836]  But it sure as hell works though.
[03:27:04.836 --> 03:27:07.157]  This is great for women or whoever else.
[03:27:07.157 --> 03:27:10.059]  I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
[03:27:10.059 --> 03:27:11.019]  Just see how this looks here.
[03:27:11.019 --> 03:27:13.200]  I'm just smearing it all over my face.
[03:27:13.200 --> 03:27:15.241]  See, this is one dose here.
[03:27:15.241 --> 03:27:17.683]  This is one dose, but I'm just putting it all over here.
[03:27:18.959 --> 03:27:20.040]  So we'll see how this turns out.
[03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:22.401]  I probably put it in the wrong places on my face.
[03:27:22.401 --> 03:27:24.283]  Again, InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:27:24.283 --> 03:27:29.867]  You get these great products for your friends, your family, energy drinks, high quality supplements, and the eye cream, and wow!
[03:27:31.903 --> 03:27:36.106]  The problem is we're live, so I can't go back and show what I looked like two minutes ago.
[03:27:36.106 --> 03:27:37.327]  But it's pretty dramatic, wouldn't you say?
[03:27:37.327 --> 03:27:38.208]  Yeah, it is.
[03:27:38.208 --> 03:27:38.508]  It is.
[03:27:38.508 --> 03:27:42.771]  And in two minutes or so, you notice a huge difference in the bags.
[03:27:42.771 --> 03:27:44.432]  And like I said, it's male or female.
[03:27:44.432 --> 03:27:47.374]  I mean, you know, nobody out there wakes up in the morning and says, hey, I love my bag.
[03:27:47.374 --> 03:27:49.836]  I'm a female that identifies that.
[03:27:49.836 --> 03:27:50.476]  I'm a female.
[03:27:50.476 --> 03:27:54.079]  This is working really great.
[03:27:54.079 --> 03:27:55.920]  Infowars.
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:27:56.701]  Yes.com.
[03:27:56.701 --> 03:27:57.762]  We're very, very excited about it.
[03:27:57.762 --> 03:27:59.983]  Let's go back to camera five, please.
[03:27:59.983 --> 03:28:00.784]  Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[03:28:02.452 --> 03:28:04.753]  Can we zoom in even more so they can actually see that?
[03:28:04.753 --> 03:28:06.714]  Wow, it works in 10 hours, huh?
[03:28:06.714 --> 03:28:09.875]  Yeah, it works up to 8 to 10 hours is the average.
[03:28:09.875 --> 03:28:11.655]  It says even on the box and stuff.
[03:28:11.655 --> 03:28:17.637]  But right now, too, Alex, people can actually go to the site, become Preferred Customers, and they get a 25% off right now.
[03:28:17.637 --> 03:28:22.659]  So, go to InfoWaresYes.com and you get, like I said, become a Preferred Customer and you get 25% off.
[03:28:22.659 --> 03:28:26.301]  If I put this on, George Soros would think I was attractive and date me, because I actually have a crush on George Soros.
[03:28:26.301 --> 03:28:27.821]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:27.821 --> 03:28:28.761]  I think he would.
[03:28:28.761 --> 03:28:29.342]  George Soros.
[03:28:30.342 --> 03:28:31.423]  Join me.
[03:28:31.423 --> 03:28:34.026]  Now you'll complete your training.
[03:28:34.026 --> 03:28:34.586]  Join me.
[03:28:34.586 --> 03:28:38.309]  We'll rule the galaxy as father and son.
[03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:40.251]  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to him.
[03:28:40.251 --> 03:28:42.974]  I wouldn't be surprised if he orders some on InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:28:42.974 --> 03:28:44.095]  I really would.
[03:28:44.095 --> 03:28:45.976]  Especially with the deal going right now.
[03:28:45.976 --> 03:28:47.138]  I'm not gonna lie.
[03:28:47.138 --> 03:28:49.099]  I've got a serious crush on George Soros.
[03:28:49.099 --> 03:28:49.740]  Hey!
[03:28:49.740 --> 03:28:50.801]  Conrad, thanks for coming in.
[03:28:50.801 --> 03:28:51.221]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:28:53.112 --> 03:28:56.555]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:28:56.555 --> 03:28:59.377]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:28:59.377 --> 03:29:01.299]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:01.299 --> 03:29:06.343]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:29:06.343 --> 03:29:09.625]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:09.625 --> 03:29:15.890]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:29:15.890 --> 03:29:20.654]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work
[03:29:20.854 --> 03:29:25.419]  And have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:29:25.419 --> 03:29:26.861]  Why take another pill?
[03:29:26.861 --> 03:29:31.106]  Many people use our Sunny Bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:29:31.106 --> 03:29:35.511]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[03:29:35.851 --> 03:29:39.073]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:29:39.073 --> 03:29:44.295]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.

[03:29:54.284 --> 03:30:03.777]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[03:30:03.777 --> 03:30:08.483]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[03:30:08.483 --> 03:30:09.985]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[03:30:10.185 --> 03:30:13.247]  From healthy, nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[03:30:13.247 --> 03:30:16.289]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[03:30:16.289 --> 03:30:18.711]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[03:30:18.711 --> 03:30:22.274]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[03:30:22.274 --> 03:30:26.637]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[03:30:26.637 --> 03:30:35.223]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[03:30:35.223 --> 03:30:37.165]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:37.745 --> 03:30:49.527]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:30:49.527 --> 03:30:51.407]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:31:06.570 --> 03:31:09.432]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:31:09.432 --> 03:31:10.913]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:10.913 --> 03:31:17.758]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:31:17.758 --> 03:31:19.840]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:31:19.840 --> 03:31:29.547]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:31:29.547 --> 03:31:34.531]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[03:31:34.531 --> 03:31:37.632]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:31:59.068 --> 03:32:07.751]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:32:07.751 --> 03:32:09.712]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:32:09.712 --> 03:32:13.173]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:32:13.173 --> 03:32:15.794]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:32:15.794 --> 03:32:18.095]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:32:18.095 --> 03:32:25.038]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:32:25.598 --> 03:32:35.385]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:32:35.385 --> 03:32:36.566]  We'll win.
[03:32:36.566 --> 03:32:39.468]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[03:32:39.468 --> 03:32:44.792]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[03:32:44.792 --> 03:32:46.634]  And you're right, to the market.
[03:32:46.634 --> 03:32:50.317]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:32:50.317 --> 03:32:51.878]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:32:51.878 --> 03:32:52.738]  We need your support.
[03:32:52.738 --> 03:32:53.299]  I'm counting on you.
[03:32:57.103 --> 03:33:00.224]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:00.224 --> 03:33:15.170]  You know, I don't even like saying this because it's so bizarre.
[03:33:15.170 --> 03:33:15.990]  It's so scary.
[03:33:28.844 --> 03:33:32.086]  You're listening to the number one band broadcast in the world.
[03:33:32.086 --> 03:33:36.469]  It's because we believe in free market, we believe in America, we believe in individuals.
[03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:38.991]  And we got loaded phone lines here, Millie Weavers will be popping in with us.
[03:33:38.991 --> 03:33:41.333]  I appreciate everybody calling in today.
[03:33:43.061 --> 03:33:45.523]  I just spent some time trying to fund our operation with great products.
[03:33:45.523 --> 03:33:47.384]  I appreciate the stations putting up with that.
[03:33:47.384 --> 03:33:49.445]  I rarely do that, but it really is good stuff.
[03:33:49.445 --> 03:33:53.868]  People understand what everybody's going through here who's a conservative, or a libertarian, or a Christian.
[03:33:53.868 --> 03:33:57.631]  Trying to just fund our ability to get the word out and try to save this country.
[03:33:57.631 --> 03:34:01.354]  And Tom in Texas is talking about silenced on all levels.
[03:34:01.354 --> 03:34:02.554]  That's what he wanted to volunteer.
[03:34:02.554 --> 03:34:05.637]  We don't really screen your calls, but where you're calling from, what the topic is.
[03:34:05.637 --> 03:34:07.838]  But he wants to talk about silenced on all levels.
[03:34:07.838 --> 03:34:10.240]  We're all pretty confident still, and we're all
[03:34:11.618 --> 03:34:17.123]  Not victims here, so we're kinda cool about it, but our First Amendment birthright is being ganged up on.
[03:34:17.123 --> 03:34:21.307]  The left, from universities to media to culture, is trying to ban speech.
[03:34:21.307 --> 03:34:23.068]  I got three articles right here.
[03:34:23.068 --> 03:34:24.489]  Twitter trolls force U.S.
[03:34:24.489 --> 03:34:27.992]  astronaut Scott Kelly to apologize for praising Winston Churchill.
[03:34:27.992 --> 03:34:28.893]  How the hell'd you do that?
[03:34:28.893 --> 03:34:30.595]  Now he's getting criticized for that.
[03:34:30.595 --> 03:34:36.059]  Columbus Day no longer a holiday in namesake Ohio City of Columbus.
[03:34:36.059 --> 03:34:37.341]  Austin considers renaming city.
[03:34:38.274 --> 03:34:40.915]  They just want to get rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[03:34:40.915 --> 03:34:45.618]  So, Tom, in Texas, what do you think about all this?
[03:34:45.618 --> 03:34:46.118]  Howdy, Alex.
[03:34:46.118 --> 03:34:46.538]  How are you?
[03:34:46.538 --> 03:34:47.198]  I love the show.
[03:34:47.198 --> 03:34:47.979]  Long time listener.
[03:34:47.979 --> 03:34:49.600]  First time caller, brother.
[03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:51.821]  Thanks for calling, my friend.
[03:34:51.821 --> 03:34:56.263]  Yesterday, me and one of my buddies went to the Cowboys-Texans game there in Houston.
[03:34:57.510 --> 03:35:03.332]  And we kind of borrowed Owen's idea when he went to the Ranger game of wearing InfoWars merchandise.
[03:35:03.332 --> 03:35:06.153]  And I have a Trump Halloween mask I decided to wear.
[03:35:06.153 --> 03:35:06.613]  Awesome!
[03:35:06.613 --> 03:35:07.853]  No problem with it.
[03:35:07.853 --> 03:35:08.793]  Everybody was cool.
[03:35:08.793 --> 03:35:09.373]  No problem.
[03:35:09.373 --> 03:35:10.434]  The fans were loving it.
[03:35:10.434 --> 03:35:11.454]  You know, it's a conservative.
[03:35:11.454 --> 03:35:13.355]  It's Texas, after all.
[03:35:13.355 --> 03:35:16.595]  But my buddy held up a support Kavanaugh sign.
[03:35:16.595 --> 03:35:17.876]  You know, very small.
[03:35:17.876 --> 03:35:19.016]  We weren't being belligerent.
[03:35:19.016 --> 03:35:20.237]  Everybody was cool.
[03:35:20.237 --> 03:35:22.397]  We even had video of all this.
[03:35:22.397 --> 03:35:25.418]  And the security in the stadium threw us out of the stadium.
[03:35:26.215 --> 03:35:33.561]  Not because, I don't know who complained, but somebody complained enough to get us thrown out of a football game that we paid a ticket for.
[03:35:33.561 --> 03:35:34.142]  Oh yeah!
[03:35:34.142 --> 03:35:37.745]  They're acting like Kavanaugh is raped now, even though he's totally innocent.
[03:35:37.745 --> 03:35:38.726]  I want to see this video.
[03:35:38.726 --> 03:35:39.607]  I want to put you on hold.
[03:35:39.607 --> 03:35:41.628]  I wish you would have told us.
[03:35:41.628 --> 03:35:44.211]  Has the video been uploaded yet?
[03:35:44.211 --> 03:35:44.551]  It will.
[03:35:44.551 --> 03:35:44.951]  That's the thing.
[03:35:44.951 --> 03:35:47.654]  I put it on my Twitter and my Twitter was banned.
[03:35:47.654 --> 03:35:48.855]  Within hours.
[03:35:48.855 --> 03:35:50.136]  I was kicked off of there.
[03:35:50.922 --> 03:35:54.463]  Oh, they're so scared of us in public places with the InfoWars Army.
[03:35:54.463 --> 03:35:56.084]  Well, you can send it to us.
[03:35:56.084 --> 03:35:59.805]  In fact, I'm going to get your name and number, either Rob Due or one of the crew.
[03:35:59.805 --> 03:36:01.246]  I want to get you on as a guest.
[03:36:01.246 --> 03:36:02.747]  I want to show this band footage.
[03:36:02.747 --> 03:36:04.767]  So tell us what happened.
[03:36:04.767 --> 03:36:07.869]  Well, like I said, we're enjoying the game and, you know, we're telling it beforehand.
[03:36:07.869 --> 03:36:12.811]  We're high-fiving, just enjoying the day, you know, having a good old time at a football game, you know.
[03:36:14.540 --> 03:36:23.201]  We walked in, security checked us in with everything, and about midway through the second quarter, we were escorted out.
[03:36:23.201 --> 03:36:26.642]  So the only time it happened was when you showed that Kavanaugh sign, huh?
[03:36:26.642 --> 03:36:27.062]  Yeah.
[03:36:27.062 --> 03:36:29.002]  We showed the Kavanaugh sign.
[03:36:29.002 --> 03:36:30.743]  Don't know who complained.
[03:36:30.743 --> 03:36:31.703]  What did they say to you?
[03:36:31.703 --> 03:36:37.764]  Because anybody can show whatever they want, but now, oh my God, the Supreme Court Justice, that was a dirty thing you did.
[03:36:37.764 --> 03:36:40.744]  Supposedly, we were told we caused a ruckus.
[03:36:40.744 --> 03:36:43.225]  How do you cause a ruckus at a football game that's already rowdy?
[03:36:43.225 --> 03:36:44.365]  That's what I couldn't figure out.
[03:36:44.656 --> 03:36:51.520]  Everybody's yelling and screaming, because wow, I tell you the NFL's already lost like 30-40% of its viewers.
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:52.620]  All this politically correct stuff.
[03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:55.522]  So you're at a Texans what game?
[03:36:55.522 --> 03:36:57.463]  We're at the Dallas Cowboys-Texans game.
[03:36:57.463 --> 03:36:59.844]  Oh yeah, Texas versus Texas, that's right.
[03:36:59.844 --> 03:37:03.025]  Well listen, I've absolutely got to see the footage of this.
[03:37:03.025 --> 03:37:03.786]  I can't wait to see it.
[03:37:03.786 --> 03:37:05.527]  I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[03:37:05.527 --> 03:37:07.148]  But good job with what you did my friend.
[03:37:07.148 --> 03:37:09.389]  Send it right to you brother.
[03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:10.669]  We're going to put him on hold guys.
[03:37:10.669 --> 03:37:13.311]  Be sure and get his name and info to do with him, okay?
[03:37:14.244 --> 03:37:28.633]  Because it's Owen's idea, kind of like the Bill Clinton's a rapist thing, where we just get, oh by the way, speak of the devil, I forgot it's on newswars.com, I forgot to get to this, they're going to have a nationwide tour of the Clintons.
[03:37:28.633 --> 03:37:31.415]  Here it is, document cam shot please.
[03:37:31.415 --> 03:37:38.499]  Oblivious, that's what they should call the tour, Bill and Hillary Clinton readying nationwide stadium tour.
[03:37:38.499 --> 03:37:40.641]  But notice they're waiting until after the campaign.
[03:37:42.182 --> 03:37:45.585]  After what's coming up in 28 days, 28 and a half days.
[03:37:45.585 --> 03:37:48.687]  So that is the craziness that's on Infowars.com.
[03:37:48.687 --> 03:37:49.868]  We're gonna go to more calls coming up.
[03:37:49.868 --> 03:37:50.909]  The War Room's coming up as well.
[03:37:50.909 --> 03:37:53.611]  If we don't get to all of you, we'll transfer your calls over to the War Room.
[03:37:53.611 --> 03:37:55.633]  I'm sure they want to take you, but I appreciate you calling.
[03:37:55.633 --> 03:38:01.177]  Millie Weaver, you were there Friday, Saturday, Sunday, because they kept protesting after.
[03:38:01.177 --> 03:38:02.358]  They got in your face.
[03:38:02.358 --> 03:38:04.160]  You're pregnant, screamed at you.
[03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:05.841]  They attacked old men, you name it.
[03:38:05.841 --> 03:38:08.964]  We've already played some of the highlights, but this was crazy.
[03:38:08.964 --> 03:38:10.425]  What do you make of what you witnessed?
[03:38:11.789 --> 03:38:29.967]  Well, I was actually pretty dumbfounded when some of these women protesters who say they're for women's rights were shouting shame at me, saying I was disgusting, belittling me and harassing me as a female reporter out there, simply asking them questions as to why they're protesting.
[03:38:30.407 --> 03:38:35.872]  You know, I was being considerate of their feelings and the emotions that were all there.
[03:38:35.872 --> 03:38:46.141]  But just for them to do that, and also, two of the women were pointing at my pregnant belly, saying, shame at my belly, and then shame at my face.
[03:38:46.141 --> 03:38:50.845]  And it's like, what's so shameful about being a woman that keeps her child?
[03:38:50.845 --> 03:38:51.906]  Is that not allowed now?
[03:38:51.906 --> 03:38:52.766]  Yeah, I saw the video.
[03:38:52.766 --> 03:38:55.349]  What is it about feminists that hate women having babies?
[03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:56.790]  They just, they hate life, don't they?
[03:38:58.047 --> 03:38:58.727]  Exactly!
[03:38:58.727 --> 03:39:05.049]  See, they don't want women to actually take on and embrace roles of motherhood and womanhood.
[03:39:05.049 --> 03:39:12.271]  They want women to try to replace men and embrace masculinity and just be all about feminism and man-hating.
[03:39:12.271 --> 03:39:15.832]  And that's what we saw a lot of during these Kavanaugh protests.
[03:39:15.832 --> 03:39:18.153]  We also saw a lot of crying and
[03:39:19.813 --> 03:39:33.219]  I mean, you can see in the video footage there were women literally clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court trying to stampede in there to physically stop Kavanaugh.
[03:39:33.219 --> 03:39:34.720]  The fight's not over.
[03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:37.601]  You can look at the news headlines that are out right now
[03:39:38.182 --> 03:39:38.762]  We're good to go.
[03:39:50.541 --> 03:40:10.217]  Yet, Ben, one, it's not over because if these Democrats were to win the midterms, get the majority in the House and the Senate, you better bet that they're going to stoop so low as to try to impeach Kavanaugh over some bogus, trumped up charge.
[03:40:10.217 --> 03:40:15.322]  Well, imagine, he's more of a mainline conservative, not even that good in many ways, but better than what the Democrats would have done.
[03:40:15.862 --> 03:40:19.565]  And the fact that they are freaking out saying they want to impeach him and all this.
[03:40:19.565 --> 03:40:26.492]  I say Republicans should go on the offensive about all the fake claims and no witnesses and what looks like clear perjury by these women.
[03:40:28.135 --> 03:40:52.668]  Oh, exactly, and when I asked many of these protesters out there what they thought about the FBI and its investigation, essentially not cooperating Blasey Ford's accusations, her witnesses couldn't even cooperate her accusations, essentially they just said, oh well, you know, the FBI, they were just told by the White House to stop investigating and to cease their investigation.
[03:40:52.668 --> 03:40:55.269]  And I love these women march up and go, he is a rapist.
[03:40:56.624 --> 03:40:57.905]  And they go, what's your proof?
[03:40:57.905 --> 03:40:59.706]  Well, he perjured, which he didn't.
[03:40:59.706 --> 03:41:00.907]  I mean, it's just weird.
[03:41:00.907 --> 03:41:04.070]  They just, it's like, they're like big babies.
[03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:07.212]  Their proof is that he likes beer.
[03:41:07.212 --> 03:41:08.213]  That, that's it.
[03:41:08.213 --> 03:41:09.254]  He likes beer.
[03:41:09.254 --> 03:41:11.515]  That's the proof that this man is a rapist.
[03:41:11.515 --> 03:41:12.957]  He likes beer.
[03:41:12.957 --> 03:41:16.059]  Well, I don't think that's how logic works.
[03:41:16.059 --> 03:41:21.103]  I don't think that's how reasoning or common sense works, but I guess it's how the liberal mind works.
[03:41:23.124 --> 03:41:26.865]  I mean, the lunacy that we saw out there was pretty insane.
[03:41:26.865 --> 03:41:41.569]  Now, there is video footage, which we were live streaming, which we're going to get up soon as well, where a group of Trump supporters and Kavanaugh supporters marched into this protest and were chanting, you know, USA, support Kavanaugh.
[03:41:42.109 --> 03:41:42.689]  We're good.
[03:42:02.825 --> 03:42:08.891]  Double standards, contradictions, hypocrisy, and lack of reasoning.
[03:42:08.891 --> 03:42:19.401]  These liberals were desperate to try any excuse they could to try to justify stopping Kavanaugh from getting an office because we all know what this is about.
[03:42:19.401 --> 03:42:25.006]  This is about Roe vs. Wade and these women wanting the right to kill their unborn children.
[03:42:25.006 --> 03:42:25.707]  That's what it's about.
[03:42:26.564 --> 03:42:27.664]  Well, we're not just saying that.
[03:42:27.664 --> 03:42:28.245]  You're right.
[03:42:28.245 --> 03:42:30.346]  Their sacrament is the abortion.
[03:42:30.346 --> 03:42:33.287]  You've had glorious time of the left, the CIA and others literally celebrating.
[03:42:33.287 --> 03:42:34.107]  I killed my child.
[03:42:34.107 --> 03:42:34.527]  I love it.
[03:42:34.527 --> 03:42:35.128]  It's so good.
[03:42:35.128 --> 03:42:36.188]  It's so juicy.
[03:42:36.188 --> 03:42:39.369]  Women have abortions about how pleasurable it is.
[03:42:39.369 --> 03:42:41.370]  Salon puts out.
[03:42:41.370 --> 03:42:42.231]  Vice puts out.
[03:42:42.231 --> 03:42:50.754]  I mean, these are sick people trying to infect us with a psychic virus of self-loathing and killing our life force.
[03:42:50.754 --> 03:42:52.215]  We'll be back with Millie Weaver.
[03:42:52.215 --> 03:42:52.735]  Stay with us.

[03:44:53.672 --> 03:45:02.181]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.181 --> 03:45:03.643]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:03.643 --> 03:45:08.348]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.348 --> 03:45:13.353]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:45:13.573 --> 03:45:33.722]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:45:57.643 --> 03:46:03.369]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.369 --> 03:46:11.237]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.237 --> 03:46:14.380]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:46:14.580 --> 03:46:19.842]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:46:19.842 --> 03:46:22.623]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:22.623 --> 03:46:31.587]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:46:31.767 --> 03:46:33.147]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:20.461 --> 03:47:28.463]  If you're a radio listener, we're showing outside the Capitol, feminists engaging in Kung Fu Warfare.
[03:47:28.463 --> 03:47:31.845]  Training for the non-violent Republicans that they're about to face.
[03:47:31.845 --> 03:47:36.626]  Let me tell you, the Pentagon and Special Operations can learn from this.
[03:47:36.626 --> 03:47:37.126]  UFC can.
[03:47:37.126 --> 03:47:38.867]  These are devastating blows.
[03:47:40.902 --> 03:47:44.004]  Actually, it looks like the worst fighting techniques I've ever seen.
[03:47:44.004 --> 03:47:50.288]  They, like, stomp backward, they stomp forward, and they, like, hammer down with their fists.
[03:47:50.288 --> 03:47:52.630]  I mean, what the hell is this?
[03:47:54.028 --> 03:47:55.489]  But again, no one's threatening them.
[03:47:55.489 --> 03:47:56.590]  It's all just made up.
[03:47:56.590 --> 03:48:05.395]  They're the ones that are, like, roundhousing pro-life women and, like, attacking pregnant women, attacking old men and running around screaming everywhere.
[03:48:05.395 --> 03:48:08.958]  But meanwhile, they're, like, doing... If you're a radio listener, it is the most ridiculous footage.
[03:48:08.958 --> 03:48:10.739]  It's on Millennium Millie.
[03:48:10.739 --> 03:48:12.660]  It's also linked on Infowars.com.
[03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:15.222]  Paul Watson did a whole boil down with all her videos there.
[03:48:15.222 --> 03:48:18.324]  Millions of views the last few days of what she's broken down.
[03:48:19.264 --> 03:48:26.612]  And it's just like, I've never seen any fighting school, Millie, that has anything even like what they've been taught.
[03:48:26.612 --> 03:48:29.375]  Where did this come from?
[03:48:29.375 --> 03:48:32.919]  Well, I don't really think that their instructor is very credible.
[03:48:32.919 --> 03:48:36.263]  The instructor's already in a leg brace.
[03:48:36.263 --> 03:48:36.943]  It's an effective fight.
[03:48:36.943 --> 03:48:39.066]  By the way, they're wearing shirts that say nasty women.
[03:48:40.194 --> 03:48:47.620]  Oh yeah, and I think that it's an effective fighting technique if you're trying to swat at mosquitoes and stomp on ants.
[03:48:47.620 --> 03:48:48.741]  That's about it.
[03:48:48.741 --> 03:48:53.885]  You would not be able to fight off an actual attack with those moves at all.
[03:48:53.885 --> 03:49:00.471]  And to even try to pitch to these women that this is going to be a valid form of defense is sad.
[03:49:00.791 --> 03:49:02.793]  Because they're just saying themselves up.
[03:49:02.793 --> 03:49:03.113]  Exactly.
[03:49:03.113 --> 03:49:08.358]  Anybody knows the real form of defense is in King of the Hill where he says, that's my purse, don't rape me.
[03:49:08.358 --> 03:49:09.319]  You kick them in the huevos.
[03:49:11.072 --> 03:49:22.021]  Well, okay, look, I've taken some actual self-defense classes from Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructors, and none of this is what they show you to do at all.
[03:49:22.021 --> 03:49:27.065]  And I will say that the best form of defense out there is the Second Amendment.
[03:49:27.065 --> 03:49:28.526]  Ladies, get a gun.
[03:49:28.526 --> 03:49:31.308]  It is the greatest equalizer.
[03:49:31.308 --> 03:49:33.810]  Women can defend themselves that don't have any
[03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:41.879]  Fighting skills or karate skills against an attacker that's much bigger than just by simply having a gun on them.
[03:49:41.879 --> 03:49:53.011]  But these feminists that are so worried about rapists everywhere, rapists everywhere, they don't want to just inform women that, hey, get a gun because it's going to save your life at some point.
[03:49:53.291 --> 03:49:58.134]  Or you can take a ballpoint pen and jab it right in somebody's eye or their throat and kill somebody just like that.
[03:49:58.134 --> 03:50:00.515]  I mean, you've got to defend yourself.
[03:50:00.515 --> 03:50:02.716]  And there's other videos the left is training.
[03:50:02.716 --> 03:50:06.979]  I mean, it is the most bizarre weirdness you've ever seen.
[03:50:06.979 --> 03:50:14.243]  I'm sorry, but you can actually hear a woman that was on looking, literally cackling and laughing at these girls.
[03:50:14.243 --> 03:50:15.584]  What are they doing?
[03:50:15.584 --> 03:50:19.125]  These bizarre stomps and swats and all saying, no,
[03:50:20.569 --> 03:50:29.474]  You know, the only thing that that's probably going to accomplish is the attacker will probably die from laughter, and maybe that will actually be their tactic.
[03:50:29.474 --> 03:50:30.154]  Maybe that will work.
[03:50:30.154 --> 03:50:37.658]  Well, exactly, but it shows the LARPing that they're all out there bullying and physically attacking people while they do not even Kung Fu training.
[03:50:37.658 --> 03:50:41.340]  It's like, stomp the ground, do like this, go like that.
[03:50:41.340 --> 03:50:45.002]  This is just total insane asylum behavior.
[03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:48.921]  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre, Alex.
[03:50:48.921 --> 03:50:52.423]  There's definitely lunacy going on within the left.
[03:50:52.423 --> 03:51:09.611]  One thing I will mention is that after the confirmation happened, there was actually a woman speaking who was, you know, one of the speakers at the event who said, we have therapy, trauma therapy advisors on hand for anyone who has been traumatized by this
[03:51:10.951 --> 03:51:18.315]  Confirmation, if you need help, if you need emergency assistance, please come up to the front right now.
[03:51:18.315 --> 03:51:20.476]  We have therapists on hand.
[03:51:20.476 --> 03:51:26.179]  And yeah, there were a couple crying girls who went up there and walked off with their therapist.
[03:51:26.179 --> 03:51:29.361]  These girls were traumatized.
[03:51:29.361 --> 03:51:30.942]  It just shows the hysteria.
[03:51:30.942 --> 03:51:35.844]  Traumatized just because a judge is confirmed to the Supreme Court.
[03:51:35.844 --> 03:51:38.866]  Remember the different videos that the different groups got?
[03:51:39.901 --> 03:51:44.187]  Not just Veritas, but the groups that follow colleges.
[03:51:44.187 --> 03:51:44.928]  What's the name of that?
[03:51:44.928 --> 03:51:47.993]  What's the group that always gets the college stuff?
[03:51:47.993 --> 03:51:49.294]  Campus Reform.
[03:51:49.294 --> 03:51:54.602]  There's like 10 videos or something where they hand out pocket constitutions and people go,
[03:51:58.550 --> 03:52:04.499]  And then they go in, Campus Reform goes into the dean's office and goes, I saw a constitution.
[03:52:04.499 --> 03:52:06.862]  And they go, my little sweetie, come in here.
[03:52:06.862 --> 03:52:14.033]  We've got Play-Doh, we've got weaving, and they sit down at little one-foot tables like babies and they go, I've got a peanut butter sandwich.
[03:52:15.374 --> 03:52:16.875]  Who could I have that now?
[03:52:16.875 --> 03:52:29.760]  And it's like, what weird mental illness, but it's all psych warfare targeting and just making them these weird arrested development, like Antifa training videos we were just showing for radio listeners.
[03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:31.981]  They can't even do a single push-up.
[03:52:31.981 --> 03:52:33.462]  I mean, who are these people, Millie?
[03:52:34.895 --> 03:52:39.519]  Well, they're the hysterics that have Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:52:39.519 --> 03:52:48.346]  You know, I was even interviewing many of these protesters out there, which you can find those videos on Millennial Millie on YouTube or on Infowars.com.
[03:52:48.346 --> 03:52:58.954]  But in the questioning, I essentially asked them if they want, if the goal here is to push the FBI investigation past the midterms to try to change the results.
[03:52:58.954 --> 03:53:03.218]  You know, if you had new senators, you could get a different result with a vote.
[03:53:03.778 --> 03:53:05.119]  And they said yes.
[03:53:05.119 --> 03:53:08.402]  You know, some of them were like, yes, and yes, it's politically motivated.
[03:53:08.402 --> 03:53:15.149]  These, you know, of course there's political intention and these accusations, but that doesn't make it hypocritical.
[03:53:15.905 --> 03:53:18.586]  You know, they say, well, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not true.
[03:53:18.586 --> 03:53:33.669]  Well, this is why so many conservatives and Trump supporters are questioning the credibility because, well, what convenient timing of these accusations and how convenient for Senator Feinstein to whip this out of her pocket last minute.
[03:53:33.669 --> 03:53:35.370]  Oh, and now Senator Feinstein.
[03:53:36.343 --> 03:53:41.447]  Senator Feinstein's calling for, you know, to try and impeach Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:53:41.447 --> 03:53:52.995]  You know, many of these Democrats, Cory Booker said that impeaching Kavanaugh should not be overruled and these Democrats are pitching their sales point for the midterms is, hey, get out and vote Democrats.
[03:53:53.015 --> 03:53:53.615]  No, I agree.
[03:53:53.615 --> 03:53:54.616]  They're going to go even wilder.
[03:53:54.616 --> 03:53:56.997]  So let me ask you this question in a moment.
[03:53:56.997 --> 03:53:58.078]  How far do you think they'll go?
[03:53:58.078 --> 03:53:59.318]  Because you asked me, have you seen the headlines?
[03:53:59.318 --> 03:53:59.858]  Yeah.
[03:53:59.858 --> 03:54:02.720]  Politico, Fox News, Democrats say they're going to get even more ruthless.
[03:54:02.720 --> 03:54:04.161]  They're going to get even more violent.
[03:54:04.161 --> 03:54:07.562]  They're going to get even more wild and crazy and more entitled.
[03:54:07.562 --> 03:54:09.463]  But here is the real feminist icon.
[03:54:09.463 --> 03:54:11.164]  These women want real training.
[03:54:11.164 --> 03:54:16.607]  This is Bobby Hill from King of the Hill, Mike Judge, showing the feminists out there real training.
[03:54:16.607 --> 03:54:16.907]  Here it is.
[03:54:18.766 --> 03:54:20.087]  Give me your purse!
[03:54:20.087 --> 03:54:20.967]  Now!
[03:54:20.967 --> 03:54:22.868]  That's my purse.
[03:54:22.868 --> 03:54:24.088]  Don't be afraid to shout it.
[03:54:24.088 --> 03:54:25.369]  That's my purse!
[03:54:25.369 --> 03:54:26.029]  Try it again.
[03:54:26.029 --> 03:54:28.410]  That's my purse!
[03:54:28.410 --> 03:54:33.832]  I don't know you!
[03:54:33.832 --> 03:54:35.393]  Get away from me!
[03:54:35.393 --> 03:54:37.254]  Get away from me!
[03:54:37.254 --> 03:54:39.435]  Come on, eat some dirt!
[03:54:39.435 --> 03:54:41.716]  Let go of my purse!
[03:54:41.716 --> 03:54:41.896]  Huh?
[03:54:45.554 --> 03:54:47.116]  And there you go.
[03:54:47.116 --> 03:54:50.301]  So, we just gave them some real training.
[03:54:57.449 --> 03:55:02.530]  Well, a groan kick or a knee to the groin would actually be a lot more effective.
[03:55:02.530 --> 03:55:10.611]  Like, if these girls were actually out there doing knee kicks, practicing knee kicks to the groin, that might be a little bit scary.
[03:55:10.611 --> 03:55:12.472]  That might be scary for a lot of men.
[03:55:12.472 --> 03:55:13.292]  Let's roll some more, though.
[03:55:13.292 --> 03:55:14.872]  I like the little, like, six-inch stomp.
[03:55:14.872 --> 03:55:15.392]  Like, mmm!
[03:55:15.392 --> 03:55:16.632]  And they go, mmm!
[03:55:16.632 --> 03:55:17.312]  Mmm!
[03:55:17.312 --> 03:55:17.532]  Mmm!
[03:55:17.532 --> 03:55:17.832]  Mmm!
[03:55:17.832 --> 03:55:18.913]  Mmm!
[03:55:18.913 --> 03:55:20.493]  And it's like, wow!
[03:55:20.493 --> 03:55:21.553]  I've seen that.
[03:55:21.553 --> 03:55:23.333]  I've seen that a lot with my three-year-old.
[03:55:23.333 --> 03:55:26.474]  When he doesn't get his way, he'll stomp his foot and say, no!
[03:55:28.479 --> 03:55:35.908]  I've noticed mentally ill people are like really like tap dancing and exactly the stomping and the banging does something and I'm not trying to be mean here.
[03:55:35.908 --> 03:55:39.072]  I'm trying to understand like we're such an open free society.
[03:55:39.072 --> 03:55:45.940]  We've created all these weird crazy beta nuts and then they just want to run everything and they're like in their own delusional Fruit Loop land.
[03:55:46.621 --> 03:55:48.543]  And then because we're so nice, they want to attack us.
[03:55:48.543 --> 03:55:50.505]  Millie Weaver, great job.
[03:55:50.505 --> 03:55:54.730]  So many amazing videos with you and your team that are on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:55:54.730 --> 03:55:59.095]  And they're going to be back on The War Room and other shows here in the next few days.
[03:55:59.095 --> 03:56:03.500]  You're following Trump and all the incredible town hall events he's having.
[03:56:03.500 --> 03:56:04.561]  So thank you so much, Millie.
[03:56:05.646 --> 03:56:06.427]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:56:06.427 --> 03:56:08.628]  You know, just one more key point.
[03:56:08.628 --> 03:56:15.933]  The Democrats aren't actually trying to stop sexual assaults from happening, because if they were, they would tell women to arm themselves.
[03:56:15.933 --> 03:56:23.738]  There's nothing wrong with self-defense training, but certainly what we saw here in this park on Capitol Hill was not real self-defense training.
[03:56:23.738 --> 03:56:25.900]  It was a weird cult-like activity.
[03:56:26.741 --> 03:56:30.164]  But all in all, get out and vote, guys, because the war is not over.
[03:56:30.164 --> 03:56:31.946]  The Democrats are rallying up.
[03:56:31.946 --> 03:56:39.833]  They're motivated more than ever to get out to vote so that they can win the House and the Senate and essentially overturn Democracy.
[03:56:39.833 --> 03:56:40.414]  No, I agree.
[03:56:40.414 --> 03:56:42.195]  They're like a giant pool of
[03:56:42.896 --> 03:56:47.637]  Disease piranhas that have been given PCP and they want to throw America like a little baby into the deep end.
[03:56:47.637 --> 03:56:48.477]  Thank you so much, Melanie.
[03:56:48.477 --> 03:56:49.497]  We will talk to you soon.
[03:56:49.497 --> 03:56:50.938]  Again, amazing job.
[03:56:50.938 --> 03:56:53.438]  And like she said, a lot of videos she hasn't uploaded in HD yet.
[03:56:53.438 --> 03:56:54.518]  It's coming today.
[03:56:54.518 --> 03:56:58.919]  We'll have that on the War Room coming up next with Owen Schroer and of course, Roger Shull and others.
[03:56:58.919 --> 03:57:01.420]  So we'll have all the latest for you.
[03:57:01.420 --> 03:57:02.540]  I'm out of time.
[03:57:02.540 --> 03:57:03.540]  Thanks for all your support.
[03:57:03.540 --> 03:57:04.540]  Thanks to local stations.
[03:57:04.540 --> 03:57:05.381]  Thanks everybody.
[03:57:05.381 --> 03:57:07.281]  We have the biggest sales we've ever had.
[03:57:07.281 --> 03:57:07.921]  Free shipping.
[03:57:07.921 --> 03:57:09.061]  50% off.
[03:57:09.061 --> 03:57:10.282]  It's Christmas.
[03:57:10.282 --> 03:57:11.362]  It's Black Friday.
[03:57:11.362 --> 03:57:11.482]  It's
[03:57:12.754 --> 03:57:15.315]  Cyber Monday all into one.
[03:57:15.315 --> 03:57:17.875]  So that who knows we'll be here in December.
[03:57:17.875 --> 03:57:18.375]  Seriously.
[03:57:18.375 --> 03:57:19.776]  At least able to sell you products.
[03:57:19.776 --> 03:57:21.456]  So get them now.
[03:57:21.456 --> 03:57:23.597]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:57:24.377 --> 03:57:25.077]  We need your help.
[03:57:25.077 --> 03:57:26.717]  I'm very, very thankful.
[03:57:26.717 --> 03:57:27.818]  But take advantage now.
[03:57:27.818 --> 03:57:32.719]  And we're just going to sell out at the last run of X2, Super Bowl Vitality.
[03:57:32.719 --> 03:57:33.659]  Doesn't matter.
[03:57:33.659 --> 03:57:35.379]  50% off.
[03:57:35.379 --> 03:57:36.800]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:37.080]  All right.
[03:57:37.080 --> 03:57:38.480]  Great job to the crew.
[03:57:38.480 --> 03:57:41.321]  Coming up, the War Room and InfoWars.com for its last show.
[03:57:43.075 --> 03:57:43.095]  X2.
[03:58:13.655 --> 03:58:16.077]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[03:58:16.077 --> 03:58:17.798]  Ordered it six months ago.
[03:58:17.798 --> 03:58:20.539]  So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[03:58:20.539 --> 03:58:21.780]  I'm breaking the contract.
[03:58:21.780 --> 03:58:23.761]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[03:58:23.761 --> 03:58:26.142]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[03:58:26.142 --> 03:58:27.923]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[03:58:27.923 --> 03:58:31.425]  There's Viable Shield X2 and we've got a good supply of it.
[03:58:31.425 --> 03:58:33.406]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[03:58:33.406 --> 03:58:36.128]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:58:36.128 --> 03:58:37.969]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[03:58:37.969 --> 03:58:39.409]  I suggest you stock up on it.

[03:58:40.770 --> 03:58:42.351]  InfoWareStore.com right now.
[03:58:43.715 --> 03:59:02.570]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:03.690]  The revolution.

[03:59:22.100 --> 03:59:23.020]  That's my dad.
[03:59:23.020 --> 03:59:24.881]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
