[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[00:14.480 --> 00:24.720]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:24.720 --> 00:32.600]  29 days to the most important election in world history, a referendum, a nationalism
[00:32.600 --> 00:34.360]  versus globalism.
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.000]  By the way, in the first round of voting, out of more than 15 candidates, the Donald
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.560]  Trump of Brazil wants a second amendment, free market, you name it.
[00:44.560 --> 00:52.200]  They tried to kill, they stabbed in the liver and the kidneys, he just won the first round
[00:52.200 --> 00:58.440]  ultra massively by a huge margin, sending the globalist Facebook, YouTube, Twitter into
[00:58.440 --> 01:04.000]  a tailspin, Soros is crapping his wicked Nazi britches right now.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.320]  This is just continuing the trend worldwide against the globalist.
[01:08.320 --> 01:13.040]  Big multinational corporations above the law, allied with the Chai comms, coming in and
[01:13.040 --> 01:18.120]  trying to take our nations over and jacking up taxes and then looting everything.
[01:18.120 --> 01:24.240]  And then they're led by evil, wicked people like Pelosi and Yunker, the Chinese dictator.
[01:24.240 --> 01:27.720]  I mean, what a sick joke.
[01:27.720 --> 01:28.800]  What a sick joke.
[01:28.800 --> 01:33.920]  People are coming off the plantation like Kanye West just said.
[01:33.920 --> 01:40.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's linked on dredgerport.com, new Facebook portal camera follows you around
[01:40.880 --> 01:41.880]  the room.
[01:41.880 --> 01:45.920]  You know, I saw this last week before they rolled out examples of it and I should have
[01:45.920 --> 01:51.400]  led the show with it, but it shows how conditioned we are to big brother.
[01:51.400 --> 01:58.820]  That even I, you know, the trailblaze, pioneered exposing that they would put little appliances
[01:58.820 --> 02:04.000]  in your house that surveil you and control you, didn't even cover it.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.520]  But now with the video of them actually doing it, it's incredible.
[02:06.520 --> 02:17.240]  Let's say activated robot hooked in to Facebook and Zuckerberg saying our users trust us.
[02:17.240 --> 02:21.720]  They're a bunch of dumb efforts tied into the communist Chinese tied into all these
[02:21.720 --> 02:23.640]  different groups, tied into hackers.
[02:23.640 --> 02:28.120]  And now I'd tell people 20 years ago, cover up your webcam.
[02:28.120 --> 02:32.160]  Nobody listened to me till James Comey said he did it himself three years ago.
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.080]  And now they just go, Hey, let's come all the way out and just say, of course, we're
[02:37.080 --> 02:38.440]  going to be in your house.
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.280]  Of course, we're going to be watching you.
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.760]  And of course, the camera is going to be waiting and following you around the home and listening
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.760]  to you.
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.760]  And in the terms of service, they admit the information is given to third party groups.
[02:50.760 --> 02:56.160]  But then when you're at Zuckerberg's offices, what did they notice a few years ago that
[02:56.160 --> 03:02.080]  he covers the camera on his computer?
[03:02.080 --> 03:05.160]  And he thinks you're a dumb effort.
[03:05.160 --> 03:08.880]  And that you're going to take this new Google device called portal.
[03:08.880 --> 03:15.560]  That's what it is, a portal to a big evil corporation run by the globalist, the Democrats.
[03:15.560 --> 03:17.400]  And that you're going to put this in your house.
[03:17.400 --> 03:19.480]  It's one thing to have a quote webcam or whatever.
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.600]  This is an AI computer that follows you and listens to you and is grabbing everything you
[03:24.600 --> 03:29.880]  say and putting it into a digital algorithm of your personality type and then selling
[03:29.880 --> 03:31.320]  the data to whoever will take it.
[03:31.320 --> 03:32.320]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.200]  They're just saying, well, wait, we can't deny we're doing all this.
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.840]  Let's just go all the way and have somebody put a robot in their house.
[03:39.840 --> 03:40.840]  That's what it is.
[03:40.840 --> 03:44.440]  A robot that is owned and works for another company.
[03:44.440 --> 03:48.840]  The software says, I've got the terms of service right here that it's owned by Facebook.
[03:48.840 --> 03:50.360]  You put a robot.
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.520]  Oh, but look, it's got a little thing to cover the camera up when you want to because you
[03:56.520 --> 03:59.120]  understand it's watching you.
[03:59.120 --> 04:06.600]  Remember who pioneered was made fun of in documentaries 20 years ago when BBC and people come to
[04:06.600 --> 04:08.880]  my house, they'd say, why is your webcam covered?
[04:08.880 --> 04:13.440]  And I said, because hackers and governments and others can dial in and use it, but I also
[04:13.440 --> 04:16.640]  go into the computer and disable it except when I use it.
[04:16.640 --> 04:21.920]  And then they laughed at me, see, because being right is bad when you're ahead of your
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.040]  time because you're not supposed to be there and actually warn people.
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.480]  So that's coming up as well.
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.480]  So Google's being summoned to the Pentagon for their traitorous activities with Communist
[04:31.480 --> 04:32.480]  China.
[04:32.480 --> 04:34.760]  I told you last week that was coming.
[04:34.760 --> 04:41.040]  We're also going to get into Taylor Swift rolling over like a yellow-bellied possum to the establishment
[04:41.040 --> 04:46.160]  talking about her Tennessee values, even your Los Angeles, New York City, leftist globalist
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.560]  values, not even the values of folks in New York City, the values of the globalist and
[04:50.560 --> 04:51.560]  the rest of them.
[04:51.560 --> 04:53.560]  That's all coming up as well.
[04:53.560 --> 05:00.560]  We'll see you next time on NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[05:53.560 --> 06:23.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now only 29 days out from the referendum against
[06:23.380 --> 06:24.380]  globalism.
[06:24.380 --> 06:31.200]  And across the world, other populist, nationalist, patriot candidates are in the lead and winning.
[06:31.200 --> 06:36.040]  Like what just happened in Brazil, it's all coming up today.
[06:36.040 --> 06:37.560]  Thank you again for joining us.
[06:37.560 --> 06:39.560]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:39.560 --> 06:43.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.080]  The Democrats have pledged to get extremely violent and aggressive top dem.
[06:50.080 --> 06:57.440]  Trump GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh Politico says after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems
[06:57.440 --> 07:01.320]  wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[07:01.320 --> 07:04.160]  The ruthlessness is what blew up in your face, idiots.
[07:04.160 --> 07:05.400]  The bullying.
[07:05.400 --> 07:12.160]  Continuing, we'll get into incredible news where the city of Columbus, Ohio is not going
[07:12.160 --> 07:16.080]  to celebrate Columbus Day because he's evil.
[07:16.080 --> 07:19.440]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and don't worry, the city of Austin is set to change
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.800]  the name of Austin because they say Stephen F. Austin was a racist.
[07:24.800 --> 07:27.000]  And don't worry, there's more news on that front.
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.080]  One of the former top astronauts has come out and apologized for saying that Winston
[07:34.080 --> 07:37.640]  Churchill was a good guy and quoting Winston Churchill.
[07:37.640 --> 07:38.640]  This is incredible.
[07:38.640 --> 07:45.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you go to any time or place in the world, it'd be like saying
[07:45.360 --> 07:54.360]  that you couldn't ever have a statue to somebody who lived in Africa 200 years ago because
[07:54.360 --> 07:56.840]  slavery was legal in Africa 200 years ago.
[07:56.840 --> 08:01.160]  Hell, it's still legal in many African countries today, but we don't run around saying how
[08:01.160 --> 08:06.360]  evil black people are because slavery still goes on in three African countries at least.
[08:06.360 --> 08:12.080]  Or that the Africans were selling slaves and so were the Romans and so were the Germans
[08:12.080 --> 08:17.120]  and so were the Visigoths and so were the Gauls and so were the Chinese and so were
[08:17.120 --> 08:18.960]  the Japanese.
[08:18.960 --> 08:20.960]  Every culture had slavery.
[08:20.960 --> 08:24.040]  You ever read a history book?
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.840]  But no one cares about liberated Libya by Al Qaeda and ISIS that Hillary liberated and
[08:29.840 --> 08:35.120]  put in charge and took out a truly progressive Islamic leader who actually had women going
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.640]  to college and no burkas and blacks lived in peace with Arabs.
[08:38.640 --> 08:42.320]  I just put USA Today on screen for TV viewers.
[08:42.320 --> 08:47.640]  Let's put that back up where Africans are being sold at Libyan slave markets.
[08:47.640 --> 08:51.520]  Thanks, Hillary Clinton.
[08:51.520 --> 08:55.040]  So occasionally mainstream media actually gets it right and I remember, was it Colbert
[08:55.040 --> 09:01.280]  about a year ago, made a joke, he goes, what's a slave block?
[09:01.280 --> 09:07.880]  They made a joke on the comedy show and I said, Hillary's responsible for Libya and
[09:07.880 --> 09:13.320]  now they're selling women on slave blocks and they go, what's a slave block?
[09:13.320 --> 09:14.320]  It's a block.
[09:14.320 --> 09:15.320]  It's what it's called.
[09:15.320 --> 09:18.560]  It's a big square block with steps.
[09:18.560 --> 09:23.760]  It's a pedestal for the goods and in every major culture you have slave blocks and you
[09:23.760 --> 09:26.920]  march people up there and a lot of times you take their clothes off.
[09:26.920 --> 09:29.560]  You're like, well, wait, Islam, you got to cover a woman.
[09:29.560 --> 09:31.480]  Not when you're buying a slave.
[09:31.480 --> 09:37.840]  They march those women up there butt naked and they sell them to Islamic brothels.
[09:37.840 --> 09:43.280]  Or they have sex with up to 100 men a day.
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.800]  When they get pregnant, they beat them with sticks until they have miscarriages so they
[09:47.800 --> 09:50.200]  can get back to business.
[09:50.200 --> 09:56.120]  Now, that's the radical globalist Islam and Hillary Clinton has been funding and has
[09:56.120 --> 09:57.120]  been pushing.
[09:57.120 --> 09:59.600]  Every time they try to get good people into a country to actually stabilize it, they
[09:59.600 --> 10:00.600]  get removed.
[10:00.600 --> 10:04.760]  My point is Taylor Swift talks about she's not going to vote for the Republicans in
[10:04.760 --> 10:09.040]  Tennessee for the first time becoming political because she's under such pressure because
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.840]  it didn't Tennessee values what happened with Kavanaugh.
[10:15.840 --> 10:22.440]  And Tennessee values and all the rest is, hey, lady, it didn't Tennessee values.
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.480]  The pedophilia in Hollywood, the mass abuse of women, the sexualization of children and
[10:27.480 --> 10:34.360]  lying about Kavanaugh and not having to process and not having innocent until proven guilty
[10:34.360 --> 10:39.400]  and not having the statute of limitations, but you guys want to get rid of.
[10:39.400 --> 10:43.080]  And then they went and looked at all the cases and they were all bunk.
[10:43.080 --> 10:44.480]  They were all boulder dash.
[10:44.480 --> 10:46.680]  They were all bologna.
[10:46.680 --> 10:48.400]  They were all Bravo Sierra.
[10:48.400 --> 10:49.400]  None of it added up.
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.800]  None of the witnesses said it was true.
[10:50.800 --> 11:00.680]  It was all lies, perjury, but she's got them Tennessee values of Taylor Swift.
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.520]  She enlisting to her common sense or her mother or her father now knows she's the biggest
[11:05.520 --> 11:11.200]  star in the world and she didn't want to go the way a Kanye Kanye was number one and
[11:11.200 --> 11:13.560]  now he's only number two or number three because he got political.
[11:13.560 --> 11:14.840]  So now they're persecuting him.
[11:14.840 --> 11:16.720]  Well, that makes him a hero for standing up for what's right.
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.680]  I got a Kanye clip here where a lot of this got censored off Saturday Night Live, but
[11:22.680 --> 11:27.360]  folks taped it where he said the Democrats had a plan to pay black women not have their
[11:27.360 --> 11:29.960]  husbands in the house to get welfare, destroy the black family.
[11:29.960 --> 11:32.320]  They go, oh, that's a crazy conspiracy theory.
[11:32.320 --> 11:33.560]  You're mentally ill.
[11:33.560 --> 11:37.200]  They said last Saturday night, the week after he was on, make fun of him.
[11:37.200 --> 11:41.040]  We didn't bully you, but we wish we would have bullied you.
[11:41.040 --> 11:47.960]  LBJ wrote a whole string of letters you can pull up and read online at his own library
[11:47.960 --> 11:50.760]  where he said these N words are getting happening.
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.680]  They own their own businesses, their own communities and segregations only made him stronger.
[11:55.680 --> 11:58.880]  We're going to desegregate and I'm not saying that that was a bad thing, but the reason
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.200]  he did it was bad and we're going to have these N words, voting Democrats for a hundred
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.840]  years and we are going to basically make you put the, put the women in charge, get the
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.720]  men out of the home and we'll have full control of these people.
[12:11.720 --> 12:16.440]  That's what they did.
[12:16.440 --> 12:23.640]  Black illegitimacy in the forties was lower than white illegitimacy.
[12:23.640 --> 12:25.120]  Now it's over 80%.
[12:25.120 --> 12:28.320]  You say, oh, what's, you're not being mean to single mothers.
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.440]  No, a lot of them are great and do a great job.
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.320]  The point is it's all geared to make men a bunch of lazy slobs and then women be wedded
[12:36.320 --> 12:37.840]  to the state.
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.920]  And if you're a single mother, your child, be it male or female, the numbers vary year
[12:41.920 --> 12:47.280]  to year and the crime statistics are what five times more likely to end up going to prison.
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.600]  Something like nine times more likely to end up taking drugs and being drug addicts.
[12:52.600 --> 12:57.840]  Many, many times more likely to end up dropping out of school.
[12:57.840 --> 13:04.600]  This was done by design and then Hollywood and the gangster culture came in and weaponized
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.720]  the black community and the black community was set up for the place where you allowed
[13:08.720 --> 13:11.840]  prostitution and you allowed drug dealing.
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.320]  That was done as a racist thing in Democrat establishment cities.
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.060]  The right wing Christian Republican cities were the ones that went the other extreme
[13:21.060 --> 13:24.720]  and banned alcohol and wouldn't allow any red light districts, but the old Democrat
[13:24.720 --> 13:31.080]  areas of Chicago, New York, places like that, they're on record folks saying, just like
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.400]  in the Godfather, which is based on true stories, but they put it into a composite.
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.460]  Mario Puzo made that clear in articles he wrote, but remember, they're in the big commission
[13:41.460 --> 13:46.440]  meeting and Don Corleone doesn't want drug dealing going on period because we have the
[13:46.440 --> 13:51.560]  judges, they're our friends for alcohol and prostitution, things that are denied to them
[13:51.560 --> 13:52.560]  by the church.
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.720]  We all do, but this drug business and telling you will be the end of it.
[13:57.720 --> 14:01.280]  Our friends in law enforcement in the courts are not going to go along with this.
[14:01.280 --> 14:03.880]  I'm telling you, it'll be the end of us.
[14:03.880 --> 14:06.320]  I agree with Don Corleone.
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.160]  We control it, keep it in the colored areas that animals let them lose their souls.
[14:12.160 --> 14:13.160]  I didn't say that.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.160]  That's the Godfather.
[14:14.160 --> 14:15.160]  There was Hollywood can say that.
[14:15.160 --> 14:16.160]  I can't.
[14:16.160 --> 14:17.160]  I'm quoting that.
[14:17.160 --> 14:18.160]  I don't believe they're animals.
[14:18.160 --> 14:19.160]  I don't believe they should lose their souls.
[14:19.160 --> 14:24.200]  They're all made in God's image like Martin Luther King said and many others, Genesis,
[14:24.200 --> 14:27.600]  but that's them telling you.
[14:27.600 --> 14:33.720]  That's them telling you it's a plan and here's Kanye talking about it and getting persecuted
[14:33.720 --> 14:34.720]  for it.
[14:34.720 --> 14:35.720]  Here it is.
[14:35.720 --> 14:54.160]  And it goes on from there and that notice didn't air.
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.800]  It had to be shot behind the scenes because they won't let Kanye go on live now because
[14:58.800 --> 14:59.800]  things are so controlled.
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.320]  And when Kanye came out and endorsed Donald Trump and Alex Jones that same week, he said
[15:04.320 --> 15:09.640]  that their matrix breakers, Alex Jones and Donald Trump are matrix breakers.
[15:09.640 --> 15:11.920]  It was in news articles and then they removed it.
[15:11.920 --> 15:12.920]  They didn't deny.
[15:12.920 --> 15:13.920]  He said it.
[15:13.920 --> 15:17.200]  They removed the video before anybody could get it and they removed it because they don't
[15:17.200 --> 15:18.720]  want that solidarity.
[15:18.720 --> 15:20.240]  I'm meant to be destroyed.
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.240]  Trump's meant to be destroyed.
[15:21.240 --> 15:22.440]  Kanye's meant to be destroyed.
[15:22.440 --> 15:29.920]  And little Taylor Swift runs out and says, Tennessee values, lady, you make me sick.
[15:29.920 --> 15:41.120]  The Democratic Party is the party of slavery and the KKK and what doesn't kill you makes
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.800]  you stronger and segregation made blacks stronger.
[15:44.800 --> 15:45.800]  I'm not defending it.
[15:45.800 --> 15:46.800]  It was one evil.
[15:46.800 --> 15:52.040]  They replaced it with something even worse left as brainwashing in the end of their families.
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.840]  That's what they and they're doing to everybody now.
[15:53.840 --> 15:58.240]  We'll be back with the really big news robots be deployed to US citizens homes to watch
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.240]  you.

[16:03.280 --> 16:08.040]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally

[17:28.480 --> 17:33.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:33.840 --> 17:34.840]  the world.
[17:34.840 --> 17:37.880]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.800]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:43.800 --> 17:47.640]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.640 --> 17:48.640]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.640 --> 17:50.160]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.160 --> 17:53.080]  The deep state began with World War I.
[17:53.080 --> 18:00.480]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[18:00.480 --> 18:03.920]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[18:03.920 --> 18:05.720]  Introducing pollen block.
[18:05.720 --> 18:11.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.760]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.520]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.520 --> 18:31.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.560 --> 18:36.920]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.920 --> 18:37.920]  symptoms.
[18:37.920 --> 18:40.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.800]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.320]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.720]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.720 --> 19:04.640]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.880]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dogs for a walk.
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.040]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.560]  lights every day.
[19:14.560 --> 19:20.200]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:20.200 --> 19:24.400]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.560]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.560]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[19:33.560 --> 19:40.760]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.760 --> 19:44.800]  So go to infowarsstore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[19:44.800 --> 19:48.440]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[19:48.440 --> 19:53.320]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[19:53.320 --> 20:11.200]  Unleash the SuperMail in you with SuperMailVitality from infowarsstore.com.
[20:33.000 --> 21:02.960]  A little bit of old-school Metallica from the Kill'em All album, Seek In.
[21:02.960 --> 21:07.840]  Seek In, Destroy.
[21:07.840 --> 21:14.040]  Or politely correct, search and clear.
[21:14.040 --> 21:16.520]  Seek In, Destroy.
[21:16.520 --> 21:17.520]  Seek In, Destroy.
[21:17.520 --> 21:18.520]  Globalist operations.
[21:18.520 --> 21:19.520]  Seek In, Destroy.
[21:19.520 --> 21:20.520]  All over the world.
[21:20.520 --> 21:37.640]  Good stuff right there, and we're doing it through intellectual prowess, and we're doing
[21:37.640 --> 21:41.880]  it through determination and dogged true grit.
[21:41.880 --> 21:44.600]  The animating contest of Liberty is now.
[21:44.600 --> 21:48.800]  Let me do this.
[21:48.800 --> 21:52.160]  Let me be a good boy in this segment, because it's so important I tell you what's coming
[21:52.160 --> 21:55.680]  up and not just digress, because I say, here's what's coming up, and then I hit one stack,
[21:55.680 --> 21:58.320]  and then I go off into that instead of saying what's coming up.
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.680]  So I'm going to discipline myself right now, and I'm doing it.
[22:02.680 --> 22:03.680]  Top Dem.
[22:03.680 --> 22:07.960]  Trump GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh, Politico.
[22:07.960 --> 22:11.800]  After failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[22:11.800 --> 22:16.800]  Taylor Swift, Bash's Blackburn in favor of Tennessee Dems, breaking political silence.
[22:16.800 --> 22:18.760]  Kanye West quit social media.
[22:18.760 --> 22:21.760]  I've been criticized for pro-Trump remarks.
[22:21.760 --> 22:27.440]  Brazil's Donald Trump wins overwhelming support in the first round of presidential vote, after
[22:27.440 --> 22:31.520]  they almost killed him, a tough ombre.
[22:31.520 --> 22:35.680]  Asylum seeker brutally rapes child who was teaching him German.
[22:35.680 --> 22:38.480]  We're going to cover this first in a moment.
[22:38.480 --> 22:44.480]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room and watches you for your own good.
[22:44.480 --> 22:47.000]  It's an imperial probe droid.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.120]  Good chance the empire knows we're here.
[22:49.120 --> 22:50.600]  I have to start the evacuation.
[22:50.600 --> 22:54.920]  Instead, oh, come on in, my little cuppy caker.
[22:54.920 --> 22:57.600]  Reads that in a moment.
[22:57.600 --> 23:01.600]  Google's in trouble, caught working with the Chai comms on their AI weapons system.
[23:01.600 --> 23:06.520]  They've been summoned to the Pentagon to go tell them that we are not going to work with
[23:06.520 --> 23:11.280]  America, because we've all been trained to hate America, but we're still your friend,
[23:11.280 --> 23:12.840]  and pat them on the head.
[23:12.840 --> 23:14.320]  So we'll see how that goes.
[23:14.320 --> 23:18.600]  Oh, it's getting better by the minute, and these people are crazy.
[23:18.600 --> 23:20.440]  So we're going to break all that down.
[23:20.440 --> 23:23.800]  Also, I didn't get to this yesterday, but I'm going to cover it today.
[23:23.800 --> 23:27.600]  Microwave weapons are prime suspect in the ills of US Embassy, and it's the same microwave
[23:27.600 --> 23:31.000]  relay frequency that G5's in.
[23:31.000 --> 23:41.560]  And there's even mainline scientists coming out and saying that the new communication systems
[23:41.560 --> 23:46.840]  that they're coming out with are really mind control devices.
[23:46.840 --> 23:50.800]  You know, you can't make this stuff up.
[23:50.800 --> 23:58.760]  So we're going to be getting to more of all that coming up.
[23:58.760 --> 24:01.320]  We're showing footage people getting hit with microwaves, so we're going to be breaking
[24:01.320 --> 24:03.320]  more of this down coming up.
[24:03.320 --> 24:08.480]  And then we're obviously going to get into the Twitter trolls, the Google trolls, the
[24:08.480 --> 24:09.480]  Facebook trolls.
[24:09.480 --> 24:14.000]  You know, threatening to ban people and banning people if they say Christopher Columbus was
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.120]  a good guy, or George Washington was a good guy, or you quote Winston Churchill, you're
[24:20.120 --> 24:21.620]  bad.
[24:21.620 --> 24:25.040]  And oh, we're not going to celebrate Columbus Day in Columbus, Ohio, and Austin's going
[24:25.040 --> 24:27.680]  to rename to some new name.
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.360]  It's Maya Angelou or something.
[24:31.360 --> 24:34.160]  Because if they can do that, they can get rid of the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.120]  of Independence because some of those people were slave owners.
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.880]  That's what it is.
[24:39.880 --> 24:43.400]  They won't talk about sex slaves in Saudi Arabia, or black slaves in Africa right now,
[24:43.400 --> 24:46.800]  or how Christians in the West ended slavery in most areas of the world.
[24:46.800 --> 24:48.600]  No, because we're the ones that ended it.
[24:48.600 --> 24:50.800]  We have the guilt.
[24:50.800 --> 24:59.160]  Then continuing, crazed leftist tweet about ruining Cabinon's life gives us a window into
[24:59.160 --> 25:01.880]  their main game plan.
[25:01.880 --> 25:09.240]  And then that ties into 29 days out how they're pledging to still try to unseat Cabinon with
[25:09.240 --> 25:13.040]  many Democrats are now saying, no, we're not going to try to unseat him now because they
[25:13.040 --> 25:23.360]  don't want any criminal investigations into the fantastical contradictions of Dr. Christine
[25:23.360 --> 25:35.120]  Glossy Ford, who, by the way, come back full circle, writes papers on 5G-type wavelengths
[25:35.120 --> 25:40.560]  being used to soothe the mind of the average person.
[25:40.560 --> 25:43.080]  Isn't that crazy?
[25:43.080 --> 25:44.080]  It's just everywhere now.
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.080]  Mainstream news.
[25:45.080 --> 25:46.600]  Oh, 5G can control your brain.
[25:46.600 --> 25:47.600]  Oh, we're deploying it.
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.440]  Oh, little robots are going to be in your house and track and trace everything you do.
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.800]  It's coming up the start of the next segment because it's a new level of the rollout of
[25:56.800 --> 26:00.880]  the little home assistants that are watching you, listening to you, they're watching what
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.080]  you click, what you do, what you say, what you write, what you speak, but now they're
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.840]  going to be watching you and tracking you openly.
[26:09.840 --> 26:11.680]  So that's all coming up next segment.
[26:11.680 --> 26:15.800]  Now, I've got something that is a huge announcement that is extremely exciting and I hope everyone
[26:15.800 --> 26:21.360]  listens up very, very clearly to this because we've had a lot of big sales at m4store.com,
[26:21.360 --> 26:25.840]  but this is hands down the biggest we've ever had.
[26:25.840 --> 26:32.680]  And this was going to be the Christmas specials, but because as you know, they've taken PayPal
[26:32.680 --> 26:33.680]  from us.
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.920]  They're trying to get our other payment processors.
[26:35.920 --> 26:39.440]  We're preparing all sorts of legal systems to that, obviously.
[26:39.440 --> 26:40.440]  This is the next.
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.720]  They want the NRA payment processors.
[26:42.720 --> 26:45.000]  They're saying they're going to kill members of Congress.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.600]  The Democrats said they're going to get more ruthless.
[26:46.600 --> 26:53.640]  This is real racketeering, combines, cartels, working in unison to punish people politically
[26:53.640 --> 26:57.400]  for wanting an American resurgence and free market and family values.
[26:57.400 --> 26:59.960]  This is true bullying.
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.760]  To counter all that, I'm just going to go ahead and sell even all of our best selling
[27:04.760 --> 27:10.360]  items and even things that are about to sell out where I've already sold out.
[27:10.360 --> 27:16.040]  We are doing the Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday all rolled into one for at least
[27:16.040 --> 27:24.360]  a week on every supplement at infowarslife.com and inforestore.com and many of the other items.
[27:24.360 --> 27:29.680]  Now, things like water filtration and air filtration, there's not even 50% in our profit
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.160]  and the maker's profit.
[27:31.160 --> 27:36.560]  I mean, like a Lexapure Breeze, when we sell at 200 bucks, you know, we're making 50 bucks,
[27:36.560 --> 27:37.560]  they're making 50 bucks.
[27:37.560 --> 27:43.320]  When we sell at 150, we're making like $25, they're making $25 and leading competitors
[27:43.320 --> 27:44.320]  are $600, $700.
[27:44.320 --> 27:48.960]  And these are just as good, they just don't have all the markup in them.
[27:48.960 --> 27:50.120]  So that's my philosophy.
[27:50.120 --> 27:53.920]  So everything is massively discounted.
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.040]  There are some things that are 50% off because there's not even 50% markup in them.
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.040]  You understand?
[27:59.040 --> 28:01.760]  There's not even, it's not there.
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.720]  So happy's, brain force, X2 even though it's the last one of X2 and even though we almost
[28:06.720 --> 28:07.720]  sold out all of it.
[28:07.720 --> 28:08.720]  You know what?
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.120]  It's 50% off because we're going to build our war chest.
[28:13.120 --> 28:17.320]  They want to shut down this year ahead of trying to destroy Trump.
[28:17.320 --> 28:23.000]  And so we need to fill our coffers that are running on the low end, you know, we're not
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.800]  on empty, we're not on reserve, but we can get there quick.
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.600]  So I need to do some massive rear fueling.
[28:27.600 --> 28:32.040]  It's a great way for you to support the M4, stamp these bullies, get great products and
[28:32.040 --> 28:33.680]  go ahead and just buy your Christmas gifts.
[28:33.680 --> 28:40.200]  Go ahead and buy what you want of happy's or brain force, ultimate bone broth or knockout
[28:40.200 --> 28:45.280]  or the real red pill plus, it's really amazing or X2 or silver bullet fit percent off.
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.520]  Go ahead and stock up yourself and go ahead and do your Christmas shopping because quite
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.680]  frankly, you might be doing it by mail order if you wait, infowarstore.com, infowarslot.com
[28:54.680 --> 28:57.160]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[28:57.160 --> 28:58.160]  They're trying to stop you.
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.160]  Don't let them.
[28:59.160 --> 29:01.840]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat.
[29:01.840 --> 29:02.840]  Not true.
[29:02.840 --> 29:04.400]  Actually you are what you can't absorb.
[29:04.400 --> 29:07.880]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are
[29:07.880 --> 29:08.880]  they?
[29:08.880 --> 29:13.160]  Protevite, a proprietary liquid system that allows premium quality nutrients to positively
[29:13.160 --> 29:15.920]  affect the blood in an astonishing five minutes.
[29:15.920 --> 29:19.960]  Watch our amazing two minute live blood cell video at truehealthfacts.com.

[29:26.880 --> 29:28.880]  Protevite is nutrition that gets in.
[29:28.880 --> 29:30.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[29:30.520 --> 29:34.440]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[29:34.440 --> 29:36.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.960]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.240]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[33:22.080 --> 33:47.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:47.880 --> 34:16.080]  People
[34:16.080 --> 34:18.080]  Everyone knows that.
[34:18.080 --> 34:20.080]  Has everyone gone crazy here?
[34:20.080 --> 34:22.080]  What's the matter with all of you?
[34:22.080 --> 34:25.080]  It was you. I was after all along, Lucy.
[34:25.080 --> 34:26.080]  What?
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.080]  I knew that if I could get Sam and Michael into the family,
[34:32.080 --> 34:34.080]  there's no way you could say no.
[34:34.080 --> 34:35.080]  Where's Michael?
[34:35.080 --> 34:38.080]  It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.
[34:38.080 --> 34:44.080]  Just like one big happy family.
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.080]  Your boys and my boys.
[34:51.080 --> 34:54.080]  Great. The blood's sucking pretty much.
[34:54.080 --> 34:57.080]  I still want you, Lucy.
[34:57.080 --> 35:01.080]  I haven't changed my mind about that.
[35:01.080 --> 35:04.080]  I didn't invite you this time, Max.
[35:04.080 --> 35:06.080]  So, there's the metaphysical archetype,
[35:06.080 --> 35:07.080]  and that's what this is.
[35:07.080 --> 35:09.080]  And if you're dumb enough,
[35:09.080 --> 35:11.080]  you've already invited the smart phones in there,
[35:11.080 --> 35:13.080]  tracking and tracing everything you do, selling the data.
[35:13.080 --> 35:15.080]  They're already censoring.
[35:15.080 --> 35:19.080]  iPhones won't even let you go to our RSS feed on my website.
[35:19.080 --> 35:20.080]  That's a link.
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.080]  They've hijacked it at the URL level.
[35:23.080 --> 35:26.080]  They won't let you send emojis of Taiwan and their flag
[35:26.080 --> 35:29.080]  or the name Taiwan in China.
[35:29.080 --> 35:32.080]  And Google and Apple are all over there.
[35:32.080 --> 35:34.080]  Yay, yay, we love it.
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.080]  And now, they want you to fully embrace it.
[35:38.080 --> 35:40.080]  Remember how I, 20 years ago,
[35:40.080 --> 35:42.080]  was in several documentaries,
[35:42.080 --> 35:44.080]  like Secret Riddlers of the World and others,
[35:44.080 --> 35:46.080]  and I remember being made fun of
[35:46.080 --> 35:50.080]  when I was on several national programs,
[35:50.080 --> 35:55.080]  and I pointed out that I had to tape over the webcam in my house.
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.080]  And then later, people noticed Zuckerberg,
[35:58.080 --> 36:00.080]  five years ago, had his webcam covered.
[36:00.080 --> 36:01.080]  And again, two years ago,
[36:01.080 --> 36:03.080]  and Shoddy called me and people asked him why.
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.080]  He said, well, folks can hack in and watch and listen.
[36:06.080 --> 36:07.080]  It's the big tech companies,
[36:07.080 --> 36:09.080]  and they've already gotten away with all this,
[36:09.080 --> 36:15.080]  so why shouldn't they try to get away with more?
[36:15.080 --> 36:17.080]  Because remember what Zuckerberg said
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.080]  when he was getting investors to have Facebook go public,
[36:21.080 --> 36:23.080]  and he was at the Bilderberg group
[36:23.080 --> 36:24.080]  and parts of it over the years leaked,
[36:24.080 --> 36:25.080]  and he said in multiple emails,
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.080]  he said, I can't believe how effing dumb people are.
[36:29.080 --> 36:33.080]  They effing trust us the dumb efforts.
[36:33.080 --> 36:35.080]  Very big little potty mouth on him.
[36:35.080 --> 36:37.080]  But look, he's a predator.
[36:37.080 --> 36:39.080]  Has a little psychotic smile.
[36:39.080 --> 36:42.080]  And so he's selling your data.
[36:42.080 --> 36:43.080]  They're trading your data.
[36:43.080 --> 36:44.080]  They're listening.
[36:44.080 --> 36:46.080]  They're watching all the Facebook apps, the Google apps.
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.080]  It came out 10 years ago that the Google cars drive around
[36:50.080 --> 36:53.080]  with those antennas and grab all your personal data
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.080]  and your pass codes,
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.080]  and then they transfer the data offshore,
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.080]  then they have third parties break into all your stuff
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.080]  and sell it,
[37:00.080 --> 37:02.080]  and now they officially help China.
[37:02.080 --> 37:05.080]  Google and Apple with surveillance grids
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.080]  and censorship grids and censorship apps
[37:08.080 --> 37:10.080]  that the public has to have
[37:10.080 --> 37:12.080]  and able to even have a smartphone.
[37:12.080 --> 37:16.080]  They built it, what, in 2006,
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.080]  they got caught over there in China.
[37:20.080 --> 37:21.080]  Google did.
[37:21.080 --> 37:23.080]  And so they backed off for a while.
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.080]  So everything you hear about drag and fly,
[37:25.080 --> 37:28.080]  all this stuff is old news.
[37:28.080 --> 37:30.080]  So why was I banned?
[37:30.080 --> 37:31.080]  The biggest thing ahead of the midterms was
[37:31.080 --> 37:33.080]  I was making this a central issue,
[37:33.080 --> 37:35.080]  and then I knew I was getting information from the president.
[37:35.080 --> 37:37.080]  But now you see it's the big number one issue,
[37:37.080 --> 37:39.080]  and I have an article that I forgot to get out of the printer.
[37:39.080 --> 37:41.080]  You guys bring that to me, please.
[37:41.080 --> 37:42.080]  Thank you so much.
[37:42.080 --> 37:44.080]  The White House Chief Economic Advisor
[37:44.080 --> 37:48.080]  warns U.S. companies not to invest in China.
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.080]  That's the Associated Press as well.
[37:52.080 --> 37:54.080]  And if it didn't get printed,
[37:54.080 --> 37:55.080]  it's no big deal.
[37:55.080 --> 37:57.080]  About 10 minutes ago during the break,
[37:57.080 --> 37:58.080]  I was in there and I said,
[37:58.080 --> 38:02.080]  this printed wrong, can I please have it?
[38:02.080 --> 38:04.080]  If not, Daniels can come back in and give it to me again.
[38:04.080 --> 38:05.080]  I know he tried to give it to me,
[38:05.080 --> 38:07.080]  and I will just read the one that's cut off.
[38:07.080 --> 38:09.080]  It's fine.
[38:09.080 --> 38:11.080]  Or we can search and you're not going to do it.
[38:11.080 --> 38:12.080]  I will do it myself.
[38:12.080 --> 38:14.080]  I have to, no big deal.
[38:14.080 --> 38:15.080]  But I want to show people this
[38:15.080 --> 38:22.080]  because I need that little critical piece of intel.
[38:22.080 --> 38:25.080]  I just want that one little piece that I needed.
[38:25.080 --> 38:26.080]  Just that one thing.
[38:26.080 --> 38:28.080]  I just didn't do it so badly.
[38:28.080 --> 38:29.080]  Oh, my God, I'm out of now.
[38:29.080 --> 38:31.080]  Oh, I got the article.
[38:31.080 --> 38:32.080]  Oh, good.
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.080]  I become OCD.
[38:33.080 --> 38:34.080]  It is a serious problem now.
[38:34.080 --> 38:37.080]  Now, stay away from China.
[38:37.080 --> 38:42.080]  White House top economic economist tells U.S. businesses.
[38:42.080 --> 38:46.080]  It's Yahoo Finance, AP, Bloomberg are all reporting it.
[38:46.080 --> 38:47.080]  Stay away from China.
[38:47.080 --> 38:50.080]  White House top economist tells U.S. businesses.
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.080]  We're going to get to more of that in the next segment.
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.080]  But right now, let me give you the big drum roll
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.080]  and the big news because you know how I do it.
[38:57.080 --> 39:00.080]  I tend to give you the background news first
[39:00.080 --> 39:02.080]  just to remind you of the history and the rest of it.
[39:02.080 --> 39:04.080]  I know most of you know more than I do.
[39:04.080 --> 39:05.080]  It's for the new viewers.
[39:05.080 --> 39:08.080]  They're the really important people.
[39:08.080 --> 39:09.080]  It's like the lost sheep scenario.
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.080]  Why would you spend so much time
[39:10.080 --> 39:12.080]  with this little sheep when you've got thousands?
[39:12.080 --> 39:13.080]  Well, because that's why I have thousands
[39:13.080 --> 39:15.080]  is I try to take care of the sheep.
[39:15.080 --> 39:17.080]  And it's the prodigal son.
[39:17.080 --> 39:19.080]  The bad spoiled son goes away,
[39:19.080 --> 39:21.080]  loses his inheritance, comes back five years later,
[39:21.080 --> 39:24.080]  totally broke and brain dead.
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.080]  And they, the father kills the top cow,
[39:27.080 --> 39:29.080]  the juiciest cow and has a big party
[39:29.080 --> 39:31.080]  and orders you celebration.
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.080]  And the good son says,
[39:32.080 --> 39:33.080]  Dad, you never did this for me.
[39:33.080 --> 39:37.080]  He goes, imagine how big the party would be for you
[39:37.080 --> 39:39.080]  when you're way better than your younger son.
[39:39.080 --> 39:42.080]  If you came back, buddy, I love you a lot more than him.
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.080]  But we don't need to do all that for you.
[39:44.080 --> 39:48.080]  We're celebrating this fact that your brother's back.
[39:48.080 --> 39:50.080]  You don't need to have the big celebration
[39:50.080 --> 39:52.080]  to make you understand you're part of the family.
[39:52.080 --> 39:54.080]  You're smarter than he is.
[39:54.080 --> 39:55.080]  You've got the birthright.
[39:55.080 --> 39:57.080]  You get everything when I die.
[39:57.080 --> 40:00.080]  I didn't need to do that.
[40:00.080 --> 40:02.080]  That's why you're the number one son.
[40:02.080 --> 40:04.080]  And he's like, oh, I get it.
[40:04.080 --> 40:05.080]  You see how that works?
[40:05.080 --> 40:07.080]  We're trying to wake up the victims
[40:07.080 --> 40:09.080]  of this step before it's too late.
[40:09.080 --> 40:11.080]  That's who we're targeting.
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.080]  The targets, the ones the globalists are feeding on.
[40:14.080 --> 40:16.080]  Excuse me, let me get back to this.
[40:16.080 --> 40:25.080]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes.
[40:25.080 --> 40:27.080]  It's what you've already done, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:27.080 --> 40:29.080]  But now they're just throwing at your face and they say,
[40:29.080 --> 40:30.080]  oh, it watches you.
[40:30.080 --> 40:31.080]  It listens to you.
[40:31.080 --> 40:32.080]  It gives recommendations.
[40:32.080 --> 40:36.080]  It's never off and it's going to run your life.
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.080]  Imagine if I showed up at your house with a camera
[40:39.080 --> 40:41.080]  and I said, you know, I'm just going to put this camera
[40:41.080 --> 40:42.080]  in your house and watch you.
[40:42.080 --> 40:43.080]  And I'm only one guy.
[40:43.080 --> 40:45.080]  You'd flip out and say, you're crazy.
[40:45.080 --> 40:47.080]  I'm going to put this camera off my front porch.
[40:47.080 --> 40:49.080]  But if it's Zuckerberg that says you're a dumb effort
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.080]  and it's all tied and everything else and it gets better,
[40:51.080 --> 40:56.080]  he's joined Google and Apple in AI development in China
[40:56.080 --> 40:59.080]  and they help put spy chips in the Apple products
[40:59.080 --> 41:02.080]  to help China steal all your data, including the Pentagon
[41:02.080 --> 41:05.080]  and the NSA and they jacked into everything
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.080]  and the Office of Personnel Management Hack.
[41:08.080 --> 41:12.080]  That's why Zuckerberg and none of them respect us.
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.080]  They've already gotten away with everything.
[41:16.080 --> 41:21.080]  We are a joke and they're all American haters.
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.080]  They're corporations and bureaucracies who got together
[41:24.080 --> 41:26.080]  when America had half the wealth 50 years ago
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.080]  and they said, let's sell this son of a gun out.
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.080]  And they built up China and India and 100 plus other countries
[41:34.080 --> 41:35.080]  but not their people.
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.080]  The middle class has got smaller on average
[41:39.080 --> 41:41.080]  because they want a giant sucking sound.
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.080]  They don't want to build a middle class like Ross Perot did.
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.080]  They want this actuaried plan to steal everything
[41:47.080 --> 41:50.080]  and then make you poor so there's no middle class to threaten them.
[41:50.080 --> 41:52.080]  They are monsters.
[41:52.080 --> 41:54.080]  They are selfish.
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.080]  They are cultural, spiritual, genetic psychopath monsters.
[42:00.080 --> 42:02.080]  And they are wildly criminal.
[42:02.080 --> 42:05.080]  Oh, but they banned the Nazis off the web
[42:05.080 --> 42:08.080]  and then next it's Alex Jones and then it's you
[42:08.080 --> 42:10.080]  and then it's the NRA.
[42:10.080 --> 42:12.080]  Oh, and they're virtue signaling.
[42:12.080 --> 42:17.080]  Oh, we're teaching people gender fluidity here at Google
[42:17.080 --> 42:20.080]  and some executives make people call them
[42:20.080 --> 42:22.080]  dragonettes in beautiful ornate buildings.
[42:22.080 --> 42:27.080]  It's all just training people for mental illness
[42:27.080 --> 42:29.080]  and how to submit to pure evil.
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.080]  So I'll play you some of the video inside your home
[42:32.080 --> 42:34.080]  with the portal.
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.080]  It's called Yes, the Portal.
[42:36.080 --> 42:39.080]  Oh, let's put from Facebook and Apple and Google
[42:39.080 --> 42:42.080]  and then it comes the AI portal directly in our house
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.080]  with all the little imperial progroid eyes
[42:45.080 --> 42:47.080]  hooked into the big AI systems.
[42:47.080 --> 42:49.080]  That's a great idea.
[42:49.080 --> 42:52.080]  Why don't you let Jeffrey Dahmer babysit your kids too?
[42:52.080 --> 43:21.080]  That might get you a better result.
[43:52.080 --> 44:01.080]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[44:01.080 --> 44:04.080]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves,
[44:04.080 --> 44:06.080]  it's just as important to make sure your kids
[44:06.080 --> 44:08.080]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[44:08.080 --> 44:11.080]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.080]  for your child built from the ground up
[44:14.080 --> 44:16.080]  to support your child's development.
[44:16.080 --> 44:19.080]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[44:19.080 --> 44:22.080]  ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.080]  with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[44:25.080 --> 44:27.080]  With this fish oil formula,
[44:27.080 --> 44:29.080]  you can support your child's optimal heart,
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.080]  joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA,
[44:33.080 --> 44:35.080]  which has been shown to be essential
[44:35.080 --> 44:37.080]  for your child's brain growth spurts.
[44:37.080 --> 44:40.080]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams
[44:40.080 --> 44:42.080]  of high DHA omega-3s,
[44:42.080 --> 44:44.080]  this formula is highly refined
[44:44.080 --> 44:47.080]  to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[44:47.080 --> 44:50.080]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow,
[44:50.080 --> 44:52.080]  look no further.

[47:29.080 --> 47:32.080]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[47:32.080 --> 47:35.080]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:35.080 --> 47:38.080]  Princess, we have a visitor.
[47:38.080 --> 47:40.080]  He picked up something outside the base
[47:40.080 --> 47:41.080]  and was on 12 Moving East.
[47:41.080 --> 47:42.080]  It's metal.
[47:42.080 --> 47:44.080]  And it couldn't be one of those creatures.
[47:44.080 --> 47:45.080]  Could be a speed or one of ours.
[47:45.080 --> 47:47.080]  No.
[47:47.080 --> 47:48.080]  Wait.
[47:48.080 --> 47:50.080]  There's something very weak coming through.
[47:50.080 --> 47:56.080]  Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.
[47:56.080 --> 47:58.080]  This signal is not used by the Alliance.
[47:58.080 --> 48:00.080]  It could be an imperial code.
[48:06.080 --> 48:07.080]  It isn't friendly whatever it is.
[48:07.080 --> 48:08.080]  Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
[48:08.080 --> 48:21.080]  10 roads, 10-11 to station 3.
[48:38.080 --> 48:48.080]  I'm afraid there's not much left.
[48:48.080 --> 48:49.080]  What was it?
[48:49.080 --> 48:50.080]  Droid is some kind.
[48:50.080 --> 48:51.080]  I didn't hit it that hard.
[48:51.080 --> 48:53.080]  It must have had a self-destruct.
[48:53.080 --> 48:55.080]  An imperial probe droid.
[48:55.080 --> 48:58.080]  It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
[48:58.080 --> 49:05.080]  We better start the evacuation.
[49:05.080 --> 49:12.340]  He's building AI with Google and Apple and China and helping
[49:12.340 --> 49:13.080]  round everyone up.
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.080]  I support Chinese censorship.
[49:15.080 --> 49:16.640]  And I want it in America.
[49:16.640 --> 49:19.800]  And taking Jones off hundreds of platforms at once.
[49:19.800 --> 49:22.580]  Well, it's called curation.
[49:23.480 --> 49:24.800]  Recurating everything.
[49:24.800 --> 49:27.240]  And just bring this into your house
[49:27.240 --> 49:29.320]  and just be a trusting, crazy soy boy.
[49:29.320 --> 49:30.160]  And go.
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.160]  Hi.
[49:33.160 --> 49:34.400]  I want to put a little thing in there
[49:34.400 --> 49:37.420]  that watches you and tracks you with AI technology.
[49:39.120 --> 49:40.540]  Trust me.
[49:40.540 --> 49:42.760]  I'm not the American psycho.
[49:42.760 --> 49:45.240]  Hi, ladies, would you like to, you're hitchhiking.
[49:45.240 --> 49:47.720]  I see, would you like to get in the car with me?
[49:47.720 --> 49:49.800]  What planet are we on?
[49:50.880 --> 49:52.400]  Our users trust us.
[49:52.400 --> 49:53.640]  Dumb efforts.
[49:55.200 --> 49:57.040]  So there's a little Zuckleberg.
[49:57.920 --> 50:00.280]  And I could joke around about this.
[50:00.280 --> 50:01.120]  This is deadly serious.
[50:01.120 --> 50:04.000]  You see, it's the over the topness of big tech,
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.040]  the globalists, under Obama, under Hillary,
[50:06.040 --> 50:08.760]  under the big plan, moving all the tech to China,
[50:08.760 --> 50:10.640]  giving them all our military secrets,
[50:10.640 --> 50:14.520]  allowing them to put spy tech
[50:14.520 --> 50:17.840]  in all the major consumer electronics and phones,
[50:17.840 --> 50:20.280]  which I told you 10 years ago.
[50:20.280 --> 50:22.700]  We wrote articles 10 years ago,
[50:22.700 --> 50:25.140]  giving you exactly what was happening.
[50:26.800 --> 50:28.400]  And that's why I'm the number one enemy.
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.200]  I told you they're buying the debt before it became big news
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.520]  because I was reading the CFR like 15 years ago.
[50:33.520 --> 50:35.040]  They said, we're going to position the US
[50:35.040 --> 50:36.960]  as a debtor to China, transfer everything
[50:36.960 --> 50:38.840]  for the USS to capitulate.
[50:38.840 --> 50:40.800]  And so we can have an orderly ascendance
[50:40.800 --> 50:42.960]  of the Chinese century.
[50:42.960 --> 50:44.200]  These are quotes.
[50:44.200 --> 50:45.440]  I'm reading this going.
[50:46.560 --> 50:48.280]  And this is from David Rockefeller.
[50:48.280 --> 50:50.360]  It's from these jerks.
[50:51.440 --> 50:54.000]  And then I started talking to high-level Hollywood folks
[50:54.880 --> 50:55.720]  and they're like, oh yeah,
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.560]  the Chinese are buying everything up.
[50:57.560 --> 50:58.640]  And now that's mainstream news.
[50:58.640 --> 51:01.040]  Wall Street Journal, China now owns Hollywood.
[51:02.360 --> 51:05.240]  And it's insane what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:05.240 --> 51:08.040]  And now they're financing the Europe Spring against us.
[51:08.040 --> 51:09.560]  They are our enemies.
[51:09.560 --> 51:12.040]  And that's why the White House has come out
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.360]  and told companies you better abandon China.
[51:15.360 --> 51:17.880]  And now even the establishment's going,
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.480]  okay, it's hard to give up on them,
[51:19.480 --> 51:21.960]  but you're right because your check made it.
[51:23.560 --> 51:25.800]  Just because Obama and Hillary and everybody
[51:25.800 --> 51:28.800]  finished the process of transferring everything to China,
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.800]  you didn't get the presidency to put the cherry on top.
[51:31.800 --> 51:34.320]  And now the rugs being pulled out from under you.
[51:34.320 --> 51:37.200]  Get this big dinner table set and Trump walked over
[51:37.200 --> 51:40.080]  and he's not pulling the tablecloth off that trick
[51:40.080 --> 51:41.080]  and leaving stuff on the table.
[51:41.080 --> 51:43.080]  Remember my dad when I was a kid?
[51:43.080 --> 51:45.440]  Did that once in front of me and only one glass full over?
[51:45.440 --> 51:46.880]  My mother was impressed.
[51:46.880 --> 51:48.400]  We were watching a movie or something
[51:48.400 --> 51:49.240]  that they didn't move my daggers.
[51:49.240 --> 51:50.160]  I can do that.
[51:50.160 --> 51:51.280]  Like the next day we're about to have dinner,
[51:51.280 --> 51:53.240]  my daggers like pulls the whole thing off.
[51:53.240 --> 51:55.440]  But the point is Trump's not doing it
[51:55.440 --> 51:56.400]  where the stuff stays on.
[51:56.400 --> 51:58.040]  He's just dragging it all off the table.
[51:58.040 --> 51:59.760]  How do you like that, globalist?
[51:59.760 --> 52:02.880]  And they're crapping their dirty little britches.
[52:02.880 --> 52:05.920]  This is a time to say, hip hip hooray.
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.120]  Frag just day, kaloo kalay.
[52:09.120 --> 52:11.240]  Or we have slain the Jabberwocky.
[52:11.240 --> 52:13.040]  That went floofal as it went.
[52:13.040 --> 52:15.360]  But I have not gotten to that yet.
[52:15.360 --> 52:16.280]  Continuing here.
[52:17.680 --> 52:18.840]  This is critical.
[52:18.840 --> 52:20.920]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras
[52:20.920 --> 52:24.000]  into their homes, AP, infowars.com.
[52:24.880 --> 52:27.560]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room.
[52:27.560 --> 52:30.840]  Gee, I bet this won't be used to spy on everyone.
[52:30.840 --> 52:32.600]  And let's go ahead and go to the little promo piece
[52:32.600 --> 52:35.360]  with a bunch of soy boys smiling all the way.
[52:35.360 --> 52:36.920]  Here it is.
[52:36.920 --> 52:40.480]  Meet Portal and Portal Plus from Facebook.
[52:40.480 --> 52:42.120]  A new way to connect that makes you feel
[52:42.120 --> 52:43.280]  like you're in the same room.
[52:43.280 --> 52:44.480]  Hey.
[52:44.480 --> 52:46.720]  Portal's smart camera follows the action,
[52:46.720 --> 52:49.400]  keeping you in frame and everyone in view.
[52:50.800 --> 52:54.400]  Smart sound focuses on your voice, minimizing the rest.
[52:54.400 --> 52:55.720]  That's what it's supposed to do.
[52:55.720 --> 52:58.240]  And with portals, you stay in control.
[52:58.240 --> 53:00.680]  Disable the camera and microphone with a single tap.
[53:00.680 --> 53:03.160]  Force flip the cover over the camera lens.
[53:03.160 --> 53:05.840]  You can connect with your closest contacts from Facebook
[53:05.840 --> 53:09.040]  and Messenger, even if they don't have portals.
[53:09.040 --> 53:10.400]  And when you're not in a call,
[53:10.400 --> 53:13.680]  Portal displays photos, videos, and events.
[53:13.680 --> 53:16.440]  And Portal has Amazon Alexa built in.
[53:16.440 --> 53:18.840]  So you can ask a question, check the weather,
[53:18.840 --> 53:20.000]  force up the mood.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.440]  Alexa, dim the lights.
[53:23.600 --> 53:25.800]  Portal is a whole new way to spend more time
[53:25.800 --> 53:27.000]  with your favorite people.
[53:27.000 --> 53:27.840]  Hey guys, bring me.
[53:27.840 --> 53:29.800]  I know we got the older Alexis around here for jokes,
[53:29.800 --> 53:31.440]  but can we bring one here later?
[53:31.440 --> 53:33.640]  I'm gonna tell it to kill itself.
[53:33.640 --> 53:35.080]  I wanna ask about the Chinese communists
[53:35.080 --> 53:38.200]  and stuff like that, but seriously,
[53:39.840 --> 53:42.520]  you notice, oh, it dials in on your voice with voice print.
[53:42.520 --> 53:45.080]  Yeah, I can listen to you in three rooms away.
[53:45.080 --> 53:48.200]  The Kinect systems, nine years ago, eight years ago,
[53:48.200 --> 53:50.800]  admitted that they could see through your walls
[53:51.720 --> 53:56.720]  using basically a form of radar, sound waves.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.480]  I mean, these things are Trojan horses
[53:59.480 --> 54:02.960]  of Trojan horses, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:02.960 --> 54:07.400]  And so, sounds great, but you know who the company is.
[54:07.400 --> 54:09.600]  This is great for your business, yeah.
[54:09.600 --> 54:11.760]  You just better not have it plugged in all the time
[54:11.760 --> 54:12.600]  or be around it.
[54:12.600 --> 54:15.120]  You better treat it like a giant rattlesnake in your house
[54:15.120 --> 54:16.920]  because it'd be one thing if it was a security company
[54:16.920 --> 54:19.800]  trusted that had a long history of not letting anybody
[54:19.800 --> 54:20.800]  get into their data.
[54:20.800 --> 54:24.040]  And then this is just for your security or whatever.
[54:24.040 --> 54:27.360]  It's Zuckerberg, man, in bed with the chai-coms.
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.360]  It'd be like randomly getting an email
[54:33.480 --> 54:35.800]  from some Nigerian prince or something saying,
[54:35.800 --> 54:37.360]  you know, they're shaving people
[54:37.360 --> 54:39.040]  from human smugglers or something.
[54:39.040 --> 54:41.240]  You know the Nigerians are the biggest scammers ever.
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.320]  You know their national product
[54:43.320 --> 54:45.040]  is scamming people over the internet.
[54:45.040 --> 54:47.400]  That'd be like coming home and your wife, you know,
[54:47.400 --> 54:50.040]  has brought the Nigerian prince delegation into your house
[54:50.040 --> 54:51.520]  and all they need is a million dollars
[54:51.520 --> 54:52.760]  to save the children.
[54:52.760 --> 54:54.360]  But this is more dangerous than that.
[54:54.360 --> 54:57.600]  It's Zuckerberg, you know, they go,
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.680]  oh, be politically correct.
[54:58.680 --> 55:01.360]  Yes, the gypsy culture of many Romanoff gypsies
[55:01.360 --> 55:03.440]  is to rob the cultures around them.
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.840]  But let's just, you know, bring a gypsy caravan in,
[55:05.840 --> 55:07.480]  let them move into your house for a month.
[55:07.480 --> 55:08.840]  Nothing's gonna get stolen.
[55:08.840 --> 55:10.520]  Your kids aren't gonna get kidnapped.
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.280]  This is more dangerous than bringing
[55:12.280 --> 55:14.960]  a hundred Romanoff gypsies into your house.
[55:20.680 --> 55:23.040]  All right, we're gonna go to break, we're gonna come back.
[55:23.040 --> 55:24.360]  I've got a great, incredible,
[55:24.360 --> 55:26.360]  Millie, we were boiled down to the insanity of the left.
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.160]  This season, we're joining us later.
[55:28.160 --> 55:29.680]  We have several big guests as well.
[55:29.680 --> 55:32.040]  I wanna get into the left, pledging more violence.
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.000]  Democrats and political talking about getting more ruthless.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.640]  They've gone full authoritarian.
[55:40.640 --> 55:42.680]  You don't ever wanna go full retod.
[55:42.680 --> 55:44.920]  Well, they've gone full authoritarian.
[55:46.840 --> 55:49.320]  So that's coming up, critical intel straight ahead.
[55:49.320 --> 55:50.600]  A ton of clips I haven't gotten to.
[55:50.600 --> 55:52.160]  Trump on fire this weekend.
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.080]  Talking about Da Nang, Dick,
[55:54.080 --> 55:56.200]  Blumenthal, and so much more.
[55:56.200 --> 55:59.280]  But that said, we have launched the biggest sale
[55:59.280 --> 56:01.680]  in our history that we're planning for Christmas.
[56:01.680 --> 56:03.640]  But because they're racing to try to shut us down
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.280]  all the rest of it, it's absolutely critical
[56:07.280 --> 56:08.560]  that you get your shopping in now
[56:08.560 --> 56:09.960]  and your Christmas shopping.
[56:11.080 --> 56:12.760]  So we're launching the Christmas Black Friday,
[56:12.760 --> 56:14.480]  Cyber Monday, all rolled into one.
[56:14.480 --> 56:17.920]  All of the specials, we were planning for Black Friday,
[56:17.920 --> 56:20.480]  Cyber Monday, and Christmas.
[56:20.480 --> 56:22.840]  And we're still around then, seriously.
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.400]  I got good cheer about this.
[56:24.400 --> 56:25.560]  We've already devastated the globalists,
[56:25.560 --> 56:27.200]  but, and I hope we'll be around.
[56:27.200 --> 56:29.040]  I'm sure in some permutation,
[56:29.040 --> 56:30.960]  but you need to get the products now
[56:30.960 --> 56:33.600]  and support the broadcast so we can be bunkered in,
[56:33.600 --> 56:35.760]  hunkered in, supply the Alamo.
[56:35.760 --> 56:37.400]  We promise we won't give up,
[56:37.400 --> 56:40.400]  but it'd be good to have a little bacon and a little beans
[56:42.360 --> 56:45.080]  to whip the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.
[56:45.080 --> 56:46.600]  So they hate you supporting us.
[56:46.600 --> 56:48.920]  You get great products, you beat the globalists.
[56:48.920 --> 56:52.640]  50% off all InfoWars Live products, super sale.
[56:53.520 --> 56:55.400]  And we're just gonna continue through the month of October
[56:55.400 --> 56:57.280]  while supplies last of each product.
[56:58.600 --> 57:00.440]  And every other product is massively discounted.
[57:00.440 --> 57:01.280]  And did I forget?
[57:01.280 --> 57:02.680]  Cause we probably want to add that or scroll down.
[57:02.680 --> 57:04.720]  Is it on there that there's free shipping?
[57:04.720 --> 57:06.680]  There it is, it's there.
[57:06.680 --> 57:09.720]  Free shipping store-wide on top of it.
[57:09.720 --> 57:11.760]  Other incredible specials as well.
[57:11.760 --> 57:14.440]  Support the InfoWars now and get great products.
[57:14.440 --> 57:16.440]  And yeah, we're getting close to selling out Rain Force
[57:16.440 --> 57:17.520]  in X2, our last run.
[57:17.520 --> 57:19.360]  Happies just came in, it's very popular, it's amazing.
[57:19.360 --> 57:21.080]  Knockout, got a lot of that.
[57:21.080 --> 57:23.800]  X2, again, that's running out.
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.200]  Bodies just came back into stock.
[57:27.200 --> 57:30.080]  We've got so much more at infowarslive.com
[57:30.080 --> 57:33.120]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[57:33.120 --> 57:35.880]  Toothpaste, 50% off, fluoride free,
[57:35.880 --> 57:37.680]  colloidal silver, iodine, fortified.
[57:37.680 --> 57:39.440]  Super blue for adults and children
[57:39.440 --> 57:40.920]  and the mouthwash and immune gargle.
[57:40.920 --> 57:44.120]  All 50% off, biggest sale ever.
[57:44.120 --> 57:50.240]  Help fund the InfoWars and take us to victory.
[57:50.240 --> 57:51.880]  Just like our information is game-changing,
[57:51.880 --> 57:53.160]  our products are game-changing.
[57:53.160 --> 57:55.720]  And SurvivalSkillX2 is the pure iodine.
[57:55.720 --> 57:58.040]  No one else has this from deep earth, crystals
[57:58.040 --> 57:59.680]  between seven and 12,000 feet.
[57:59.680 --> 58:03.080]  It's very hard for me to get, it's the good halogen.
[58:03.080 --> 58:05.160]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens,
[58:05.160 --> 58:08.720]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you,
[58:08.720 --> 58:11.720]  fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[58:11.720 --> 58:14.280]  Myotrysilinium goes with it like a horse of carriage.
[58:14.280 --> 58:17.000]  Silinium is an electrochemical.
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.240]  It's to eat as well in all activity in the body,
[58:20.240 --> 58:22.760]  particularly neurons.
[58:22.760 --> 58:24.560]  So these go incredibly well together.
[58:24.560 --> 58:26.160]  We have a combo of those.
[58:26.160 --> 58:27.480]  Just experience it for yourself.
[58:27.480 --> 58:30.240]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.920]  Very simple stuff, filter your water.
[58:32.920 --> 58:34.960]  Yeah, I find myself some water filters.
[58:34.960 --> 58:36.560]  Best out there for the price.
[58:36.560 --> 58:39.320]  When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be six
[58:39.320 --> 58:40.320]  months a year until we get more.
[58:40.320 --> 58:41.160]  I hope we get more.
[58:41.160 --> 58:42.480]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[58:42.480 --> 58:46.400]  SurvivalShortX2, M4WarsTour.com or M4WarsLife.com
[58:46.400 --> 58:48.480]  or AAA-253-3139.
[58:50.200 --> 58:52.960]  I want to plow into all of this.
[58:52.960 --> 58:55.760]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,
[58:55.760 --> 58:57.880]  just encouraging listeners to understand that
[58:59.320 --> 59:01.960]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[59:01.960 --> 59:06.960]  or books or videos or other material from M4WarsTour.com,
[59:08.160 --> 59:10.160]  you are funding the revolution.
[59:10.160 --> 59:12.280]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[59:12.280 --> 59:15.160]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products
[59:15.160 --> 59:16.280]  at M4WarsTour.com.
[59:16.280 --> 59:17.400]  I don't want to thank everybody that has,
[59:17.400 --> 59:19.760]  but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[59:19.760 --> 59:22.480]  with colloidal silver and with high quality
[59:22.480 --> 59:23.560]  atomic iodine in it.
[59:23.560 --> 59:25.960]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[59:25.960 --> 59:28.600]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[59:28.600 --> 59:31.320]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[59:31.320 --> 59:35.720]  M4WarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[59:35.720 --> 59:38.320]  And your purchase of the products stands with us,
[59:38.320 --> 59:40.040]  stands with America, stands with Trump,
[59:40.040 --> 59:41.400]  stands against the globalists
[59:41.400 --> 59:43.040]  and their satanic pedophile armies.
[59:43.040 --> 59:45.640]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[59:45.640 --> 59:48.240]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[59:53.240 --> 59:56.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.280 --> 01:00:19.160]  So, you know, they always say when they kick you off Google,
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.120]  Facebook, Twitter, well they only put the negative results
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.360]  up about you and your Donald Trump or Alex Jones
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.720]  at the top, they always say,
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.320]  oh, it just builds your own thing.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.680]  And then they come after your credit card processors
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.960]  and they come up with the very software you use
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.720]  on your website.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.760]  They come after your very internet service providers
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.480]  and then they come after your payment processors,
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.680]  everything.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.960]  So Andrew Torb at the bottom of the hour from GAB,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.640]  which again is just a free speech site.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.000]  So you've got black nationalist, white nationalist,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.520]  you know, maybe that's 5% of the site,
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.360]  then you've got just regular conservatives,
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.440]  libertarians, liberals, it's a free for all.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.760]  Long as you don't, remember how the internet used to be?
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.840]  Long as you don't call for killing anybody
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.920]  or you're not selling methamphetamine or whatever,
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.320]  you can do it but then they can come into your site
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.160]  and say, look, a Nazi.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.120]  And they had the Leptis groups call up and go,
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.080]  oh my God, they can't have a donate button on their website.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.200]  Kick that away.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.120]  You'll get another process company.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.000]  Kick that away.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.760]  And then the Democrats just have a way,
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.720]  even though it's not public who you're using,
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.360]  they know because they have the Justice Department.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.200]  It's nice to have some FBI agents like, you know,
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.200]  with reality winners, political views in there.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.360]  And that's what Project Veritas shows they're in there
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.720]  and they're doxing Congress and doxing
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.240]  and it's just fun giving ISIS blueprints
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.520]  and just, you know, and that Google's helping China
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.200]  build AI to suppress their people
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.880]  with Operation Skynet.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.560]  I'm not kidding, that's not from Terminator.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.400]  That's what they call it.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.240]  And I told you Skynet was a Pentagon plan
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.080]  for this big wireless grid,
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.240]  but now China's doing it
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.000]  because it's all been given to them.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.040]  They're the good boys.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.560]  China's the good authoritarians.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.160]  They don't have that pesky voting and things.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.600]  And so now we've got the head of Interpol,
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.520]  who was a CHICOM.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.640]  He was the deputy head of their Navy.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.240]  Top civilian military officer heading up Interpol,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.440]  which he disappeared last week.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.800]  So the Chinese told us five days later they grabbed him.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.000]  I guess he wasn't doing everything they said,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.400]  but the CHICOM officer,
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.280]  he was in control of the code keys
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.440]  to basically everyone's IDs,
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.600]  everyone's social security numbers,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.000]  everyone's information,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.280]  just like the personnel management pack.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.440]  Interpol's not just the US though,
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.680]  it's everybody's identity.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.280]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.280]  How China detained the head of Interpol?
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.200]  Oh my goodness.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.200]  We let one of their top civilian military commanders,
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.520]  the equivalent of a four-star general,
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.880]  run Interpol for the last few years.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.400]  What could go wrong?
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.680]  Well, just when you check in to a hotel,
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.960]  when you get a rental car anywhere in the Western world
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.840]  or in many other areas of the planet,
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.440]  it logs into Interpol
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.800]  and tells them everything that's going on
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.160]  under the Patriot Act.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.560]  That put us into that.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.160]  So you show up the rental car,
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.000]  you always wonder why.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.840]  Where you going?
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.680]  What you doing?
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.520]  What's happening?
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.280]  I'm like, I'm here with my four children
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.320]  and I'm really tired.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:31.840]  Oh really?
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.080]  And I go, listen, I know you're putting it
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.680]  in that security database.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.080]  You know where that goes?
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.920]  You know that, huh?
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.120]  I'm like, yeah, lady.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:38.960]  I know that.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.280]  And why don't you ask me 20 questions?
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.520]  Let's see, oh, let's have this big database
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.840]  that controls everything.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.760]  And then let's put the chat comms
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.760]  in control of the AI, of Apple, of Google,
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.880]  of Facebook, of Twitter, everything.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.840]  Because again, it's a base.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.920]  Everybody always says, oh my God,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.920]  corrupt people use Israel as a base against America.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.600]  And some corrupt people do jump back and forth
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.440]  and use it.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.960]  Absolutely.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.080]  But I've noticed what about China
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.680]  and how the global is using it as a base
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.360]  to launch attacks on America.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.280]  Now he went to the year and a half ago
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.440]  when Trump got elected to the Davos
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.880]  and said, I'll stop Trump.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.720]  I'll stop.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.080]  You know, globalism will defeat America.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.400]  And the younger said, yes, we'll defeat America
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.240]  in a trade war.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.600]  And they shook hands on that.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.280]  That was a declaration of war against us.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.040]  Remember, I covered it at the time.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:25.960]  Pretty big deal.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.080]  That's how arrogant these guys are.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.440]  And people didn't think that was an issue.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.360]  Oh, Alex, come on.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.600]  But it's Junker and Soros and the Chai-Com leader
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.440]  and all of them.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.560]  And they just think they're gonna get away with all this
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.160]  because our own elite sold us out to it.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.000]  Well, guess what?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.280]  They didn't have a right to do that.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.080]  So Obama and Hillary and Soros
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.920]  and all you that sold us out in Apple,
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.520]  we're evicting your deal with China.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520]  It's a fraud.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.480]  It's no void.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.160]  And we're tearing it up.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.280]  And a lot of you are in for a big treat.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.920]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.240]  can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.160]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.000]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.640]  coming to you live from the front lines
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640]  of the Info War.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.640]  It's also what happens when you listen
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.640]  to the radio host, Alex Jones,
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.640]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.640]  were inside jobs.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.640]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.640]  or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.640]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:00.640]  against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.640]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.640]  And they began to have some of their allies
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.640]  within the Internet world, like InfoWars,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.640]  take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous,
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.640]  outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.640]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.640]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.640]  your reputation is amazing.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.640]  I will not let you down.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.640]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.640]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.640]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.640]  Yeah, my reputation is amazing with the patriots
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.640]  in corporate America and at the Pentagon
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.640]  and at the Patriots at the CIA and with the president.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.640]  Not the whole CIA, not the whole Pentagon,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.640]  but the people that know the score
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.640]  and who want to sabotage this country.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.640]  Guess what? I'm the test pilot.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.640]  I've been volunteering for this mission,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.640]  never involved in the agencies, any groups.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640]  I knew the globalist threat.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640]  I read their books. I saw their reports.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.640]  I saw their plan building and everybody else
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.640]  was scared to take them on.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.640]  No one was willing to do it in a high-tech, modern manner.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.640]  And so we did it.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.640]  And you were willing to take them on.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.640]  And now, once it's realized that the Clintons
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.640]  and the globalists and the Bushes sold us out to China
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.640]  in a world government plan.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.640]  And the CFR decades ago said the Chinese century is coming
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.640]  and did everything to sabotage us.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.640]  Once people realize that, it's over.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.640]  You ask, how could they do this?
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.640]  Well, you see, America was conquered by the people
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.640]  when they stood up in 1776.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.640]  And then by 1789 and the official establishment of the nation,
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.640]  the ideas of rule by the people
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.640]  and due process and checks and balances
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.640]  threatened all the other imperial corrupt systems in the world.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.640]  And that's why the big mega banks and the robber barons
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.640]  fund communism and fund socialism and fund the UN
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640]  and fund all the radical Islam,
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.640]  because they are at odds with the American system,
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640]  which is really the Renaissance.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.640]  And the expression of the Magna Carta in 1215
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:26.640]  and the Gutenberg press 300 years later.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.640]  And where we are today, this is all the arc
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.640]  of humanity going to the next level.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640]  We're going to hit some bumps.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640]  We're going to go into some valleys,
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.640]  but the arc overall is up, up, up.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.640]  And now, the last 200 years, we are leading.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.640]  America is leading straight up.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.640]  We've already hit escape velocity.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.640]  We're already a type one civilization, I can tell you.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.640]  But the globalists do not want you to know that.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]  They want to suppress it.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640]  They want to steal the future.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.640]  And when I say this, it's not hyperbole.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.640]  You see it all over the news now.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.640]  Communist China was chosen by the Ford Foundation,
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640]  the Rockefeller Foundation and others.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.640]  Mao was put into power.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.640]  Congress passed laws to give billions of dollars of weapons
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.640]  to Shanghai check on the nationalists.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640]  Imagine China, they were a nationalist country today
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640]  and really free market.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.640]  They'd be even more powerful than our friend.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640]  That'd be great.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.640]  No, the globalists wanted to manage Communist Party.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640]  They could control and then they would make deals
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.640]  to build them up and transfer our industrial might
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.640]  and then maneuver us into a checkmate position.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640]  And Trump understands this,
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.640]  that they had a $900 billion trade deficit on us
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.640]  and all these other things, he's saying it's wrong.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.640]  And now, he's coming out saying China's meddling
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640]  in our elections and he gives real concrete examples
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.640]  of them buying four page ads and double spread ads
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.640]  in hundreds of newspapers in battleground states
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.640]  like Ohio and Michigan and Florida.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.640]  And they've got paid infomercials on television
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.640]  putting down Trump and they're financing books and movies.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.640]  You want to make a movie about Trump being bad
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.640]  or white people being bad?
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.640]  It will get financed in 10 seconds.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]  And guess who does it?
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.640]  Chinese holding companies.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.640]  Why do you think there's hundreds of shows on Netflix
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.640]  about race rioting and whites being bad?
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.640]  Are hundreds of shows about men being bad?
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:26.640]  It's how China divides and conquers.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.640]  So the Chinese Communist are allied
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.640]  with the big think tanks,
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.640]  the psychological warfare professors
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.640]  to give China the intel
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.640]  to understand how to propagandize here in America.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.640]  So you hear Hillary say,
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.640]  phones gave Russia the American know how they needed
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640]  to steal the election.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.640]  That's her telling you what she did with China.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640]  They're giving it from the perspective
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.640]  of weird mentally ill, chip on their shoulder,
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.640]  Harvard and Yale and Stanford
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.640]  and UT, psychology department people
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.640]  and Chicago business school people
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.520]  who are just in their own world.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.020]  They don't get what's happened in the world.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.260]  And they thought Hillary could win.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.980]  She looks like a vampire out of a movie,
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.320]  mixed with a joker.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.660]  It's a joke to them, but the joke's on them.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.640]  So her and her pedophile husband and the rest of them
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.200]  just don't know even what universe they're fighting in.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.040]  And so they made the deal with China.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]  They bragged about it.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.440]  They thought you were idiots.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.960]  And then Trump got in
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.200]  because the American people were hungry for it.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.160]  Patriots in the government pushed for it.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.760]  Matt Drudge, myself and many others
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.000]  were willing to be attacked and demonized
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.120]  to get the truth out.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.240]  You were willing to do it.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.840]  And we are kicking the living snot out of them.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.320]  We're kicking the living holy details out of them.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.080]  We are stomping their guts out.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.840]  We opened a gigantic can of Yosemite Sam on them.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.440]  And, ah, hates globalists.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.240]  And they don't know what to do.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.640]  Info wars is where the fuse got lit.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.120]  The bomb already blew up.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.720]  They're over info wars trying to piss on us,
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.540]  thinking that, yeah, and that's how far behind they are.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.040]  That's why it's a sick joke.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.600]  I mean, let me tell the listener something, okay?
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.360]  Supporting the info war, spreading the word.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.840]  We've already devastated them.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.000]  Nationalists are winning all over the world
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.560]  from Italy to Brazil.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.760]  It's gonna be tough on those of us
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.640]  that have been on the front line.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.720]  We've been singled out for retaliation.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.960]  But the tree of liberty gets watered
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.720]  by the blood of patriots and tyrants, jackasses.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.360]  And that's what these globalists don't get.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.160]  They keep thinking I'm like them
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.840]  and just hold it on to life and hold it on to power
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.960]  and trying to get on top of people and scheming.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.080]  I'm already on top of you.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.120]  Spiritually, I don't even want power.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:04.960]  You get real power.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.360]  You don't want power.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.360]  You people are falling.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.560]  I'm talking to the globalists right now.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.400]  You're a joke.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.160]  So here's the big giant announcement to everybody.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.360]  We're winning.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.280]  We're going through hell.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.360]  We got even bigger challenges down the road.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.480]  But don't let anybody demoralize you
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.720]  because you are kicking butt.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.240]  And who cares when mainstream media lies
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.400]  about your attacks you?
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.040]  These are all the sellouts and all the scum
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.200]  and all the traders and all the yes men
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.760]  who are just groveling and trying to get ahead
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.840]  by how low they can lay on their belly
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.720]  like fat little snakes.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.560]  We're men.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560]  We walk on our legs.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.160]  We don't bow down in ditches.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.200]  We build a world.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.280]  We're farmers.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.120]  We're engineers.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.240]  We're scientists.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.080]  We're fathers.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.920]  We're mothers.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.760]  We're brothers.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.600]  We're sisters.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.440]  We're husbands.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.280]  We're wives.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.440]  But I tell you this, we're also very, very vicious
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.120]  and very, very destructive and very, very wicked
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.560]  when we need to be.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.600]  And the globalists have been finding that out, you see.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.480]  All they've got is throngs of mindless zombies
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.360]  that can't even find their butt with both hands.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.280]  We have all the tools.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.120]  If you simply get off the bench
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.520]  and start becoming political and cultural
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.840]  and economic in the fight and nothing can stop you,
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.760]  you are invincible with God's help.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.840]  And it's here and it's now, but I'm gonna say it again.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.320]  The big news.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.920]  They made a deal to sell us out to China
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.920]  and bring in world government collapses.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.680]  In the 11th hour, 58 minutes, begun to reverse.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.720]  That's why they're in panic mode.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.840]  It's why they're so criminal and why they're so dangerous
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.720]  is because they're willing to do anything.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.360]  But now they're exposed
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.320]  and they don't have control of the executive
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.760]  and that's why we're going to win.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.640]  The problem is they're gonna stage false flags
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.440]  and some really nasty stuff soon.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.760]  And our biggest challenges are about to happen.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.760]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.760]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.880]  keeping your doctor or being able to afford
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.160]  needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.240]  has become a challenge.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.520]  Control your own healthcare costs and choices
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.880]  with Liberty Health Share.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.840]  Liberty Health Share is not insurance.

[01:16:52.880 --> 01:17:02.880]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:25.880]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:29.880]  Welcome back.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.880]  Okay, I have so much news I can do 10 hours of broadcast,
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:39.880]  but I keep harping on China because it's in the news that the president, the Pentagon,
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.880]  even Congress, big corporations admit, okay, it's been a one-sided deal with China.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.880]  It's been a giant crime against our country.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.880]  We've been totally and completely sold out.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.880]  And now they're transferring the Internet control keys over there
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:58.880]  so that they can run censorship against the rest of the world out of there
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.880]  with a government that supports total tyranny.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.880]  And then they've loaded spy chips into all the Chinese appliances, the phones, you name it.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.880]  That's Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.880]  And now, this is from Yahoo News.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.880]  Associated Press Reuters is all picking it up.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.880]  Stay away from China. White House top economist tells U.S. business
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.880]  as trade tensions escalate to the U.S. and China.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880]  Washington is sending a warning to U.S. companies.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.880]  Think twice about doing business in China.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.880]  If I were a business, I would basically just stay away from China right now.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.880]  Their misbehavior is so terrible.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.880]  Kevin Hasser, chairman of the Economic Council,
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.880]  advisor said on Yahoo Finance Market show Friday,
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.880]  that's why President Trump is taking a hard line with them.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.880]  They've got to change the way they behave if they want to be part of the modern world global economy.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.880]  Now, instead, they just do whatever they want
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:56.880]  because they're a bunch of mad dog communists that have been in power since 1949.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.880]  And the children of all the party officials are all billionaires
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.880]  and are just allied with insane anti-American Silicon Valley.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.880]  And again, Google, all of them are helping censor.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:15.880]  They're helping round people up and they're helping create AI weapon control systems
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.880]  but won't even work with the Pentagon.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.880]  I respect the company if they said I'm not going to work with anybody.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.880]  But no, no, no, we're not. We're America haters.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.880]  We won't work with America.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.880]  Hasser also cited the bombshell story from Bloomberg Business Week,
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.880]  which claims, which claims,
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.880]  China's military deployed a microchip.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.880]  They're in all the devices to attack hardware and supply chain
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.880]  and infiltrated U.S. tech giants like Amazon and Apple.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.880]  Both companies have denied the report.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.880]  Oh, and they deny they censor. They deny they're leftists.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.880]  But in a still raised many concerns about Chinese electronic manufacturers,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:00.880]  Hong Kong listed, Lenovo and ZTA saw share prices drop 15%.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Zuckerberg, let's pull him up in China.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.880]  He agrees with censorship. So does Tim Cook.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.880]  Tim Cook, I did a special report on it last week.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.880]  Tim Cook, the most dangerous man in the world.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.880]  Because he's the bridge, the Trojan horse.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:20.880]  And he says, oh, we need to let China censor.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  It's called curation, curating like a museum.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.880]  And I want to do that in America.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880]  So he thinks they demonize me.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.880]  They lie about me and they pick me as a straw man, then they do it.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.880]  So they're all moving back in.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.880]  Big Tech made the decision a few years ago to Obama to move back in.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.880]  They've done it and they never left.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.880]  It's the truth.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.880]  So the globalists made a deal to sell us out.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.880]  We pointed it out. Others pointed it out.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880]  Trump got in.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.880]  The Russia distraction isn't working.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.880]  And it's all coming out and the Democrats are scared.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.880]  How a Pentagon contract became an identity crisis for Google.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.880]  New York Times won't work with the Pentagon.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.880]  That's Google.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880]  You see?
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.880]  And now they're going to meet with the Pentagon and say, oh,
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880]  we're not discriminating against America.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880]  No, the sky's not blue.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.880]  No, no, no.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.880]  Unbelievable because China has a billion, 400 million slaves
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.880]  who have high IQs and work hard, and they can be used to leverage
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.880]  out the whole planet if they can have unfair trade advantage.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.880]  And that's the plan.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.880]  And that's why they did it.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.880]  I'm done talking about China.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.880]  I've done an hour and 24 minutes on it.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880]  I'm done.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.880]  It's just now you see it coming into view.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.880]  China is attacking the U.S. infrastructure and infiltrating it
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.880]  with the help of Big Tech.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.880]  This was a plan under Hillary and Obama to put us into checkmate,
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.880]  to make us capitulate, to capture America.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880]  They're globalists.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.880]  China is the globalist stronghold.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.880]  They set it devos.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.880]  That's the plan.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:05.880]  Yeah, let's just show images of Zuckerberg with the Chinese president.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.880]  So that's what's going on.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.880]  They've got a client group.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.880]  The left thinks they can leverage into global domination.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880]  Well, not if we're aware of it.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.880]  And not if we start cutting China off.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  Who wrote the TPP deal?
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  Hillary?
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.880]  Who did, turned out, helped write it?
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880]  Diane Feinstein.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  And who gave advice in what they wanted if China was going to join TPP,
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.880]  which they never even ended up doing?
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.880]  Because they just got us to go to the agreement,
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880]  but they didn't have to enter it.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.880]  And that was the Chinese chief of staff she had.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.880]  It was her personal aid for over a decade,
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.880]  a high-level Chinese intelligence operative, now confirmed.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880]  Of course, that's a Chinese seat in the Senate.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.880]  They paid for it.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.880]  They believe they own us.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.880]  They think we're idiots.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.880]  Because when you are brought up like Diane Feinstein to hate America,
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.880]  and her whole world is hating America,
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.880]  hating Western culture, she's taught to feel inferior,
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.880]  she's taught that she's been put down and that she's an underdog,
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  so if she can metaphysically piss all over America
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.880]  and run us into the ground with a bunch of soulless, chai-kong murderers,
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.880]  she'll be a real girl.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.880]  Well, guess what, you old hunchback witch?
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.880]  Get ready because everybody hates you.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880]  So there you go.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.880]  Now, we're going to go to Brighton and come back with the head of GAB
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.880]  that they're trying to take off the Internet as well
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.880]  and trying to take their processing away from them to get into the censorship boards,
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.880]  or when he thinks Andrew Torba thinks we should do to fight this,
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.880]  then we're going to open the phones up as well after that.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.880]  Then I have Conrad Padilla here in the studio,
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.880]  Millie Weaver and so much more.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.880]  We're also going to play this compilation,
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.880]  I've got a bigger one coming up when Millie Weaver joins us,
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.880]  I'm going to host the fourth hour today.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.880]  When Millie Weaver joins us, incredible footage, she and her crew,
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.880]  she's got two crew members now, not just Gavin, one other fella,
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.880]  just the most amazing stuff.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.880]  Now, we're on broadcast TVs, we have to blur out all the,
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.880]  even the shirts that say F this and people flipping the bird.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.880]  You'll see a lot of black cubes and stuff everywhere,
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.880]  but that's what's happening there, so that's all coming up as well.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  infowars.com, newswars.com, I cannot stress enough
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.880]  how they're trying to shut us down and I cannot stress enough
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.880]  that because they've taken our payment processor PayPal
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  and then we've got some backups, but they are just,
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.880]  like we're a foreign country, the globalists are persecuting us
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.880]  like sanctions, because we're Americans.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880]  Globalism is a sanction on America.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.880]  So I'm seen as Americana, I'm under massive attack, as you know.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.880]  Prop now they say he's lost $2 billion in his businesses since he ran
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880]  for president one with all the persecution.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]  Well, guess what?
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  I don't have one tenth of what he's lost, one one-hundredth of that.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.880]  So we don't have the money to operate under that.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.880]  We've still got shopping cart, you're still able to get orders through
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.880]  and whatever orders go through will be shipped out.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.880]  That's why we're wrapping Christmas and Black Friday and Cyber Monday
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  all into one now and saying get your products now
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  at infowars.com and go ahead and order the Christmas stuff
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880]  that we're going to need.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.880]  You know, some X2s, some colloidal silver, silver bullets,
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.880]  some real red pill plus, even though X2 is going to sell out,
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.880]  even though BrainForce is going to sell out, that's our last run of that,
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.880]  super mail vitality, we're still going to do 50% off
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  just to get the inventory out the door.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.880]  We know our numbers, we're sure to sell all this by Christmas,
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.880]  but you know what?
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.880]  I'm not going to wait till then and then sell it then.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.880]  We're going to get it out the door, help us now, get the money in
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.880]  to make sure we can continue on for a while no matter what they pull on us,
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.880]  but don't wait, ladies and gentlemen, take action.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.880]  50% off, super sale and free shipping store-wide.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.880]  Free shipping store-wide, 50% off and all the supplements,
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.880]  a bunch of other big specials as well, infowars.com, infowars.com.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.880]  They absolutely hate the fact that you're able to support us
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.880]  and get great products.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.880]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.880]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.880]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.880]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.880]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.880]  someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.880]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.880]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:53.880]  FakeTV.com
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.880]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.880]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now,
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:32.880]  but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago,
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:33.880]  so I get the price down.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.880]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.880]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.880]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.880]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.880]  There's Viable Shield X2.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.880]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:47.880]  It'll be gone in a couple of months.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.880]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowars.com.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.880]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.880]  I suggest you stock up on it.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.880]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.880]  infowars.com right now.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.880]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.880]  to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.880]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.880]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients,
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.880]  amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.880]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.880]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula,
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:20.880]  the new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.

[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.880]  we've managed to make this powerhouse formula
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.880]  into a delicious, concentrated drink mix

[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.880]  the Real Red Pill,
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.880]  that could become one of our fellow Infowars' favorite products.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.880]  Now, with an extra proprietary energy blend inside,

[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.880]  By the way, Tucker Carlson defended us twice last week.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880]  I never even got this clip.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.880]  I want to play this ahead of our guest joining us,
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.880]  because slowly but surely,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.880]  free speech is being very quickly strangled.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.880]  And now they're going after your ability
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.880]  to even be in the free market,
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.880]  and the Democrats are using people inside the Justice Department,
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.880]  inside the CIA, to dox folks,
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.880]  as you're now seeing, criminal charges,
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.880]  with intel that only insiders could have
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.880]  to actually shut down our ability to even have our own platforms,
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.880]  and the head of GAB,
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.880]  which is a true free speech social network,
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.880]  is facing oblivion right now.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.880]  Many authors that were bestsellers on Amazon
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.880]  have had their payment processors taken,
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.880]  and Amazon taken, so they're just going dark.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.880]  We need the president and Congress to act.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.880]  But first, you had to turn the economy on.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.880]  You had to point out that the chai comms are the real enemy,
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.880]  that the globals are using as an attack base against us,
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.880]  and he had to get the Supreme Court in place to move forward.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.880]  But guess what?
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:25.880]  Trump is about to go on the attack after the midterms.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.880]  So all the globalists and AI, pushers,
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.880]  Google, and all the rest of the censors, get ready.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.880]  Here is Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.880]  Previously on this show, we've told you how employees
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.880]  at Google discussed altering search results
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.880]  to undermine the White House's immigration policies.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.880]  At the time, Google said it has never changed search results
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.880]  for political reasons, and it never will.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:47.880]  We knew it was untrue.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.880]  Then now we can prove that it is untrue.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.880]  The show has obtained internal Google emails
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.880]  in which an employee discusses editing YouTube search results
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.880]  to suppress videos based on their political content.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880]  Here's one example.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.880]  Last March, Google engineer Dong Zhao sent an email
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.880]  saying the company wanted to, and we're quoting,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.880]  demote low-authoritative content on controversial queries
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.880]  to fight against fake news.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  This was not hypothetical.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880]  He said the company had already succeeded
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.880]  in suppressing unwanted videos,
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.880]  videos for searches like Hillary and, or flattered here,
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:21.880]  Tucker.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.880]  It's not clear which videos were suppressed
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.880]  because if Google won't admit it or tell us,
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.880]  but the email does indicate that Alex Jones
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.880]  and Infowars were a major target of this.
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.880]  Google says their efforts are not political
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:35.880]  and meant to fight conspiracy theories,
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.880]  though for the record, we have never endorsed
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.880]  any kind of conspiracy theory in the show and never would.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880]  And by the way, how does Google define a conspiracy theory?
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.880]  They haven't told us that either,
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.880]  or why a superpower global monopoly ought to be making
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.880]  that decision in the first place since they have
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.880]  a congressional exemption in which they promised not to.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.880]  They promised to be a conduit through which information flows
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.880]  and not a news site that edits it.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.880]  Congress might want to rethink that agreement.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.880]  Yeah, that's about to happen.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  Conspiracy theory means questioning the official story.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.880]  They mixed it with big foot space aliens,
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.880]  but that's not the stuff that hurts them.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:13.880]  They have censored me saying,
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.880]  Jones claims big tech censoring conservatives.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.880]  We have Project Veritas videos.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.880]  We have internal documents, hundreds of them,
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.880]  where they say our main enemies Alex Jones.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.880]  Our next enemy is Paul Watson.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.880]  Our next enemy is Donald Trump.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.880]  And yes, Tucker Carlson.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.880]  His videos would all get 20 million views.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  You can't have his show, you know, on, on YouTube,
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.880]  have 20 million views before they put shadow banning
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.880]  about a year and a half ago.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.880]  I noticed every Tucker Carlson video had like 5 million views.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.880]  Now they're a half million because they shadow ban the things.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.880]  Okay, it's simple.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880]  They admit it.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.880]  I have their executives on hidden camera.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.880]  I'm going to spare you and go to our guest,
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  Andrew Torba of gab.com.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.880]  You know, Andrew obviously launched a successful site
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  with millions of people use it.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.880]  And they've Googles delisted it.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.880]  They've gone up as payment processing.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.880]  They're trying to shut him down right now.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.880]  They say, oh, go do your own thing.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.880]  Oh yeah, that's when they really come after you.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.880]  So it's good to have you here.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.880]  I wanted to get your view on where we are right now
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.880]  in this purge 29 days out from the election
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.880]  because it's hurting those of us that run these operations.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.880]  But I think the intimidation and the censoring
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880]  is actually waking a lot of people up.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.880]  But will it be too little too late?
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:29.880]  Where would you say we are right now in this fight?
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.880]  Well, Alex, I think a lot of people are waking up today,
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.880]  actually, just within the past half hour.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:37.880]  We had a breaking news report that Google Plus,
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:40.880]  Google's social network, exposed the private data
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.880]  of hundreds of thousands of users to developers.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.880]  Just like Facebook had millions of users data
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880]  exposed to developers for years.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880]  This is going on.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.880]  And finally, people are starting to wake up and say,
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.880]  wait a minute, why do we have all of our data?
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.880]  Why do we share all of our most intimate private moments,
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.880]  all of our most intimate private conversations
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.880]  with these two or three companies?
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.880]  The reason why we started Gab is I was out in Silicon Valley
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.880]  and I said, why is there no real alternative?
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.880]  We have this illusion of choice where all of these companies
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.880]  own every single app that we use to communicate,
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.880]  every single app that we use to get news, to get information.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.880]  Why is there no real alternative?
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.880]  So that's why we started Gab.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.880]  I saw this stuff coming and I've seen it for years.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.880]  I've been talking about it for years.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:25.880]  You've been talking about it for years.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.880]  And I think people are finally starting to wake up, thankfully.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.880]  And I hope it's not too late.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.880]  They told us to go and build our own,
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.880]  which is exactly what we did.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.880]  And now we're being attacked at every single level.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.880]  We're being banned from app stores.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.880]  We have payment processors, no platforming us
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.880]  and saying we can't use them anymore.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.880]  We have our hosting provider telling us to censor things.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.880]  We even have our domain registrar threatening to seize our domain
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.880]  because they don't like the content on our site.
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.880]  Now, this is ridiculous.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.880]  This is not a free market. This is a rigged market.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.880]  It must be clear because Congress and the president
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.880]  haven't acted yet because it takes time.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.880]  Everything they've done to me and you
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.880]  is being green lighted against everybody else
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.880]  from James Woods to Ann Coulter.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.880]  They're moving against everyone right now.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.880]  This is serious authoritarianism.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.880]  It's cartel.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.880]  When you get all these companies together,
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.880]  notice Tim Cook about it and said,
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.880]  oh, we didn't get together. He admitted it earlier.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.880]  That's the real crime is that they're getting together
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.880]  and targeting groups.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.880]  Right. And Tim Cook talks about curating content.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.880]  Well, curation is just another word for censorship.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.880]  It's him. It's Apple. It's Google.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.880]  It's Facebook picking and choosing
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.880]  what news sources are quote unquote
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.880]  real. Oh my God, Alex Jones had
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.880]  two million downloads in a month of his app.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.880]  It's number one with five stars, 20,000 reviews.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.880]  Oh, I'm going to curate this.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  Turd the punch bowl. No one wants it.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.880]  It'd be one thing if it was some scam
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.880]  app that didn't work and had, you know,
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.880]  half a star. But no,
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.880]  five perfect stars.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.880]  I was censored for winning the
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.880]  ND 500. I was censored for winning
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.880]  the Super Bowl. I was censored because
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.880]  they were number one even with their damn
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.880]  censorship and they can't compete with
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.880]  our ideas. So they're a bunch of authoritarian
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.880]  scum.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.880]  Absolutely. And, you know, we just raised
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  $630,000 in our
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880]  latest funding round directly from
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.880]  the people and they see us
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.880]  doing things like this. They see us
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.880]  winning. They see the Info Wars app being
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.880]  downloaded like crazy with five star reviews.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.880]  They see Gab raising hundreds of thousands
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.880]  of dollars from the people, not from
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.880]  Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists or from
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  conferences like Twitter did and they
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.880]  say, we have to stop this. We have to shut this
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.880]  down because these guys are going to continue
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.880]  to grow and they're going to continue to take
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.880]  away our market share. So they
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.880]  and they don't have that market share. They don't
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.880]  have control. They can no longer control the
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.880]  narrative on the Internet and that's why
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.880]  they're censoring and that's why they're locking
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.880]  us down. That's why there are no platforming
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.880]  us because we are winning and I think we have
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.880]  to keep that in mind. We have to remain positive
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.880]  and keep fighting and keep building.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.880]  And I totally agree. If we're folks that don't
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.880]  want to be in the world, best of times, worst of
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.880]  times, okay, we got censored all these platforms
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.880]  that cut a lot of traffic, but the fact that
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  there's this Streisand effect
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.880]  video wise four or five times the views on
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.880]  our own platform. The problem is
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.880]  instead of a $50,000 bill,
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.880]  it went up 100,000 to 150,000
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.880]  if you count the different bills just for
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  video and then we've even got those companies
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.880]  saying we may kick you off and not let you
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.880]  buy the video from us and so
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.880]  we then had to leave one company.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.880]  I mean, this is literally
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.880]  total whack-a-mole and all we're doing is
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.880]  sitting here defending free speech. So
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.880]  you sound like a lot of money, $600,000.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.880]  The software, the bandwidth,
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.880]  all of it, you need millions.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.880]  Show to we, I mean folks, this is
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.880]  a war. Google has
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.880]  hundreds of billions, Apple has
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.880]  a trillion, but literally a million
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.880]  against each of their billion trumps
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.880]  them like David versus Goliath,
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.880]  but we still got to have that support folks.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.880]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.880]  And I think, you know, it's important to keep
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.880]  in mind that, you know, we are
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.880]  playing whack-a-mole, so it prevents us
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.880]  from building out and improving the
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  platform because we have to constantly change
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.880]  providers and find a provider that will
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.880]  support what we're doing and support our mission
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.880]  and inevitably we have to build our own.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.880]  We have to start from scratch and build out
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.880]  our own infrastructure. What about the fact that
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.880]  as libertarians or just common sense
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.880]  people, we never target them with boycotts
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.880]  and stuff. I mean, these damn domain companies
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.880]  and these, these, these, these bandwidth
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.880]  people and all of them, they lie about who
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.880]  you are. You've been there for years, you've
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.880]  mulled this money, they treat you like crap
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.880]  and kick you off or threatened to. It's, it's
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.880]  literally like we're Jews in Nazi Germany.
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.880]  You know, I think we need to start
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.880]  to do the boycott. I think we need to start
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.880]  to maybe pick up the tactics of the left
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.880]  and start to boycott some of these companies
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.880]  and call them out. And again, we have to build
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.880]  our own infrastructure. We have to keep fighting.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.880]  We have to keep building. Otherwise,
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.880]  we're going to have no voice left on the internet.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.880]  You're right, my friend. We'll be
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.880]  right back with Andrew Korba
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.880]  from gab.com and gab.ai
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.880]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.880]  and newswars.com. We are here
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.880]  literally because of you. We are in your hands
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.880]  and when you share our links and our videos
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.880]  and our articles, you put it in the face
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.880]  of the globalist and deliver victory
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.880]  to humanity. The scientists at InfoWars Life
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.880]  have created a powerful formula
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.880]  for inflammatory support
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.880]  and joint support. Discover the power
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.880]  of ancient medicine with bodies.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.880]  Bodies contains one of the most
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.880]  potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.880]  Turmeric has been used for thousands
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.880]  of years and is one of the most studied
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.880]  herbs today. It is well known
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.880]  in traditional medicine for its soothing
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.880]  properties. Our pure turmeric
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:21.880]  extract plus peppering from black pepper
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.880]  makes for optimal absorption to help
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.880]  boost and support your flexibility,
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.880]  mobility, joint function,
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.880]  immune system and so much more.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.880]  Regular turmeric root from the store
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:33.880]  only contains one to five percent
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:35.880]  of active ingredients. But our turmeric
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:37.880]  root extract contains over 95
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.880]  percent of the active ingredients.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.880]  Bodies combines turmeric with
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:43.880]  organic herbs such as spearmint,
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.880]  sage, lemon balm and thyme
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.880]  to work synergistically for full
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.880]  body support. Try bodies today

[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.880]  if you spread the word about our articles

[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.880]  we won't just
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.880]  continue to stand up against these
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:35.880]  brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.880]  We have huge sales

[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.880]  We're still able to operate
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.880]  the shopping cart and get stuff shipped
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.880]  out to you despite the fact we're trying
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.880]  to block our commerce and you're right
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.880]  to the market. But if you don't stand
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:51.880]  up and support us financially

[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.880]  Prebiotic fiber is
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.880]  soluble fiber that ferments
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.880]  in the gut to help feed good bacteria
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.880]  which helps you digest food
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.880]  absorb nutrients and even
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.880]  support your immune system.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.880]  InfoWarsLife's cutting edge formula

[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.880]  prebiotic fibers are used up only
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.880]  at the beginning of the colon, but our
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.880]  premium organic acacia fiber
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.880]  is slowly digested by the
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.880]  good bacteria throughout the
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.880]  entire colon for maximum
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.880]  prebiotic effect.
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.880]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:19.880]  or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.880]  And now because of their intensifying
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.880]  censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.880]  that everyone go to
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.880]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:33.880]  and sign up via email so there's no way
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.880]  the censors can get between us with
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.880]  critical videos, articles, breaking news,
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.880]  intel, you name it.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.880]  And so now I ask you more than ever
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.880]  to share the InfoWars.com
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.880]  articles, to share the videos, to tell
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.880]  people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:49.880]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.880]  for the free newsletter at
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:53.880]  InfoWarsLife.com forward slash
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.880]  newsletter. We are the Renaissance
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.880]  and we are winning.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.880]  show.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.880]  Defending the Republic
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.880]  from enemies, born
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.880]  and domestic.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.880]  Andrew Dwarf is our guest this segment
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:33.880]  and the next segment and then I'm going to open
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.880]  the phones up and take your calls for a while
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.880]  then we have a special guest in the studio
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.880]  but just listen to me. I've been on air
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:41.880]  23 years and you guys,
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.880]  the audience has been awesome and we've changed
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:45.880]  the world together and I love you all
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.880]  and I'm not bitching and complaining at you.
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.880]  I'm going to end when stuff's really serious
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.880]  to joke around and have fun
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.880]  because that's just how my brain
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.880]  works.
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.880]  But they,
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.880]  here's the problem. I'm not a propagandist.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.880]  I promote what I promote because
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.880]  I believe in it passionately but I don't
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.880]  engage in trying to doll it up or even
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.880]  think about what I'm going to say.
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.880]  But then at the same time,
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.880]  I talk to a lot of smart folks and they're like,
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.880]  man, you do not want to encourage the enemy.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.880]  The enemy's tapping my phone
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.880]  every damn thing about me.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:19.880]  And I'm not at liberty to get into all this
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.880]  and I'm not complaining.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.880]  But let me tell you folks, you've seen spy movies
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.880]  and stuff, it's way beyond that. These people
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.880]  are sick
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.880]  and
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.880]  they've got
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.880]  Justice Department level
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.880]  stuff on us. Nothing corrupt.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.880]  They're using the databases like you see
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.880]  in the news that the Justice Department
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.880]  and Congress and all these communists
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.880]  they've hired out of the colleges
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.880]  who literally
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.880]  don't want to work with the Pentagon in AI
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.880]  but want to work with China suppressing their people.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.880]  And so I am literally under attack
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.880]  by a bunch of Maoist
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.880]  and
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.880]  I can't even talk about business stuff
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.880]  on the telephone now.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.880]  I have to meet with people
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:05.880]  and because we've even done dis info before
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.880]  on the phone and then they act on it.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:09.880]  And off record,
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.880]  I've even been to the FBI twice
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.880]  and said knock it off, okay?
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.880]  Because we even did some counter stuff
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.880]  and have watched and done some things
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.880]  and it's like, my God, man,
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:21.880]  they have hired like 30 years
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:23.880]  of FBI agents and people that are
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.880]  whacked out leftist, man.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.880]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but let me tell you something.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.880]  They have built a secret police army
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.880]  in this country and they are
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  at war with info wars and the president
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.880]  and all I can tell you is
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.880]  thank God for President Trump because we've come a long way.
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:39.880]  I'm gonna go back to Andrew.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.880]  It's just this.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.880]  If I've called for your help before
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.880]  and said things are serious,
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:51.880]  this is urgent and it's
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.880]  10 times the threat we've ever faced.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.880]  You can see it all over the news, they're in Politico.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.880]  I've got the quotes right here.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.880]  After failing to stop Cabinon,
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.880]  Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.880]  See, they're just gonna double down.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:07.880]  They're gonna stage a false flag and blame it on me.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:09.880]  I'm totally sure of it.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.880]  I'm totally sure of it now.
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.880]  They've got big stuff coming so we think we're winning.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.880]  Get ready.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.880]  We're gonna make it through this storm
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.880]  because people are aware of their scams now.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.880]  Cabinon was a big example of that,
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.880]  but we need your financial support
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:25.880]  to not just expand,
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.880]  but to hold the line and let the enemy know
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.880]  that you're standing with us.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.880]  Because what happens if they get all our payment processors,
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:33.880]  which they're trying to do?
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.880]  Then you only build it by the product.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.880]  If they don't fund us,
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:39.880]  they've taken all our...
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.880]  I can't even advertise online on big platforms.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.880]  They've taken that from us.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:45.880]  And then I sure as hell can't...
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.880]  they do this sell stuff to make money to fund us.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:49.880]  I'm a free market guy.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.880]  So...
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.880]  George Washington robbed British ships
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.880]  to fund his revolution.
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.880]  So I'm just selling products to fund ours.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.880]  And you know, maybe they'll shut down
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:01.880]  our capability to do that,
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:03.880]  and people have to do other stuff.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.880]  But we're not the weather underground.
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.880]  We're just trying to be Americans to promote things.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.880]  So we've got the biggest sales.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.880]  In case they shut us down to financially before Christmas
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.880]  or Black Friday or whatever they're trying to do,
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:15.880]  and you see them on the news,
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.880]  saying they want us destroyed,
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.880]  you can get your orders in right now.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.880]  50% off, M4 SuperSale and free shipping
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.880]  on all the great supplements,
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:25.880]  BrainForce X2,
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.880]  even though they're all about to sell out.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.880]  This is the last run of X2.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.880]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, everything.
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.880]  FloodInfoWarsStore.com,
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.880]  M4WarsLive.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.880]  Everything
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.880]  is 50% off of the supplements.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.880]  A lot of other products are already so discounted.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:43.880]  There's not even 50% to discount.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.880]  Maybe 25, 30% you could.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.880]  So there's a bunch of other big specials, free shipping,
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.880]  store-wide on everything.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.880]  So on top of 50% the free shipping on those
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.880]  is a... some of these are lost leaders.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.880]  But we've got to move the inventory off the shelves
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.880]  in case the enemy shuts us down financially for a while,
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.880]  which is the move they're making.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.880]  FloodInfoWarsStore.com today.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.880]  Now is the time, folks.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:05.880]  Now we need provision for this war.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:07.880]  We need to be strong. I want to expand live broadcast
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.880]  right through every night,
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.880]  through the election, and then on after.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:13.880]  We're getting the people in place. We're getting the crews in place.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:15.880]  It's very expensive. Our bandwidth bills
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:17.880]  have tripled because everybody came
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:19.880]  to InfoWars. Everybody came to Prison Planet.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:21.880]  Everybody came to NewsWars. Yes,
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:23.880]  we're actually bigger than we were.
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:25.880]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:27.880]  We were already under shadow banning, so
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:29.880]  we're going to catch. But there's the other
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:31.880]  problems of the expensive skyrocketing show.
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.880]  Thank you for being financially supportive.
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.880]  Get great products at the same time.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.880]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com. There's a donate button
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:39.880]  as well right there in the support us.
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.880]  I want to give a pure donation. That really helps
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:43.880]  because there's not much profit in these products.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.880]  When we do big sales, though, we sell a ton of them,
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:47.880]  so it kind of evens out. Plus, I got to move it off
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:49.880]  the inventory shelves. So I'm not here dead in the water
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:51.880]  with a ton of Christmas inventory,
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:53.880]  and they've shut us down, which is their plan.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:55.880]  So I need you to come to Paul Revere's rescue.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.880]  Well, financially.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.880]  InfoWarsStore.com
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.880]  InfoWarsLive.com
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.880]  or triple-a-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:07.880]  Now, going back to Andrew Torba,
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:09.880]  Andrew,
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:11.880]  explain to me your view on where this is going
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.880]  and what Congress, what the president needs to do,
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.880]  because this is incredibly authoritarian.
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:17.880]  It's the Chinese model of cutting people off
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.880]  financially and talking about what they're trying
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.880]  to do to your payment processors, because,
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.880]  I mean, like you said, this is just incredible.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:25.880]  Sure, Alex.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.880]  Well, I think what you just said is so crucial
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:29.880]  and so important.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.880]  The people are really funding us,
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.880]  just as they're funding InfoWars.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.880]  And that's what makes these people so mad,
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:37.880]  and that's why they're trying to cut off
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:39.880]  our payment processors and your payment processors
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:41.880]  and your hosting providers.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:43.880]  And I think a lot of folks don't realize
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.880]  how much it costs to run a website,
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.880]  how much it costs to run a social network.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:49.880]  The bandwidth required to live stream your videos,
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.880]  to host your videos.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:53.880]  The bandwidth required to host our content
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.880]  on our site.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.880]  People don't realize this. It costs money.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.880]  And we don't have the luxury, like big social networks,
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:01.880]  we're not mass collecting your data,
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:03.880]  like Facebook and selling it to advertisers
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:05.880]  for billions of dollars.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.880]  We're completely powered by the people,
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.880]  just like InfoWars is.
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:11.880]  And I think what Congress needs to do,
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.880]  what President Trump needs to do,
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.880]  is take antitrust action against these companies,
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:17.880]  because they're doing anti-competitive behavior
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.880]  in the marketplace.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:21.880]  By an oligarchy in Silicon Valley
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:23.880]  that decides who can participate in the free market
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.880]  and who cannot.
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.880]  And I think it's so crucial
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.880]  that the people understand that they really are
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.880]  powering this revolution
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.880]  and this information war,
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.880]  and alternative platforms like us
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:37.880]  and alternative sources of news, like InfoWars,
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:39.880]  are completely powered by the people.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:41.880]  And that's why the ability for us
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:43.880]  to participate in the free market
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.880]  is being cut off.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:47.880]  That's why they're going after our payment processors
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.880]  and again, I don't like Nazis,
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.880]  but first they take Storm Front
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.880]  or whatever it's called away,
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:55.880]  and then the next it's
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.880]  they're trying to take Donald Trump's banking away.
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.880]  They're trying to take the NRA's banking away.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.880]  They're trying to take ours away. I mean, they've done it.
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:03.880]  And we have to run around like chickens with our heads cut off,
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  you know, just deal with this all weekend,
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.880]  and it's just never ending,
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:09.880]  and it's so criminal.
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:11.880]  If we were doing this to them, they would completely go insane.
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.880]  Let me ask you this.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.880]  The alliance between Big Tech,
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.880]  a mid-level out in Silicon Valley
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:19.880]  who worked with some of the high-level guys,
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:21.880]  and we were successful programmer.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.880]  The merger with China, the way they'll work with China,
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.880]  but not the Pentagon, the way they're
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.880]  Google and Twitter and Facebook are helping,
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:29.880]  and Apple especially suppressed the Chinese people.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.880]  This authoritarianism
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.880]  and how they've gotten away with so much,
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:35.880]  I think that's why they're so arrogant
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:37.880]  is no one's ever said no to Big Tech.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.880]  They're just out of control.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:41.880]  Absolutely. It's absolutely insane
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.880]  that they refuse to work
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:45.880]  as U.S. corporations.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:47.880]  They refuse to work with our own government,
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  our own military,
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:51.880]  and they choose to instead work
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.880]  with the Communist Chinese
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.880]  and help them censor their version of the Internet.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.880]  It's absolute madness.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:59.880]  This is something you would never think of
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:01.880]  from an American corporation,
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:03.880]  and yet here we are.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:05.880]  This new portal technology,
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.880]  this hardware device that Facebook just put out today,
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.880]  they want to be in your living room.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.880]  This camera actually tracks you around your home.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.880]  It listens to everything that you do.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.880]  So, not only are they tracking us
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:17.880]  and collecting all of our data,
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.880]  every single click, every single move we make on the Internet,
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:21.880]  but now they want to do it in our homes.
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:23.880]  I don't think so.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.880]  I don't think I'm going to allow more talk about Facebook.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:27.880]  And notice they target mainly women in these ads.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.880]  80% of advertising targets women.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:31.880]  If not the women are dumb, they're trusting.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.880]  And they're just, oh, women, put this in your house.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:35.880]  Oh, it tracks you and loves you.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.880]  It's absolute insanity.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.880]  This camera actually literally
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:41.880]  tracks you around your home.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.880]  They have a microphone on you 24-7.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.880]  It's dialed to your voice print
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:47.880]  to dial everything else out, but your voice,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:49.880]  which means it can listen through walls.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.880]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.880]  And this thing will be on 24-7.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.880]  I guarantee developers
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:57.880]  will be able to exploit it and get into it.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:59.880]  As we've seen, Facebook is not
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.880]  to be trusted with our data.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:03.880]  So, anybody that buys this, I really feel bad for them.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:05.880]  They are insane if you put this in your home
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.880]  in the same year.
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:09.880]  I've told hundreds of thousands of developers
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:11.880]  have full access to everybody's
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.880]  cloud, everybody's code keys,
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:15.880]  photos of your wife naked.
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:17.880]  I mean, I'm told they've got everything.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.880]  Alex, the information that I've heard
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:21.880]  from some of my friends in Silicon Valley,
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:23.880]  you would be appalled.
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.880]  Absolutely appalled at the level of information,
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.880]  the level of access that people who hate us,
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.880]  who want us dead, have access to.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:31.880]  So be very mindful of what you're saying
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:35.880]  on these platforms and what you're talking about as well.
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:37.880]  Well, you've got all the Project Veritas video
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:39.880]  where they sit around in the lamp and go,
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.880]  oh, I read their instant messages.
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.880]  Oh, I block messages. I listen to them.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:45.880]  I look at pictures of their wife naked.
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:58:06.880]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:26.880]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
