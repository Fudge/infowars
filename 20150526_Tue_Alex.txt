[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, the 26th
[00:05.120 --> 00:12.080]  day of May 2015 worldwide transmission. Well, top government insider in the U.S. says we'll
[00:12.080 --> 00:19.200]  be lucky if we don't have World War III by this summer. And praise that it won't be nuclear.
[00:19.200 --> 00:24.000]  Here's a report on Monsanto and we'll be back. Hey, it's Anthony Gucciardi. This is in Promptu
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.680]  Little Session. We're going to go ahead and ask people, I'm at March against Monsanto 2015,
[00:27.680 --> 00:31.280]  who aren't part of the event, what they know about GMOs and what they think about it. Let's do it.
[00:31.280 --> 00:34.720]  Hey, guys. Are you guys here with the March Against Monsanto event?
[00:34.720 --> 00:38.240]  I said no, we just kind of appeared here. Do you know what it is?
[00:38.240 --> 00:40.560]  No, we don't. Do you know what Monsanto is?
[00:40.560 --> 00:46.320]  Nope, not at all. Have you heard about Monsanto? No. GMOs? No. You have any interest in it?
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.120]  No. No. It's crazy that, you know, all these people are over there protesting it and the average
[00:51.120 --> 00:53.840]  American doesn't really know what Monsanto is. Yeah, so.
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.680]  You're with March Against Monsanto? No. Do you know what it is? No. That's March Against Monsanto
[00:59.680 --> 01:02.400]  right there. That's what I thought when someone asked. It had something to do with life with
[01:02.400 --> 01:07.280]  state and GMOs in Monsanto. We're just going around seeing if people who aren't a part of
[01:07.280 --> 01:13.200]  the march actually know what it is. Do you know what Monsanto is? No. No idea? No. Do you know
[01:13.200 --> 01:19.520]  what GMOs are? Yes, I've heard this phrase. You do, though. Yeah. Well, I mean, okay, no.
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.240]  We found one out of like 10, 15 people that know what Monsanto is. It's a good number.
[01:24.240 --> 01:29.840]  We're gonna keep doing this. Do you know what Monsanto is? No. No? No. Do you know what GMOs
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.200]  are? No. What? Have you heard of it Monsanto before? I told everyone what it was. I didn't
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.320]  hear you tell them, but yeah, I've heard of it. Okay. Do you know what it is? I believe it's a
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.400]  company. I think they make carpet. Genetically altered. Carpet? Carpet company. Is that what?
[01:46.400 --> 01:52.400]  Is Monsanto makes carpet? Sure. Genetically altered food. Correct, sir. Correct. They make GMOs.
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.160]  Long time they were doing it with cattle in Wisconsin for, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 years ago.
[01:58.160 --> 02:02.400]  Where are you guys from? Well, I'm from Russia. In Russia? Yeah. Do you know what GMOs are? Yes,
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.160]  of course. I'm against of it. I'm so against of it. Do you think most people in Russia are against
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.720]  GMOs? Yes, actually. We're trying to fight it. Yeah, you know, whenever I go on Russian television
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.960]  RT, they always say like, this is a non, yeah, an RT. They always say this is not a real issue here
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.040]  because we unanimously are totally against GMOs. Is that pretty much the case? Yep. Yep,
[02:21.040 --> 02:25.360]  absolutely. Is it weird to you that Americans have to go and do this to try and get GMOs out of the
[02:25.360 --> 02:29.280]  food supply? A little bit, yes, a little bit, because if it's supposed to be like the first country
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.840]  and like, you know, you guys have to be for the healthy, but it seems like not. A lot of GMO here.
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.720]  If I were to go in Russia and say like, hey, you know, we want to get GMOs out of the food supply,
[02:38.720 --> 02:42.560]  what do you think about that? Would they be all for that? I'll say it one more time, sorry.
[02:42.560 --> 02:46.240]  Most people in Russia would just think it's a non-issue, right? Like it's, they would already
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.560]  know that GMOs are back. Yes, it is, absolutely. Wow, well, we're going to talk to some Americans
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.000]  to get their take on it. All right. Okay, so you actually know what Monsanto is? I know a little
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.120]  bit about it. Where are you from? I'm from Houston. Okay, so and you actually know, like,
[02:59.120 --> 03:05.680]  do you know what GMOs are? No, not really, but I know about the whole cow thing and like with
[03:05.680 --> 03:11.440]  the milk. Yeah, and then from my English class. Okay, cool. So I've just spoke to someone with
[03:11.440 --> 03:15.200]  Russia and they basically said, everyone knows GMOs are bad, you know, it's totally accepted fact
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.240]  over there. Isn't it weird that most people don't even know what this is and here there are hundreds
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.240]  of people protesting it and millions around the world right now? Yeah, I think that's pretty
[03:22.240 --> 03:26.720]  interesting because it like, because it affects us very much. Who's your friend? Do you know about
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.200]  Monsanto? I don't know about Monsanto. No, do you know what GMOs are? Yes, I do. Oh, so you do? Okay.
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.320]  So you, so some people seem to have heard of GMOs, but they don't know about Monsanto. Oh yeah. Yeah,
[03:36.320 --> 03:39.760]  are these your family? Yes, my family. Do they know what Monsanto is? They don't speak English.
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.480]  They don't speak English? Where are they from? But I mean, what language do they speak? Vietnamese.
[03:44.480 --> 03:47.600]  Can you ask them if in Vietnam people know what GMOs are? Of course they do because of Agent
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.520]  Orange, right? Let's talk, let's actually talk about that. So you know what Agent Orange is,
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.960]  Orange is, right? Orange. Agent Orange. How do I explain this? During the Vietnam War,
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.160]  the United States used Agent Orange, they claimed it was an herbicide, but it was a chemical that
[04:02.160 --> 04:06.400]  killed millions of people and led to millions of birth defects in Vietnam. Okay. Are you familiar,
[04:06.400 --> 04:26.960]  24, 24, 24D? Oh, like the pesticide? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They didn't know what that is.
[04:26.960 --> 04:31.280]  She says in the north, not the south. And it was very devastating. It was, yeah. You know who made
[04:31.280 --> 04:37.440]  that? Who? Monsanto. I see. Tell them that's who they're protesting right there. They're protesting
[04:37.440 --> 04:40.960]  the company that was responsible for Agent Orange, which, which led to millions of birth defects
[04:40.960 --> 04:53.760]  in the country that she's from. Tell her about that. All right, folks, the full report is on
[04:53.760 --> 05:00.960]  info wars.com. Excellent job, Gutiarty and Josh Owens. We'll be back. President Obama has said
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.680]  in the past that we must find the proper balance between security of our nation and the privacy
[05:05.680 --> 05:10.800]  of our citizens. But with numerous whistleblowers coming out, including but not limited to Edward
[05:10.800 --> 05:15.920]  Snowden, Wayne Madsen, and of course, William Benny, who tell us that the NSA is doing more than
[05:15.920 --> 05:20.640]  checking al-Qaeda's Gmail accounts. It's about time that somebody held the president's feet to the
[05:20.640 --> 05:26.640]  fire. Appearing on CBS, Rand Paul noted, here's the thing about the president. He's disingenuous
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.680]  about this. The president started this program through executive order. He could end it anytime.
[05:31.680 --> 05:37.600]  The senator also noted that the NSA bulk collection was recently ruled illegal by a federal
[05:37.600 --> 05:43.920]  appellate panel. Why doesn't he stop it? What's he waiting for? Mr. Paul said. He says, oh, Congress
[05:43.920 --> 05:49.440]  can stop it. He started it on his own. He should stop it. And I've asked the president repeatedly
[05:49.440 --> 05:55.520]  stop the program. But as we all know, that hasn't happened. You can find more reports on the Alex
[05:55.520 --> 06:04.800]  Jones channel on YouTube. In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football,
[06:04.800 --> 06:11.520]  the basketball, security, alert, this is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building
[06:11.520 --> 06:17.200]  independent media operation, but the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones
[06:17.200 --> 06:23.200]  responsible. Prime director, discredit Alex Jones. Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy
[06:23.200 --> 06:28.720]  theory. A popular conspiracy theory talk show called info wars. Alex Jones is now in an Austin
[06:28.720 --> 06:35.360]  jail. These people are assaulting us. Targeting of patriots engaged. They are never going to stop.
[06:35.360 --> 06:41.280]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them. Block free iPhone app at

[07:00.960 --> 07:05.440]  started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both used
[07:05.440 --> 07:09.040]  a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here. Well, thank you, brother. It's
[07:09.040 --> 07:13.200]  because it also funds our operation. But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[07:47.120 --> 07:52.720]  going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I love it. Visit infowarslife.com

[08:00.720 --> 08:05.600]  Now to a Texas-sized conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories are running wild tonight
[08:05.600 --> 08:11.040]  about the Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[08:11.040 --> 08:14.880]  There are all kinds of conspiracy theories floating around about an upcoming Pentagon
[08:14.880 --> 08:20.080]  training exercise called Operation Jade Helm 15. The U.S. military is secretly
[08:20.080 --> 08:25.760]  plotting an invasion of the Lone Star State. Talk show host Alex Jones among the many stirring
[08:25.760 --> 08:32.080]  up concerns on conservative websites and social media that Jade Helm is a trojan horse for a
[08:32.080 --> 08:35.840]  federal invasion. A dress rehearsal for Marshall Law.
[08:43.280 --> 08:49.440]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones, who as David said has been one of the leading proponents of
[08:49.440 --> 08:54.640]  this theory, had agreed to join us this morning, but he did not show up at our studio. This is
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.000]  the dirty tricks they gotta pull. No, none of my listeners buy it. Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.800]  come on right now. The Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theories are inspired by Alex Jones, the Nutshop
[09:06.800 --> 09:13.920]  radio guy. The site Info Wars has led the Internet buzz, insisting it's all a plan for the Army to
[09:13.920 --> 09:20.960]  wage war on Americans, publishing a military PowerPoint slide showing Texas as red enemy
[09:20.960 --> 09:26.400]  territory. Texas, the prospect of armed federal troops, has sparked an avalanche of speculation,
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.400]  including fears of a government conspiracy to launch a hostile takeover of the state.
[09:30.400 --> 09:33.760]  You know who's calling it a Texas takeover? Lone Star lunatics.
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.000]  They're there for corporate executives to load their teleprompter,
[09:38.960 --> 09:43.520]  like a Pez dispenser, and then they just sit there and spout BS at people.
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.920]  From Willie Nelson on down, it's practically the slogan of the state.
[09:51.920 --> 09:58.800]  Don't mess with Texas. And that may explain the reaction to Jade Helm 15. Some folks in
[09:58.800 --> 10:03.120]  that state have seemingly been shaking in their rawhide boots ever since word got out about an
[10:03.120 --> 10:09.440]  upcoming military training exercise in Texas called Jade Helm 15. But come on, crazy people
[10:09.440 --> 10:13.120]  attend a local town hall meeting. Isn't a Texas specific story? I think the Constitution says
[10:13.120 --> 10:18.640]  you can't hold a town hall meeting without crazy people. I think it's in there. I heard that on
[10:18.640 --> 10:25.120]  Alex Jones, so it's true. I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true. There's even a Texas
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.640]  Ranger on the case, Walker, Texas Ranger that is also known as Chuck Norris in a new column
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.280]  for the conservative website World Net Daily Norris writes quote, if you haven't heard about
[10:35.280 --> 10:42.480]  operation Jade Helm 15, you need to. For an invasion, Marshall Law, Mayor of Big Spring,
[10:42.480 --> 10:48.560]  Larry McClellan has heard it all. He's gotten thousands of emails about Jade Helm conspiracy
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.240]  theories. Conspiracy theories have now been floating around for weeks about a military
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.680]  operation in West Texas.
[10:53.680 --> 11:06.880]  I'm a sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.840]  Training with the police, training with locals in plain clothes, quote, doing suspicious activities
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.000]  is to train the police to work with the military and covert operations and to condition the
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.480]  military to accept it and to condition the public to accept it. And then when we cover it and talk
[11:28.480 --> 11:34.080]  about it, they practice the PSYOP in real time, putting out this information. Conspiracy theories,
[11:34.080 --> 11:38.880]  conspiracy theories, Texas sized conspiracy theory, conspiracy theories, the government
[11:38.880 --> 11:43.680]  conspiracy Jade Helm conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories. The thing that
[11:43.680 --> 11:48.880]  kills me about conspiracy theories is they believe that they reflect like at a higher intelligence
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.600]  or a higher skepticism or a sense of awareness when in fact every conspiracy theories you know
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.480]  is gullible. Keep shoving lies at your audience jackasses. Please folks, call Fox News, tweet
[12:00.480 --> 12:03.120]  them, tell them I'm ready right now.
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.080]  And I think that's a healthy thing to question your government. I don't think it's particularly
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.840]  healthy to question the military. Alex Jones, a man who trades in such sinister conspiracy
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.760]  theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says. And they're always talking
[12:25.760 --> 12:30.320]  about false flag operations and they're so insulting and cruel like Alex Jones. Pretty
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.640]  snitch is a great thing, but then there's this shouting fire and uncrowded theater idea which
[12:34.640 --> 12:43.520]  you're not allowed to do. Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[12:43.520 --> 12:53.920]  Radio Network. Crashing through the lies and disinformation, waging war on corruption,
[12:54.560 --> 13:01.200]  changing the destiny of this planet, the human course of our species. That's what we're all
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.840]  about here at the Info War and history has shown us many things. But chief amongst it is that
[13:07.840 --> 13:15.040]  individuals have an incredible power to change the destiny of our human kind.
[13:17.760 --> 13:26.320]  For good and for bad and that for too long, the corrupt have been in control, openly maneuvering us
[13:30.080 --> 13:33.200]  towards what can only be called high-tech slavery.
[13:33.200 --> 13:41.120]  Our stories linked on DrudgeReport.com, Congress and the federal government are openly beginning to
[13:41.120 --> 13:46.320]  sniff around with the new Supreme Court ruling and are talking about taking over the public
[13:46.320 --> 13:53.920]  and private pension funds to quote, protect them and then of course tax them and loot them
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.600]  because our country is managed by the very same globalist that have done this in countless other
[13:59.600 --> 14:09.360]  countries over and over again. So we know the MO of the globalist because we've seen them carry it
[14:09.360 --> 14:14.320]  out. In fact, Sunday, I read this again on air, but will you guys print me Barry Goldwater
[14:16.480 --> 14:20.800]  from No Apologies, Warning of the Trilateral Commission, Global Government Plan,
[14:20.800 --> 14:27.200]  and then also print me Cicero on the Trader, thank you because those quotes from the 60s and those
[14:27.200 --> 14:35.760]  quotes from 2060 something years ago together really illustrates everything. I have been
[14:35.760 --> 14:41.520]  saying that there is a clear move, you'd have to be blind to miss it, to start conflict with China
[14:41.520 --> 14:49.200]  and Russia. That does not mean that China and Russia are good, it's part of a larger planetary
[14:49.200 --> 14:55.680]  destabilization program by the globalist who sit outside of the three power blocks, the Anglo-American
[14:55.680 --> 15:04.000]  West, the Russian system and then of course the Asian system dominated by the Chinese.
[15:06.160 --> 15:11.280]  And out of the planetary destabilization, they believe in Henry Kissinger's own words,
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.840]  out of these global crises and new crises, it will emerge the planetary government.
[15:17.840 --> 15:21.280]  And I can play the clips if you'd like. And I've read the books he wrote, I've read the books
[15:21.280 --> 15:28.400]  Brzezinski wrote, I mean it's from their fat mouths. That's why Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater
[15:28.400 --> 15:34.720]  sounded like Alex Jones in the 60s. When Ronald Reagan ran for governor in California, he sounded
[15:34.720 --> 15:40.960]  like Alex Jones. When Barry Goldwater ran for president, he sounded like Alex Jones. Well,
[15:40.960 --> 15:48.400]  actually Alex Jones sounds like them because they were simply there facing the facts,
[15:48.400 --> 15:53.120]  but under political pressure and being shot, people like Ronald Reagan quit trying to abolish
[15:53.120 --> 16:00.480]  the Federal Reserve or the IRS, didn't they? So we're dealing with the very same globalist group
[16:00.480 --> 16:04.480]  that has occupied our country and now they know there's an awakening happening, so they want
[16:04.480 --> 16:11.040]  to take the glove, the velvet glove off of the iron fist and they want to bring the hammer down
[16:11.040 --> 16:17.920]  domestically to set the precedent that they can arrest and incarcerate and disappear anybody they
[16:17.920 --> 16:24.800]  want. And we're here forcing a discussion, forcing it out in the sunlight to have a debate about it,
[16:24.800 --> 16:31.760]  to kick the tires, to look at the speedometer, to look at the paint coat, to look at the paint,
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.360]  to look at the brakes, to look at the upholstery and to say, you know what,
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.960]  we don't want to buy this car, we don't want to go down this road. And they're saying, no, no, no, no.
[16:40.960 --> 16:47.840]  On Amnesty, you can't see the legislation, just trust us, we're going to pass it. Or you can't see
[16:47.840 --> 16:55.680]  the power grab by the FCC of the Internet and of non-broadcast media. Just trust us. And you
[16:55.680 --> 17:05.680]  can't see the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it's secret. But just trust us and don't be an extremist.
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.600]  And you can't see details of $5 billion a year spent by the Energy Department in weather modification
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.120]  in the United States alone. We're like, we'd like to know exactly what you're doing.
[17:15.840 --> 17:20.800]  Shut up, crazy man, it doesn't exist. Really, here's the documents. Well, never mind that.
[17:20.800 --> 17:28.800]  Hey, we don't want you arming Al Qaeda to take over the Middle East. Okay, we'll just change
[17:28.800 --> 17:35.200]  the name. You lift the curtain up on these guys, and let me tell you, they're doing some bad stuff.
[17:35.200 --> 17:41.440]  And the curtain is being lifted. And so they're basically engaged in a rear-guard action right
[17:41.440 --> 17:51.280]  now, trying to do several things. Shut down our economy, get us on welfare, get us on food assistance,
[17:51.280 --> 17:56.800]  get us on corporate welfare, get us on the system. Corporate jobs that are government funded,
[17:56.800 --> 18:01.280]  government jobs that are government funded, food stamps, criminal justice system,
[18:01.280 --> 18:07.120]  psychological system, get you in the system, get you in the artificial economy that they control.
[18:07.120 --> 18:13.680]  That's feudalism. That's human management, 101, carried out in every culture since agrarian
[18:13.680 --> 18:24.000]  societies formed 7,000 years ago. But in the process of trying to bring in this planetary
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.560]  government based on destabilization, the elite endanger themselves. And you see elites,
[18:30.560 --> 18:36.400]  whether it was Julius Caesar going a bridge too far, Adolf Hitler going too far, the
[18:36.400 --> 18:46.480]  Communist going too far, every other group gets, take the example of what was it, Chile attacking
[18:47.120 --> 18:52.320]  the British and the Falklands going too far, thinking they could win. So it goes both ways.
[18:57.440 --> 19:02.080]  In this destabilization, the elites end up destroying themselves.
[19:02.080 --> 19:09.520]  Coming up, economists, government preparing to seize 401k pensions, Supreme Court ruling sets the
[19:09.520 --> 19:13.520]  stage for economic totalitarianism. We'll cover that first when we come back then.
[19:14.480 --> 19:22.240]  Senior NATO official will probably be at war this summer. If we're lucky, it won't be nuclear.
[19:22.240 --> 19:28.880]  Infowars.com, another headline, 2015 predictions, World War 3 can be inevitable as Russia leads
[19:28.880 --> 19:36.080]  world into new kind of conflict. Another headline, Russian air defense units redeployed amid
[19:36.080 --> 19:41.920]  snap combat readiness drills. Another report, terrorist nuke attack may be carried out inside
[19:41.920 --> 19:46.640]  the United States in the next 12 months. That's just some of what's coming up today.
[19:48.240 --> 19:53.040]  Rand Paul says Obama's disingenuous, says he can stop Tennessee spying anytime he wants.
[19:53.040 --> 19:59.200]  And the floods in Texas, mass shootings in Baltimore as the police stand down. Stay with us.

[21:06.880 --> 21:12.560]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.320]  children are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.600]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist
[21:23.600 --> 21:28.480]  concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[21:28.480 --> 21:33.040]  psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest
[21:33.040 --> 21:37.680]  quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer
[21:37.680 --> 21:41.680]  and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and
[21:41.680 --> 21:47.280]  powerful calming formula out there. Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like
[21:47.280 --> 21:53.040]  chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great. Obtain your Child Ease today

[21:59.280 --> 22:03.600]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able
[22:03.600 --> 22:08.480]  to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body. As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues
[22:08.480 --> 22:12.960]  will shrink and you'll become wrinkled. An older person will typically injure more easily and heal
[22:12.960 --> 22:18.800]  more slowly. Not fun. However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb,
[22:18.800 --> 22:23.440]  then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[22:23.440 --> 22:28.560]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[22:28.560 --> 22:34.240]  My name is Errol. I'm 74 years old. You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing. I play
[22:34.240 --> 22:39.360]  pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy
[22:39.360 --> 22:44.400]  and recover faster from my working out. I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder,
[22:44.400 --> 22:54.400]  but now I'm getting much better results using One World Way. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325

[24:11.360 --> 24:18.160]  The entire world is descending into economic, social, military conflict.
[24:18.160 --> 24:24.960]  And you notice ahead of all this happening, central governments, especially here in the West,
[24:26.640 --> 24:32.960]  began to prepare for this the last 15 years very intensely. The Army reports, the British
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.120]  Ministry of Defense reports, talked about a road warrior scenario in most areas of the world,
[24:39.120 --> 24:48.880]  out of which a global centralized government will rise as the answer to the chaos, which they
[24:48.880 --> 25:04.560]  themselves have instituted by creating artificial scarcity. And then mainstream media sits there
[25:04.560 --> 25:12.720]  and tells the public there's no such thing as corruption, there's no such thing as centralized
[25:12.720 --> 25:19.120]  power being a danger, there's never been a slouch in history, a gravitational pull towards
[25:19.120 --> 25:24.800]  tyranny, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, don't get prepared, don't get prepared.
[25:26.640 --> 25:33.840]  With countless TV shows, stereotyping preppers so that they could grab the audience while
[25:33.840 --> 25:43.280]  demonizing it, while the establishment itself digs in. And here are the headlines,
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.480]  economists, government preparing to seize 401k pensions, Supreme Court ruling,
[25:48.480 --> 25:54.800]  set stage for economic totalitarianism, close quote. Economist Martin Armstrong, very respected,
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.320]  warns that the Supreme Court ruling last week to set the stage for the federal government to
[25:58.320 --> 26:05.600]  begin seizing private pension funds. According to Armstrong, the outcome of Tybalt versus Edison,
[26:06.320 --> 26:11.120]  which found that employees have a duty to protect their 401k plans for mutual funds
[26:11.120 --> 26:16.400]  that perform poorly will grease the skids for the feds to seize private funds and prosecute
[26:16.400 --> 26:22.080]  companies who manage mutual funds, quote, badly. That's right. Just like Obama's federalizing
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.440]  police, the name of fixing them, which only makes it worse. And then Al Sharpe that admits
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.400]  that's the plan. Between the court ruling and the Obama administration's push for stronger
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.760]  fiduciary rules, the developments send a strong message to governments can much easier seize
[26:37.760 --> 26:43.840]  the pension fund management industry, of course, to protect the consumer, close quote, writes Armstrong.
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.840]  Well, they've been making those changes for years. And again, this is what the very same
[26:49.840 --> 26:57.200]  globalist that run our country have done everywhere else. So it'd be like if you were cows and
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.120]  going down a processing line at a slaughterhouse, and if you were smart,
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.680]  and you weren't a cow, you would see the cow ahead of you with a big gas bolt coming down,
[27:09.680 --> 27:15.360]  air powered bolt slamming down in the head and knocking your brains out. And then big old chains
[27:15.360 --> 27:21.520]  dragging up around your legs and hauling you up to get your guts cut out. So we watch them do this
[27:21.520 --> 27:29.520]  in Brazil and Nigeria and Greece and everywhere else. And we're kind of coming up the line here,
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.680]  watching the country be butchered. And I'm saying we don't want to keep going on that line.
[27:35.680 --> 27:38.000]  Four or five more cows go through, we're up next.
[27:38.000 --> 27:50.560]  And cows do get upset. I mean, they, they bray and they move and they kick and they hurt each other.
[27:51.760 --> 27:55.440]  One of them breaks their legs, they'll just got chains that lower down and wrap around them
[27:55.440 --> 28:02.240]  and grab them and drag it on up. That's the humane way with the big gas powered hammer,
[28:02.240 --> 28:08.320]  Thor's hammer. A lot of times they just put them in a big neck squeeze and a giant guillotine
[28:09.520 --> 28:12.320]  comes from the bottom and just goes up to the throat.
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.040]  And I've just watched the New World Order do this all over the world, feeding and praying on
[28:19.040 --> 28:26.320]  populations and shutting off their food and then sending in the U.N. with some grain for photo ops
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.160]  when it's the U.N. itself that cuts off the food and then takes the property.
[28:30.160 --> 28:36.080]  And then all the young girls, all the young wannabe supermodels, they go out to the mall and
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.800]  raise money for UNICEF, the children. The children that survive are taken to slave brothels.
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.560]  But again, those girls don't want to know how to really help children. It's just better to feel good
[28:46.560 --> 28:52.240]  and wear a World Wildlife Fund shirt or who actually run the controlled hunts than been caught doing it.
[28:52.240 --> 29:01.120]  It's all about just feeling like you did good. Here's another report where they're already doing it.
[29:02.480 --> 29:09.760]  AP reports, grease moles levy on undeclared deposits to raise cash.
[29:11.200 --> 29:20.160]  Grease is considering a clawback or a bail-in, a 15% levy on undeclared foreign deposits
[29:20.160 --> 29:23.280]  and double the rate on declared deposits in domestic banks
[29:24.080 --> 29:27.280]  as the epicenter for tax dodgers to legal assets.
[29:29.520 --> 29:31.920]  Of course. And then first they announced that in
[29:34.720 --> 29:39.360]  some of the other countries they've done it in, like Cyprus. And then soon it's just the whole
[29:39.360 --> 29:44.240]  country you get to have 40% taken out. Oh, and then another 20. And then, oh,
[29:44.960 --> 29:48.800]  this is the global standard and it's coming here. They'll be back. Stay with us.
[29:48.800 --> 29:55.520]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.600 --> 30:04.960]  Wherever children can be found having good, clean fun, you can rest assure there's a control
[30:04.960 --> 30:09.920]  frig not far behind trying to ruin their childhood. As was the case in Pennsylvania,
[30:09.920 --> 30:14.640]  where a teen was ordered to tear down a treehouse because their neighbor complained.
[30:14.640 --> 30:19.120]  At first, I thought it was a joke. But then I found out it wasn't, the teen said,
[30:19.120 --> 30:25.520]  according to local reports. So then I got really sad. And it is sad. People complain that teens
[30:25.520 --> 30:30.640]  spend too much time in front of their cell phones and video games. But when they go out and actually
[30:30.640 --> 30:36.720]  have physical activity, some people find that to be unacceptable. This was echoed earlier this year
[30:36.720 --> 30:41.120]  when a family was forced to remove a cardboard fort from their own front yard.
[30:41.120 --> 30:45.840]  I had worn positive memories from my childhood about forts and thought it was a great way to
[30:45.840 --> 30:52.160]  spark imaginations away from the TV, the father said. But no, that also was unacceptable.

[33:31.600 --> 33:37.440]  We've got Joe Biggs back in Cleveland with the verdict on the police officer and there have
[33:37.440 --> 33:43.440]  been demonstrations, there have been hundreds of arrests, a 71 night, something like a hundred
[33:43.440 --> 33:50.000]  something another night and more numbers are beginning to come out on that front. What I
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  really want to talk to Joe Biggs about who's in the middle of a demonstration right now here in
[33:54.000 --> 34:02.240]  just a moment is where he was just a few weeks ago. Baltimore's bloodshed continues 29 shot
[34:02.960 --> 34:09.120]  nine dead over holiday weekend and not by the police. Most of it black on black violence.
[34:10.480 --> 34:17.840]  Same thing in south side of Chicago 12 dead 43 wounded in shootings across Chicago over holly
[34:17.840 --> 34:28.800]  holiday weekend and it just goes on from there. Meanwhile, not only do we see the very same
[34:28.800 --> 34:40.320]  globalist banksters running around preparing to claw back and quote loot and have bail ins and
[34:40.320 --> 34:48.000]  basically rob private after tax bank accounts. You name it in places like Greece and moving
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.200]  towards our pension funds and Obama wanting to tax in a state of the union education funds
[34:57.440 --> 35:05.120]  and talking about tax increases via executive action outside of law. We have this headline
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.120]  of the London Telegraph. Now it's alarmist when we say this a year ago or six months ago but it's
[35:11.120 --> 35:19.040]  not when mainstream media does. US China war inevitable unless Washington drops demands over
[35:19.040 --> 35:24.880]  South China Sea warning from state run China newspaper as Beijing reveals plans for the
[35:24.880 --> 35:34.000]  development of disputed South China Sea islands which is right out in the middle of the ocean folks
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.440]  and is a huge power grab as they prepare to take over all that trade coming through from Japan
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.840]  and South Korea. It is very provocative and our government has helped build them up and helped
[35:45.840 --> 35:49.920]  give them everything and George Soros says it's going to cause World War three if we don't let
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.520]  them have what they want because he's so heavily sold out to the communist Chinese.
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.960]  Senior NATO official will probably be at war this summer if we're lucky it won't be nuclear.
[36:00.960 --> 36:08.880]  Is that the bad feeling I have? Russia's air defense units deployed amid snap combat readiness
[36:08.880 --> 36:15.120]  drills. Another report terrorist nuke attack may be carried out inside the United States
[36:15.120 --> 36:17.040]  in the next 12 months we're going to break that down.
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.560]  And there are real preparations on a planetary scale global currencies are on the verge of
[36:24.560 --> 36:31.680]  imploding. Unrest is increasing all over the world as inflation begins to hit on top of
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.400]  depressionary activities in the real economy but still there's such exponential increase in the
[36:38.400 --> 36:44.320]  volume of money that you have this perfect storm of artificiality that isn't supposed to be able
[36:44.320 --> 36:52.640]  to exist under really any economic model. Not Keynesian not Austrian school none of the quote
[36:52.640 --> 36:58.560]  free market so-called systems where you can have stag inflation which they said was impossible
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.600]  until the 70s. Now we're moving towards hyper stag inflation a word I invented a decade ago
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.560]  to describe you have stagnation in the economy with inflation on top of it.
[37:13.280 --> 37:18.000]  And that's exactly what we're starting to see raise its head. So you have wars erupting
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.320]  when governments are too greedy consolidating power the special interests are detached from
[37:24.320 --> 37:30.000]  reality filthy rich and you've got an elite in Russia that won't back down elite in China won't
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.400]  back down an elite over here won't back down all moving quickly towards conflicts so we're
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.760]  going to be breaking that down as well. Now Joe Biggs joins us from Cleveland Ohio
[37:41.760 --> 37:48.640]  where we have a whole bunch of churches together I believe the number is 40 you'll correct me if
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.600]  I'm wrong marching so they don't like living in a police state undoubtedly they do live in
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.320]  a police state to a certain extent but it's also part of the breakdown of society again which is
[37:58.320 --> 38:06.640]  the plan but we have the police standing down in Chicago which is democratic run and in Baltimore
[38:06.640 --> 38:12.400]  Maryland was democratic run I mean you're in the black run Democrat cities especially in Baltimore
[38:13.440 --> 38:21.280]  and still the white person is blamed as a total red herring but there are legitimate issues
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.080]  obviously to demonstrate against so we're going to get Joe Biggs take on this who's been there
[38:26.080 --> 38:32.320]  for two days during the demonstrations and the arrest uh Joe Biggs joining us. Joe Biggs here
[38:32.320 --> 38:39.680]  with info wars.com I'm marching down Lakeside Avenue in downtown Cleveland and as you can see
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.640]  there's 40 different congregation 40 different church congregations behind me right now a lot
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.480]  of people saying that they're here walking hand in hand they went to the justice center first
[38:48.480 --> 38:53.040]  asking for justice and now they've gone to town hall and we're just going to continue going
[38:53.040 --> 38:56.880]  through all of Cleveland people are coming out from all the businesses looking trying to see
[38:56.880 --> 39:02.080]  what's going on you know yesterday nothing really went on a memorial day a lot of people were kind
[39:02.080 --> 39:06.320]  of scared to come out they didn't know what was going to happen there's a large rib cook off of
[39:06.320 --> 39:11.520]  end that happens in Cleveland every year and it's sold out every year this is the first year it has
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.280]  not been and no one really came because of the fears of riots possibly happening so now people
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.920]  out here trying to calm down the crowds and the citizens of Cleveland let them know that Cleveland's
[39:21.920 --> 39:29.440]  bigger than Baltimore and bigger than Ferguson. Continue Joe. Well I was hearing you talk about
[39:29.440 --> 39:35.440]  the uh the killings in Baltimore I mean that's something that you kind of expect happening
[39:35.440 --> 39:42.160]  after all these riots it's it's sad that that's happening there and then where else it was uh
[39:42.160 --> 39:48.560]  it was Baltimore and Chicago everywhere Chicago yeah Chicago I mean killings everywhere the floods
[39:48.560 --> 39:55.280]  in Texas I mean this has been a horrible weekend sorry I'm trying not to hit some people that were
[39:55.280 --> 40:01.920]  walking behind me. Describe for radio listeners what TV viewers are saying Joe. Right now there's
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.360]  probably I'd say 2,000 people uh from different church congregations different religions uh
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.240]  Christian Jewish everyone out here in the front all the church leaders are in the front right now
[40:12.240 --> 40:17.040]  holding hands and leading everyone in song and as you can see there's just people coming out from
[40:17.040 --> 40:21.840]  all the different businesses taking pictures trying to see what's going on I think it'll be good for
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.480]  Cleveland to see this right here because you can't walk down the road and not hear someone talk about
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.960]  the the Brillo verdict or what's gonna happen is this gonna be the next Ferguson will be this
[40:30.960 --> 40:34.800]  will this be the next Baltimore. What do you think of that verdict with the cop jumping on the hood
[40:34.800 --> 40:43.280]  of the car and unloading into the two guys killing them? I it's so I just I almost like choked on
[40:43.280 --> 40:49.600]  my food when I heard them read the verdict that the judge can justify a police officer jumping
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.600]  on the hood of his car and then shooting then jumping from his car onto the hood of the suspects
[40:55.600 --> 41:02.400]  and then firing 15 rounds in I mean that is that's out of this world to know that that a judge found
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.760]  that justified and that the sword that they're using is the fact that officer Brillo was scared
[41:07.760 --> 41:12.480]  that if he was out of his car that the uh the two suspects would have driven in their car into him
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.280]  and pinned him against the vehicle so that's why he jumped on the hood of his car and then over
[41:17.280 --> 41:22.080]  onto the suspects car and even in the middle of shooting into the windshield he had to reload
[41:22.080 --> 41:28.320]  so I mean that's a sadistic thing to do. Sure well Anthony Gutiarty was out covering the Monsanto
[41:28.320 --> 41:34.560]  rally and he talked to the state police there and then he also talked to an awesome police officer
[41:35.600 --> 41:41.200]  when he was covering the march down the road and the police officer said I like Alex's show
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.200]  but I get asked by the people in department is the Alex Jones radio show is info wars pro cop
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.360]  or anti cop and so I'm going to break that down here briefly Joe for the listeners and the viewers
[41:53.360 --> 41:59.680]  out there we're pro-justice we take things case by case example we don't just mindlessly hate the
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.720]  police and want a civil war and always just blame the police at the same time we have a
[42:04.720 --> 42:11.920]  centralization of power we have the police more and more being above the law especially in some
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.960]  of these corrupt jurisdictions that's creating anger that's creating a sense of injustice
[42:16.960 --> 42:21.760]  and then you've got George Soros and the justice department trying to make that escape goat for
[42:21.760 --> 42:28.800]  the overall corruption to create destabilization to bring in basically a permanent civil emergency
[42:28.800 --> 42:35.120]  in this country a form of martial law so that's where we stand on the police but we just don't
[42:35.120 --> 42:42.320]  inherently hate the police we want to reform the police and the entire government and reform our
[42:42.320 --> 42:48.080]  own communities and our own selves we are a fallen corrupt decadent slob like nation
[42:48.080 --> 42:53.440]  compared to what we were we need to admit that like and like an alcoholic before we can turn this
[42:53.440 --> 42:58.880]  around what's your take job eggs exactly and i get asked that same question almost every time i go
[42:58.880 --> 43:02.320]  one of these trips you know a lot of people were like why do you guys hate police officers or things
[43:02.320 --> 43:06.640]  like that i was like i don't hate them at all what i do is i back up whoever's in the right if the
[43:06.640 --> 43:10.800]  protesters are in the right i'll point that out if the police are in the wrong i'll point that out
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.000]  if the police are in the right i will point that out when we're in ferguson in august we had
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.640]  the police were completely out of control shooting at reporters shooting at people for no reason putting
[43:22.640 --> 43:29.360]  lasers like the sniper rifles on people's heads on you they were sent yeah on me on jacari on protesters
[43:29.360 --> 43:34.320]  on old people children it was out of control and i was completely against the actions by the police
[43:34.320 --> 43:40.080]  officers but then we went back in november and the protesters were out of control but the police
[43:40.080 --> 43:43.760]  officers kept their cool it seemed like they learned a little bit more from that and these
[43:43.760 --> 43:47.920]  these people were out there shooting at the fire departments shooting at the firefighters who were
[43:47.920 --> 43:53.360]  simply trying to you know put out these fires to save the businesses for the people so like you said
[43:53.360 --> 43:56.960]  we're in the we're on the side of whoever's doing the right thing and that's what we're trying to
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.800]  support that's what we're trying to exactly the world and as society degenerates joe as society
[44:02.800 --> 44:09.760]  degenerates it's going to be coke versus pepsi ford versus chevy uh cowboys versus the steelers
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.880]  just mindless boil it down to which side you're on that's what the globalist want we need to be
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.240]  together for sovereignty against the globalist takeover did you hear all this news that they're
[44:20.240 --> 44:24.880]  moving around the world to just take part of people's bank accounts to give to private banks
[44:24.880 --> 44:30.000]  and that they're preparing to move towards going after pension funds while openly admitting nuclear
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.560]  war could break out and that we're accelerated towards armed conflict with china and russia
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.760]  and then george soros who's behind a lot of it has the nerve to get up on tv and say we're all in
[44:39.760 --> 44:46.000]  danger of world war three yeah and he's the one that's funding it it's his money it's his dollars
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.400]  that are starting all these uprisings i mean that that bad feeling you've been saying that you've
[44:50.400 --> 44:54.960]  had you know you've had for the past week or so you know i hope that god that that's not what it is
[44:54.960 --> 45:00.720]  because that's one thing we do not need right now is an all out nuclear war well everybody i've been
[45:00.720 --> 45:06.560]  talking to uh basically you know has the same feeling of real concern i think it's just everything
[45:06.560 --> 45:11.760]  we're seeing happening we know things are getting worse we know things are degenerating we know there
[45:11.760 --> 45:17.200]  are people that are going to try to capitalize uh on making things even worse than posing as saviors
[45:17.200 --> 45:23.680]  and it's just that six cents saying gear up get ready watch your six uh joe it looks like you've
[45:23.680 --> 45:29.280]  now arrived at the final destination looks like a pretty big crowd there uh pan the camera around
[45:29.280 --> 45:34.640]  there please and then tell us on uh for radio listeners what you're seeing all right so you've
[45:34.640 --> 45:41.040]  got a few thousand uh about a thousand five hundred people or so we're right outside of the cleveland
[45:41.600 --> 45:50.480]  city hall and it's on lakeside uh drive so everyone out here is basically voicing their
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.600]  opinions about how cleveland needs to be calm they need to let the system work but then you have a lot
[45:55.600 --> 46:02.080]  of people in the crowd saying hey the system isn't working there's no justice in america so you know
[46:02.080 --> 46:07.840]  a lot of people are voicing their opinions on what's going on meanwhile being peaceful the police have a
[46:07.840 --> 46:12.640]  much uh they don't have a defensive posture today you know they're further back they're spaced out
[46:12.640 --> 46:18.720]  they're giving people the uh the right to protest peacefully so i mean that's good that's a step up
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.640]  unlike what we saw in baltimore where they're driving around in humvees and helicopters four or five
[46:24.640 --> 46:30.640]  helicopters in the sky you know cleveland's definitely being a good representation of how
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.480]  you should deal with something like this well if you have police that become above the law when they
[46:36.480 --> 46:41.440]  do bad things it will end up bringing down the entire legitimate state system and we'll and then
[46:41.440 --> 46:46.160]  we'll give rise to the federalization of the system itself controlled by globalist and that's
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.840]  exactly what soros and holder and al sharpton are pushing and they've told us that's what they're
[46:51.840 --> 46:57.200]  doing here's al sharpton two weeks ago we've been frightened of all over the country which is why
[46:57.200 --> 47:02.400]  we're going to do this march from here to uh washington we need the justice department to step
[47:02.400 --> 47:07.440]  then and take over the police in this country in the 20th century they had to fight states rights
[47:07.440 --> 47:13.200]  and to get the right to vote we got to fight states rights in terms of closing down police cases
[47:13.200 --> 47:18.320]  police must be held accountable i don't think all police are bad i don't even think most of that
[47:18.320 --> 47:24.880]  but those are i need to be held okay so because there's some bad people then everyone has to lose
[47:24.880 --> 47:30.720]  their rights why do we even have states al sharpton i mean if it's a black run city like baltimore
[47:30.720 --> 47:37.040]  chicago partially black run uh you know areas like cleveland a major you know african-american
[47:37.040 --> 47:45.920]  representation how on earth do you then in democrat black cities blame whitey okay i mean it's a
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.520]  problem system wide uh out of control militarized cops shoot white people hispanics all the time the
[47:51.520 --> 47:58.880]  numbers show that uh sheriff clark's broken those numbers down uh and again the whole world is not
[47:58.880 --> 48:05.440]  orbit around a few hundred maximum black men being questionably killed every year and i'm sad it
[48:05.440 --> 48:13.440]  happens but when evil vicious villains like al sharpton and george soros are obsessing on it you
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.960]  know it's bad they use grievances in ukraine a year and a half ago to bring that government down and
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.520]  lead us to the edge of world war three they use grievances to put the muslim brotherhood in charge
[48:24.240 --> 48:31.200]  of areas like libya and egypt to commit giant mass murder they're taking us somewhere worse
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.560]  what is it people don't understand if a nazi collaborator that wants our guns and hates
[48:36.560 --> 48:43.840]  liberty is funding uh and and busing hoodlums in to attack the police it's being done to destroy
[48:43.840 --> 48:51.360]  the first amendment and create a diversion for obama joe begs exactly i mean al sharpton is
[48:51.360 --> 48:56.160]  planning on being here uh friday i believe alex and a lot of people are already kind of upset
[48:56.160 --> 48:59.760]  over that a lot of the people that i have talked to are sitting there saying like why is this guy
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.480]  going to come out here all that it ever does is start controversy all that does is bring out
[49:04.480 --> 49:10.080]  hating people because no one trusts them and then behind me you've got four uh of the commies from
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.880]  revcom out here those guys every time we see them something happens i mean can we go talk to the
[49:14.880 --> 49:20.640]  commies yeah let's let's talk to them why not no i think if it gets too hot we'll skip this
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.080]  number right we'll play it by ear just walking over the car if i talk to you so uh why are you
[49:26.080 --> 49:31.840]  out here today sir well i'm not i'm not i mean i unite with what's going on you unite with what's
[49:31.840 --> 49:42.960]  going on but what are you uniting with so uh hold on so what do we do i'm not really i don't
[49:42.960 --> 49:48.400]  want to represent the march tell him as an individual what he stands for as an individual
[49:48.400 --> 49:54.720]  what are you with i'm with info wars info wars info wars we're a website and uh we do a radio
[49:54.720 --> 50:02.960]  show a nightly news proud of austin texas asking what should be done so what should be done do you
[50:02.960 --> 50:07.280]  think to stop a lot of this stuff from happening well actually may uh dramatic mass action is what
[50:07.280 --> 50:15.200]  has to be done uh to say we will stop police murder of black and brown people and we're not for
[50:15.200 --> 50:19.600]  walking through the courts and all that we'll you know we got people arrested and we're gonna
[50:19.600 --> 50:25.280]  fight that we want those car charges dropped from saturday seventy seventy one to seventy seven
[50:25.280 --> 50:29.840]  were arrested has it been released yet yeah they've been released but they got charges and we're
[50:29.840 --> 50:36.480]  saying no charge drop those charges this is legitimate to say no to police murder this case
[50:36.480 --> 50:41.200]  of timothy and melissa the guy he doesn't even get manslaughter so they want to get mass movement
[50:41.200 --> 50:47.040]  to the street ask about his organization we will kill with impunity and continue to so what organization
[50:47.040 --> 50:52.560]  are you with sir i'm with the uh stop mass incarceration network what is the revolution
[50:52.560 --> 50:58.720]  what is this what's the revolutionary uh revcom what's rev com rev com is a website of the
[50:58.720 --> 51:05.040]  revolution uh revolutionary communism dot com asking what communism stands for what's communism
[51:05.040 --> 51:10.640]  stand for liberation liberation absolutely asking me things a liberation is about to happen
[51:10.640 --> 51:15.920]  that was a liberating liberation is going to happen i think at some point it will
[51:15.920 --> 51:21.760]  but it's not inevitable can't say it's going to just happen so you want people to get out
[51:21.760 --> 51:25.840]  mass numbers and move through the streets and does he think this summer can be the beginning of it
[51:25.840 --> 51:29.680]  okay do you think this summer could be the beginning of a mass movement it already is
[51:29.680 --> 51:33.280]  it already is it already is yeah that's it first and started it fergus has started it
[51:33.280 --> 51:37.760]  boulder more george soros when i was in fergus and i saw you guys out there oh yeah and uh
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.040]  you were the ones i saw a lot of you guys with molotov cocktails i thought that was pretty
[51:41.040 --> 51:46.640]  interesting yeah your bullshit no delete that that's all you guys believe that you were uh getting
[51:46.640 --> 51:54.800]  kids riled up joe joe you know again again here's what's happening you've got the mega elite that
[51:54.800 --> 52:00.560]  are tax exempt like george soros funding this because they believe this summer is their time
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.440]  to have mass revolution and then obama will use that to come in and take over this is cloward
[52:05.440 --> 52:10.800]  and piven this is their plan so separating the problems with police good lord we wrote the book
[52:10.800 --> 52:16.960]  on trying to stop this from happening this is a classic communist takeover plan except they won't
[52:16.960 --> 52:22.800]  put the communists in in the end they'll just bring in basically a multinational un stabilization
[52:22.800 --> 52:28.320]  force and just bring us under corporate fascism job it's the same thing with isis and taliban
[52:28.320 --> 52:32.000]  they go out they look for these young impressionable minds they get them amped up they spew the
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.320]  rhetoric towards them they you know they give them a microphone they give them a position
[52:36.320 --> 52:40.800]  to where they feel like they have power they have a a position to make a difference and have some
[52:40.800 --> 52:44.880]  kind of change and then they put them in the line of fire and let them die that's what happened
[52:44.880 --> 52:50.880]  overseas with these guys you got these revcom guys who go up to these young impressionable minds
[52:50.880 --> 52:55.120]  these young black men they get them amped up they got they start spewing forth their rhetoric
[52:55.120 --> 52:59.280]  then they go hey man you're angry you're angry why don't you take this uh this bullhorn why don't
[52:59.280 --> 53:04.080]  you tell the police to go f off why don't you go do this and that you know and then they hand over
[53:04.080 --> 53:07.840]  that mall talk hey man come on this will make a difference don't you want the revolution and you
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.480]  were out there in the pitch black was having but you said you saw yourself people with revco
[53:12.480 --> 53:16.240]  buttons a communist revolution that they were the ones handing out the mall ops
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.520]  yeah i mean i even went to the police officers and i said hey look these are right here on the
[53:23.520 --> 53:27.520]  ground we spotted them is there anything you guys want to do about it they didn't do anything they
[53:27.520 --> 53:32.320]  ignored my uh you know my warning i showed them where it was and they just went off about their

[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:21.680]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.600]  joe biggs reporting from playland ohio and it found a nest of communist brigade
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:43.120]  they engage in their normal rat like behavior gosh you think about how all these billionaires
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.160]  and all these people promote communism and supposedly sexy and cool and then you get around
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.840]  them or you actually read the writings of shea guavara who was a basically like a white supremacist
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:06.000]  he hated the indians the natives i call them retarded dumb that they needed to all be killed
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.600]  and then you see people that are obviously mezzo-american
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.600]  native american from from south of the border wearing shea guavara shirts and he just can't
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.880]  help them they might as well be wearing an adolf hitler shirt
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.760]  of course the nazis really didn't have a big beef with people in latin america that's actually
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:34.160]  where they all ran to i'm just there's nothing nastier and more elitist than a communist i
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:41.440]  i've been around i've seen it all folks and they are the scum of the earth just the the most
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:54.080]  misgrant underhanded sneaky deceptive dishonorable lying cheating venomous ugly rat like stinking
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:01.920]  parasitic maggots the world has ever produced and they're just growing with unlimited billions
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.640]  funding them like weevils getting into the flower or something in your pantry they are just infesting
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.240]  everything and creating class warfare while megabanks fund them why because the megabanks
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.920]  all want us fighting with each other because there's unlimited wealth under free market
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:24.480]  if you're willing to just do basic jobs and work free market just builds total wealth
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:32.000]  the problem is it creates decadence and then the commies move in the problem is capitalism works
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  too good it produces too much and people get lazy and then they basically wake up mindless thugs on
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.040]  the continent that their forebears built and then their children just turn into total spoiled rotten
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:59.200]  scum and then we fall while they complain about the fact that they can get a hundred flavors of
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.400]  ice cream while they complain that they can have all this shelter for such low prices while they
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.960]  complain because somebody else has got a nicer car than them or somebody else is a big house
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:16.240]  don't you understand wealth produces wealth when it's spent and used in the economy the globalists
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:22.400]  create trillions and trillions and then hoard it all and hold it as an economic weight a ball and
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:31.920]  chain to enslave us and to siphon off our wealth bag oh my gosh i am just i am just so sick of these
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:38.160]  bags of pus let's go back to joe bags joe bags joining us his feed cut out they're in cleveland

[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.080]  i was and decided to leave he said he would have never spoken with me if he knew i was gonna spew
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:56.560]  for such anti-communism rhetoric why don't you love communism joe because it's stupid
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.440]  especially these guys man all they all they care about is destruction they don't care about anything
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.520]  whatsoever i've been around commies when when you have a drink whether they go look we're gonna kill

[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:20.320]  and you're like but but what comes he goes killing so it's really a devil cult joe yeah exactly i mean
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:26.160]  that's why the their their followers look like vampires all right we're gonna check in with you
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.800]  again you're following a lot of great reports to info wars dot com we're putting them on facebook

[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.600]  win i'm pretty sure things will get crazy especially if there's protesters out a lot of the uh protesters
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.720]  have been being booed by all these sports fans telling them hey get a life stop running our

[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:13.440]  these guys are corporate spokesmen they're not leaders i mean they both started illegal wars
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.120]  hell they both tortured people they bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.280]  they both violated the constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take i mean
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:31.200]  what will it take to finally wake you up think about it if joseph stallin ran for president as a
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:37.680]  democrat and adolf hitler ran as a republican one of them would end up leading our country
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:45.280]  its elephants and asses screwing the masses and your choice between the two parties is a myth
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:53.520]  because in reality it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology divide and conquer so join the revolution

[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:38.160]  and we are back live ladies and gentlemen i just walked into the studio a few seconds late because
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:45.920]  i was busy going over news articles as they develop and break i'm going to be honest with
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:56.240]  everybody i could spend the entire broadcast just on one article here in my stack but we don't
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.720]  have time to do that so i'm just going to go over all of it i've already mentioned some of this but
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:08.240]  it is so important to go into more detail us china war inevitable unless washington drops
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:16.480]  demands for south china sea that's the london telegraph we're going to be getting into that
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:24.640]  senior nato general will probably be at war senior nato official will probably be at war
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:33.520]  this summer if we're lucky it won't be nuclear russia's air defense units deployed amid snap
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.720]  combat readiness drills report terrorist attack may be carried out inside the united states in
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:51.680]  next 12 months and then a story that ties into this out of the wall street journal that i want to
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:10:04.880]  read over how islamic states win in ramani reveals new weapons and tactical sophistication and prowess
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.960]  our government wanted a weak iraq government put in a weak government armed and created this group
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.680]  with saudi arabia and others help and then turns around as the secretary of defense did
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:23.280]  did last week and criticizes the iraqi government that's like chopping your arms and legs off and
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:30.160]  saying hey get up off the floor weakling and when i talk about this the day after memorial day
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.600]  i'm not running down our troops that took part in this i had a lot of family that spent multiple
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.120]  tours in iraq and these are some of the best people you can imagine and they really wanted to
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.480]  build up iraq and make it a free state
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.920]  and they now basically realize that it was always from the beginning about making a failed state
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.120]  and breaking the country in three parts and they understand that what's happening in syria is
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.160]  premeditated as well so the general military down to the non-commissioned officers they know
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:11.360]  what's going on and it's the very same globalist that destabilized iraq they're destabilizing america
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.080]  and the rest of the world that the same people putting our trips on these do not treat lists that
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:26.800]  are a death warrant that are a death sentence and notice how that came out a year ago that they were
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.040]  putting them on lists not be treated and oh it was a mistake we're going to fix it in a year later
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:37.920]  they say oh it's still happening oh we still didn't fix it it'd be like if you got caught
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:42.000]  robbing fort nox and you're loading gold into trucks and the military shows up and you go
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.000]  i made a mistake and made a wrong left turn in here and
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.240]  gee i'm still screwing up loading gold bars uh can you give me directions sonny how to get out of
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:59.520]  here can you help me with this gold here thank you pick up some of this gold for me it's a confidence
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:07.360]  game and the very same globalist financial institutions that control the private central
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:13.760]  banks of the world created the derivatives created the fractional reserve banking created all this
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:22.000]  Ponzi scheme garbage this counterfeiting pyramid and then there are the ones going the west is
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.280]  going bankrupt we better raise taxes and take over pension funds bank heads call for ending cash and
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:38.560]  taking part of your deposit banks want to charge you to have a deposit all these announcements are
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.600]  being made right now the supreme court's ruling that the government could take over pension funds
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.960]  every few days i see major cities signing deals with the feds you know when one of their cops does
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:13:00.800]  something wrong to be federalized so they won't get in trouble anymore we're being taken over
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.360]  there's an excellent article breaking that down at info wars.com
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.840]  Obama usurps local police with fake ban on militarization and the day he gave a press
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.680]  conference a few weeks ago i said watch when details are released they're going to give them
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:23.600]  m reps body armor machine guns everything it'll just be under federal programs to get it now
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.920]  you'll have to go to the sensitivity training and you'll have to basically be federalized
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:34.480]  and sure enough that was announced it's not hard to know what they're going to do leopards don't
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:44.160]  change their spots ever and we told you it's about federalizing and al sharp has come out and said
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:55.200]  that and a lot of folks understand what i'm doing but a minority does not and by minority
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.160]  if you're public school educated like i was and a little bit ignorant i'm not talking about skin
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.720]  color i mean a minority of the massive people of every race color and creed are saying alex you
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.240]  went from exposing the police and making films about it and writing a book and harping on it
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.600]  to now zigging when we're zagging
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:25.840]  and are supporting the police and and that's not what i'm doing i'm supporting local government
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.120]  and state government not that it's perfect but the feds have been totally taken over
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.320]  it'd be like if dc surrendered to aliens and announced you know show up at the local
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.920]  sports stadium to be given your brain ship the quack quack who or whatever the aliens are called
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:49.200]  hypothetically you know common peace i would then say we've got to get control of our local
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:59.120]  governments to say no it's the same thing and what are the globalists doing they're trying to get us
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:06.880]  to fight with the locals so it's a vice grip effect with pressure from below pressure from above
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:13.040]  that's a communist tactic they're using communist tactics because it was wall street and london
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:22.160]  that openly funded the bolsheviks in 1917 that's declassified that's public that's a fact it was
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:29.360]  over 100 000 americans who spoke russian russian immigrants a lot of them jewish out of brooklyn
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:38.560]  other areas that were sent in to bring down the czar for three years they only had moscow folks
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.440]  but they got all the counties and cities the states all the different provinces there is what
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.360]  they were called to surrender a minority called white russians that just meant the color of the
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:57.760]  flag white for imperial refused and fought on for another decade and there's famous posters
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.280]  in russian showing the police and military handing their guns into the bolsheviks they then
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.280]  over the next 30 years basically killed every one of them most of them right away but over the
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:14.160]  years they just exterminate everybody this has been done before i am a lay historian i have i can
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.920]  have top historians on they completely agree with my analysis this is what's happening and we are in
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:29.600]  grave grave grave peril what i said in my four police state films what i said in my book on the
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:35.360]  police state to set into tyranny is everything that's now happened and i said we've got to keep
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.760]  the police local we can't let them be federalized these threat fusion centers then when they're
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:46.240]  given the paramilitary training the public will turn against them then the feds will come into
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:52.720]  the public and say we're going to federalize them don't worry we'll fix it classic problem reaction
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:17:03.360]  solution and all the films police state one through four are online with millions of views
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.040]  police state 2000 police state to the takeover police state three total enslavement police state
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.680]  for the rise of fema and man we ought to do a boil down from two and a half hours to ten minutes
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:20.640]  of police state for the rise of fema because it's all the clips the military training to take on
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.960]  veterans gun owners you name it that's the film i put out four years ago i mean it's got it all
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:31.520]  and then you watch that and then you see the news going there's no plan to go after patriots it's
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:40.480]  it's preposterous but just like they're turning islamic state loose later they will mop them up
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.800]  and only give them a small region but i've been saying that now for a couple years under the

[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.360]  china war inevitable reads the headline that headlines all over the world news unless washington
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:51.600]  drops demands over south china sea warning from state one china newspaper as beijing
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.200]  reveals plans for development of disputed south china sea islands and we can pull up online those
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:03.680]  disputed what the pentagon calls sand castles where they're just going out into some of the
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.840]  areas that aren't that deep five ten feet deep and they're dredging up creating islands and
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:17.280]  militarizing them putting landing strips on them in one of the most busy if not the most busy
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:24.560]  areas of the ocean in the world claiming that it's found china and so for 12 miles around
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:30.400]  those it's chinese land so if u.s aircraft or anybody else flies over them now they're sending
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:37.120]  fighter planes up to say this is our area very provocative by the chai comps and we're stuck
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.120]  between a rock and a hard place we've got criminals that have basically made all of our
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:50.400]  investments in china sold us out now maneuvering our military that's completely exhausted and
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:58.480]  basically on the verge of implosion towards war with them and of course they're first building
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:03.920]  these a year ago they'd say we're not putting military there no we're not putting no we're
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:10.320]  not putting air bases no no no no no and then now they admit it these are our bases and we control
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:16.560]  the entire area and we may start taxing ships that drive through it's all lies and this is exactly
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.520]  what all the experts like admiral more former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who was a
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.520]  frequent guest until he died i don't know a decade ago he died about 14 years ago time flies
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:34.240]  and admiral more said we gave them Panama canal we've given them islands in the caribbean the
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:41.120]  chinese government's building there they get 96 percent of world rare earth minerals the globalists
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:46.160]  have double crossed america they've done everything to maneuver us into a position
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.480]  where we can't beat china meanwhile they don't want russia to ever get up on their knees they've
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:00.080]  been on their back russia is just trying to sustain itself saying men are strong families are good
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:09.520]  have children don't take drugs uh jesus loves you i'm not trusting putin but he is in rhetoric
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:18.080]  about 170 degrees different from obama he's on 180 i mean john bainer is about 20 degrees different
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:26.880]  from obama he's almost obama putin's about 180 degrees 170 degrees that's the 180s half
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.400]  it's about 170 degrees difference and and how do you juxtapose this paradox
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.960]  i'm telling you right now the main predator group into the future is the communist chinese
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.400]  ladies and gentlemen even though their economies on the verge of collapse that's another reason
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:48.000]  they're even more dangerous and our economies on the verge and the russian economies on the verge
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.680]  what happens historically when empires get on the verge of collapse they have wars so they can
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:29:00.800]  then have austerity and domestically cement their takeover in fact i think now is the time

[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:52.160]  and i've got to just tell it like i see it you have the globalists that are above the three
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.160]  major power groups but their main power came from the united states in england the vestiges
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.960]  the remnants of the old british empire combined with the new burgeoning american empire
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.840]  all under red white and blue and we have the soft power that we were more moral more free market
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:16.480]  more freedom than all the other nations and systems so you combine the physical power
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:24.720]  with the intellectual cultural superiority then undoubtedly the west in those respects was
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:31.360]  very superior to why the whole planet adopted it not even through conquest but through imitation
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:42.560]  now we are just basically satanic slobs totally decadent sitting on our thumbs on average not all
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:49.280]  of us i'm not on some high horse i'm decadent too so when i say that i'm speaking for myself
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:56.880]  but compared to some people it's just it's night and day the fact that americans don't even care or
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:03.760]  know how out of control stuff ish anthony gucciardi went out to the monsanto rally one of hundreds
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:11.040]  around the country and was a speaker there and he talked to something like 50 people
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:18.800]  and only a couple of americans of the 50 he talked to knew even what monsanto was
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.280]  every foreigner he talked to he told me and we've seen the report but every foreigner he talked to
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:33.120]  from mexico or from russia you name it knew exactly all about gmo all about monsanto all about
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:40.320]  everything and it's well known in international polls university exit studies high school exit
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.960]  polls that americans are the most geographically mathematically
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:57.680]  illiterate people there are whether it comes to reading writing arithmetic geopolitical facts
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:06.640]  political facts the average american does not know which end is up and advanced free media
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.960]  didn't tell them how to find their behinds they wouldn't be able to do it and i don't say that
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.400]  with pleasure this has been done by design and boy have the elite done a great job
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:27.280]  and then you notice who the globalists say their number one enemy is recent veterans veterans
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:38.320]  in order top enemy veterans returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians and then
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:43.760]  evangelical christians for some reason and i say that because most evangelicals i know are
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.880]  nice people but man are they going along with the tyranny and you notice there's a group in
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.920]  there i kept saying would soon be added and now finally has been local police and sheriffs
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.280]  are being harassed by the feds being indicted being
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:08.000]  sued like our pio not because they're bad there's certainly some that are but because
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.440]  that's another independent group that might become a focal point of political resistance
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:21.120]  of leadership the globalist fear leadership and they fear legitimate constitutional government
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:28.880]  standing up with the people's backing if you get a governor and you get much of a legislature
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.160]  with a million people in the streets of texas saying we want to secede the feds can't invade
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.760]  they can't stop that the feds would know that was coming and would blow up a federal building
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.360]  to blame it on the governor that tried that and to say supporters of the governor blew up the
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:54.240]  daycare center this is military moves were up against you've got to understand the moves
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:39:00.480]  they're going to play and listen i don't want texas to secede i'm a republican in that i'm
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:08.000]  for a republic not a republican little r i'm for republican big r as in george washington
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.040]  i believe in the federalist system it's beautiful we need a check on the states
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:24.720]  there is no check on the feds they've been captured it's gone we're wide open the entire pentagon
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:31.040]  preparation is to take out the states the states wouldn't even resist politically or physically
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:37.760]  currently what are they planning so horrible so draconian i've got full body chills right now
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.360]  when i and i know why people get scared and don't look into this
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:50.240]  because it's scary it's real when i fully focus on this and look at all the facts i get body chills
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.920]  the kind of chills i got growing up when for no reason you know some crazy guy
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.160]  busted into a party or whatever and started attacking people and i'd get chills that was
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:08.160]  just my body release and hormones and getting connected to all my cells getting my nerves
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:14.640]  firing to fight and when i talk about this i mean i start getting in a fighting mode folks because
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.680]  at a primitive level my body knows we're being overrun my body knows we're being conquered my
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:26.480]  body knows dangerous things are happening my brain analyzes it and even when i'm not consciously
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.400]  thinking about it i have a feeling of disquiet i'm upset i want to be involved to fight the tyranny
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:39.440]  and why is that because we're going to lose all of this prosperity all of this security all of this
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.880]  freedom right now i'm going to go to your phone calls joe john tom quarry chris and others told
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:51.760]  free number to join us 800 259 9231 first time callers in this first round of calls and we're
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.480]  mainly talking about the preparations for world war three that are in a bunch of newspapers
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:03.040]  china has vowed to step up presence in south china seeing a provocative new military white paper
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.720]  and its aimed warnings and amid warnings that the u.s china war is inevitable unless
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:14.880]  washington drops its objections to beijing's activities beijing can now claim any sand castle
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:23.680]  they build with a bunch of dredges is their territory and that they will enforce that china
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:30.160]  never had a claim to that area china has been talking about invading the philippines in a
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:37.600]  white paper two years ago i mean that is very aggressive now they want to replace the japanese
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:45.760]  as the aggressors huge article on the telegraph up on info wars dot com senior nato official will
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.880]  probably be at war this summer if we're lucky it won't be nuclear info wars dot com paul joseph
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:58.640]  watson a senior nato official told former nsa intelligence analyst john schindler that the
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:04.880]  world would probably be at war sometime this summer and schindler is a very respected nsa whistleblower
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.680]  will probably be at war this summer if we're lucky it won't be nuclear the official told schindler
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:23.360]  last week and schindler tweeted said a senior nato non-us go foe to me today will probably be
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:30.560]  at war this summer if we're lucky it won't be nuclear let that sink in although the tweet was
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.400]  retweeted over 400 times the comment garnered no mainstream media attention whatsoever which is odd
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.960]  given the fact that schindler is a former u.s navy war college lecture and is known to have many
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.760]  high-level military contacts although not specify the reference i want to get him on guys call and
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.800]  get him on today please work on it the reference was almost certainly in relation to growing tensions
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.320]  between the united states and russia one analyst of the comment suggests it may have been a deliberate
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.880]  leak from nato sources to emphasize how serious the situation is earlier this month nato launched its
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.240]  biggest ever war game exercise looks they've had the head nato generals on tv going we can take

[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.720]  earlier this month nato launched its biggest ever war game exercise on russia's doorstep
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.200]  mosca responded by conducting provocative war games and Mediterranean sea in coordination with the

[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:30.480]  the air hi alex welcome you know the the end run at all this has always been a world government or
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.520]  communism and basically they got the soviet system all set up in this in this country with the interface
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.440]  fine on everybody's phone calls and license plate readers and they got everything set up
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.120]  and we took free trade which is part of communist goals and used it to build china up from it was
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:48.000]  stuck in a bronze age under mile and made them go first grade superpower and what i think is
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.440]  going to happen is we're going to go to war we're going to lose the war they're going to bring
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.960]  communist occupation forces in here they set up war and all those idiots you see on the street
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.440]  and Austin you were facing off against we did the copper stars and at the first spot and every

[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:38.240]  republic and they're gearing up this summer to go crazy and i just say thank god for the second
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:46.000]  amendment because uh it's not going to go well if they pull this for the first few waves of trash

[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:30.720]  are hundreds of of gangland shootings every few days the cops are going to get paranoid scared
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.440]  outgun they're going to kill innocent people in the crossfire in the friendly fire it's going to
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.160]  happen you got a lot of thug cops as well they're going to make it worse and it's going to blow up
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:46.080]  you can really and the communists are wild eyed now they've gotten the word that this is their time
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.680]  i've been dealing with these people for 20-something years and i'm telling you the communists have a
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:58.480]  gleam in their eye they're making their move john communist goals the communist rules for
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.280]  our revolution and the planks of the communist manifesto has all been carried out just go up
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:07.440]  there and look at them you can search them on the web everything in there has been carried out on
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:12.800]  this country and uh fact that the bush all those neocons that bush had around them were all
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.280]  considered crossy eight communists i mean they've been controlled i mean they're in control go all
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.360]  the way up the floor and that's why they put in all the republican leaders like banner and others
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:28.480]  uh that's a minion of uh mr globalist newt genrich that will go along with everything
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.480]  for the for the street we're from people you face there in austin they go all the way up into the
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.320]  colleges in the local garden oh no we already know the handlers are high level the the handlers are
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:45.920]  high level ut taxes and foundations they go all the way up it's a big iceberg what you've seen
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:52.000]  with just a tiff of the iceberg alex it goes way bigger than that oh it was like a tip of a
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:59.760]  festering sir servile puss well i mean these people are sick i appreciate your call god bless you
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.560]  it is like the tip of a big rotting corpse uh you could smell the stench of death on those people
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:17.680]  too man just just over the top i kill my babies oh i'm i love satan i love being dirty i love it
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.200]  we're gonna red tear you giggling yeah you're gonna find out red tear as if those useful idiots will
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.920]  ever be part of any power structure and again it's not going to be a communist takeover let's get
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:34.960]  that straight the communists are going to be the detonators for civil unrest that's why communists
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.320]  always want to get rid of the death penalty as general parton taught me part of the communist
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:44.400]  takeover program is they want to be able to get their people out once they've taken over
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:48.400]  and they want to be able to not have charges on them when they kill cops and stuff
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:56.560]  that's why the police have got to prosecute bad cops they've got to not be federalized and realize
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.160]  the attack plan and then we have to stand with good departments when they're under federal attack
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:09.280]  because it's not federal it's globalist let's go ahead and talk to tom in canada on george soros
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.600]  tom you're on the year welcome i actually want to talk about uh the chinese government i mean
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:22.480]  any government that's just forcing abortions on the woman that's uh you know a little messed up so
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:30.320]  if uh u.s ends up going to war with china one day i mean it's possible man and that'd be crazy but
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.240]  you know look at your military budget six hundred and fifty billion a year something like that so
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:43.040]  i wouldn't be too worried about that um but also i want to talk to you about climate change i think
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:49.600]  you uh you're a smart guy but you got blind spot with climate change uh sea levels are probably
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:56.240]  going to start rising pretty dramatically in about 15 20 years and uh i know you got some good
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:02.480]  some good points about climate change and stuff and you know you know information about it but i
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.680]  still just don't really think you know what's totally going on with that and sure let me say this
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:16.080]  let me say this when the earth was warming until about a decade ago the ice caps of mars were melting
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:26.560]  too and then now they're growing again and al gore said the arctic would be gone by 2013 it's
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:33.760]  bigger than ever recorded by the satellites over and that's admitted but if the sea levels were
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:39.440]  going up the answer isn't paying al gore carbon taxes or obama or george soros who own the big
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.720]  carbon training facilities in london and chicago so that's my issue there i mean they're in the
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:51.200]  news saying flooding in texas uh is because of global warming we always go through cycles of
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.680]  flash flooding in central texas when i was in high school here it basically rained for a year
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:01.360]  straight almost and then it went into i mean it's just a cycle communist china freely allows the
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:06.160]  sale of bulletproof armor plates while our u.s politicians argue from banning americans from
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:12.080]  owning body armor does that sound right to you harm your american body at infidel body armor dot com

[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:24.960]  with a volunteer military that has by and large been a corporate globalist tool to secure resources
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:31.040]  for multinationals and then we end up holding the bill sometimes the war's legitimate sometimes it's
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:36.960]  not but in almost every case the economic gains we don't even see i mean if you're gonna have an
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:44.080]  empire at least have some of the spoils come back to the old system the homeland and i'm not
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.400]  endorsing an imperial system like the british empire but at least a lot of its spoils did come
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:55.760]  back to england back to what became the united kingdom nowadays we pay to take over iraq and
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:03.840]  break it up and the chinese government and the french government and others got the oil the
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:10.480]  french who weren't even part of it and the chinese you see the sick joke we can't even have that canadian
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:17.120]  oil it's being trained by warren buffett out to the coast of canada the west coast to be sent
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:27.920]  to china everything's being strategically done to shut us down and the pentagon's main enemy
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.080]  is its own veterans that should be a big wake-up call and i keep harping on that to point out
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:40.560]  we've been taken over if a foreign power took over your government who would their number one
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:48.400]  enemy be let me think the veterans oh yes because the government that's taken over the globalist
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.680]  system is going to do horrible things ladies and gentlemen like taking the pension funds
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:58.240]  and arresting political prisoners and they know it's going to get so bad veterans are going to
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:04.080]  get sick of it and will fight they'll have local police brainwashed and ready and federalized
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:11.440]  to then go after the local vets that will exhaust and break down local government and then later
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:18.640]  just like iraq was weakened and isis came in the un will come in with a multinational force
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.040]  under global receivership will be blamed for the global derivatives will be blamed for everything
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.000]  we're being set up for that and then we will be occupied and broken in a bunch of pieces
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.080]  as economic redevelopment zones under a north american union but it'll all be sold
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.680]  not as an invasion but as helpers communist china is going to build the new rail lines

[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.160]  on the air what do you think's happening with this massive acceleration towards war with china and
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:44.880]  russia a lot of this stuff's been saber rattling in the past for the military industrial complex but
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:49.920]  now they're making really provocative moves in ukraine the chinese are making super provocative
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:56.160]  moves towards the west what do you make of this hey alex first of all uh i'm a pastor here in
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:00.160]  southern illinois and i just want to thank you for your spiritual discernment all of this is
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:06.720]  happening um i think you know more than anybody else that uh there's a spiritual force behind this
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:12.480]  more than just what meets the eye so yes it is a evil force that wants us to kill each other
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.320]  right absolutely and uh i just want to say too that that you know i realize that there's a lot of
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.000]  my brother and brothers and sisters that are evangelicals that are becoming decadent just
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.320]  like everybody else but there still are some of us that are preaching the truth and see what's
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:31.280]  going on so answer my question why do you think evangelicals out of all the christian groups
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:36.400]  are being lumped in as terrorists i think because there are some of us that know i mean you know
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:40.880]  your history probably better than most people probably 90 of the people in the united states and
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:45.680]  one of the people that group people groups that the british feared the most were the preachers in
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:49.520]  fact they called them the black robe regiment because they could inspire people and stir the
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:54.880]  people up to realize that there is more than just uh filling your belly and being entertained there's
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.480]  more to life than that and i think that's why they're lumped in with some of that group and that's
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:03.520]  why they're being co-opted like every other group oh exactly i mean i like evangelicals i was brought
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:07.680]  up you know part of the time going to evangelical churches that and baptist churches and others
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:13.760]  but it's just at the same time i see so many evangelicals kind of a mainline now establishment
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.840]  name it and claim it they've been kind of compromised but i think it is the spirit of
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.720]  really evangelicals that threatens the system means the system is so devilish they hate that holy
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.000]  spirit absolutely you're 100 right there and i just want you know we're praying for you we're
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.160]  putting news articles in front of our congregation we're praying about stuff that's going on the
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:36.880]  world we're trying to wake people up to realize that what the bible said a lot of this stuff
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.040]  is falling right in line with it oh i mean if this doesn't get i mean look if this doesn't make
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:45.600]  people realize it's a spiritual war look at everything being manifest just as the bible said
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:50.640]  it would it is just so crazy god bless you good to hear from you mad max in north carolina thanks
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:58.080]  for holding her on the air then chris yeah i was hoping maybe you could get joe biggs to ask the
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:08.560]  kami agitators there whether or not they foresee or hope for a bolshevik style revolution in america
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:15.760]  and uh you know i remember seeing the movie red dawn when i was a teenager i think it came out in
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:22.400]  84 perhaps 85 and uh you know i didn't really you know was not i was very unsophisticated back
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.800]  then in my thinking but you know the only way you could really get away with something like that
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:34.400]  an invading force is to actually have uh traders you know we would have to have traders within our
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.840]  own government uh and throughout our own society in order for them to really be able to get away
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.320]  with that i think and of course i've learned over the years that we actually do have all those people
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:49.520]  in place oh we've got the local communists you know trying to say where i live and stuff they're
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.760]  so stupid they're saying other alex jones isn't about how you know i'm gonna you know have the
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.880]  red terror and all this and and so here's how this works all this stuff kicks off we all know
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:04.160]  who the enemy is it just comes down to that and we know they're coming for us yeah and i think
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:09.520]  they'll use the american forces uh under the american flag so far as uh they can uh get away
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:15.920]  with that and get the uh the american forces to go along they can uh supplement those with the uh
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.760]  the blue helmets you know the united nations forces under the uh blue flag and then uh
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:27.520]  you know i don't know it sounds kind of far fetch but uh i i could see them maybe possibly
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:32.000]  bringing uh you know millions of chinese hundreds of millions of chinese troops in
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:36.640]  anything flies now the government gets with everything you'd be racist if you weren't for
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.000]  you know chinese communist trips in your house uh i never used to believe that but i mean so many
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.320]  folks told me that was the plan that bent on the inside i would just roll my eyes and now
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.920]  you just see it all unfolding and the communists are lining up they're getting fired up they're
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:56.880]  getting ready they believe this summer is their time and it's all white house directed thank you mad
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:04.000]  max president obama has said in the past that we must find the proper balance between security of

[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:25.440]  president's feet to the fire appearing on cbs rand paul noted here's the thing about the president
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:30.560]  he's disingenuous about this the president started this program through executive order he could end
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:37.120]  it anytime the senator also noted that the nsa bulk collection was recently ruled illegal by a
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:43.840]  federal appellate panel why doesn't he stop it what's he waiting for mr paul said he says oh congress
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:49.360]  can stop it he started it on his own he should stop it and i've asked the president repeatedly
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:55.440]  stop the program but as we all know that hasn't happened you can find more reports on the alex

[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:34.960]  fight for freedom at least bold compared to others i don't think i've been bold enough quite frankly
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:40.320]  and i've had a lot of success because i was bold it separated me from the rest of the herd
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:46.640]  plus we're fighting bold activities by the globalist only bold actions are going to really have an
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:53.360]  effect and break through well the new world order knows that fortune favors the bold they are just
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:00.560]  warp speed right now pulling on all the stops doing stuff that's over the top stuff that i just can't
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:07.600]  believe and i really think jones calzins right they want to get us into a nuclear war have that
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.920]  selectively take out the major military centers roll out the secret weapons defeat the the the
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:20.400]  russians and the chinese maybe keep the chinese halfway alive militarily and then create a new
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:26.640]  bipolar world not a tripolar world and then finally create a unipolar world government
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:35.040]  based on the ashes of that but the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry i'm going to get
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:40.240]  rodney stich on for a full hour special report very soon on the nightly news he's with us till
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:47.840]  about 40 after then i'll go to chris and richie and malik and many others that are patiently
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.960]  holding on the nuclear war news uh that the pentagon is talking about the chinese government's
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:59.680]  threatening and just all the craziness that's happening but rodney stich is a very interesting
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:04.240]  person i'll tell you about him in just a moment and before we go go any further i want to read
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:09.760]  these quotes again just because i think they illustrate everything we're facing the first
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:19.200]  quote comes from sissarob marcus tulius sissarob this is before the birth of christ in the in the
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:26.880]  time of julius caesar i guess about 55 60 years before the time of christ a nation can survive
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.600]  its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive trees and from within an enemy at the
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.000]  gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly but the trader moves
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.640]  amongst those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleyways
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:46.880]  heard in the very halls of government itself but the trader appears not a trader he speaks
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:53.680]  in accents familiar to his victims and he wears the face and arguments he appeals to the baseness
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:58.640]  that lies deep within the hearts of all men he robs the soul of the nation he works secretly
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:05.520]  and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city george soros he infects the body politics
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:13.440]  so that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to fear and as we convert into a corrupt
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:20.320]  society we have economies based on baloney so productivity falls then the answer is more government
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:26.480]  more regulation more taxes and so the producers become less and less and so the society sinks
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:37.680]  very goldwater quote on the trilateral commission senator berry goldwater presidential republican
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:44.480]  a nominee in nineteen what nineteen they killed kennedy in 63 and had an election
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.800]  after that well when did he run for president was it in 64 68 you have to look it up
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:57.200]  the trilateral commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:01.760]  commercial and banking interest by seasoned control of the political government of the united
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:07.280]  states the trial commission represents a skillful coordinate effort to seize control and consolidate
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:13.120]  the four centers of power political monetary intellectual ecclesiastical what the trilateral
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:18.560]  commission intends to create is a worldwide economic power superior to the political
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:23.600]  governments of the nation states involved as managers and creditors of the system they will
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:32.400]  rule the future very goldwater in his 1964 book with no apologies and that was a decade exactly
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:38.880]  i guess he ran against lbj right after kennedy got killed and lbj took over
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.160]  he wrote that a decade before the trilateral commission was founded the year i was born 1974
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:50.560]  because he'd been in the senate meetings when they were pushing all this through the council
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.320]  on foreign relations what is trilateral
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:07.600]  the trifecta unos dos tres try three tricycle try north american union asian union european union
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:14.960]  all started by trade deals all secret the eu deals were secret why do we put up with this
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:19.440]  this didn't happen until just a decade ago or so in the u.s but in europe they were able to do it
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.680]  england is in the u.s and can't get out and never had a vote
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:32.640]  people go well don't worry the u.s created the u.n and runs all this not the u.s the robber barons
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:41.440]  and officially was founded in july 73 but didn't really get funded and didn't have a building till
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:49.360]  74 so technically the year before i was born a pointless factoid but just correcting myself
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:57.680]  now joining us till about 40 after just to look into one area of this transportation notice it
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:02.400]  was aviation that rolled over to the tsa taking over and now it's the model to take over every
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:07.600]  other sector of transportation and the economy in general under infra guard under infrastructure
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:14.800]  protection of the tsa with the dea there stealing money out of your wallet as after that forager
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:20.000]  seizure rodney stedge could do 10 hours with us i want him to just give us the basic overview today
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.320]  then come back on a few weeks for a full hour unfriendly skies is history of aviation disasters

[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:52.480]  the f a a was called the tombstone agency the practice of coverups by the political ntsb and
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:59.360]  see once they're corrupt you can pull a 9 11 examples the life and death assessment given to
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:05.200]  him to halt the serious problems and airline having the most crashes the web of intrigue that

[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:21.040]  hi alex that was quite a quite an area you covered there absolutely well you're an amazing
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:24.720]  individual spend a few minutes telling us about yourself you're awakening them we'll come back
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:31.520]  and dive into wherever you want to go first well um let me just give you a quick rundown on my
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:40.000]  background here um i hate to show my age but um i was a naval aviator the navy patrol plane commander
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:50.800]  in world war two thereafter i was a um international airline captain uh pretty much in all types of
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:59.360]  operations and uh for the purpose of this show i uh what would be especially interesting is my
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:07.680]  time flying muslin pilgrims from throughout the middle east to the holy cities of mecca and madina
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:17.600]  and this is where i found myself into a a cia revolution where i needed a machine gun escort
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:28.160]  take me and my co-pilot from the hotel out to our plane and um uh after that period of time
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:36.160]  um i went with the f a a and this is at a time when airline disasters
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:43.920]  were a common event uh sometimes every few months and one of the major air disasters
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:52.560]  that was occurring was a dc eight that crashed into the brooklyn area of new york city there
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:18:01.600]  was a big scandal behind that anyhow um the f a a small the safety segment and we have the
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:08.480]  political segment too you know uh the safety segment set me up to a politically powerful
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:15.360]  airline that was having a lot of crashes including the one in new york city and there was more or
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:24.080]  less uh less uh life and death assignment and uh it didn't take me long to discover the problems
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:30.960]  and then i came under attack as i tried to correct them and the attack was from the political end
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:41.120]  of the um f a a and during these attacks three more crashes occurred and crashes are kind of horrific
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:50.480]  at times so um other inspectors had looked broad you can't fight the system but if i didn't do
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:58.720]  something this would go on so i did some very unusual things um first i used the law in such a
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:05.520]  way that i acted as an independent prosecutor and there were several weeks of court like
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:13.360]  proceeding um uh that followed but the administrative law judge was simply an aviation ignorant
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:20.800]  attorney on the staff of the f a a administrative so he covered up and then the head of the f a a
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:30.320]  sky rifle program was so outraged by it he urged me to send a report to the f a a administrator
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:37.680]  and he would sign it which was done um of course at this time now this is a major scandal because
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:45.760]  we had a number of people uh die and here i'm getting here's all the evidence aviation expert

[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:20.960]  well then corruption doesn't tend it always historically rots and grows and and gets more
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:27.760]  out of control and more wild and more insane until your whole government collapses and now
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:33.120]  look at the f a today i mean famously corrupt and i want to get into 911 with our guest i want to
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:37.600]  get into i mean he's a famous guy if you go research aviation disasters one of the first
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:44.880]  investigators world war two vet pilot you name it so he's hired to go in there good people in the
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:52.240]  agency supported him he'd gotten up to that point why were all these uh planes crashing routinely
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.880]  and then we'll kind of do a condensed history of where it went during this segment then i want to
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:02.640]  get into 911 with our guest and uh ask uh where this is all going today but the crew wants to
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:08.160]  know before you finish up on that part about the japanese flag behind you uh rodney stitch
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:20.240]  wiki leaks usa.org well the japanese flag is one that i um recovered toward the end of the war
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:30.560]  i i was flying a four-engine uh privateer out of tinnian to a little island called marcus island
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:40.320]  and i happened to find a flag there so i brought it back incidentally um after the end of the war
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:50.000]  uh i flew for a while for japan airline and uh many of my co-pilots were former japanese
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:58.240]  wartime navy pilots so here we have the cockpit and this is even before the uh peace peace treaty
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:08.640]  uh took effect and i think it was 52 um here you have japanese and american wartime pilots in
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:13.600]  the same cockpit so it's kind of interesting i thought the japanese were pretty honorable i mean
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:21.200]  once the war was over they didn't uh generally double cross did they no uh in some ways i thought
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.920]  they were more honorable than some of the people i ran into in the u.s government and i think i
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:36.480]  even have mentioned that in some of my uh writing incidentally the 20 books are in all areas of
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:45.200]  government corruption based upon what i and i have uh over a period of years uh by writing books and
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:52.640]  being on hundreds of radio and television programs starting back in 1978 oh i know i mean i've read
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.200]  books from back in the 80s and stuff uh where it'll quote you know rodney stitch i mean you've been
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:01.520]  involved i should have introduced you as an icon of the liberty movement that a lot of young folks
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:06.400]  may not know who you are i mean you what is your view about the planetary situation right now let's
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:13.360]  get a big wide view then we'll zoom into aviation who's taking over what's happening uh what's your
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:21.840]  view well that's an area you're far more qualified than i am alec i've been sticking pretty much to
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:30.400]  the hardcore corruption that i and others have developed or discovered and i leave it up to
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:40.720]  people like you to come up with an analysis of what is behind all this it's amazing this is your
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.400]  short segment long segment coming up but let's get back to the point before the break uh you're
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:49.120]  in there you're the top federal investigator on some of these crashes you write your reports you're
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:55.280]  told basically shut up but some other folks uh in the fAA they support you they sign the document
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:01.200]  it gets sent to the full uh you know head of the fAA please continue well what happened then
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:09.920]  i i sent a letter uh to the fAA saying i refuse to work under these deadly uh conditions and i'm
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  resigning so i uh then returned to california and uh i started um writing books uh to inform the
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:28.560]  public of these things because everywhere i went well i now uh during during all these accidents
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:37.440]  when i was fighting uh the system i notified a number of members of congress and um this was in
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:48.160]  about 65 i did get one thing accomplished they abandoned the federal aviation agency but and
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:56.480]  then renamed it the federal aviation administration but it's the same personnel in the same culture
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:04.320]  so the crash continued for a number of years and they eventually greatly reduced the frequency
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:14.560]  due to other other uh conditions uh improved engines and things like that however occasionally
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:24.400]  like on 9-11 people don't realize um the fAA did have a role in that but anyhow um what started
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:36.400]  happening is that um i started receiving um uh information from our former cia people cia people
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:43.200]  that were involved in like we're gonna come right back on that point rodney stitch wikileaksusa.org
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:49.680]  i talk about a hardcore investigator he said world war two vets stay with us we're on the march
[02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:55.040]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:05.200]  wherever children can be found having good clean fun you can rest assure there's a control freak
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:10.640]  not far behind trying to ruin their childhood as was the case in pennsylvania where a teen was
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:15.840]  ordered to tear down a treehouse because their neighbor complained at first i thought it was a
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:22.240]  joke but then i found out it wasn't the teen said according to local reports so then i got really
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:28.160]  sad and it is sad people complain that teen spend too much time in front of their cell phones and
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:33.520]  video games but when they go out and actually have physical activity some people find that to be
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:39.040]  unacceptable this was echoed earlier this year when a family was forced to remove a cardboard
[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:44.560]  fort from their own front yard i had warm positive memories from my childhood about
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:49.280]  forts and thought it was a great way to spark imaginations away from the tv the father said
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:57.200]  but no that also was unacceptable you can find more reports on the alex jones channel on youtube

[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:43.360]  austin sometime to be in studio i mean a world war two vet combat vet flying around during the
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:50.000]  pacific during all that craziness and then just to consummate a whistleblower from the beginning
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:58.640]  and then his book that i have read is simply amazing unfriendly skies his work on 9 11 scandal
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:04.320]  behind the hijackings of 9 11 twa flight 800 he was early on said that was bull of course it's
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:10.560]  come out that's bull the fbi put journalist in prison that exposed it was a continuous rod warhead
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:16.320]  and the rest of it i had general parton on who developed the continuous rod warhead the head
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:24.880]  of air force weapons development before he then headed the entire air force we've had multiple
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:31.360]  former chairman of the joint chief's staff we've had top admirals top generals general parton
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:36.480]  i think about the amazing guests we've had on the show it's just mind blowing we had the former
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:42.720]  technical head of the nsa william benion probably 10 times or more including in studio i'm not bragging
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:48.560]  people keep saying though if this was going on in government we'd hear about it we do it
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:53.680]  does come out the reason i'm saying the government's not our enemy is as bad as the government is
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:59.120]  an overrun with corrupt interest on average people in government are more awake than the general
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:05.200]  public does that mean there aren't giants swaths of bad people in government absolutely it's there
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:12.320]  but again why is homeland security saying they're worried about veterans because nine times out of
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:17.200]  10 when somebody's really fighting tyranny effectively it's got to be nine times out of 10
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:23.440]  it's a veteran because they at least have some sense of duty some sense of even of the war they
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:29.040]  were in was wrong or partially wrong depending on which war it doesn't matter they're people
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:34.720]  that are willing to go fight they're people that aren't cowards they're people that believe in
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.880]  something and believing in something is better than nothing in this world

[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:09.920]  former f a a criminal investigator you know in there trying to find out what's happening
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:16.560]  you expose it they refuse to change it but but change the name of the agency wikileaksusa.org
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:21.920]  of all these scandals you witnessed the stuff you saw with the cia you said the cia started to
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:27.360]  bring you information uh you got cut off by the bright continue there and then that's segue into
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:37.440]  911 okay um as i as i started to say uh the publicity from appearing on shows and the books
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:49.280]  uh started uh 20 or 30 years of people coming to meet each these are uh fbi agents who were in key
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:58.160]  operations especially in the middle east um who would uh report to me um and we were talking back
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:06.800]  and forth for years about the cia drug smuggling atorber surprise iran contrae um how we were
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:16.880]  subverting different uh government um and even a couple of mafia people and eventually um we'll
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:26.640]  we'll probably get into one mafia person who had more to do with being able to prevent 911 but
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:34.160]  that's for a little bit later um but i needed any rates with all of this information and
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.120]  seeing the consequences i felt i had to do something and i think i should have my head
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:46.800]  examined for feeling that but nevertheless what i did uh since i was uh uh experiencing cover-up
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:55.520]  everywhere i figured well there's a uh federal crime reporting statute i'll uh that says if you
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:00.480]  know the federal crime you got to report it to a federal judge or any other federal official
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:07.200]  so i think we're okay i'll um i'll file a federal action which i did a number of
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:16.000]  and that that turned out kind of interesting especially the one i um uh filed just before
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:23.840]  911 and even more interesting the two that i filed after 911 but anyhow there's a tremendous
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:35.280]  amount of information and uh i can't understand uh the and so much corruption that exists
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:44.080]  and the total cover-up by the media and the people are suffering just like uh i go into
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:53.040]  details on how um uh we generated the hatred in the middle east and then i go into the corruption
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:41:00.160]  that enabled a series of terrorist attacks to occur and this is factual i try to avoid
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:05.600]  any conspiracy uh deals i just go with what's admitted which is an incredible amount well
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:11.040]  let's talk about the particular books and articles where you break down what happened with 911 uh
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:16.000]  from your perspective and research your angle and then leading that into the larger issue
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:23.600]  of the middle east and where it's all going okay um uh can i give you a introduction on
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:31.840]  on how it could have been prevented well first of all the CIA had a role in that but that wasn't
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:40.240]  not a more criminal enroll uh uh complicity was involved in that and that is with the
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:49.440]  department of justice i happened to be have it about a 10-year uh continual communication with
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:42:01.040]  a mole in the al-qaeda shell he um he was um uh a mole in the shell headed by ramsey usher and uh
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:10.480]  uh being a former new york city mafia member uh youth chef thought uh he also wanted to undermine
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:18.640]  the united state so youth chef started giving him a lot quite a bit of information on uh al-qaeda
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:27.920]  activities including information on several planned al-qaeda attacks that did occur and
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:35.360]  are you talking about a mod salon i'm talking about gregory scarford uh junior whose father was
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:46.320]  uh mafia carpo and uh his father and fbi agents in the new york city officers were
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:53.200]  involved in murders just as was occurring in boston and boston had a little more publicity
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:43:00.160]  the murders in the new york city officers were pretty well kept quiet by the media but anyhow
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:09.440]  he the mole and his new york city attorney was advising fbi agents of the planned attack as they
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:17.840]  as he was receiving the information well uh washington uh deep six the information and the
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:27.200]  reason they said that they were planning to discredit uh this young uh mafia in the business
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:34.640]  visual who was about uh planned to testify in several murder trials about the murders that
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:42.960]  his father committed with the help of specific people and then fbi or so he was going to expose
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:47.840]  something like the whitey bulger situation but going on in new york all right that is correct
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:56.560]  and so um since the department of justice was planning to discredit this one testimony he was
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:05.120]  given now they're confronted with the same fellow providing insider information so apparently they
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:16.160]  decided to cover up so uh the advance information they were having that they were receiving was one
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:25.600]  the plan for me or the plan taking down of a uh airline and departing new york city the basis
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:34.640]  for that they taught and this is what uh ramsey usif thought was it would uh bring about a missed
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:41.600]  trial he was going he was undergoing trial for the world trade center bombing and the plan
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:49.760]  and of a couplet of a dozen u.s. airliners in the middle east so anyhow that was the first test
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:58.320]  then the next information they um and then that twa 800 happened in several weeks thereafter
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:05.840]  then the next one was the um planned bombing of u.s. embassies and that was covered up and then
[02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:14.960]  of course nine uh nine eleven so nine eleven then it could um now i have uh i go into great
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:25.680]  details as i have uh about the nine eleven and i go into how easy it would have been to prevent it
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:35.200]  the primary reason for preventing it for uh uh the terrorist being able to get on the aircraft
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:45.760]  or uh the flight attendants had keys uh it was obvious to any street to the thug that all they had
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:52.320]  to do would get the key from uh mostly female flight attendants they can go in the cockpit and
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:46:01.040]  confront the crew but then the um department adjusted now that was criminal so what i did i uh
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:09.040]  and after that happened uh i filed a federal lawsuit first i filed it in um a federal court
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:16.640]  in washington dc and and this is on the basis of the federal crime reporting statute and they
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:25.280]  refused to file it and only had a mandatory duty to do so so then i submitted it uh for filing in
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:36.000]  new york city and uh judge uh michael mccasey uh he refused to file it uh uh it wasn't until
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:46.320]  about a year later when i notified every member of the um supreme court justices of the latest
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:55.360]  obstruction of justice by federal judges that then my action was filed and then within a few minutes
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:47:03.760]  they dismissed it so they didn't want this information to get out um uh now if you want
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:11.280]  to go into more detail than anywhere but that's my uh the information i have actually that portion
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:17.600]  of it in my book of course i go into it absolutely bottom line what do you think really happened on
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.840]  911 i mean we know there was a standout we know saudi arabia was better than i'm involved
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:26.720]  obviously i've shown evidence it goes further but we just go what we can prove now the cover-up has
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:32.320]  been admitted they admit the 28 pages this whole thing should be reopened now when you've got the
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:40.880]  former head of the commission saying there was a cover-up oh well now infinitely uh uh the 911
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:46.720]  commission was pretty well controlled by the same department of justice people who were involved in
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:54.720]  the deep fixing and i go into greater details on that both on the internet site and in books now uh
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:48:01.040]  the area if you talk about i have no information on that so i i avoid sure i understand let me
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:05.920]  raise this what about the airline that went down right after uh 911 we'll put it on screen for tv
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:12.640]  viewers american airlines flight 587 that so many witnesses said looked like it had its engine blown
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:20.160]  off as it took off there from jfk do you have any intel on that to airbus 300 situation well yes
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:28.320]  both on the internet site and in my books i go into that quite a bit and and that was the
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:37.440]  usual cover-up whereby the ntsb said they there was light treatment from the plane took off so the
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:46.800]  tail ripped off her tail don't rip off that easily but what i have i have the um statement made by
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:54.160]  numerous people on the ground these are professionals a fireman or policemen who report
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:49:03.520]  uh seeing an explosion and uh and in the area of the rear baggage compartment so what happened on
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:13.920]  that plane of course it took off from jfk and shortly thereafter um uh uh the it goes down
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:23.280]  uh the um the explosion occurs one or two engines uh rip off and the tail ripped off that's what i was
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:28.240]  about to say i remember at the time it was even in local papers with cops and firemen and citizens
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:33.520]  saying the planes blew up pieces going everywhere in the sky uh thousands of feet in the air up
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:39.120]  to take off and then they spin it and go that's a conspiracy theory the back tail just fell off
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:45.280]  clearly this was a secondary terrorist attack in my view oh yes and i agree with that and i would
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:55.280]  presume the system did not want to be reflected as having another terrorist attack occur um uh
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:50:03.040]  this would of course reflect badly on assistance and the same thing if the information that uh i
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:10.640]  and all of my sources and we're all professionals if this was known uh the scandal would go far
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:20.960]  beyond uh uh nine eleven because this matter of fact uh uh i'll briefly make reference to the fact
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:28.160]  that um i sued a number of the federal judges because to that cover-up years of cover-up well
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.400]  listen this is what it comes down to my friend let me give out your website for folks because i'm

[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:23.760]  we do not live in boring times we live in interesting times to re-quote the chinese proverb
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:30.480]  china is such a bubble they are creating a new billionaire every week but a billionaire in this
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:37.040]  inflationary currency situation is not a billionaire just like somebody worth a million dollars in the
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:42.400]  thirties will be a billion dollar today in the aggregate it is a very strange system that we live
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:47.040]  in i mean soon a five bedroom house pretty much anywhere in the country will be you know millions
[02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:52.720]  of dollars well what have you got five six kids i mean it's just but the wages aren't going up
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:58.240]  but the cost is going up so california la passes a fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:03.120]  that'll just cause more inflation but i'm digressing let's go to your calls
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:09.440]  chris in south carolina thanks for holding you want to talk about hr 112 bill tell us about that
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:15.680]  uh well i found i discovered uh just doing a little bit of research and alabama is the one
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:22.800]  that's pushing it but it's supposed to allow them to put limits on the fiscal spending of federal
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:30.640]  government allow them to put uh what does it say i want to uh well that's great what's your
[02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:35.360]  point on the bill specifically i believe they were saying it needed 13 other states and i
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:39.360]  noticed that they weren't getting that much uh if you want it and i was just wondering uh
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:45.440]  do you think it's something that people should support or not are you talking about a constitutional
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:52.400]  convention it they were trying to go that direction and then decided against it or
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:59.520]  something more or less to basically try to limit the federal government within their state from
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:03.840]  you know from like turn uh how long they could actually serve a term sure i'm familiar with
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:09.440]  that i've seen that before look these con cons are very very dangerous because anytime you get one
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:15.280]  then it opens it up for anything to be done uh at the same time my view on those is softened
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:19.920]  a little bit because the feds are so gone that almost anything would be better because they're
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:25.920]  just doing an all by fiat uh but we do need to hold congress accountable hold the executive
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:32.400]  accountable hold the uh judiciary as well and the question is how do you do that when they're
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:38.320]  acting in unison with a rogue plan to bring us into a planetary government i appreciate your
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:44.400]  call chris richie in new york thanks for holding go ahead okay alex maybe that goes on to what i
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:51.280]  want to ask you um how about uh they they sue for everything why can't we do the same thing
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:57.280]  and i'm saying you have uh here u bc uh they they uh dealing with the uh business with the enemy
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:02.640]  act in 1944 i'm saying uh you you have you know that's a great point a lot of these multinational
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:07.840]  corporations that are based here trade with all of our enemies and if they catch a us citizen
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:11.760]  giving to a charity that gives money to some terror group you go to jail why don't these big
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.960]  corporations get in trouble again uh the cops are trained the bureaucracies are trained only go out
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:24.080]  for little guys there's no way to create these citizens oversight committees on everything
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:31.520]  they do i mean harass them on everything they do you know we don't want you know listen how far
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:37.760]  can we go by petition as opposed to having to try and be a law by representatives i'm seeing we the
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:42.480]  people we are the people we are the government where is it where can we draw the line and say
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:46.880]  all right and well listen i think lawsuits properly prepared at the state and federal level are the
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:52.880]  way to go the globalists are scared of them that's why they call it paper terrorism uh but it's not
[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:58.160]  i mean if it's frivolous and and and not directed correctly it's it's it's you know it's it's frivolous
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:03.920]  but i think it's a great thing to do i mean look at how a bunch of ambulance chasing lawyers have
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:09.200]  screwed stuff up well what about patriots filing lawsuits that certainly draws attention to what's
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:14.880]  happening and does have an effect so i think it's a great idea uh but but more importantly voting
[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:20.400]  with our dollars boycotting establishment companies supporting companies and individuals and groups
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:23.760]  that are promoting freedom that's one of our biggest powers we've got left
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:30.000]  Alex also like you said i've heard you say before uh third continent the congress or whatever it was
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:37.520]  you had said before how about a realignment how about a realignment that excludes the the pulling
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:42.960]  the rug out no i hear you the feds are illegitimate we have to educate folks about that first stay

[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:08.560]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:19.680]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:28.320]  new headline up at info wars dot com wealthy installing safe rooms prepare for civil unrest
[03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:32.000]  demand for expensive bulletproof home shelters more than doubles and that's what we've
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:37.760]  told you about a lot until it hit mainstream news like the new york times and the london
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:45.920]  guardian they're also relocating uh to areas of the pacific ocean why did the globalists
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:50.240]  do this because they just can't control themselves they all want to steal and do things that help
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:57.200]  them individually but in the end bring down the whole society they just don't have a sense of
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:05.040]  your report you so don't do bad things they come back on you malik in california thanks for holding
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:13.360]  you're on the air okay he's not there uh we'll go ahead down go to frank in ohio you're on the
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:20.000]  air go ahead frank alex i'm mad as hell and i'm not going to take it anymore all right brother
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:26.160]  tell me what you're thinking i'm thinking that you know that they want to talk about the constitution
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:30.160]  that did judge up on a stand the other day here in cleveland wants to talk about the constitution
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:36.160]  for the cop and in this and that oh what about them being out of their jurisdiction when they went
[03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:42.640]  at chasing after those two travelers in that in that car well what happens is a lot of cops who
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:48.080]  aren't even bad people just shouldn't be cops and get too adrenaline you know rushing once they chase
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:52.880]  somebody uh and then they just jumped out of the car like he was superman and jumped on their hood
[03:01:52.880 --> 03:01:58.480]  and killed him in cold blood and they were unarmed and uh it's it's scary i mean it and people say
[03:01:58.480 --> 03:02:03.280]  well do what the cop says and you won't die and i and see as society unravels there'll be more and
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:07.920]  more of an instinct either hate the cops or back on no matter what they do we need to understand
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:11.680]  we're being played off against each other but what's your take on the cop not getting in trouble
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:20.640]  the cop not getting in trouble it's more uh corporate uh overreach where they're they're
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:26.400]  they're they have more rights than the people do anymore well i mean all the time cops kill white
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:31.520]  people uh in the wrong and then they and there's coverups or whatever and it's terrible or hispanics
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:35.760]  the difference is al sharpton and the media tell blacks it's because they're black and i'm sure
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:42.480]  sometimes it is but most the time it's the paramilitary training uh most the time uh it is the
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:49.760]  you know just the whole shoot first ask questions uh you know later mentality and then that's being
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:55.520]  exacerbated but at the same time when government more and more becomes above the law uh you're
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:03:00.400]  going to see people taking the law into their own hands but but what's crazy is folks that want to go
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:05.440]  after the the police they'll just randomly go shoot some cop in the head i mean you know that's
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  what's so stupid about this i mean if you think somebody killed your brother wrongfully i'm not
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:15.920]  saying do this uh but you would end up you know trying to find who actually did it not randomly
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:21.200]  but it's like some of these racist black folks that go out and find a white person well i'm mad
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:25.680]  a cop killed a black guy so i'm gonna go kill an old white lady well i mean that'd be like
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:30.160]  of a black guy you know killed a white woman let's just go randomly find a black guy and kill him
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:38.480]  it's just mindless tribal gang type thinking but that's what the media instills and programs into
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:45.120]  people the cops haven't been taught the laws they they they know the legal but they don't know the
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.640]  lawful well i'll say the biggest thing is that every cop show i watch is just cops torturing
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:56.640]  and killing and and and beating people up for no reason and situationally with the situational
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:02.400]  ethic it's almost always right that they did it well cops are watching this believing then
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:08.640]  if they feel like it they can do it and if it's mind control is what it is plus there's more cameras
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:14.080]  so it's creating a perception that there's a massive increase in this uh and really there's
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:20.240]  not because violent crime has dropped so much because of gun ownership there's less bad situations
[03:04:20.240 --> 03:04:24.560]  there probably is an increase in cops overreaching but if you add that into the fact that there's
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:31.120]  less violence total uh it appears to be flat or actually lowering overall police misconduct and
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:36.240]  i made a real study of it uh doesn't mean that it shouldn't be dealt with it isn't a problem
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:40.880]  but it's not as big as the dollar in trouble world war three looming cancer viruses in the
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:47.600]  vaccines 17 million black babies aborted i mean we've got a lot of big issues here george soros
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:52.960]  isn't setting my agenda to hate the cops that's all i'm saying there's a reason that's being done
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:05:18.800]  but i hear you frank that judge is out of control that cop should have gotten trouble for what he did
