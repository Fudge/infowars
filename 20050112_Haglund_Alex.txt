[00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:04.965]  We're talking with Dean Hagelin.
[00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:20.377]  He is an actor, he is an inventor, and he is also a traveling sage, going about the country, just investigating what the public mind is brewing.
[00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:25.961]  A general snapshot of America as it is today.
[00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:31.565]  Just briefly, Dean, tell us what you're doing.
[00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:32.846]  Well, I got in a car,
[00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:34.997]  In Los Angeles.
[00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:42.623]  Started driving east with the goal of getting to Tampa for a photo shoot.
[00:00:42.623 --> 00:00:44.045]  How long that would take?
[00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:44.785]  I didn't know.
[00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:45.626]  Who I'd meet?
[00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:46.867]  Had no idea where I'd stay.
[00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:50.470]  It was up to the fates and serendipity.
[00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.517]  And then I document the whole thing because I thought that would be a better way of finding out what's going on in America than, you know, calling up, researching.
[00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:00.798]  You know, Ewan McGregor?
[00:01:00.798 --> 00:01:03.120]  He did that motorcycle trip around
[00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:05.856]  Uh, the world, where he went through Russia.
[00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:06.437]  Did you see this?
[00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:07.197]  Yes, I did.
[00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:07.897]  Yeah.
[00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:13.761]  But, it was all carefully managed and packaged by handlers, so he didn't actually meet anybody.
[00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.322]  He didn't actually talk to anybody.
[00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:23.326]  They just raced motorcycles and open stretches of the highway, and then showed up at policy staged events.
[00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:27.589]  Not really the way to figure out what's going on with the country, so, or the world for that matter.
[00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:31.831]  So I figured this would be a better way without having any, uh, just a laptop,
[00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.007]  Go to the free Wi-Fi spots.
[00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.768]  Find out where I'm going to next.
[00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:37.929]  Love MapQuest.
[00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.771]  I'm a MapQuest fan.
[00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:45.255]  Well, this is exciting and I'm honored to be included in the film you're making, Dean.
[00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.276]  Chris Carter.
[00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:46.817]  Yes.
[00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:47.798]  The X-Files.
[00:01:47.798 --> 00:01:48.118]  Uh-huh.
[00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:49.119]  The creator of it.
[00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.560]  Yes.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.142]  What's Chris Carter doing today?
[00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:55.384]  Probably surfing or mountain climbing.
[00:01:55.384 --> 00:02:00.708]  Or he got into free swimming where he could hold his breath for two and a half minutes underwater.
[00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:01.709]  But he's also writing.
[00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.758]  And, I probably could say it, we're maybe working on a second X-Files movie.
[00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:28.670]  It's just Fox and Chris Carter have to come to some sort of agreement, but I had heard that they're actually writing, and NBC has just approached Chris Carter and Frank Spottnitz, the two main writers of the X-Files, to redo Colchak the Night Stalker, which was the series with Darren McGavin that originally inspired Chris Carter to do the X-Files in the first place.
[00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.771]  Wow.
[00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:30.171]  Full circle.
[00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:37.282]  The Lone Gunman ran in 2001.
[00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.343]  That's right.
[00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:41.284]  2000.
[00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:43.004]  It was a mid-season replacement.
[00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:44.885]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:45.005]  2001.
[00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.505]  We shot in 2000.
[00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:48.586]  January 2001 we started airing.
[00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:55.508]  When did you shoot the episode with the government secretly hijacking a jet by remote control to fly it to the World Trade Center?
[00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.969]  Yeah, that we shot in March of 2000.
[00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.030]  So that's almost the full...
[00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:03.479]  Eight months, nine months before it actually happens.
[00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.739]  Am I counting that right?
[00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:14.782]  On the morning of September 11, 2001, you see a plot from the TV show you were in, to some extent coming true.
[00:03:14.782 --> 00:03:17.163]  What did you think on September 11th?
[00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:22.424]  You know, I didn't even put it together until I got a call from one of the writers, going, are you watching this?
[00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:24.505]  And by that time, well,
[00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:32.252]  The personal note, my pipes went in my sink at my house and I had to go to Home Depot.
[00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:33.993]  So I wasn't really watching what was going on.
[00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:35.394]  I was concerned about a plumbing issue.
[00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:42.578]  So all I did really follow it, I just heard, oh, something's crazy happening and I'm just supposed to fly to a comedy club.
[00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:46.000]  Because I do stand-up comedy as well.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.462]  And so I was like just trying to get the sink fixed before I had to get the airport to go fly out of there.
[00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:53.284]  So I didn't even know the planes were grounded or anything like that.
[00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:54.985]  So then finally when I get the sink fixed,
[00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.632]  And then I sort of realized, wait a second, I'm not flying anywhere.
[00:03:58.632 --> 00:04:02.374]  Then the phone rings, and then it's one of the writers going, are you watching this?
[00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:03.574]  Then it all comes together.
[00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:04.255]  What did he say?
[00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:05.035]  Who was the writer?
[00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:07.776]  It was Vince, Vince Gilligan.
[00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:09.817]  He called and he said, are you watching this?
[00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:10.818]  And I go, yeah.
[00:04:10.818 --> 00:04:12.098]  It's weird, why are you calling?
[00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:13.699]  He goes, because it's the show.
[00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:19.675]  And then it took me a while to go, oh yeah, the pilot, good God, it's exactly what they wrote.
[00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:22.537]  And they were really freaked out about it, the writers.
[00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:28.060]  But then I saw in articles where they were interviewed about it, who particularly wrote that episode?
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.702]  I think Vince Gilligan was the key, the head writer on that one.
[00:04:31.702 --> 00:04:32.563]  Who else was involved?
[00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:38.306]  And then it was Frank Spotnitz, John Chypin, and then Chris Carter did a rewrite on that as well.
[00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:43.950]  So you've got these three writers involved, the principal writer being Gilligan, and then 9-11,
[00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:50.269]  happens, and I saw him quoted saying, yeah, we thought it would be a big deal, but it really wasn't a big deal.
[00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:54.090]  Nobody seemed to really even talk about it in the story I read.
[00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.711]  I certainly paid attention.
[00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:00.391]  Tell us in a nutshell what happened in that episode.
[00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:11.674]  There is a government plot where they take a computer and basically override all the pilot's control systems, and by remote control are going to fly it into the World Trade Center.
[00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:17.557]  And in the series to start a worldwide war on terror, on terrorists.
[00:05:17.557 --> 00:05:18.978]  That was part of the plot.
[00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:24.561]  Third world countries, third world tin horn dictators begging to take responsibility and be smart bombed.
[00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:25.041]  That's right.
[00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:26.122]  Because the war is over.
[00:05:26.122 --> 00:05:27.002]  The war is over.
[00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:30.144]  And we need a new enemy to keep the economy going.
[00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:31.845]  The Cold War is over, John.
[00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:32.906]  That's right.
[00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:33.286]  Oh, you do?
[00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:35.707]  Wow, Alex, you did watch the show.
[00:05:35.707 --> 00:05:36.528]  That's very good.
[00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:38.509]  No, no, I made a big deal out of it.
[00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.331]  There's two ways to look at this.
[00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:53.580]  Either one of the writers had an inside track and had somebody inside the globalist system plant this story with him, and he inadvertently read it, and he inadvertently wrote it,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.245]  Or, the writer simply picked up on what was all over the news for four years before it was written in 2000.
[00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:12.871]  Because I was on the radio in 1996, every few months, CNN, AP, there's a plan to hijack jets and fly them in the World Trade Center.
[00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:18.815]  But then on the morning of 9-11, the government came out and said, hey, we never heard of a plan to do this.
[00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:20.416]  No one ever thought of a plan.
[00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:23.938]  Well, Bush a few months before was in Genoa, Italy at the World Summit.
[00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:27.469]  They had anti-aircraft missiles on top of the buildings.
[00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.971]  He stayed on an aircraft carrier out in the Mediterranean because of a threat of hijacked jets being flown in.
[00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:40.695]  The CIA put out reports of this, of plans to fly him into the CIA, plans to fly him into the World Trade Center, Pentagon, Capitol.
[00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:47.437]  But Connelly Sirais, our new Secretary of State, all of them, they said they never heard of such a plan.
[00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:48.938]  It was preposterous!
[00:06:48.938 --> 00:06:50.239]  So what do you think it is?
[00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:53.540]  Or any ideas or feelings or thoughts on that?
[00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:55.306]  You know, what is it?
[00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:56.667]  Is it an inside track?
[00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.968]  A conspiracy?
[00:06:57.968 --> 00:06:59.790]  With the writers of The Lone Gunman?
[00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.092]  Or is it that they were tuned into the news?
[00:07:02.092 --> 00:07:05.395]  I mean, Tom Clancy... Tom Clancy wrote it in his book, too, right?
[00:07:05.395 --> 00:07:06.376]  I mean, it was all there.
[00:07:06.376 --> 00:07:07.617]  It was already out there.
[00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:16.446]  And this is what the writers of The X-Files and The Lone Gunman did, is they were great at coalescing all of this information.
[00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:20.067]  You know, the show was popular because it hit on so many things.
[00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:26.049]  UFOs, you know, creepy alien mutations, you know, all sorts of stuff.
[00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:31.270]  And bringing it into a collective, like the collective consciousness into one single show.
[00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.972]  And bringing a lot of futuristic, but also near future and current cutting edge things.
[00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:36.692]  Right.
[00:07:36.692 --> 00:07:43.014]  And so, because they had that skill already for like eight years before The Lone Gunman started up,
[00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:46.149]  They had already been, you know, pulling these clips.
[00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:53.535]  If you ever went into one of the writers' rooms and see their library, it's not how to write screenplays and, you know, actors in Hollywood.
[00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:59.499]  It's, uh, you know, Mithra, early Mithra religions, and, uh, there's 12 kooky things to do at night.
[00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:02.922]  You know, they had, like, such an eclectic library mix.
[00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:08.306]  They were so well-read that that was what they fueled themselves to write these episodes.
[00:08:08.306 --> 00:08:12.409]  So, clearly, I think that they were just picking up on what was already out there, the A.P.
[00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.290]  Wise stories and the Tom
[00:08:13.512 --> 00:08:14.867]  McConnelly surrised?
[00:08:17.287 --> 00:08:21.069]  Who would have thought of such a... Congolese Rice is not a writer, also.
[00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:22.270]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.873]  What did you think of watching this intelligence chief who's advising the president?
[00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:34.418]  We now know there were memos that said Bin Laden is dedicated to attack, probably with jets in the buildings.
[00:08:34.418 --> 00:08:35.599]  I mean, they knew.
[00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:36.319]  They were lying.
[00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:36.860]  They knew.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.082]  And if you read Michael Rupert's Crossing the Rubicon, have you read that book?
[00:08:41.082 --> 00:08:41.503]  Yeah.
[00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:43.204]  Yeah, with the timeline in there.
[00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:47.706]  We actually broke that.
[00:08:47.706 --> 00:08:59.552]  My sources, three years ago, there was a NORAD stand-down order because there was a drill at 8.30 in the morning.
[00:08:59.552 --> 00:09:01.713]  There were about 24 drills.
[00:09:01.713 --> 00:09:10.458]  One of the drills, though, was the exact same planes, you know, tight planes, hitting the exact same targets at the exact same time.
[00:09:11.124 --> 00:09:17.612]  And so NORAD then stood down because NORAD was being told this is a drill.
[00:09:17.612 --> 00:09:20.455]  They have air traffic controllers going on tape.
[00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:23.639]  Is this part of the drill?
[00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:30.087]  And then they have the F-16s off in Canada and the West Texas doing other drills dealing with hijacked jets.
[00:09:31.144 --> 00:09:41.970]  So all the jets in the real world were in different areas dealing with other drills, and then there was another drill of flying jets at the World Trade Center in Pentagon at 8.30 in the morning.
[00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:50.775]  Dean, what's the chances, just in your view, of having the exact same drill, of the exact same thing happening, on the exact same day?
[00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:51.835]  Zero, I would say.
[00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:54.257]  Or a million, or a bazillion.
[00:09:54.257 --> 00:09:56.318]  Whichever way you want to lay that out.
[00:09:56.994 --> 00:09:59.737]  Dean, what do you think really happened on 9-11?
[00:09:59.737 --> 00:10:06.943]  I think it was staged, and I think it was, you know, according to Jordan Maxwell, it's America's Reichstead.
[00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:10.126]  And it seems all the evidence is pointing there.
[00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:13.970]  There's that guy who's got $100,000 to anyone who can prove... Jimmy Walter.
[00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.131]  Jimmy Walter.
[00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:16.152]  Engineering.
[00:10:16.152 --> 00:10:21.136]  That if the, you know, prove that the World Trade Center can fall down like that.
[00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:21.837]  Without explosives.
[00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:27.194]  We're good to go.
[00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:47.853]  Last year.
[00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:48.994]  Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[00:10:48.994 --> 00:10:53.555]  I mean, everybody already knew that, but it's LBJ admitting that our ships were never attacked.
[00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:54.115]  Right.
[00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:59.037]  So they just said we got attacked, and then 58,000 Americans died over a million Vietnamese.
[00:10:59.037 --> 00:11:00.658]  Man.
[00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:05.099]  So, and this again brings it to what the long gunman was about.
[00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:06.440]  That this was
[00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:12.965]  The three of us in a, you know, little office trying to put this information out there, saying that this is happening.
[00:11:12.965 --> 00:11:16.666]  And sort of, you know, a Don Quixote tilting at windmills kind of thing.
[00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:18.187]  Would people listen to your warning?
[00:11:18.187 --> 00:11:18.847]  Right.
[00:11:18.847 --> 00:11:28.311]  And clearly, part of the humor was that, you know, the way it got out is that we were displayed as, you know, kooks and nerds and freaks who lived in the basement kind of thing.
[00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:33.113]  And that, I have found, is what happens in reality.
[00:11:33.113 --> 00:11:34.514]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:36.035]  Sorry that you're part of that genre now.
[00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:41.550]  Well, no, but I mean, people who said the world was round were kooks at first.
[00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.330]  That's right.
[00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:51.496]  And, you know, that's how, I guess that's how we grow as a society is, you know, first somebody comes up with an idea that everybody's like, hmm, and then we all learn from there.
[00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:54.198]  Just one or two questions left.
[00:11:54.198 --> 00:11:56.439]  I don't know if you're aware of this.
[00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:58.340]  You ever heard the name Lionel Chetwin?
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.421]  Lionel Chetwin.
[00:11:59.421 --> 00:12:04.144]  He made those made-for-TV movies where Bush is his hero and he saved people on 9-11.
[00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:05.788]  Yes.
[00:12:05.788 --> 00:12:06.508]  Yes, right.
[00:12:06.508 --> 00:12:07.208]  That producer?
[00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.569]  Yes, that producer.
[00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:12.109]  He was made the president of Bush's Media Council.
[00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:12.850]  When did that happen?
[00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.910]  A few years ago.
[00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.010]  Was this after he produced those things?
[00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.110]  No, it was before.
[00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.591]  He produces them while he's on this council.
[00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:23.012]  And he interfaces with Bruckheimer and all these bigwigs.
[00:12:23.012 --> 00:12:26.832]  But I was for the Conspiracy Zone that Kevin Nealon did for a while.
[00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:34.214]  I was a guest out there and Chet Winn walked into the communal bathroom, kind of like the famous movie, While I'm at the Urinal, and said, you're Alex Jones.
[00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:38.969]  We're about to go on TV together again and he goes, I'm Lionel Chatwin.
[00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:41.170]  We're going to get you.
[00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.390]  And he told me, we're going to get you.
[00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.331]  Well, I took that serious.
[00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:53.295]  I went on the air and later I got a call by his lawyer and I said, hey, when we walked out, because I was talking about it on the radio, when we walked outside, and the producers were there, I go, Lionel Chatwin just said they're going to get me.
[00:12:53.295 --> 00:12:55.116]  And he joked and said, yeah, Lionel was just joking.
[00:12:56.047 --> 00:13:01.371]  So I said, you better go back, Mr. Lawyer, and ask him, and ask the producers, and they called back and apologized.
[00:13:01.371 --> 00:13:03.512]  They were trying to intimidate me to shut up.
[00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:18.021]  I have the mainstream news articles where Lionel Chetwin and others went and met with Hollywood and said, right after 9-11, we want the media and TV to portray a positive government image.
[00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:18.602]  Yeah.
[00:13:18.602 --> 00:13:24.626]  Not an anti-government image, and this was quoted, like the X-Files.
[00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:33.187]  Now, I don't know if you were aware of that, but I'm interested in your view on that.
[00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:52.931]  Well, see, when I travel around the world, it seems that the show is actually much more popular in Europe and Australia because of its anti-government message, and how the US government is, you know, seen by the rest of the world as kooky and crazy, and here was a show to back that up.
[00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:53.991]  It was sort of a, you know,
[00:13:55.475 --> 00:14:02.380]  They saw that as a bright light that someone else was thinking, like the rest of the world, as opposed to following the propaganda line.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:21.314]  The interesting thing that I had heard, that this goes back before even Lionel Chatwin, that Chris Carter was at a cocktail party, and he felt very out of place, and apparently he had a tuxedo in the corner, and this psychic came over to him and said, whatever you're working on is going to make you a ton of money.
[00:14:21.314 --> 00:14:23.176]  And that was just before he did the X-Files.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.562]  Well, that psychic I talked to, I go, what were you doing at the Hollywood party?
[00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:33.986]  She goes, I was hired by the CIA to go to parties and then just go home and email what I talked about at people.
[00:14:33.986 --> 00:14:43.251]  So the CIA has been tracking Hollywood parties since the 80s in order to determine because, you know, Hollywood films are a
[00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:47.353]  They set the agenda.
[00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:50.336]  They set a foreign policy, sort of.
[00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:51.657]  No, it's a projection.
[00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:54.139]  It's America's dominance, they admit, as long as it's Hollywood.
[00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:54.679]  Right.
[00:14:54.679 --> 00:15:04.386]  And so they want to make sure that all the producers and the writers, that nobody's thinking anything so radical or doing a movie that will completely undermine their foreign policy plans.
[00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:08.589]  And that they do that through sending women to parties and having them email.
[00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:09.490]  It's the weirdest thing.
[00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.771]  It's kind of creepy.
[00:15:10.771 --> 00:15:13.353]  Everybody I tell in Hollywood, all my actor friends, are kind of freaked out about it.
[00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:21.798]  Well, they admit that there's been a long time programming shows like SWAT on TV or, you know, if you want to get... JAG and all those military shows.
[00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:32.340]  Well, they have Threat Matrix 24 in England, the show's called Spooks, and now they torture children on the shows to get answers, so the terrorists will answer questions, they torture their child.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.601]  But the good guys have to torture the child, because that's how we save the Earth.
[00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:43.662]  So we're being, you know, these moral dilemma questions are training us that torture's okay.
[00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:43.862]  Right.
[00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:51.310]  And this becomes, you know, as an actor, the question is, well, are you going to audition for that?
[00:15:51.310 --> 00:16:05.278]  You know, there's a part where the tire hits the road when you're in Los Angeles, where suddenly you are called to audition for things that are questionable, that have not just, you know, is it a good film, bad film?
[00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:14.449]  But now you're actually seeing as, you know, more than I research this stuff, you're seeing part of that machine come right through your own backyard.
[00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:15.471]  It's very, very creepy.
