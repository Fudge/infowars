[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:31.480]  about a week and a half ago I saw a YouTube video that had about 2,000 views
[00:31.480 --> 00:39.400]  Mancow Muller Eric Mancow Muller being waterboarded and I emailed it to Curt
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.680]  Nemo and I said that is gonna be a big story and sure enough millions of views
[00:45.680 --> 00:53.480]  on YouTube alone all over MSNBC CNN Fox you name it for the last week and we've
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.800]  been bubbling about getting him on but we finally just talked to him we've been
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.240]  misplanned phone tag last few days he is coming up during the next break why is
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.840]  this important because I knew what the response of the media and the neocons
[01:07.840 --> 01:13.720]  would be they came out and said it was fake because when they called Mancow's
[01:13.720 --> 01:16.920]  publicist for the company he works for talk radio network they said oh it was
[01:16.920 --> 01:22.840]  just a radio stunt but nevertheless the waterboarding was real because the
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.560]  Chicago police being control freaks said you can't do a waterboarding if it's
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.600]  real and they said don't worry it's a stunt by the way if somebody consents to
[01:33.600 --> 01:37.000]  having water poured down their nose they're allowed to do that so that's
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.160]  just a police as usual out of control but they've now said it's a conspiracy
[01:42.160 --> 01:49.120]  theory it's not torture you see Mancow had been supporting torture and then
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.120]  going further and saying that this wasn't torture though it's one of the
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.400]  most effective tortures it brings on a panic attack and as bad as it is in a
[01:57.400 --> 02:00.800]  controlled air-conditioned environment with your friends around you laughing he
[02:00.800 --> 02:06.960]  gave up in six seconds the average person in about 15 imagine having somebody
[02:06.960 --> 02:10.440]  jump on your stomach with their knee like Jesse Ventura talked about in
[02:10.440 --> 02:16.560]  seal training in the budge training escape and evasion training and imagine
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.520]  being locked up for three days hanging by your wrist in a in a metal shed or a
[02:21.520 --> 02:26.240]  bamboo hut when the skeet is biting you with guys jabbing you with ak-47s and
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.880]  knocking your teeth out before they do it and it's just done as a form of
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.680]  humiliation and control and to get fake data and oh the evil North Koreans the
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.040]  the evil Cambodians the evil Russians the Soviets they would torture people but
[02:44.040 --> 02:51.160]  when we do it it's good it's good old-fashioned America so that is coming
[02:51.160 --> 02:58.680]  up we're gonna have our once a month visit that we have here on air with

[08:55.680 --> 09:00.520]  horrible you troublemaker you know what I saw this early last week and I said
[09:00.520 --> 09:03.240]  that's gonna be big one had a few thousand views on YouTube now it's
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.240]  millions all over international television and now you supposedly are a
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.400]  Shea Guevara hardcore communist according to the control right wing even though you
[09:13.400 --> 09:17.680]  actually support torturing people still you just admit it's torture you're now
[09:17.680 --> 09:24.680]  bad because you dare admit it's torture Alex my friend you've you've done it
[09:24.680 --> 09:30.840]  you've done it again look at this this is a lose lose situation for me I was
[09:30.840 --> 09:36.360]  convinced that water sprinkled the face was not torture the right loved me the
[09:36.360 --> 09:42.280]  the left continued to load me I'm I am not a Republican I am not a dummy crap
[09:42.280 --> 09:45.520]  I am a libertarian now the stupid people in this country don't know what that is
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.360]  they hear libertarian and think oh liberal you must like Obama no I want
[09:49.360 --> 09:52.960]  the government to leave me in my family alone I want to be able to drink raw
[09:52.960 --> 09:56.680]  milk that isn't controlled by the government I want school toys I want
[09:56.680 --> 10:01.960]  these sorts of things you're all kind of yeah yeah and and what happened here is
[10:01.960 --> 10:07.760]  I set out to prove that it wasn't torture and and I came to believe after I
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.080]  was waterboarded live on my silly little radio show that it was torture and
[10:11.080 --> 10:14.480]  what happened is you have to understand look Pelosi knew the dummy
[10:14.480 --> 10:18.560]  craps knew the Republicans knew everybody knew so it's not left and right
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.720]  that's the game they play I'm left I'm right you know listen to the puppets but
[10:23.720 --> 10:29.800]  who is the dopeto here it's it's the corporate run country so they have a
[10:29.800 --> 10:35.880]  vested interest in this never being decided so when Fox and MSNBC and CNN
[10:35.880 --> 10:39.600]  and others came out said wow this is torture they wanted to be kind of a
[10:39.600 --> 10:45.560]  non-issue now I also said this is a bigger issue than me I cannot make the
[10:45.560 --> 10:49.560]  decision on this I you know I'm an imperfect individual I don't believe
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.480]  that our our brave proud people in the military did this for their jollies I
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.600]  think they did it to save American lives when I pour water down somebody's nose
[10:57.600 --> 11:01.840]  to save my child yes and I would do the same for your child Alex or any of your
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.400]  listeners so you know I'm in a really ugly position here friend but that's
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.640]  the issue is you're seeing what the neocon establishment is doing you go on
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.280]  air and you say I still support this but it is torture and that isn't enough for
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.200]  them they want us to play the mental mind game of saying no this doesn't cause a
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.560]  panic attack no this doesn't simulate drowning and I just even turn on
[11:25.560 --> 11:29.600]  yesterday he pointed out that you know in the escape and evasion training in the
[11:29.600 --> 11:35.080]  Navy they also jump on your stomach with their knee while they pour the water
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.880]  down your nose and and you know and they've got to have medics there on top
[11:39.880 --> 11:43.200]  of it because this would you know really hurt people I think Dick Cheney and
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.240]  Nancy Pelosi and other people that have been saying this isn't torture how about
[11:47.240 --> 11:53.040]  they get water bordered I mean volunteer for it well listen I want to say
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.480]  something about what you just said there is a lie that is going around okay and
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.760]  that is that it's drowning now I talk about in my book as a kid I drowned and
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.400]  I had to be brought back to simulate drownings what I said but but but but
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.280]  Alex it doesn't it doesn't I've been whitewater rafting it even in your area
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.080]  you're an outdoorsman I know this isn't gulping for air this isn't like
[12:14.080 --> 12:18.720]  drowning in a pool this isn't like that this is worse and and to your listeners
[12:18.720 --> 12:24.520]  oh really to your listeners who say as I did you could hold your breath this goes
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.160]  into your sinuses fills up the back of your skull with water it cuts off all
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.760]  oxygen to your brain and it is that it's instantaneous I had a severe chest pains
[12:34.760 --> 12:38.760]  I had you know I went into the slapping the smart ass that I am I thought it was
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.200]  no big deal let me let me just say something else immediately these
[12:42.200 --> 12:48.240]  bloggers I believe many of them are front for government agencies you know
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.680]  you they lie let me stop you that's the classified that tens of billions are
[12:52.680 --> 12:58.720]  spent by both parties a year in fake news and fake blocks right so you can't you
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.520]  can't find who they are you can't do them you can't so all these lies went out
[13:03.520 --> 13:07.120]  that I had perpetrated a host now look I have a silly little radio show I wasn't
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.400]  trying to say that when you know when I got waterboarded it was exactly what
[13:10.400 --> 13:13.880]  happened at Guantanamo Bay so people would say things like well was it a
[13:13.880 --> 13:19.160]  licensed torturer no no it was not did you have chains around you
[13:19.160 --> 13:24.520]  no here's what it was and this this is not the cameer Rouge method or anything
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.280]  else this is the CIA your legs have to be up your elevated your head back
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.160]  and water is poured in your nose and in your mouth that's it and so for them to
[13:33.160 --> 13:37.200]  try to discredit me I wasn't trying to do it exactly like at Guantanamo I was
[13:37.200 --> 13:41.120]  trying to prove that it was not torture I don't understand how they think I would
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.500]  fake it to prove myself wrong but the but the army field manual since the
[13:45.500 --> 13:50.000]  1960s says it's one of the most effective yeah forms of torture so
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.680]  there's never been a debate they just continue with an ignorant public right
[13:53.680 --> 13:57.640]  to tell them that it's a fun thing to happen and it's no big deal right I've
[13:57.640 --> 14:00.640]  talked to people that have been waterboarded they said it totally it
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.880]  just elicits the panic responses that would happen with you
[14:03.880 --> 14:09.280]  uh... alex it was horrific and it was instantaneous and and i get i went in
[14:09.280 --> 14:11.120]  like a punk
[14:11.120 --> 14:12.560]  laughing
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.720]  and i thought i could hold my breath for thirty seconds to a minute
[14:15.720 --> 14:17.400]  came over it's not torture
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.360]  and i want to tell you it was good night i read it felt like my brain had been
[14:22.360 --> 14:23.720]  short-circuited
[14:23.720 --> 14:27.720]  uh... i was up at night on my knees praying to god please i have two little
[14:27.720 --> 14:30.560]  daughters i just want to live i would have a chest pains
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.600]  uh... it mess with my body
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.520]  well describe what it did describe the process well i mean i mean it's good
[14:36.520 --> 14:37.960]  good
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.600]  uh... it is uh... i'm i'm laying back my legs are up my legs were bound to my
[14:42.600 --> 14:44.240]  hands were bound
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.280]  uh... they started to pour the the water you can see it on the internet but
[14:48.280 --> 14:51.160]  but they started to pour the water on i'm thinking okay
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.600]  and it went right into my nose and shut down my brain and man i wanted this
[14:55.600 --> 14:56.360]  and now
[14:56.360 --> 14:57.840]  down a little bit better
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.240]  they were saying eight-second that may actually have been short of eight
[15:00.240 --> 15:01.240]  seconds
[15:01.240 --> 15:05.280]  uh... it was it was something i wanted to stop look that's why we use it and
[15:05.280 --> 15:06.280]  again
[15:06.280 --> 15:08.080]  three people water boarded
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.560]  if we picked up somebody off of the battlefield we could save lives
[15:11.560 --> 15:13.440]  i think it's a bigger issue
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.080]  than what i can address
[15:15.080 --> 15:17.920]  i really do i think it's too big of an issue for me alex
[15:17.920 --> 15:21.120]  uh... should we do it look if it's going to save american lives i don't know i
[15:21.120 --> 15:22.320]  also want to tell you
[15:22.320 --> 15:24.160]  i'm sure you already know
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.000]  uh... about the manchester documents
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.960]  manchester documents found in manchester england where some of my favorite music
[15:30.960 --> 15:32.280]  comes out of
[15:32.280 --> 15:34.600]  and it was the al-qaeda playbook
[15:34.600 --> 15:37.600]  and they basically say no matter what
[15:37.600 --> 15:38.920]  claim torture
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.040]  so you know
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.280]  you give him too much cap crutch at guantanamo they claim torture
[15:43.280 --> 15:45.120]  they claim torture for everything so
[15:45.120 --> 15:48.800]  i i wanted to prove this was just another thing they claim torture about
[15:48.800 --> 15:51.360]  the acl you and leave with them everything else
[15:51.360 --> 15:53.740]  and i was going to prove that it wasn't torture so i don't know whether
[15:53.740 --> 15:57.240]  syndicate radio host who did well last week made a major headlines throughout
[15:57.240 --> 15:58.360]  this week for those that
[15:58.360 --> 16:00.640]  just joined us uh... having water boarded
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.760]  and coming out saying yes it's torture look this is and you know why they're
[16:03.760 --> 16:04.840]  attacking you
[16:04.840 --> 16:09.440]  it's because you have supported the view that it's not torture out and and
[16:09.440 --> 16:10.360]  supported
[16:10.360 --> 16:13.280]  go ahead and use harsh interrogation to quote
[16:13.280 --> 16:15.400]  you know when the war and save the military
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.000]  uh... lives but that's why this has been so damning to them
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.200]  obviously now you're seeing the disingenuousness
[16:22.200 --> 16:24.040]  and the deceptiveness
[16:24.040 --> 16:25.800]  uh... of these people
[16:25.800 --> 16:29.240]  uh... as uh... they're coming out and and and and now trying to discredit you
[16:29.240 --> 16:30.720]  and saying you're a liar
[16:30.720 --> 16:35.160]  uh... all because uh... when separately the p r firm
[16:35.160 --> 16:38.400]  at talk radio network you know totally separate in the company and i know how
[16:38.400 --> 16:39.440]  this stuff works
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.560]  they get you know the police show up saying you can't water boards they say
[16:42.560 --> 16:43.480]  don't worry
[16:43.480 --> 16:45.080]  it's just a hoax
[16:45.080 --> 16:48.600]  and then the now they're trying to spin that and we'll use that but but i mean
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.920]  that's asinine it's on video for the water down your nose the army admits it's
[16:52.920 --> 16:56.960]  torture but but i like that that's not exactly what happened look um...
[16:56.960 --> 16:59.040]  that the network that syndicate my show
[16:59.040 --> 17:01.040]  the police here in my city
[17:01.040 --> 17:03.920]  the company that runs my home base station
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.920]  uh... building management
[17:05.920 --> 17:08.120]  my insurance company
[17:08.120 --> 17:09.680]  everybody
[17:09.680 --> 17:10.240]  you know
[17:10.240 --> 17:14.520]  we talked about it for a few days and look i understand i i can't allow an
[17:14.520 --> 17:16.040]  employee to waterboard
[17:16.040 --> 17:17.440]  you could die
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.120]  i'm not going to allow one of my employees to waterboard with you alex
[17:21.120 --> 17:23.920]  hey i've already decided that i'll announce it now
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.680]  i'm gonna get an actual uh... somebody trained in it and i'm gonna be water
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.200]  boarded
[17:28.200 --> 17:31.160]  i'm gonna do it and i'm gonna uh... see if i can still hold out thirty
[17:31.160 --> 17:34.160]  seconds well but you know i hope you can and and maybe
[17:34.160 --> 17:36.520]  maybe you'll do a different version that i did my brother i'm gonna get the
[17:36.520 --> 17:39.240]  full deal i'm gonna have him stick my head completely
[17:39.240 --> 17:42.680]  the uh... see that's a field waterboarding that you got yeah the
[17:42.680 --> 17:44.120]  hardcore type
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.000]  have you seen conspiracy theory mel Gibson they put on a stretcher and stick
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.920]  his head in the water that was about you
[17:48.920 --> 17:51.880]  that's the real deal that movie was about you wasn't it
[17:51.880 --> 17:54.960]  no but that would be heraldson the woody heraldson character in the twenty
[17:54.960 --> 17:57.760]  twelve movie i've talked to him it is made but go ahead
[17:57.760 --> 17:59.880]  all right now i don't know whatever
[17:59.880 --> 18:03.920]  but we had to tell people that now we're not really going to do it because we
[18:03.920 --> 18:05.120]  didn't want to get shut down
[18:05.120 --> 18:07.240]  i understand the fact is we did it
[18:07.240 --> 18:10.280]  and it is uh... it is uh... it's horrific
[18:10.280 --> 18:13.560]  and uh... but should we use it save lives
[18:13.560 --> 18:17.160]  alexa is a tough one what do you think
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.120]  well i know that now that of our troops get captured foreign governments can
[18:21.120 --> 18:24.040]  torture them and say it's okay and i know that our founders figured out it
[18:24.040 --> 18:25.760]  was bad the british did it are
[18:25.760 --> 18:27.480]  uh... forefathers didn't
[18:27.480 --> 18:30.660]  uh... they spoke out against it said that they want to take the high road
[18:30.660 --> 18:33.360]  and torture gets you fake evidence
[18:33.360 --> 18:36.320]  like cleat shake mohammed saying he bombed buildings that were built three
[18:36.320 --> 18:38.360]  years after he was arrested
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.440]  uh... and i think it's a very very slippery slope
[18:41.440 --> 18:44.880]  and uh... certainly there's been some people you know exaggerating using it
[18:44.880 --> 18:46.840]  for political purposes but on the other hand
[18:46.840 --> 18:50.640]  the media hasn't really reported on the army's own report general to goomba's
[18:50.640 --> 18:51.520]  report
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.840]  about raping children in front of their parents of your god
[18:54.840 --> 18:57.240]  and so and so i'm against it
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.360]  uh... because i will lose our soul once we start down this road man don't you
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.000]  may be right you also do know that they look they did get good information as
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.360]  well out of waterboard
[19:07.360 --> 19:10.840]  they did get some good information but but look this is this is not a question
[19:10.840 --> 19:13.320]  for me honestly it's too heavy an issue for me
[19:13.320 --> 19:16.000]  you know i thought about doing waterboarding six months ago which is
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.520]  show how it's torture but it but
[19:17.520 --> 19:20.200]  it would be as effective i did it the fact that you didn't think it was
[19:20.200 --> 19:21.400]  torture was more effective
[19:21.400 --> 19:22.160]  i guess
[19:22.160 --> 19:24.440]  i guess look here's what i did learn
[19:24.440 --> 19:27.800]  and it's kind of what i've known for a long time as i looked behind the curtain
[19:27.800 --> 19:29.000]  of odds

[23:27.200 --> 23:30.600]  tax dollars to increase market share paying fat dividends are you wondering
[23:30.600 --> 23:33.840]  why supplies of gold and silver coins decreasing rapidly leaving the public

[24:08.040 --> 24:11.920]  Eric Mancow Muller
[24:11.920 --> 24:19.880]  has now had the dirty deeds done to him by the establishment media coming out
[24:19.880 --> 24:23.960]  saying he's a liar it's not torture that he staged all of that
[24:23.960 --> 24:27.880]  but clearly you can see that either he's an academy award actor or it was
[24:27.880 --> 24:31.560]  certainly upsetting you can see the water being poured down his nose by a
[24:31.560 --> 24:35.600]  strapping marine and they go well he's not a professional torture I mean it's
[24:35.600 --> 24:40.880]  very simple the you know you went off with the CIA you know says the the this
[24:40.880 --> 24:45.880]  is the way you do it yeah I love this you know and it is a right-wing thing and
[24:45.880 --> 24:51.000]  I'm a libertarian left or right you can keep it it is interesting as a look my
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.720]  dad was the the mayor of the Lakers New Jersey this is where the Hindenburg went
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.520]  down which political party would he belong to I wonder if some of these are
[24:58.520 --> 25:02.240]  liberals if they if they ever actually read anything that their hero wrote or
[25:02.240 --> 25:08.640]  said I'm talking about JFK they would be considered crazy nowadays really this
[25:08.640 --> 25:13.360]  this nation has turned into one big party as I said everybody says left or
[25:13.360 --> 25:17.600]  right but they're all the same the powers that be and and so it's really
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.760]  amazing this Oz like curtain of Washington is before we went to break I
[25:20.760 --> 25:24.440]  was talking about this I've seen behind the curtain folks and let me assure you
[25:24.440 --> 25:29.320]  they all suck to pick a side is like picking between after a lung cancer
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.160]  okay so you vote anyway you want it doesn't matter they want your money and
[25:33.160 --> 25:36.400]  they want more and more crippling regulations that keep in the driver's
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.240]  seat the whole time they talk about how you know they're doing it for your
[25:39.240 --> 25:43.080]  children they take your freedoms as they're doing it for your children so
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.560]  here I am in Obama land I'm in Chicago I've watched this movie surrounded by
[25:47.560 --> 25:51.640]  low-life sweet talk is way to the White House and I can't believe that people
[25:51.640 --> 25:56.240]  believe that Obama like Christ walked across the cesspool of corrupt
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.400]  Windy City politics into the most powerful office in the world I mean
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.420]  people need to grow up so here I did this waterboarding I upset at the
[26:03.420 --> 26:08.680]  political apple cart in America it may be career suicide because I dared to ask
[26:08.680 --> 26:13.840]  questions look I wanted to prove that it was not torture and I discovered to my
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.960]  surprise that it was torture so instantly everyone hated me
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.520]  democrat republican life right the bleeding heart liberal thought it was
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.480]  some conservative trick and we were laughing at the republicans felt they
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.800]  were betrayed the fact is and that's because the democrats are so deeply
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.120]  involved in it that they all have to cover up the new policy knew I'm waiting
[26:34.120 --> 26:37.480]  for someone with a sandwich board to walk up and down the streets of
[26:37.480 --> 26:42.160]  Washington and have it say Pelosi knew that's exactly right look the Bush
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.440]  regime everybody signed off on it Pelosi knew the dummy craps knew so it is
[26:46.440 --> 26:50.160]  cover your ass season right now in Washington DC yes this shatters the
[26:50.160 --> 26:53.360]  left-right paradigm and and man calvin closing I want you to fire your
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.120]  website and we're folks in here show but I know what's incredible is we knew a
[26:57.120 --> 27:00.760]  year ago he was gonna set up youth brigades and red and black uniforms and
[27:00.760 --> 27:05.600]  but now the military ads with them doing military marches are on TV and now
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.840]  they've introduced bills to totally ban entire classes of firearms they've
[27:09.840 --> 27:13.200]  introduced the cyber bullying act they've got Hannah Montana in character
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.280]  pushing arresting someone I mean this makes the hate crime stuff pale in
[27:17.280 --> 27:22.760]  comparison I mean this is even amazing me how fast it's moving man Cal Muller
[27:22.760 --> 27:26.840]  your comments on that what is going on too many things to comment on my

[42:03.280 --> 42:09.080]  reserve oversight away from real scrutiny and secret Aaron Dykes points out
[42:09.080 --> 42:12.080]  the obvious but it's finally the mainstream news stuff we put in the
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.760]  Obama deception Aaron did a great report up at info wars dot com and
[42:16.760 --> 42:22.760]  everybody should see just a child with a temper is what they're saying about the
[42:22.760 --> 42:28.240]  policeman who on video in New York in yonkers beat this woman had to death
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.320]  breaking her job blacking both their eyes bruises all over her body slamming
[42:32.320 --> 42:38.160]  her head repeatedly in the concrete pools of blood for no reason and he's
[42:38.160 --> 42:42.360]  been found not guilty and they say this is good and there's all these videos
[42:42.360 --> 42:46.000]  coming out of cops running up the suspects who have their hands spread out
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.800]  eagle and kicking them savagely hard enough to kill them heads flying back
[42:51.800 --> 42:55.880]  blood spewing and the police come on the news and laugh and say we call this
[42:55.880 --> 43:00.280]  adjusting their head and then they even laugh on TV it's it's funny that you've
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.240]  been given the green light to go absolutely wild I heard local news
[43:04.240 --> 43:14.200]  defending the police shooting two black men in the back asleep in a car and then
[43:14.200 --> 43:17.560]  the police keep saying on the news we thought he was reaching for a gun and
[43:17.560 --> 43:21.400]  the news comes out and says he had a gun you already the police report there was
[43:21.400 --> 43:26.160]  no gun they don't care they put it out on the news that he had a gun
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.120]  again it's the same news that tells you it's the law to take vaccines when it's not
[43:30.120 --> 43:35.200]  it's all about deception all about lying so the talking point out in Austin is a
[43:35.200 --> 43:40.280]  federal lawsuit's been filed goes like this oh this bad family suing over the
[43:40.280 --> 43:45.080]  fact their son was shot in the back and killed in cold blood that's gonna cost
[43:45.080 --> 43:51.520]  taxpayers money no having mad dog out of control cops is gonna cost us money
[43:51.520 --> 43:57.120]  that's what's gonna cost us money so see oh we're with the police poor things oh
[43:57.120 --> 44:00.640]  there's a suit and they were literally demonizing the family on two different
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.720]  talkstations I tuned into driving into work it was unbelievable and then they
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.880]  went on to say oh well this guy had been arrested before for drugs and so the
[44:10.880 --> 44:16.280]  callers were saying good killing all the CIA ships the drugs and openly caught
[44:16.280 --> 44:23.480]  routinely the big banks openly launder the money but that's okay but if anybody's
[44:23.480 --> 44:28.880]  ever had an arrest for drugs he had an arrest not a conviction kill him and I've
[44:28.880 --> 44:35.560]  heard people say you shouldn't be out at night kill him kill kill everybody this
[44:35.560 --> 44:42.640]  is the attitude this is the attitude now when your son or daughter gets killed
[44:42.640 --> 44:46.160]  by the police it won't be so funny but see you'll have the local news and the
[44:46.160 --> 44:53.760]  media and the police lobby out there telling you it's a great thing and it
[44:53.760 --> 45:01.880]  goes on and on and of course the squad car videos malfunctioned just like they
[45:01.880 --> 45:11.120]  said the subway train video malfunctioned out in Oakland and then
[45:11.120 --> 45:16.320]  witnesses said no that he was in handcuffs they shot the guy in the back and
[45:16.320 --> 45:21.080]  the police said the public's lying they're nothing but liars we've done
[45:21.080 --> 45:32.840]  nothing wrong everything's fine and this went on and on for a while then they
[45:32.840 --> 45:38.480]  said oh the surveillance cameras in the subway system the train train station
[45:38.480 --> 45:43.520]  they malfunctioned they weren't working kind of like 7 7 and Madrid and every
[45:43.520 --> 45:49.920]  other terror attack and in the Pentagon and the Fed seizing all the cameras from
[45:49.920 --> 45:56.200]  9 11 in lower Manhattan and in Austin you know they shoot you in the back all
[45:56.200 --> 46:06.080]  the cameras weren't weren't on and then it turned out with that case in
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.720]  California the police lied oh my goodness because a train was driving by
[46:11.720 --> 46:17.800]  and what is the train video pickup the train on the other platform the police
[46:17.800 --> 46:20.640]  didn't think to stop that train and go in and confiscate all the cell phone
[46:20.640 --> 46:27.600]  videos several people shot the entire thing you have police run up and say
[46:27.600 --> 46:33.440]  lay down and these young men who came back from a fireworks display lay down
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.960]  somebody called in a fist fight on a train turned out these were not the
[46:36.960 --> 46:40.720]  guys but they're black so you know the news is kind of like I go ahead and
[46:40.720 --> 46:44.120]  kill him you know because everybody knows all blacks are criminals according to
[46:44.120 --> 46:50.080]  the media and so they lay down and then they put this one guy in handcuffs and
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.040]  he's kind of look you know leaning up off his chest saying come on man I'm to
[46:55.040 --> 46:58.600]  shove my head in the ground and then they put him in handcuffs and then the cop
[46:58.600 --> 47:02.320]  just pulls his gun out shoots him in the back bullet goes through him bounces off
[47:02.320 --> 47:06.440]  the concrete back up to his chest and the police then go around slamming his
[47:06.440 --> 47:11.960]  head in the ground and roughing him up kind of having a little victory assault
[47:11.960 --> 47:15.320]  that they just killed him and the guy was obviously feeding off of this and
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.200]  getting off so they slam him down on the ground some more and then go around
[47:19.200 --> 47:23.200]  grabbing everybody cell phone cameras to cover up the murder and then the train
[47:23.200 --> 47:31.840]  pulls off and that's all we see and we got the police reports now at Oklahoma
[47:31.840 --> 47:37.320]  and we got the local witness reports they all match people that were coming out
[47:37.320 --> 47:41.520]  of businesses and saw the whole altercation the police in Oklahoma just pull
[47:41.520 --> 47:44.560]  over an ambulance with a woman who's collapsed of heat exhaustion complaining
[47:44.560 --> 47:49.960]  thought it was a heart attack and they run up and start pushing the EMT that
[47:49.960 --> 47:52.960]  gets out and the guy's going what's going on here the cops are screaming you
[47:52.960 --> 47:56.120]  should have got out of my way and he's like I couldn't because it was traffic
[47:56.120 --> 47:59.080]  in front of him the cops on a power trip turns out he's going after ambulance
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.800]  is not once but twice last time with a pregnant woman in the back he just
[48:03.800 --> 48:06.400]  doesn't like the fact that the ambulance is don't get out of his way it's a god
[48:06.400 --> 48:13.080]  complex his daddy's the local judge and all that you know classic story and so
[48:13.080 --> 48:16.200]  the other EMT says well I guess I'll help this lady so he's in the back
[48:16.200 --> 48:19.240]  helping her in the cops run up and say do not help her you're under arrest and
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.120]  the EMT looks like he's crazy he says what are you talking about this is an
[48:23.120 --> 48:27.840]  ambulance and the cops start shoving him and he's like hey man EMT says what's
[48:27.840 --> 48:31.440]  your problem it's all on video we've played it here what's your problem I'm
[48:31.440 --> 48:35.320]  in this is an ambulance he's sick I'm gonna help her so the cop grabs him by
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.400]  the arm tries to pull it behind his back to torture him and the EMT pulls his
[48:40.400 --> 48:43.080]  hand back well that's the assault that's why they say they're gonna go ahead and
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.760]  charge the EMT he pulls his hand back from the mad dog and lunatic see now the
[48:48.760 --> 48:52.240]  ambulances have got it got a you know maybe be shot seeing it next it'll be
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.400]  gunning them down it'll be well they need to die oh and they shot the patient
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.080]  too they deserve it you know this is how we do it to keep you safe this is
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.720]  mental illness this is tyranny it always happens the power goes to their
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.640]  head so then the cops start choking the EMT and the EMT figures out boy they're
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.120]  about to kill me so he totally controls himself lets them choking and is saying
[49:16.120 --> 49:20.880]  you're choking me you're choking me you're choking me and then finally the
[49:20.880 --> 49:27.800]  cops settle down look like reality comes to them and they start patting the sun
[49:27.800 --> 49:31.600]  it was falling the ambulance on the back saying the son's like will you just
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.640]  please let my mother go to the hospital and the cops kind of notice how crazy
[49:35.640 --> 49:38.560]  they are and they go okay let's go to the hospital and they take him to the
[49:38.560 --> 49:41.640]  hospital and don't arrest anybody but then the higher-ups say look we got to
[49:41.640 --> 49:45.320]  charge people we got to cover this up bubba you did it again what's your
[49:45.320 --> 49:48.680]  what's your thing with ambulances you know that's happening at the state
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.400]  police office going oh you know look out he saw an ambulance like a bird dog
[49:53.400 --> 49:58.600]  seeing a you know a bird or a rabbit this is like the dogs the dog track with
[49:58.600 --> 50:06.800]  the electronic rabbit that that release that they chase but the issue is this
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.480]  guy wasn't off the force the last two times he pulled over ambulances with
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.600]  their lights on and he's gonna keep doing it and he's gonna keep doing it and
[50:14.600 --> 50:21.680]  the police are gonna go on TV and say it's normal because the system wants to
[50:21.680 --> 50:25.880]  defend their minions and they want them to know no matter what you do in this
[50:25.880 --> 50:30.520]  coming tyranny you're gonna be backed up and so the police are gonna become
[50:30.520 --> 50:36.840]  universally hated and the good cops are gonna leave and it's gonna get worse

[54:08.520 --> 54:16.600]  back in April Salon reported top Senate Democrat bankers owned the U.S. and
[54:16.600 --> 54:25.280]  Congress and that was said by Senator Dick Durbin on local Chicago radio we
[54:25.280 --> 54:35.320]  played that clip here on air now a another member of the Congress has gone
[54:35.320 --> 54:41.640]  public headline banks run Congress top Democrats says this is out of raw
[54:41.640 --> 54:47.120]  story it doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that the banking and
[54:47.120 --> 54:54.360]  financial services industry has an outsized influence in Congress Wells
[54:54.360 --> 55:00.000]  Fargo city group and JPMorgan Chase each got bailouts of 25 billion in
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.040]  government bailouts last year Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs got 10
[55:05.040 --> 55:10.320]  billion a piece and AIG the mammoth insurer that lost billions in bad
[55:10.320 --> 55:15.120]  derivatives debts had sucked in more than 170 billion yeah and then they paid
[55:15.120 --> 55:21.040]  that out to the before mentioned banks and broken firms meanwhile President
[55:21.040 --> 55:31.800]  Barack Obama is in a recent bailouts speech in California Colin Patterson
[55:31.800 --> 55:35.280]  Democratic chairman of the Agriculture Committee says he knows who to blame
[55:35.280 --> 55:41.720]  the banks run the place Peterson told the New York Times in money's edition I
[55:41.720 --> 55:46.080]  will tell you what the problem is they give three times more money than the
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.920]  next biggest group it's huge the amount of money they put into politics and he
[55:49.920 --> 55:55.200]  went on from there and here's the problem they will run around advertising
[55:55.200 --> 55:59.400]  that they own everything they will lobby to pass laws to restrict political
[55:59.400 --> 56:03.440]  giving and right in loopholes where only they can give money that's how these
[56:03.440 --> 56:09.760]  people operate the big banks financed the campaign finance reform bill that
[56:09.760 --> 56:13.680]  double the amount of money that big corporations could give but restricted
[56:13.680 --> 56:19.160]  what individual citizens could get I mean it never ends with these criminals so
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.200]  I thought I'd cover that more on the GM situation coming up right now let's go
[56:24.200 --> 56:27.400]  ahead and start taking some of your phone calls John in Texas you're on the
[56:27.400 --> 56:36.240]  air welcome hello yes sir hi Alex I have a story I wanted to tell you I bought a
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.160]  book a while back called the Forsaken and it was about the Stalin purges all
[56:41.160 --> 56:43.800]  the Americans and went to work for the Ford Motor Company in Russia and they
[56:43.800 --> 56:50.320]  got caught up in a purges yes so anyway in the book they had a story told about
[56:50.320 --> 56:54.160]  Stalin and a secret policeman went to room when they were laughing and laughing
[56:54.160 --> 56:57.480]  and they said the reason they were laughing they said Stalin had tears in his
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.680]  eyes because the secret policeman was telling about one of the Communist Party
[57:00.680 --> 57:07.320]  officials that Stalin had arrested and had shot and the guy was telling
[57:07.320 --> 57:11.640]  Stalin maybe couldn't hold a guy was on his knees pleading for his life and and
[57:11.640 --> 57:17.640]  so anyway a while after that it said that after that storm three weeks later
[57:17.640 --> 57:22.000]  Stalin had that secret policeman arrested shot too and that's you name the
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.400]  dictatorship that's the kind of stuff that goes on and that's what we're
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.120]  heading right now through all these cops up there all these government
[57:28.120 --> 57:32.920]  officials I think they're part of the program well they better think again most
[57:32.920 --> 57:37.440]  of them are weak-minded and believe their own propaganda but yes these
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.800]  predatory systems statistically attack their own more often than they even go
[57:42.800 --> 57:47.520]  after those that are fighting them and I refuse to live on my knees I refuse to
[57:47.520 --> 57:51.480]  lick the boots of the government I refuse to be a surf and a slave I will

[58:01.560 --> 58:05.440]  they can use torture here in the United States on people and people will be
[58:05.440 --> 58:09.200]  struggling to shoulder and say well no no no no no it's worse than that they call
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.040]  it pain compliance or pressure compliance it's in the extras of my film

[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:00.320]  everything's great and peachy and wonderful and i was wondering if you guys
[1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:04.600]  managed to take up a clip of of that particular event
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:06.680]  because i couldn't find anything

[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:31.000]  clip and i think maybe you guys uh... but that i didn't see in the tax of the

[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:04.880]  many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the united states

[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:10.120]  was just thinking we need to get Mike Rivera on for a couple hours on Jason

[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.720]  news and information before I go to the illustrious Mike Rivera who by the way
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:23.000]  has his own great what really happened on com t-shirts you should get in

[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:32.440]  the Gadsden flag don't tread on me unite or die live free or die this same
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:37.320]  image of the rattlesnake had all three things under it on different flags but
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:41.240]  this is the most popular used by the Marine Corps and the army now listed by
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:48.240]  the feds as terrorism and as a reason to be taken into jail now that's in the
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.880]  homeland security and my act documents I have to tell you I've been wearing these
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:57.280]  in public I've been wearing the Minuteman shirt in public and later if I have
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:02.840]  time I'll tell stories literally I was at the IGA food place at like 9 30 at
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:09.120]  night when I was down at the beach buying pancake mix and milk and I and I was
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:13.560]  buying a pad of paper that was writing notes and this is just one of many
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:19.320]  stories and I was wearing the shirt that said live free or die on it similar
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:23.160]  to this Patriot shirt we have with the M4s wear to identify yourself with
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:26.960]  liberty lovers and to meet like-minded people and I have all the sudden I had
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:31.120]  a security guard walk up nobody's around me the place is almost empty as I'm
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:35.640]  putting stuff in the cart pins a little pad of paper actually buying this this
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:39.200]  pad right here and he came up and looked in front of my shirt looked at my back
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:42.520]  and almost said something to him but I was all sunburn and brain dead and just
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.040]  wanted to go home and go to sleep you go back to the back of the cabin and I
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:48.800]  just kind of let him do it and you know look at it the front and back of the
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:51.800]  shirt and then he kind of stood down act like he was looking at something and
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:55.760]  walked off because see they all get the reports you got to watch somebody that's
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:58.760]  got a minute man on their shirt you got to watch people that talk about the
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:02.520]  Bill of Rights and Constitution so I hope everybody will get the shirt and I
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:06.440]  hope we'll all wear it it's available at info wars dot com and stop being such
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:10.240]  cowardly slaves if we give into the chilling effect and give into this
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:14.960]  demonization then they're gonna win but they are the cooks that security guard
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.360]  was a cook the off-duty cops with their wives walking on the beach that would
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:22.400]  stop it and look at the shirts and they'd be walking and looking and and then
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:26.120]  kind of scared and some of these guys were big guys you know high and tight
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:29.440]  air cuts and they kind of read it and look and I'd go hi how you doing they
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:35.120]  go I mean here's one of them he's with the founders he's with liberty he's with
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  freedom he's with the Bill of Rights he's one of them oh my god he wants to
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.200]  kill me he wants to and you know in a way it is it is true that we're gonna be
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:46.720]  enemies you've chosen evil you know the Soviet Nazi way we've chosen the
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.640]  Republic and so we are I guess enemies of the New World Order and I you know
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:55.200]  it's gonna be a hot war and I guess they realize I'm wearing the wrong colors
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:58.960]  I'm wearing American colors you know these guys just wrap themselves in the
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:03.920]  flags they don't live it they just use the flag as an excuse to urinate all
[1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:07.920]  over what this country stands for so let me tell you they are scared of these and
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:10.920]  these federal reports have gone out to the smallest departments and you want to
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:16.960]  see a vampire you know having holy water thrown on them or a cross this is the
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:21.940]  shirt because this is a ghost every time they would see the minute man on my
[1:12:21.940 --> 1:12:25.480]  shirt the other shirt but let's punch that up for folks it was as if they had
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:29.800]  seen a ghost and I guess it was liberty and freedom is dying there were
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:32.560]  homeland security trucks driving up and down the beach you try to go to the
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:35.800]  national seashore they got license plate scanners everywhere they asked you
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:39.360]  questions about why you're going to the national seashore this country is going
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:44.320]  into tyranny micro vero good to have you joining us from Hawaii sir Aloha
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:49.280]  Nui Nui Nui what do you think of my contraband shirt I mean I'm evil well
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:53.040]  absolutely absolutely you are and it looks really good on you I have to say
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:58.080]  that it's some of the shirts that we have you know we get these mixed
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:02.560]  reactions to pretty much everyone sort of gives a stink face with the eat the
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:07.080]  rich t-shirts but the one about I survived the bush economy and all I have
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:10.880]  left is this lousy t-shirt that one tends to get a lot of laughs but while I
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.960]  was listening to I have a suggestion and I'll probably do this on on my t-shirts
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.560]  and you should do it on yours is just something where instead of sort of
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:23.240]  being this confrontational image of us and them is it to include them into the
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:27.440]  issue such as bailout means you are now on the hook for a hundred thousand
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:31.400]  dollars so when they're the cops are looking at that t-shirt they start
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:35.000]  thinking yeah that means me as well the government is sticking me with all these
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.040]  hundreds of thousands of dollars of bills to give to the bank and maybe start
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:42.960]  pulling them over a little bit more to our side rather than justifying their
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:46.520]  paranoia in their defensiveness well no I agree with you in fact I didn't
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:50.200]  confront the security guard but I mean he came up he was acting like he was
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:53.720]  buying something then he walked right over and looked at my shirt and then
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:58.160]  looked at the back because they looked at me on surveillance camera and you know
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:02.440]  come down to see this dangerous person with a minute man on his shirt God
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:07.040]  forbid I wear this yellow one in public but I thought that was made up and
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:12.320]  exaggerated but I had all these shirts printed up and now I'm wearing them
[1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:17.360]  around town other places and I'm experiencing it where where I mean
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:21.440]  these cops have really been brainwashed and exactly they're having their futures
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:26.480]  destroyed as well Mike they should want to stand with the Gadsden flag they
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:32.400]  should want to stand with Paul Revere I mean how is Paul Revere bad well you're
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:35.960]  absolutely right and and the point is I think we need to start rethinking our
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:39.120]  approach to the ordinary man in the street police because you're right they've
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:42.320]  been brainwashed they've been given all these reports that say anybody wearing
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:47.480]  any of these t-shirts we're the bad guys so rather than reinforce that I think we
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:52.280]  need to rethink some of our designs to where we say we're you and I are really
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:56.240]  the same against this common enemy do you have a half million dollars lying
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:00.160]  around you're not doing anything with because that's your share of the federal
[1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.840]  government's debt that they've borrowed and stuck you with the payments and
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:07.880]  obviously it needs to be rendered much more simple and elegant for a t-shirt but
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:11.520]  the idea is that if we don't reinforce these preconceptions they've been
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:15.880]  brainwashed with we stand a much better chance of drawing them over to our side
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:21.640]  of the issues well I agree with you a lot's going on Greg Palast and others
[1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:26.640]  are reporting basically breaking down the same thing that we've said because we
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:31.320]  have a government documents GM was planning years ago to move to China and
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:37.960]  Brazil and just you know to become completely global the media keeps
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:41.720]  billing it as if it's a bankruptcy and and socialism and a government bailout
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:46.120]  it's not it's just like tax incentives for companies to leave the United States
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:51.280]  this is a tax incentive and under the NAFTA and GATT rules under the World
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:59.040]  Trade Organization rules general motors cannot use bailout money to carry out
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:04.560]  U.S. operations it has to be open to bidding and be spread out globally and
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:08.680]  that's why they said they can't use the economic stimulus money domestically it
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:14.200]  has to be spent internationally and so to see GM fall to see Chrysler fall in
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:19.800]  the last month to see the government now saying they're going to buy up basically
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:25.400]  the newspapers where do you see all this going microvaro well I noticed this
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:28.960]  morning that our manufacturing index continues to decline in the bottom line
[1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:32.440]  fundamental truth is if you're not making products to sell you cannot save the
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:37.320]  economy I it really does seem as if the government simply wants to buy up and
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:43.720]  own everything it's amazing the the USSR fell and Russia became capitalist now we
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.160]  seem to be heading into this totally a communistic socialistic fascistic
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:51.880]  state where the government will own everything will all be technically
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:55.960]  government employees but the bottom line is if we're not manufacturing if we're
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.360]  not making products to sell we can't save this economy we just can't and
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:04.360]  every day we get another news report about how the banks are showing profits
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:07.480]  not because they're really profitable but they're playing more of these book
[1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:12.440]  keeping tricks to take all of these huge losses they're absorbing and somehow
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:15.520]  through the magic of numbers turn them around and say see this is really a
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:21.200]  profit by my stock and it's it's rigging and gaming and patchovers I don't think
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.160]  this economy can be saved and I'm starting to come around more and more to
[1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:28.480]  this idea that you've been promoting that this has to be intentional that
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:32.080]  there's got to be something else behind it because government can't I government
[1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.400]  is generally stupid I will grant you they can't be this stupid that they
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:39.320]  don't understand that taking the jobs away from working-class America and the
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:43.000]  clients away from the middle class is what is pulling down our economy from
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.680]  the foundation upward well the reason that I've known this was by design was
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:53.000]  because Mike and I know you're you're not a dull knife yourself there in the
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.920]  drawer that the IMF and World Bank are the international fronts for the private
[1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:01.200]  banking family syndicates that on the Federal Reserve the Bank of England the
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:05.120]  Buddhist Bank and others on record and they go around and do the same thing
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:08.680]  they're doing to the West they've done to third-world countries in Latin America
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:14.000]  in Africa in Asia in the Middle East though the Middle East you know knew
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.400]  what this was and hasn't been as trusting and so they're not being as hurt as bad
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:22.120]  by it so they get the old-fashioned military invasion because they won't be
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:26.040]  economically captured Serbia wouldn't take a globalist-controlled central bank
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:29.840]  so you saw what happened there they hired a bunch of Muslims to attack them
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:33.160]  then when they defended themselves they said oh look they're evil and then you
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:38.860]  know al-Qaeda the CIA's favorite attack dog you know winning against him so this
[1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:44.400]  happens over and over again that's how we know that it's engineer then we have
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:47.840]  all their different IMF and World Bank documents where they talk about how they
[1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:52.040]  want to bring in this crisis offer the solution and George Soros is bragging
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:55.360]  about how he loves this is the culmination of his life he's having a
[1:18:55.360 --> 1:19:00.480]  great crisis it is it's rather amazing but you know where I think they're going
[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:03.640]  to stumble on this is I think most people around the world are recognizing
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:08.360]  that what turned an American economic downturn into a global catastrophe was
[1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:12.280]  globalism that all this interlinking between countries and I think when they
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:16.000]  stand up there and say we need more globalism as the solution I think a lot
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:19.120]  of people are going to get they're going to be very very distrustful of this
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:21.960]  they're going to balk they're going to say this doesn't make any sense you know
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.840]  if we've got a house on fire over here let's not go down the street chop up the
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:29.160]  other houses and throw the wood on the fire to try and put it out which is
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:34.000]  basically what globalism amounts to absolutely you know there's a host of
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:37.960]  issues discussed with Mike Rivera today in the 40 minutes we have left with him
[1:19:37.960 --> 1:19:43.160]  we're also going to be taking your calls at 1-800-25-99-231 but Mike when we
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:46.400]  come back what are some of the issues you think are most important you'd like to
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:50.480]  discuss today well I obviously the torture scandal is not going to be going
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:54.280]  away anytime soon we we definitely need to deal with that we definitely need to
[1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:58.960]  deal with the fact that the the the US government's handling of the economy is
[1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.720]  exactly opposite what I said they're surrounded by a harmful indoor air that
[1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:07.120]  can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies take a deep

[1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:14.080]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.240]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:23.040]  American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:27.280]  election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:32.920]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:39.520]  oligarchs that's fascist it's not about left or right it's about a one-world
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:45.720]  government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his

[1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:06.280]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years
[1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:11.520]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:15.720]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw free
[1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:19.280]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:23.840]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation in higher taxes these questions and
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:27.120]  more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book the creature from
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:31.120]  Jekyll Island congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:35.640]  know about central bank power a gripping adventure into the secret world of
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:39.520]  international banking cartel hi this is Ted Anderson I will give a silver

[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:03.280]  less than a century ago half of the American public grew much of their own
[1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:07.680]  food today it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:12.440]  food during a great depression over 18 million people suffered from starvation
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:16.600]  and as America continues down its current path for many the reality of
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:20.920]  another depression is a very serious concern with massive layoffs and
[1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:25.120]  unemployment at record levels growing your own food will help you save money
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:29.080]  that you'd normally spend at the grocery store invest in your family's future by

[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:44.560]  I'm just glad that I'm not buffalo, bamboozled, hoodwinked, shanghaied, conned and
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:48.480]  manipulated I'm glad that I know who the global star what their plan is and I'm
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:53.280]  aware of it and I have a desire as Thomas Jefferson said to set bushfires
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:57.680]  in the minds of many women everywhere to realize what's really happening yeah the
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:01.040]  torture issue isn't going away because they tried to say it isn't torture but
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:04.320]  everybody knows waterboarding and raping people's children in front of them as the
[1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:07.800]  army's own reported myths is torture now it comes out what we already knew the
[1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:13.360]  Democrats were complicit all along and going along with this bush protects them
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:17.440]  when they're out of office they protect him when he's out of office and really I
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:22.200]  think the illusion that was Obama is now imploding you know even Lou Rockwell was
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:25.720]  on the show Friday and he said he had supported Obama early on believing all
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:30.480]  this crap you had done that but I think now the fact that we've all been
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:34.440]  betrayed only illustrates how both parties are controlled where do you see
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:40.320]  this torture scandal going well it's it's going to keep on growing it's going
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:46.080]  to go on festering I think Barack Obama committed a major mistake by trying to
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.440]  block the release of these most recent photographs because first of all it shows
[1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:54.400]  he's he's an accessory after the fact in in war crimes he's complicit in the
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:58.000]  cover-up and more to the point now that he's gone to the Supreme Court and
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:01.880]  they've given him an additional 30 days to file documents regarding whether or
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:05.920]  not these pictures should be sealed it gives the world another 30 days to let
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:10.360]  their imaginations run free about what the pictures might show and after 30
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:14.520]  days no matter what pictures are released people are going to assume they've been
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:18.160]  altered they've been airbrushed they've been faked they've been sanitized so it's
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:22.280]  just made matters all that much worse we're getting con confirmation reports
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:26.960]  from other sources that these pictures do indeed show the sexual assault of
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:31.560]  people and the bottom line is that the u.s. government's credibility on the
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.680]  torture issue or the enhanced interrogation is that somehow these
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:39.520]  people deserved it and that somehow these methods were necessary to protect
[1:26:39.520 --> 1:26:44.280]  lives but when you get into situations of children being sodomized in front of
[1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:47.360]  their mothers nobody's going to believe that that had anything to do with
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:51.560]  protecting national security and the bottom line is behind all of it the
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:55.840]  real core issue that is the most protected point in the scandal is the
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:59.480]  fact that you know we we've had a chainies come out and bid it iraq had
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:02.840]  nothing to do with nine eleven we all know there were no weapons of mass
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:07.280]  destruction the entire war in iraq hinged on the claim that iraq was a
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:13.160]  ting al-qaeda we now know that was based on a single confession extracted under
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.200]  torture and as soon as the torture was over the guy retracted the confession
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.040]  and said look i just said that to get you to stop
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:22.600]  and now that of course people trying to find out
[1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:26.320]  just how we got into iraq this individual has conveniently committed
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:28.840]  suicide or been suicided
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:29.680]  and so
[1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:33.800]  this is the real scandal behind it all forget all the the sodomy and the rape
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:37.920]  and all the rest of the stuff is the fact that the entire war in iraq and
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:41.960]  four thousand dead americans and thousands more crippled was based on a
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:47.040]  confession extracted under torture we had no real legitimate reason to be there
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:52.640]  we have no real legitimate reason to remain why are we still in there why is
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:56.440]  obama talking about extending our true presence there strengthening our true
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:00.480]  presence there another hundred billion dollar war appropriation just past
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:06.920]  congress why what are we doing there the entire war is based on a lie we are the
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.760]  bad guys we are the aggressors in this current war and if you look at the
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:15.240]  history of the twentieth century every major war was ultimately lost by the
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:19.400]  country that started it so guess where that sets us up i'm not surprised our
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:24.880]  soldiers are committing suicide in such numbers they know they're the bad guys
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:27.240]  well it's it's amazing to see
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:29.160]  to see this unfolding
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:31.760]  and on top of that
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:35.120]  the media is playing a game here when they act like they didn't know it was
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:38.240]  torture and they have a debate about whether it's torture or not
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:41.960]  or whether torture was ordered we have all the white house memos
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.520]  but before we had the orders and before we found out polosi was in on it
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:50.400]  and that she tried to you know lie about that
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:53.720]  i remember in the three or four months of nine eleven washington post articles
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:55.520]  that are in my film road to tyranny
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:58.600]  where they thought they had the public where they wanted them with ninety
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:01.120]  plus percent approval rating so they tried to sell
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:03.240]  pure evil at that point
[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:05.040]  and it said
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:07.000]  detainees children
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.800]  uh... being used to get answers
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:12.480]  and then it said we're quote putting pressure
[1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:14.760]  in the article and on to say torture
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:16.800]  of children in front of their parents
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:18.200]  to get answers
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:21.760]  and so i don't ever forget being out in hollywood is because i was going on a
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:25.520]  national tv show out there
[1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:28.160]  and i forget the hotel room watching a
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:31.960]  press conference with rumsfeld bragging how they were torturing why does it the
[1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:34.280]  media go get
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:38.160]  all those clips of him saying that all those articles and then there's no more
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:41.480]  debate we arrest these people because the whole government both parties are
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:42.400]  involved

[1:30:12.040 --> 1:30:15.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:19.640]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:21.840]  technology is coming number three
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:25.200]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.160]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:31.520]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:35.520]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number five

[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:12.000]  called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:15.840]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and

[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:30.320]  time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:33.560]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants proto

[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:41.400]  having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of
[1:34:41.400 --> 1:34:44.680]  nutrient dense food to feed your loved ones there have been a lot of times in
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:49.600]  US history pilgrims for example when seeds at the highest value barter item of
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:53.280]  anything out there there's a war on against non-hybrid seeds you know they
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:57.000]  pass a law in Europe or you have a license to own them waged by the global
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.760]  elite and want to control us by controlling the food supply governments
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:04.480]  are storing seeds the UN is storing seeds globalist of every stripe or
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:08.880]  storing seeds near the Arctic Circle why do you think this is you know why
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:13.640]  control and power solutions from science is trying to get the seeds out of the
[1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:16.800]  globalist hands into the hands of the people one seed bank at a time check out

[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:37.280]  okay let us now go back to Mike Rivera Mike shifting gears to Europe here the
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:41.520]  establishment and the Bilderberg group was in the new in the EU observer and
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:46.080]  other papers a few months ago as I'm sure you saw being a newshound bragging
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.920]  at the end of the on the chairman of the bill very all we set up the Eurobike
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:52.920]  covert action we're setting up the North American Union by covert action the
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:57.400]  transatlantic treaty organization signed by George Bush in 2007 that's all
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:01.760]  covered in game it's all out in the open and they laugh at us publicly knowing
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:06.360]  most people don't read the newspaper and then spinning it that it's all for our
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:10.840]  own good here they just deny we're in North American Union though under treaty
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:16.480]  we've been in one since 2005 and then we have to fight for years admitting that
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:20.520]  there's a nap a super highway going in in Texas the media denies it exists then
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:25.000]  it admits it exists but then says okay we're canceling it but the third
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.120]  paragraph in the AP article a few months ago said well actually they're
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:31.800]  getting rid of the name they're just going to keep it and not give it a name
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:36.800]  and have it piece by piece but the whole project continues well in Europe it's
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:40.120]  another form of spin and I want to ask you how we fight this and where you see
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  this going because as you know Zellacal the US head of the World Bank big
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:50.840]  neocon came out in Bloomberg over the weekend and said look there's gonna be
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:55.240]  worldwide revolution the trillions we've given to the banks the people are
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:58.480]  gonna find out we did it he's speaking with incredible candor they're gonna
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:01.960]  come after us and then he didn't really say anything after that he just kind of
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:05.040]  made the announcement kind of like he was a white tailed deer throwing his
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:09.160]  tail up you know hot tailing it saying look out they're coming for us so a lot
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.960]  of weird mixed signals but with Zellacal but in Europe every time they let them
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:21.360]  vote as you know in the Netherlands or in Ireland or in countries like France
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:26.880]  the people say no by 70 plus percent 76 is the number that you usually see they
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:30.600]  won't let the Brits vote on it they're just bringing them under the regulations
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:36.920]  of it that's why Jackie Smith said you know arrest talk show host if they come
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:40.160]  here you're not allowed to criticize immigrants Michael Savage she was
[1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:44.720]  following the rules well now Reuters reports poll finds ira support EU's
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:49.120]  Libsons treaty rises they're gonna try to have another vote and they did this
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:55.240]  last time saying it was gonna win last year in Ireland and then it lost so they
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:58.840]  are being how do you deal with this level of deception and where is all
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:02.640]  this going well the good news is because these deceptions are being
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.720]  repeatedly exposed and people are seeing this incredible disconnect between
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:09.560]  what the what the corporate media is saying and the reality on the ground and
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:13.800]  I would cite as a local example some of these incredibly bogus polls we've been
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:17.400]  very obviously bogus polls we're seeing in the corporate media about how
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:21.520]  Americans want Guantanamo kept open and they don't want investigations into
[1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:24.920]  torture I mean the first rule of propaganda is for it to work it's got
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:30.320]  to be believable and our corporate media has gone so far past that line right
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:33.800]  now where people and this is why they're losing audience and why people are
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:36.320]  coming over to the Alex Jones show and what really happened show and they're
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:40.000]  coming to the blogosphere because the propaganda has reached an
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:45.240]  unbelievable level now getting back to the situation about the economy I think
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:50.280]  there are a big reason the people of the world are rejecting this globalism and
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:54.560]  these unions is for two reasons one they know it's not for their benefit it's
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:57.960]  for the benefit of the banks so they can have a bigger pile of money that they
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.760]  can siphon off of and at bottom line when you talk about a global governance
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:07.000]  that's what Alexander the Great wanted that's what Napoleon wanted that's what
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.760]  Hitler wanted and people understand that global governance is not about wise
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:15.660]  management of the globe it's about some individual or some small group
[1:39:15.660 --> 1:39:19.960]  standing up on top of a monument built to their own glory and screaming I am in
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:24.520]  control of it all am I not really cool and I think we've kind of had enough of
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:29.280]  that sort of situation and as I said before the current economic downturn
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:32.760]  on the entire planet is because of globalism and most people are smart
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.560]  enough to realize more globalism is not going to fix it now interestingly enough
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:41.560]  we brought up a con a concept of my own show yesterday I've been getting a ton
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:45.640]  of email about it both pro and con and it has to do with a little theory and
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:50.800]  international law called an odious debt and what that is this basically means
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:57.760]  that one a government ceases to operate the debts incurred that were not for the
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:01.720]  benefit of the people are construed to be personal debts of the government
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:05.760]  officials themselves and the people don't have to pay them back the u.s. use
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:10.000]  this to get Cuba off the hook for debts run up by the Spanish occupation
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:14.240]  Mexico use this principle to repudiate the debts run up by the emperor maxim
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:18.640]  million basically what it means is that at at some point in the future if the
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:22.720]  government of the United States should collapse the way the USSR did all this
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:26.480]  money spent on wars of aggression all these debts run up for the bailouts all
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:30.320]  the money borrowed for walls and security and surveillance and all of this
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:34.280]  other stuff that didn't really improve the lot of the common people we the
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:37.320]  people are not going to be held liable for that debt anymore but that's what I
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:40.640]  was going to get to next and and I want you to continue you know with the
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:46.720]  punchline here I would it's with the key but but I mean that is so central not
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.520]  just odious debt fraudulent debt a contract that's fraudulent a contract
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:55.000]  that's carried out through deception is now in void and as a free human being I
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:02.040]  don't own a I don't own and I don't owe a half million dollars to foreign
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:07.160]  offshore banks a I don't have it be it was set up fraudulently I mean we even
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:12.440]  pay taxes to the offshore banks to give them the money and then we pay interest
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:16.760]  on the money we pay taxes to give them this is the greatest Ponzi scheme
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:22.400]  fraud they want to carry their Ponzi scheme through to the next level through
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:30.520]  fraud so it is fraudulent and that's why China and Russia and Europe and Japan
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:34.560]  are saying can you guys pay this back because they know they can do the math
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:40.760]  we've gone from the average American owning you know more money and more
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:48.000]  assets than they did debts to being a total debtor nation in 2007 and at the
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.600]  worst debtor level we've been in our history the previous record of a some
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:58.480]  debtor nation was in late 1933 and so we physically can't pay it back it's
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:02.760]  fraudulent the world knows that we all owe over a half million dollars and it's
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:06.520]  now going hyperbolic it's going from a couple hundred thousand a year ago to
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:10.160]  five hundred thousand now and accelerating towards a million dollars in
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:15.240]  debt per American within two years the Wall Street Journal reports and no
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:21.080]  police state is going to be able to extract this out of the slaves the
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:24.080]  country is imploding the illegal aliens are bankrupting everything in the
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:27.840]  southwest because that you know they're in the social welfare net because they're
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:31.280]  not paid enough to live I mean this is all coming to a head so where do you
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:34.760]  see all this going microvera well there's a fundamental principle about the
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:37.840]  debt based currency system that we find at the heart of the Federal Reserve and
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:41.360]  that is that the instant it goes into operation more money is owed to the
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:44.800]  banks than is actually physically in existence we talk about the federal
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:49.080]  government being sixty five trillion dollars in debt most of that is debt of
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:53.200]  money that is fictional it never really existed in the first place it is simply
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.480]  notes in a ledger that the interest is accruing over time and so the money
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:02.160]  doesn't exist and unless we go out and conquer other countries where we're
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:05.280]  never going to come up with it and we have to collapse the problem with
[1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:10.360]  bringing a global bank into line with the same debt based currency where all
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:14.320]  money is borrowed from a central bank when it gets to the point of collapse
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:19.240]  there are no other places to go for money so a global debt based Federal
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:23.440]  Reserve style bank inevitably will plunge the entire world into an
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:26.880]  incredible depression where we're going to wind up eating each other and this is
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:31.760]  why it must be avoided at all costs I agree with you let's take some calls for
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:36.000]  Mike Rivera joining us from Hawaii be a video camera right now simulcasting at
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:41.680]  prison planet dot TV and a Genesis on the radio let's go ahead and talk to Peter
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:47.000]  in Iraq Peter thank you for holding you're on the air
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:52.800]  um Alex just a bit sorry to great point the other day and I just want to bring it
[1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:59.000]  back up he was saying that um and I know you're all about a bloodless peaceful
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.800]  revolution and we need a great point about how oh I'm too old to read less
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:09.280]  and take back military well wouldn't you think that'd be great idea to have
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:13.720]  people enlist in the military who aren't like you know what's going on and
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:17.800]  then when they give you orders just like sorry I used to work to hold the
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:23.760]  Constitution not any executive branch or anybody else yes I mean I've said that
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:26.800]  it's all what I mean it's a very complex issue and I want to get Mike Rivera's
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:32.720]  take on that as well look we know that as the police get more and more corrupt
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:35.880]  leadership and as they're told to do more and more things that are unconstitutional
[1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:40.640]  and as the media plays these mind games and legitimizes it all that the stupid
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:46.160]  ignorant foolish or or wicked people and there's a mix of all those will stay in
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:49.760]  the police forces the good ones will get out and then you're left with a bunch of
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:54.280]  rotten apples the same thing for the military as they hire illegal aliens as
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:58.960]  they hire criminals as they kill military investigators as the corruption gets
[1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:03.600]  worse and worse the good people get out and it's a race to the bottom but how
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:07.200]  can you expect good people to stay in when they're going to be sent on
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:12.600]  fraudulent missions when they're going to be stuck in bad situations where
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:17.840]  they're going to be given these experimental vaccines and shots I think
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:21.600]  it's a good thing that there are a lot of good people in the military at the
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:25.560]  same time I wouldn't wish anybody to join this military that's controlled by
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:30.000]  offshore banks I mean we know that the of any Democrat or any Republican Ron
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:34.040]  Paul got the most money I mean Ron Paul got over 70% of the military
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:38.080]  contributions until he got out of the race and then and then and then Obama
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:41.520]  got most of them because he was saying it in the war so I know the troops are
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:47.040]  good that's why they're trying to replace them with black water and illegal
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:51.240]  aliens and felons so it's a very complex question I mean I can't make that
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:55.640]  decision I can't sit here and tell you what I think you should do I think that's
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:46:00.440]  for you to decide micro vero yeah absolutely agree unfortunately the
[1:46:00.440 --> 1:46:04.280]  moral and the immoral are mutually exclusive societies and neither one
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:08.280]  tolerates the presence of the other so once the government the military and
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:12.440]  corporate culture starts to go bad it goes all the way bad they go out of
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:15.680]  their way to eject anybody who's not going to go along with the program we
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:20.320]  saw that with Cynthia McKinney we saw it with Ron Paul it is it is almost
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:24.800]  impossible for an honest moral person to stay in Congress they can get in there
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:30.080]  for a first time but they very quickly find themselves on the outs it is a
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:33.680]  sort of like remember the high school clique or all the popular rich kids that
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:36.360]  get together and they could do whatever they wanted and get away with it all
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:41.120]  that's basically what the US government has become it's the socials it's the
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:45.720]  privileged and they basically see themselves as inheritors of the
[1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:50.800]  rulership of not only the United States but of the entire world and any
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:54.880]  sacrifice to that objective is is perfectly justified we're seeing just in
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:58.520]  the economic policies here in the United States there is no respect left for the
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:03.160]  working class people there's no respect even for the middle class people the
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:06.760]  entire bailout consists of taking trillions of dollars from the American
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:10.400]  people to give to the banks so the banks can loan it back to the American
[1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:14.320]  people at interest that doesn't really make any sense and there's no talk about
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:18.000]  bringing back manufacturing on which the entire economy no you're right
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:22.120]  everything else is being sacrificed on the altar of globalism which is what
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:25.760]  they want they want to consolidate it system you know I just hoping you get
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:29.640]  back from Iraq Peter there's a country to come back to anything else from Iraq
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:38.520]  Peter well I mean if if you really expected the people to stand up and
[1:47:38.520 --> 1:47:42.800]  fight I mean they have to know how to even if it's a support job medic or
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:47.400]  whatever or I mean I'm not saying like my generation or even if it's beyond my
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:52.240]  generation I can't you know isn't gonna have to make sacrifices if you're gonna
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:56.640]  have a have a revolution if you want to know what's gonna happen people are
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:00.920]  gonna try to see PS people's kids and it's happening more and more I see in
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:04.520]  the news every week and people are just gonna kill them and cops are gonna stop
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:07.640]  people at a checkpoint and the citizens are just gonna get out and it's already
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:11.520]  starting to happen and then the media kind of keeps it quiet but you see the
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:15.480]  reports all the time it's usually old vets Korean War Vietnam most of them
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:18.520]  are dead now but they've had a couple cases in Austin where World War two
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:22.240]  vets to get pulled over and harassed by cops in Hays County and they'll vet it
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:25.360]  just get out and kill them you know it's like buddy I'm not your slave this in
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:29.200]  Nazi Germany you're dead and you know the cop can argue about that all day and
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:33.160]  have the media say the old man was bad but at the end of the day there's gonna
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:38.600]  be a lot of blood and the system knows that and you know and look if we're
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:42.280]  self-sufficient they can't beat us that's why they want to shut down the farms
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:46.480]  and ranches and get control and you know if we try to have a continental
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:49.760]  Congress or something like that they're gonna send feds in that stage of truck
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:54.040]  bomb outside and say we did it we've got a grassroots takeover the counties and
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:58.000]  cities these big centralized assaults aren't gonna work we've got to try to
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.920]  keep it peaceful as long as we can but they're not gonna be peaceful these guys
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:05.600]  are arrogant they never have lost in the past this is what always happens
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:11.000]  they're gonna start fights with us and you're gonna know you're gonna know you
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:14.920]  know as more Waco's happen as more things happen like that you're just gonna
[1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:18.320]  have more and more people say I'm done and you're gonna have more massacres of
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:21.800]  kids getting shot and people dying in ambulances because the cops won't let
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:24.760]  them get to the hospital and you're just gonna have more and more of this is
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:28.080]  gonna happen and it's just good it's probably gonna be a war I mean if you
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.120]  really want to know folks it's probably gonna end up in a shooting war in this
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:36.200]  country and I wish that wasn't the case because I've had my butt kicked and I've
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:40.640]  you know live a little bit I know it's not fun and not macho but it is what it
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:44.000]  is and I'm not licking boots and I'm not going along with this crap anymore and
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.600]  so it is what it is and so the troops need to decide who's side they're on
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:53.240]  what they're gonna do anything else from Iraq Peter well if you don't know how
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:57.320]  to fight you can be cut down like fodder but I mean that's pretty much it
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:03.280]  just cuz you shoot a gun doesn't mean you know what you're doing and I understand
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:05.400]  you're over there hold on sir I understand you're over there in Iraq
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:10.080]  dealing with the Iraqis and all the rest of them but take you know the French
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:12.480]  resistance caused the Nazis a lot of problems and they'd already been a
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:16.000]  disarmed public it's like moose hunting you know when moose hunting there's a
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.800]  lottery and like one in five guys gets a moose ticket I mean if people actually
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:23.400]  decided to go after the police and military let's say there's two million
[1:50:23.400 --> 1:50:28.360]  of them let's say there's three million of them I mean let's say five million
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:31.760]  Americans decided to go moose hunting it's over very quickly all you got to
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:42.120]  get one moose you understand what I'm saying Peter yeah but I absolutely but

[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:08.120]  got this segment the next with Mike Rivera I want to go to Kurt Roger Todd
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:14.680]  Jeremy Steve and others but Peter you know as they teach in the military I
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:17.760]  know of your boots on the ground they're probably not teaching you this but the
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:22.200]  point is 90% of war is psychological we do need to reach out to the military and
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:25.000]  police before it's too late but a lot of more on power trips are too far gone
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.520]  especially in police forces and and and you know training is fine and dandy and
[1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:37.760]  it's great but the problem is the feds are all over that type of training and
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:41.200]  certain people who call for violence and send folks to prison so you are gonna
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:44.720]  train train with people you've known for years people you trust and call it a
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.080]  shooting club a tactical shooting club and don't make it all secret agent you
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:51.760]  know just all we go out to the deer camp and you know we do you know we do this
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:56.240]  and you can you know read up on the French resistance and others and books
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:00.320]  like total resistance and guerrilla warfare but this is an urban guerrilla
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:03.200]  warfare is a little bit different first thing I told the militia stop wearing
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:06.960]  camouflage I see him in the cities and camo you know in the city's camo is a
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:10.680]  sports jacket in a tie and you know you're real calm and hi how you doing
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:13.880]  that's that's that's the things that were went to that that's that's that's
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:18.440]  your uniform folks is a button-up shirt and you know hi how you doing you better
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:22.720]  uh well I don't want to get into that the point is is that we don't want to sit
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.000]  there and think too much even about going to that level we want to try to
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:29.960]  stop things politically and things will work themselves I mean micro vero before
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:32.840]  I go back to the caller to finish up any comments on what we're saying yeah
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:36.360]  absolutely I mean we need to avoid violence as long as possible because
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:40.520]  violence will only justify further repression by the government we know
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:44.560]  the government likes to plant people within the peace movement to be violent
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:48.600]  so the media can attack us I mean look at all these so-called phony terrorist
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:51.920]  groups that were set up by the FBI informants this is just the way the other
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:55.840]  side likes to play and so we need to avoid getting sucked but now they get
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:00.800]  caught now they caught when we used to took us years to expose that 93 was a
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:05.680]  fake deal and that 96 was a fake deal in Miami now it comes out in days it's
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:09.640]  totally fake with the FBI leading the group commanding it you're at and it
[1:57:09.640 --> 1:57:13.960]  comes out that cops everywhere from Canada England of the US dress up like
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:17.720]  anarchist to discredit the peaceful demonstrators I mean the truth is
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:22.240]  coming out yeah absolutely it's we're a much more educated and sophisticated
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:26.240]  society and I think our greatest hope for the future is that the powers that be
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:30.800]  let me rephrase that the powers that imagine they are still don't get how
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:34.840]  the entire world has been changed by the alternative media and by the blog
[1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:39.400]  sphere they don't understand we're much more aware sophisticated and skeptical
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:43.000]  and they can even try to shut the web down now as they're openly announcing
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:46.920]  it's still too late it's over everybody knows your criminal liars
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:55.040]  anything else Peter yeah wasn't there a and excuse me for not remembering your
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:00.160]  name there was a general American general board who was a metal bottle
[1:58:00.160 --> 1:58:04.680]  recipient from over one and prior to World War two wasn't there a medley butler
[1:58:04.680 --> 1:58:11.720]  when America medley exactly and how did you get to that position I'm sure all he
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:16.440]  did was keep it though keep his mouth shut not scream 9-11 was an inside job
[1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:20.920]  every 20 seconds to go your job and when it comes down and you know you know you
[1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:24.520]  know what's going on and the water comes down that's when you do it but if you're
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:29.720]  labeled oh you're that you're that guy instead of I am just tell my no no great

[2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you on answers well so does he
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:29.240]  Jones final segment with Mike Rivera yes there is something to be said as the
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:37.560]  last caller was saying to my rack military to keeping your oath but keeping
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:43.480]  quiet and when the shoe really drops saying no and a lot of troops have done
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:46.280]  that with these experimental vaccines you know they say it's the law we give you
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:50.720]  whatever we want no not of its experimental that's like what was really
[2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:54.640]  telling was six years ago Mike Rivera when they ordered 14 million first
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:01:00.680]  responders firemen police medical workers county city workers to take the
[2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:05.720]  smallpox shot and the LA times reported two years into that that only 4,000 of
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:12.520]  14 million had done it 99.9% had said no and then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:16.760]  take it I mean I think they can set up this grid and push it all but as push
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:23.080]  comes to shove this is really gonna blow up in their face well it depends on
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.040]  what the agenda is a lot of this vaccination and pushing these medications
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:30.280]  it's just really about justifying giving a lot more tax dollars to the
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:35.960]  pharmaceutical industries I mean we saw that with this whole swine flu brew ha ha
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:39.960]  I mean obviously given the number of people actually sick and dying from this
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:44.440]  flu it shouldn't have been headline grabbing news but it did justify a lot
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:48.200]  of purchases of vaccines and the other awareness of course is that a lot of
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:51.760]  these vaccines really are oftentimes more dangerous than the actual disease
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:55.560]  they're supposed to protect you from look back at the 1976 swine flu
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:02:00.960]  outbreak more people died from the vaccine than from the flu itself you're
[2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:04.200]  absolutely right about that let's take another call here from Kurt in Texas
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:09.680]  Carter on the air go ahead this is the subject you covered back last week I
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:15.880]  couldn't get in talk to you I was at Walmart and when I started to check out
[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:22.200]  there was a lady had a child that was acting up and I happened to comment to
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:27.760]  the cashier that during the time I was raised if I threw a fit like that my
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:34.680]  dad and take off his belt and swat me and she says oh she became very talk to
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:40.760]  you she said we're told at company meetings that if we see the parent
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:47.520]  what the child with their hand or lay one violent act for them shake them or
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:53.000]  anything like that to call child protective services immediately and I
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:57.120]  want to back you up all the ways yeah let me back you up I see articles all
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:02.360]  over the country where a mother grabs the child and says stop it and police show
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:06.480]  up and then it's always a footnote that surveillance cameras so the whole
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:10.200]  society is little spy tattletales they're not looking for you stealing stuff
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:12.880]  at the time the employees do two-thirds of the stealing that's their own numbers
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:17.680]  it's all about what's that t-shirt say well did they just spank that child like
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:22.080]  stop that I told you know with that toy the kids got to get out of controls they
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:26.200]  put them on riddling in Prozac so the cops can then taser them so so she was
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:30.160]  proud of the fact that oh we're told to tattle to homeland security I mean
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:35.680]  Walmart yes was she proud of herself services was she proud of herself oh
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:41.680]  yes seem like it she's very talkative about how they had told them to watch
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:48.160]  out and if they see any parents shaking or hollering at the children or swat them
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:52.480]  with their hands or something in the store to call child protective services
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:04:01.080]  immediately and I thought goodness my father's dead if he'd been alive he'd
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:06.320]  probably been in jail here to go no no that's the issue is and these
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:10.080]  sociologists and psychiatrists run everything now they know it's going to
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:14.200]  cause everything to break down it's about I have the textbooks they say we're
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:19.040]  going to destroy their families microvarum yeah absolutely it's it's all
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:22.560]  about control and I notice as we have all these governors starting to slash the
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:26.440]  state budgets and they're talking about reducing health care for poor families
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:30.080]  we just have that happen here in Hawaii the one area of government that is not
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:33.960]  seeing budget cuts as their surveillance the spine the control the child
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:37.840]  protective services the elements of dictatorship they're still being fully

[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:23.480]  all right I'm gonna spend 40 minutes coming up in the next segment the rest
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:28.360]  of the hour before Webster Carpenter joins us going over a small slice of the
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:35.040]  casual society cyber security global straight jacket full spectrum dominance
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:39.880]  grid and that's what the Pentagon calls it itself and last night in the day I
[2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:43.720]  probably wrote 15 pages of notes just of every little point and I printed a
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:48.280]  bunch of articles to back up what I'm saying but as bad as this is going to
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:53.200]  sound this is nothing compared to what it really is nothing you've heard the guy
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:56.560]  about the Walmart employees if somebody grabs their kid by the arm and says no
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.240]  you can't have that toy cameras are on you they record your face take digital
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:04.720]  photos the police are waiting for you to take your kids that's why you pull up
[2:09:04.720 --> 2:09:07.840]  in front of Walmart and the ladies got four kids in the car some of them
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:13.560]  teenagers she walks five feet to throw money the Salvation Army box remember and
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:17.200]  the police were there arrested her CPS all the kids including the two-year-old

[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:02.200]  questions about it and he hadn't been on with us in over a month I wanted to get
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:07.200]  a color blues Tyler Palmer on the designer and head of the company co-CEO
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.200]  over there I wanted to get him on because well they just mail one to Jesse
[2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:15.880]  Ventura he saw one at Willie Nelson's house and really wanted one when he was
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:19.360]  here and he said hey I want one of those how do I buy one I just said look we'll
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:24.880]  just send you one from a color blue and he just got his yesterday it grabs
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:28.120]  water out of the atmosphere that's what clouds are for those that don't know
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:31.880]  they are water vapor and it's it's humidity you know like when you hear
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:37.800]  humidity today 65% or it's a muggy 80% humidity in average humidity you get
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:40.920]  seven and a half gallons a day and that's where they're smaller units they have
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:44.560]  bigger ones if you want them computerized but very simple hot cold water
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:49.040]  how much water what the humidity is seven filters it goes through I wanted to
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:53.160]  have him on for a few minutes to talk about the system you don't have to have
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:56.560]  a well water anything they have solar panels you can get you know to just run
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:00.320]  the unit even if you don't want to be on the grid and running off the power
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:05.560]  system this is the thing to have in the city in the country you name it and the
[2:11:05.560 --> 2:11:08.960]  military and governments by the big humidifiers and even some of the small
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:12.560]  ones from a color blue so it's good to have Tyler Palmer on with us Tyler
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:16.120]  thanks for joining us thank you for having me again Alex and hello to all
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:21.160]  the listeners I was listening to the show earlier and I thought you know how
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:29.200]  long can we last without water when the controlled red gets implemented and it's
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:37.760]  the time now to get ready and get ready with water with energy with food it it's
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:42.720]  a very crucial and critical time to get the message out and I'm glad that your
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:47.760]  show is a vehicle for doing that well I'm just sitting here thinking of the
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:51.360]  control grid and things I haven't written down on these pages coming up and I
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:54.000]  thought oh kill switch is being built into all the cars
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:00.360]  microphones and cameras on all the computers there's no way to keep track
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:03.720]  of all of this I mean it's just getting too insane tell folks about the color
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.240]  blue and how folks get it and I know you're offering a discount today yeah
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:12.040]  well the color blue as you said it takes the humidity in the air and it
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:16.720]  condenses that humidity and makes drinking water out of the humidity in
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:21.960]  your air it doesn't just grab the humidity and and serve it up it filters
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:31.600]  it through essentially seven filters one reverse osmosis system three activated
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:40.760]  carbon filters and then one granular media that has like diatomaceous earth
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:49.360]  in it which is sort of a way of straining out you know smaller organisms
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:54.280]  and whatever might be in the in the atmosphere so there's a filter made out
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:58.600]  of plankton skeletons one of the one of the best filters in the world right and
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:05.920]  and also we use the the ultraviolet light it has a 245 nanometer UV light in
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:11.200]  the upper storage tank and we've we've recently added one to the lower storage
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:16.880]  tank as well so there's two UV lights in there now and some people say it's
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:23.480]  overkill but when you taste the water it certainly speaks for itself and we
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:28.280]  just got a big shipment of them in and if you want to order them for father's
[2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:33.880]  day or for just getting prepared we do have a special today father's day
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:40.120]  sounds like oh al-qaeda better call who fathers patriots founding fathers this

[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:49.000]  them are great but this is out of the atmosphere and then it goes through
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.280]  filters you can't get clear you can't get pure you can't get better tasting this
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:56.880]  is just just an amazing system and anybody that's used it gets completely

[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:08.320]  right now let's go to pulling up my call list here Roger in Missouri go ahead
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:14.120]  sir hey Alex my answer to that last call or is don't go to Walmart I haven't been
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:18.920]  to Walmart in three years but that's not what I called for look I tried to go to
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:23.400]  IGA in Port Aransas where probably 20 people in there at 930 before it closed
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:27.440]  on a Friday night I already told the story and I mean the guy literally came
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:32.600]  up and looked at my shirt the security guard correct I wear my 911 t-shirt all
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:37.080]  the time and get funny looks but I mean they're trained to literally spy on us
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:42.600]  but I mean this is not freedom folks no it's not I'm a I'm a disabled a marine
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:46.280]  from Vietnam conflict and also an ex-police officer I've talked to you
[2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:52.040]  before I used to live in Austin I was waterboarded I was which is through
[2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:56.000]  survival school I was not only waterboarded I was put in a box that was
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:03.400]  smaller than I was tall and beat on and taking output on the stool ropes my
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:09.920]  hands have my how my back and soles kicked out from under me and don't do
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:19.200]  the water boring I've had problems from that since 1971 I'm claustrophobic I
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:24.200]  had always been a habit swimmer every time I get water up my nose I have a
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:30.840]  just a flat panic from that and I'll advise you don't do it and take my
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:35.720]  word for it is torture well I know it's torture but I want to illustrate what
[2:17:35.720 --> 2:17:39.760]  it's like when somebody really I want to see I'm I'm guessing I can hold out about
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:45.520]  30 45 seconds we'll see if I can do it and and because I can just turn my
[2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:49.560]  brain off usually I want to see how bad it really is but I know it can cause
[2:17:49.560 --> 2:17:53.920]  physical damage that's why the Chicago police were trying to stop Eric Muller
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:58.200]  Mankow from doing it you're saying it caused you health problems yes it's
[2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:04.360]  called it's called I'm mostly the mental I have PTSD anyway and but the water
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:09.080]  boarding really bothered me more the waterboarding and the rest of it and
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:14.160]  bothered me more than going to war you know I have more effects from the from
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:21.000]  the survival school but you gotta realize 1971 Marine Corps bootcamp at
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:24.720]  least every three days you speak they don't do that anymore but they did when
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:29.000]  I went through so and I've talked to older Marines they say they used to
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:33.160]  shoot at you through a real hang grenades beat people people would die
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:38.760]  falling off rubs and I guess they've lightened it up a bit they was experts
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:43.760]  at hitting you in the solar plexus taking the end of your band at walls on
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:48.240]  your hip and jabbering in your side or just playing kicking in a butt hard
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:53.720]  with the toe of the shoe toe of the boot you know and like I said I was 18 years
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:58.160]  old when I went to that survival school I was in top physical condition best
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:02.400]  best condition I was ever in my life and it almost killed me I said well
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:05.520]  Ventura said that they jump on your stomach too when they waterboard you
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:10.800]  do they do that to you yes yes and and you think you're dead you think you're
[2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:16.360]  dead I was also choked out we did that in in in boot camp you had to your buddy
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:20.200]  behind you you had you could not fight back and they actually choked you out
[2:19:20.200 --> 2:19:25.280]  until you passed out in high school a few times we did that as a game the
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:29.560]  weird dreams you have like in the 10 seconds you pass out and all the guys
[2:19:29.560 --> 2:19:32.560]  in there have been like and I had to have these weird dreams I go but the
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:36.040]  only problem is one time they let me go in my in my head and busted it open I
[2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:39.240]  tell you the crazy stuff that goes on well I'd like to hear more of those

[2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:12.120]  that's 1-800-686-2237
[2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:32.680]  minding breaks let it all hang out cause we got a run to make the boys up there
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:37.360]  sticking Atlanta and there's beer it takes our count and we'll bring it back no
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:44.520]  matter what it takes he's found it down loaded up and trucking okay
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:52.120]  40 minutes I'm gonna break down the casual society over in then Webster
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:55.600]  Griffin Tarple is gonna join us and continue it with open phones as well
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:25:03.880]  now understand as bad as this is gonna sound this is not one 100th of the
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:07.680]  knowledge that I'm aware of and I'm probably not aware of half of what's
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:14.440]  going on the more I learned the less I know that I know it just always gets
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:22.760]  worse always gets crazier than we had first broken down now remember I had
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:27.520]  gotten on the air 13 years ago with the telecommunications act of 96 and said
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:31.560]  they're turning all the major telecommunications and cyber systems that
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:36.200]  are private with $9 billion of federal money into giant wiretaps it was
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.640]  admitted it was designed for the feds to call through it without wiretaps that
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.560]  was debated in Congress and then I would have listeners call in and say there's
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:48.000]  no such thing as the NSA there's no such thing as echelon remember in the
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:57.120]  mid 90s it didn't exist so let's throw that mother Jones article up first
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:01.800]  should Obama control the Internet and if you scroll down on the article they
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:08.120]  have the quotes by Jay Rockefeller and Senator Olympia Snow as well saying
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:11.800]  should President Obama have the power to shut down the domestic internet traffic
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:17.160]  during a state of emergency Senators John Rockefeller that goes by Jay and
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:23.200]  Olympia Snow Senators think so and that's the bill that Obama has executive
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:29.080]  signed in as an executive order this is the accompanying bill now that's just a
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:34.200]  head off one small part of this larger story people are in denial this story
[2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:38.480]  posted at info wars dot com and prison planet calm and a tailed analysis by Paul
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:43.480]  Watson that gives you a wide spectrum view of what's happening people are all
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:47.800]  over both websites commenting saying we're making it up there's no way to
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:53.480]  shut down the internet well the stated goal of the Pentagon the cyber command is
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:27:02.200]  to do just that and the head of cyber security quit in March cyber security
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:08.760]  chief resigns at mid turf battle in a blunt letter Rod Berkstrom cited class
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:11.960]  for national security agency so they may I think like it's a turf battle when
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:15.360]  you actually read what he had to say he shows a threat to our democracy with the
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:21.680]  Pentagon taking over all private internet activity in the United States and a blunt
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:27.120]  letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jen Napolitano Berkstrom complained
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:30.880]  about a shortage of money for the center and clash over whether the national
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:35.080]  security agencies to control cyber efforts the role the NSA in protecting
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:38.600]  domestic computer networks has triggered debate particularly among privacy and
[2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:42.920]  civil libertarians groups so this is kind of an MSNBC whitewash you pull up
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:46.240]  the other articles you can actually read him saying in fact I want that on screen
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:51.320]  I meant to have that article just just Google head of cyber security resigns
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:55.520]  says threat to democracy I want folks to see that case there's any denial out
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:28:04.000]  there so that said let me just read over the four pages of notes that I've boiled
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:10.400]  this down to a different control grid point the casual society surveillance
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:16.000]  grid to control mobility and purchasing and and to track and trace all you buy
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:19.360]  sell and do track all your internet activity track all your private
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:22.880]  activity track your car where you drive by scanning and reading your license
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:27.160]  plate that's now nationwide in the US all over Europe all over England it's a
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:32.880]  global treaty it's all integrated in global databases under treaties I want
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:37.080]  to go over that yeah US cyber security chief quits over NSA power grab the
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:41.040]  register US government cyber security chief abruptly quit last week amid
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:50.840]  allegations his office was over woefully underfunded and an unduly control by the
[2:28:50.840 --> 2:28:54.920]  country's ultra secretive national security agency and he goes on to say
[2:28:54.920 --> 2:28:59.520]  that it is a threat to our freedoms so yeah that's got his actual quotes from
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:03.360]  his letter right there out of the register trying to read it across the
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:10.200]  room and couldn't have to look over here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
[2:29:10.200 --> 2:29:14.040]  over this was a quick segment the long segment coming up I'm gonna break down
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:19.320]  these different points and and and tie it all together and MIT the Pentagon the
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:24.240]  UN it's all stated internet to which is a consortium everything you're gonna hear
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:34.440]  is on record this is what they admit can you imagine what we don't know can you
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:43.000]  imagine what we're not being told so we will go over all of it on the other side

[2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:31.360]  all right there's two key points I want to make and then I'm going to launch it the
[2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:40.720]  details I take my chances and that's this for a living in the movies and TV but the
[2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:45.640]  hardest thing through international treaties in 2000 is one they had in
[2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:51.360]  Australia we already have a world ID agreed upon standardization of the type
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:56.200]  of digital photo the type of biometrics the type of fingerprints biometrically
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:00.480]  through the treaty we already have a world ID system that's why Germany and
[2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:05.400]  England and Japan when the United States makes people entering it
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:10.720]  biometrically scan the very same companies the very same systems are
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:15.680]  contracted to put in those grids in other parts of the world so this is
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:21.520]  internationally standardized and all the things you see that individually or
[2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:26.720]  horrible tyranny are all openly set up by think tanks openly rolled out and
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:31.240]  taught in the universities most of the big grants and the people that are
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:34.880]  getting their tuition paid for with scholarships now the biggest growth
[2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:41.840]  industry isn't just law enforcement but it's homeland security data mining and
[2:34:41.840 --> 2:34:46.080]  total information awareness network and Patriot Act compliance so this is all
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:50.440]  in the industry publications it's a big joke to them everything you buy
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:53.760]  everything you sell everything you do everything you believe everywhere you
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:59.320]  serve everything you do as the New York Times bragged years ago dealing with the
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:03.600]  total information awareness network is now being integrated and tracked so you
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:07.360]  can forget trying to hide out not be in their system the answer is bring the
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:11.280]  criminals to justice bring the bankers that are destroying the dollar and our
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:16.080]  sovereignty to justice I'm gonna cover that next hour now thinking about this
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:20.360]  show of the last week the reason I keep holding off doing it is because there is
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:23.600]  so much data so I want to make that point this is full of notes on it these
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:27.160]  are just notes out those notes that I wrote today trying to boil it down let
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:32.800]  me just go over these this is an opting into the matrix is what's happening
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:37.040]  right now where Google announces oh we have a new system we're using now for
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:42.360]  four years where the cameras and microphones built into all the new
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:47.360]  computers we have a AI software listening every word you say what you do
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:53.600]  watching you if you're dogs barking then Google ads for dogs and dog food and
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:57.520]  dog toys and dog medicine and heartworm medicine pops up on screen that was the
[2:35:57.520 --> 2:36:01.720]  example they use or if we hear you watching a particular show or see it
[2:36:01.720 --> 2:36:06.040]  off the computer camera we will then advertise products that go along with
[2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:11.840]  that psychological algorithm that personality type this is announced in
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:16.080]  fact people won't believe it punch it up on screen Google using cameras and
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:21.440]  microphones to track computer users I think that was the present planet
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:26.840]  headline and then we've got links to Google's press release so I mean they're
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:31.680]  bragging about this and other companies are doing it Tevo remember the Janet
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:36.440]  Jackson wardrobe malfunction with her breasts coming out in the Super Bowl
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:42.080]  that staged event as staged is the barat guy you know falling on M&M at the
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:45.160]  MTV Awards I told you that was staged now they've been at stage we come on it's
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:51.000]  all stage folks quit being so gullible Tevo came out and said oh we had 2.2
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:55.520]  million rewinds and replays and then in the Chicago Tribune said but I'd always
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:36:59.000]  been saying you mean that's a two-way system you're tracking what they do and
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:03.680]  they said yeah see this is an there's thousands of these examples so you're
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:09.640]  opting into the matrix I have another article here today that's on the front
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:15.120]  page of Xbox.com just go to Xbox.com and it's Steven Spielberg running it
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:19.960]  and I know somebody that worked high level for Microsoft in development of
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:24.040]  the Xbox it's meant to take over your computer your cell phone your whole life
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:27.840]  your identity your friends the outside world will be so bad you'll want to be
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:32.800]  in the simulated world this you scan with a camera on it your body your
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:37.600]  biometrics you you turn forward sideways and backwards your 360 body is now
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:42.600]  scanned two-way the feds are in it this is this is Microsoft is the feds just
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:47.320]  like IBM on record in-game covers it it's now declassified we covered it two
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:51.320]  years ago it's now mainstream news but I know people high level two different
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:55.120]  people but one super high level in the involvement with the development of all
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:37:59.880]  this and this is literally meant to mesmerize to lower your brainwaves to
[2:37:59.880 --> 2:38:03.680]  put you into a trance television already does it but this is to bring you to the
[2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:09.720]  next level this is the opting into the matrix notice the kids when you see them
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:12.920]  at restaurants they're not talking to their parents they're texting they watch
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:16.080]  four or five hours of TV a day two or three hours of video games they won't
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:19.640]  talk to their friends across the table they're texting to them they're not
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:23.960]  having language anymore that's a major British study about all this media
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:27.720]  people don't have language anymore the language is being reduced down where you
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:34.240]  can't talk to people so we're being sucked in the matrix the TV screen is a
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:39.080]  lens on which projects through the eyes which are brain stems literally windows
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.920]  into the soul interfacing and so we're being mesmerized being sucked into the
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.760]  crystal ball that's how they like in it so so people are opting into the matrix
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:54.080]  being sucked in 30 40 years ago writers talked about how you'd live in
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:58.280]  Manhattan or Houston or wherever and you'd see high-rise buildings with people
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:02.640]  fighting and people playing pool and people people gambling or people having
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:10.080]  sex or people reading or people laughing now you look at high-rise buildings and
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:14.520]  it's nothing but blue glow at night no one's talking no one's living the TV is
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.800]  the life it's ever and it's teaching you how to tattle on your neighbors it's
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:21.120]  teaching you you're fat and inadequate it's teaching you that cops tasering you
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:25.200]  were good and the second them it's bad it's all messages all brainwashing the
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:30.080]  torture is good that vaccines are good it's it's all you you're opting in and
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:34.560]  it's made to be comfortable and funny and goofy and your choices and your
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:42.200]  favorites this is the control system let me see I've covered 0.1 of all these
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:50.760]  pages I'm gonna will we ever get to it so you're opting into the matrix but are
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:55.640]  you really opting in it's kind of you opt in to go down to the river's edge to
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:39:59.720]  drink some water as a primitive man and a big crocodile grabs you and drags you in
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:03.480]  and eats you you opted in to go get water that look good you didn't see those
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:07.160]  two eyes right there I'm telling you there's crocodiles down there I'm
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:10.080]  telling you out here in the hill country if you buy a house in the country
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:14.120]  watch out for rattlesnakes the realtors won't tell you about it that's what I do
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:19.080]  I warn my fellow humans because I have a tribal love of humanity but see the
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:23.120]  marketers they love the fact that they're lying lying there in the water's
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:27.520]  edge with just their eyes and the tip of their nose popped up so you think you're
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:31.560]  going into something fun this is a scientific Pentagon assault on you and
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:41.240]  your family so the control grid is a technological enslavement paradigm and
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:45.840]  it's all standardized all controlled always being honed being implemented in
[2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:51.000]  phases this is all stated by internet to and ran corporation documents and MIT
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:55.560]  they're all on record bragging about it they're on power trips there's these
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.200]  arrogant technocrats and there's psychologists I counters controllers
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:02.800]  above them and the elites who make the decisions who are very proud of how
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:06.320]  dumb the public is and how they've done the public down further and how they use
[2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:11.800]  every human instinct to manipulate us and every human instinct against us to
[2:41:11.800 --> 2:41:19.520]  control us now the the end game of this is to have the false culture of the
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:23.680]  television and the different niche groups they're targeting integrate and then
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:27.960]  manifest on the ground to have the delusions the disinformation and the
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:33.920]  paranoia and the lies manifest in the real three-dimensional world not the
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:38.000]  two-dimensional television that's why they're coming ahead with every major
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:44.880]  production firm industrial light and magic dreamworks the group headed up by
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:50.680]  James Cameron to go to holograms and now they're introducing holograms on CNN to
[2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:56.800]  make the unreality even more real so they want to highly control mobility
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:02.080]  mobility by having you watch TV instead of go play basketball mobility instead of
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:05.000]  having you spend time reading history books to your children so you'll watch
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:09.200]  your show they watch their show mobility where you've got to have all the
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:12.640]  trinkets and crap so you're in debt to buy all the little trinkets they sell and
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:16.160]  all the gadgetry which controls you further by federal law all the cell
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:20.360]  phones track you down to a few feet with with GPS triangulators off the cell
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:24.880]  towers by law they can listen to you even without a warrant and even when the
[2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:28.160]  phone is turned off I told you that 12 years ago now it's mainstream news I
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:31.720]  just point out don't be in denial anymore remember all the things I talked
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:35.080]  about we got to just get all the hundreds of old shows video shows TV
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:38.440]  shows I didn't put them on the web some folks are doing that but if you've got
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:43.200]  my shows you watch me awesome for years just put them on the web folks because
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:46.840]  slaves today have been incrementally taught to believe this and go along with
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:50.320]  but if they can see somebody telling them exactly what would happen 10 12 13
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:57.360]  14 years before that has an effect on them they sell you the image that guns
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:00.720]  are illegal through television this is just one example of hundreds where they
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:04.920]  everything is based in Chicago LA or New York they have highly restricted gun
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:09.280]  laws so these dramas and cop shows are based there where people go to jail for
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:14.480]  having a gun on these cop shows the carpet cleaner sees a gun in the New
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:18.000]  York apartment he calls the cops turns out the guys at child molester he
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.360]  deserves to have his gun taken if you're a gun owner you're a child molesters the
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:25.560]  message and people are always right to call the cops on people and her heroes
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:31.080]  and so somebody in Austin Texas watches that show NYPD blue and all those other
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:35.120]  shows and then now they call the cops on you when they see a gun case because
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:40.480]  they think guns are illegal they think TV is real one example one small
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:43.680]  microcosm and there's other ways that they do that you know you know the guys
[2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:49.040]  at child molester he owns guns he also beats his wife and he's ugly you don't
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:52.720]  want guns you don't want to be him the sharp good-looking young cop she's
[2:43:52.720 --> 2:43:56.200]  gonna get him and you know she sits there and tortures him to get the answers
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:43:59.600]  to save the kids and you know thank God that person ratted them out they had a
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:04.080]  gun you know it's just every oh yeah see it's just just all for these weak-minded
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:12.760]  people to suck them into this so they want to control your mobility with face
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:19.320]  scanning cameras and DMVs and everybody car rentals hotels to get a job to buy
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:22.840]  alcohol now to use a credit card they want to see your ID now they're swiping
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:26.040]  it they have big consortium meetings saying they're getting people ready to
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:29.920]  thumb scan and biometrically face scan to buy and sell for identity theft because
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:33.340]  they know their cybersecurity rules and digitization of everything actually
[2:44:33.340 --> 2:44:36.800]  creates more of the theft the government even admits that but again to
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:42.040]  create more of a crisis to offer more of their solution and so they glorify all
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:45.680]  these tattletale squads and you heard the guy earlier and I've even seen their
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:49.520]  own documents were Walmart and Target Target really is another Pentagon front
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:53.480]  company their main business is actually security surveillance cameras data
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:58.040]  mining target stores only one part of their division out of Minnesota it's a
[2:44:58.040 --> 2:45:01.880]  Pentagon front and they admit they're watching you and if you grab your kid by
[2:45:01.880 --> 2:45:05.040]  the arm in the store you'll wonder why cops are there and CPS is there five
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:08.880]  minutes later they also get kickbacks of that money target gets a lot of money so
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:15.120]  does Walmart one of their main profit centers is that the USA Today reported
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:20.000]  four years ago that in a headline scoff laws get caught ordering pizzas the big
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.400]  three pizza companies that have over half the US market and more we're
[2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:27.480]  joining it at the time through a private Dallas consortium again the globalist
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:30.960]  always privatize all their data mining and police state for their companies
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:34.680]  that nexus in with government so the private people out of government can
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:37.760]  then go into private industry and actually make money off the police state
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:41.600]  grid mandated by government and the thing was that whenever you call to get a
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:44.960]  pizza they know that's your real address and your real name so when they're
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:49.520]  running your credit card name that's run through a NCIC criminal police database
[2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:57.080]  so instead of a pizza you get a SWAT team now that was four years ago and they
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:45:59.520]  said they've been doing it for three years before that so that's seven years
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:03.320]  they've been doing that you starting to understand the control grid here ladies
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:08.080]  and gentlemen who's is in there going whoa yeah Google scoff laws ordering
[2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:12.800]  pizza and then you'll get USA Today and it'll it'll explain and that's just one
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:16.080]  I plug a lot every few months so people can look at that I think that's
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:22.040]  particularly egregious for folks to understand it okay when you buy stuff
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:25.400]  at Valero gas stations they run your card for beer or cigarettes they're
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:28.560]  gonna phase it in everywhere for all products that's that's run through a
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:33.520]  database everything folks it's all yeah there it is Missouri tracks scoff laws
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:38.400]  via pizza delivery databases and that's just an article about I noticed they
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:41.920]  always talk about it with one state to make people not get alarm nationwide
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:45.640]  introducing this is nationwide you learn in the article but you introduce it as
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:50.080]  it's only one area and not going on all over the place they always say oh it's
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:54.000]  just a trial program oh it's just the beginning but you read here they admit
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:58.080]  it's right out of Texas where the feds is nationwide it's dinner time you're
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:01.600]  hungry and tired so you pick up the phone in order your favorite pizza but you
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:04.920]  might have just landed yourself a lot more than pepperoni and cheese if you
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:08.360]  have fines fees of the courts the phone call may have provided the link to state
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:15.080]  needed to track you down and make you pay that's AP and that was 2004 four and a
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:20.560]  half years ago hmm there you have it again there's thousands of this it's
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:24.400]  just everything totally integrated they admit it not even me connecting the
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:28.840]  dots it's all stated and once the full grids in place you have more than one
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:32.480]  kid they're going to come CPS the kid when it's born or abort them and blow
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:36.800]  your head off the next time and they got devil dog cops ready to rock I mean
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:41.160]  it's just total hell is upon you folks you need to know that the churches are
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:43.760]  going to tell you lay down that's the end of the world but there everybody's
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:46.200]  going to be here while this is happening thinking it's the end of the world
[2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:54.080]  laying down now remember I again I told you this 13 years ago I had state
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:48:00.000]  reps on 10 years ago federal reps on six seven years ago and now it's been
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:04.400]  declassified it's been all over the news that for 36 years worldwide in every
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:08.920]  IMF World Bank controlled country from Russia to Australia to England the
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:13.040]  United States to Germany blood has taken at birth for 36 years globally it
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:16.880]  started an international secret agreement blood is taken and put in a DNA
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:23.240]  database and is sold to private biotech companies who then license and
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:28.320]  register your DNA type so when you want gene therapy later you got to pay them
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:31.760]  for your own blood it's also used so they can frame you with the blood they
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:35.680]  take it's also used so they can track you and so they can make race specific
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:39.640]  bio weapons for you individually if they want and they now admit for at least
[2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:43.600]  ten years they have laboratories that in one day can make a bio weapon which
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:51.160]  will only kill you or down to any sub derivation or somebody that's 10%
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:55.040]  African from a certain area of Africa and a mix of Native American they can
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:48:58.320]  kill you anything they want they can kill you they already have it this is
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:02.680]  total full-spectrum dominance new world order style this is what they brag
[2:49:02.680 --> 2:49:05.760]  about it's why it's so funny to them they're gonna orderly put in the
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:09.120]  control grid and then they're just gonna start the slaughtering all the
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:12.520]  killing and cancer you've seen so far it's just the beginning of the soft kill
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:16.000]  operation most the cops military listening there you're already dead they've
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:20.040]  already implanted you I mean this with the cancer viruses which are
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:23.960]  harmonially have hormonal fluctuation triggers where when you have a certain
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:28.160]  hormonal fluctuation on average around retirement you'll be dead and I'm sorry
[2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:31.040]  they murdered you I'm sorry they've murdered most of us but before we died
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:34.240]  from their soft kill attack now that we're aware of we can do damage to them
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:37.200]  and save others and keep this iron grip from being able to make it all the way
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:43.240]  through and I've got no point for about a hundred and I'm telling you folks it
[2:49:43.240 --> 2:49:50.360]  just goes on and on DNA medical mafia for telling you it's the law you got to
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:54.280]  take shots now saying 60 plus shots are mandatory from just 10 when they're not
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:59.040]  mandatory trying to force injections on everybody when you go in to have a baby
[2:49:59.040 --> 2:50:03.080]  they say do you have enough money is your husband mean to you they ask the
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:05.960]  husband to leave the room and they're they're entering into the health
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:11.160]  department database everybody's a spy the census is now going to be yearly and
[2:50:11.160 --> 2:50:14.840]  then monthly the feds have announced it they're getting GPS of your door come in
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:17.400]  your house and threatening you if you don't answer hundreds of questions
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:21.080]  totally a violation of the Fifth Amendment total tyranny they admit it's
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:25.440]  for drones police and federal police to know right where your doorstep is under
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:31.640]  law they want to make you monthly answer questions total police state the
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:36.000]  Department of Homeland Security reports where they how am I going to cover all
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:42.440]  this I got Webster Tarpley coming up I could do this in three or four parts I
[2:50:42.440 --> 2:50:49.240]  guess I mean folks I haven't even I haven't even gotten into it yet I just
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:52.920]  I mean I believe me everything I'm saying is on record it's I haven't even
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:56.720]  scratched the surface of the slave grid to understand they're killing all of us
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:51:00.840]  including those of you that serve them don't don't laugh it's real and you know
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:04.120]  it is in your gut finally in the news this evening it's being reported that
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:08.920]  cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even as
[2:51:08.920 --> 2:51:12.800]  energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the
[2:51:12.800 --> 2:51:16.440]  limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[2:51:16.440 --> 2:51:20.880]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade
[2:51:20.880 --> 2:51:25.200]  of power outages across the country putting us all in the dark are you
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:28.880]  prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government
[2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:33.000]  created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:37.880]  and generate your own private supply of electrical power if so this will be the
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:42.120]  most important information you have ever heard solar powered generators are
[2:51:42.120 --> 2:51:46.320]  finally available they have no moving parts to wear out or break and require
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:51.920]  absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so go
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:57.440]  to my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com check out my solar
[2:51:57.440 --> 2:52:03.200]  backup dot com before you lose your power hey folks Alex Jones here I'm sitting
[2:52:03.200 --> 2:52:06.600]  on a special alert to all those out there listing with credit card debt and

[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:35.720]  on this we'll do this in parts this is the opting into the matrix the control
[2:54:35.720 --> 2:54:42.920]  grid the tech system the tattletail squads to control mobility to control
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:45.720]  where you can go what you can do they're gonna use the carbon tax to do that as
[2:54:45.720 --> 2:54:51.760]  well no non-essential travel all these new taxes and regulations everything you
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.920]  do and say and buy will be inventoried on your global ID card for the carbon
[2:54:55.920 --> 2:54:59.840]  tax with carbon rationing that's the official you in plan now Pelosi's
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:02.800]  saying and I'm getting hundreds of emails going out as you know this it's all
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:08.560]  stated DNA illegally taken at birth now they admit to the slaves force in
[2:55:08.560 --> 2:55:12.760] oculations now openly being announced the census lying and seeing how to answer
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:16.360]  questions yearly and monthly running around getting GPS at your front door
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:20.760]  and the face scanners the thumb print scanners the license plate readers
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:25.440]  everywhere you go tracking you DHS reports saying gun owners veterans those
[2:55:25.440 --> 2:55:31.720]  that talk about the Constitution those that wear your patriot type don't tread
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:35.120]  on me t-shirts or bumper stickers or terrorist most the Homeland Security
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:38.480]  Funding being spent on that the Patriot Act being used in non-terror related
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:45.200]  cases Patriot Act compliance with no more warrants with the feds tied in to
[2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:50.240]  the banks databases looking at everything you buy sell and do looking at all
[2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:54.440]  your transactions guilty until proven innocent you know the biggest one of
[2:55:54.440 --> 2:55:58.600]  these no fly list where now if you are on the 1.1 million people and growing by
[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:03.480]  25,000 a month no fly list you can't own a gun they're already using that and
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:08.320]  refusing people that are on it to buy guns and veterans to buy guns even
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:12.480]  without PTSD and that's on record but now they're trying to make it law with
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:18.480]  the no fly no buy meanwhile all over the country the states are making the
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:21.640]  police license plates and their private car license plates and the bureaucrats
[2:56:21.640 --> 2:56:27.760]  and state and federal people where their license plates can't be read and where
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:32.120]  they can speed getting trouble basically can't get arrested and that's mainstream
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:36.080]  news so we're all slaves being tracked if they don't like you as they admit
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:39.880]  anti-war groups on no fly list anti-torture groups on no fly list
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:44.200]  congressmen on no fly list can't get off can't find out why you're on it don't
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:50.240]  have a second amendment once they do it I mean that's total 1984 they're using
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:53.520]  debt to control people bankrupting us financially so we have to go to the
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:56.840]  government hat in hand with their new mobile medical vans and their FEMA
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:04.080]  centers with medical centers where we want to go to the FEMA camps again the
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:11.120]  key here is that the globalists make money and get power and control out of
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:15.320]  owning the private company systems that then government contracts with to
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:19.400]  implement all this it's a revolving door between industry and government so
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:24.320]  they also profit off of their police state they used to control us and that's
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:29.840]  how this thing grows and tomorrow I will carve out an entire hour and make
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:34.040]  sure I get to the rest of all this and recap what we've already covered but
[2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:37.800]  that gives you just a window into the control grid so we'll get into a lot
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:41.760]  more tomorrow that's about 10% of what I'm gonna be covering because we got
[2:57:41.760 --> 2:57:45.800]  tarply coming up and I just ran out of time I wanted to get into this remember
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:49.320]  two days ago Geithner tells China its dollar assets are safe and it was in the
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:53.400]  news that he got laughed at well now dollar declines as nation moles reserve
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:59.000]  currency alternative and it says in Bloomberg the world is going ahead and
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:02.160]  deciding what the new world currency will be well they're gonna have a basket
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:06.440]  of currencies at first and then go to a pure face scan thumb print global
[2:58:06.440 --> 2:58:10.200]  currency they're gonna go right past the Amaro right past it all you'll still
[2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:14.600]  have regional currencies that have your local look but it's like there's 15
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:17.880]  different you know sports illustrators it's all printed by the same people it's
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:22.840]  standardized all the same databases but that will be globally identified with a
[2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:28.200]  thumb print and a face scan when you use a regional currency set by the new bank
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:32.080]  of the world that will set interest rates currency rates and everything so
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:35.880]  you'll still have paper money it's just tied to the casual society tracking
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:41.520]  system will break this down in 60 seconds stay with us it's key

[3:00:02.240 --> 3:00:21.040]  this is the controlled implosion of our economy by design stated on record by
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:25.280]  the globalist I believe they miscalculated it's gonna walk with
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:28.880]  their face you better hope so for the future of humanity we got Webster
[3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:32.400]  Griffin partly coming up in the next segment right now I want to bring Jim

[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:51.720]  940 with the gold and the silver priced into the market when it was a dollar or
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:59.160]  more under what it is now many other brokers and golden silver outfits are
[3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:03.720]  completely sold out of their selling for huge premiums I wanted to have Jim
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:08.480]  newcomer up for just a few minutes before Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us GM
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:15.120]  going under and and you know I'm not even tooting my horn here Jim newcomer but
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:19.200]  we told people two and a half years ago that GM was gonna go under by design and
[3:01:19.200 --> 3:01:25.440]  then it was going to be moved to China and Brazil and Burmese came running in
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:29.040]  here breathing heavy earlier saying you were right you were right yeah yeah here
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:33.840]  it is AP source GM to sell Hummer to Chinese company but that's only the
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:36.920]  beginning I have about five or six articles I printed this morning because
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:40.680]  I wanted to make this point and back it up and somebody's got to find the tapes
[3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:44.120]  of me and Bob Chapman two and a half years ago saying this and then two years
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:49.600]  ago and a year ago and six months ago and last week that this is all by design
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:53.320]  that's why they federalized it and this is them handing our industry over to
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:57.440]  foreigners with money to finance it leaving the country not just Hummer
[3:01:57.440 --> 3:02:01.560]  them they're announcing their Chinese divisions doing great I mean I've never
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:06.640]  seen such raping Jim newcomer good afternoon Alex I agree with you 100
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:11.640]  percent what's going on as a criminal I think years ago there was the old adage
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:16.680]  that as General Motors goes so goes America maybe it's a precursor of what's
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:21.960]  to come so but I don't think it may be I think I mean until we arrest the bankers
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:25.800]  it's over until we end the Fed it's over Jim I mean if people don't get in a
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:29.600]  golden silver now I mean I don't know what to tell them whether it's one silver
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:34.000]  coin or a hundred or whether it's one gold coin or five tell folks the great
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:37.800]  deals you've got today well the precious metals are real money and their real
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:42.720]  value today we've got to the coins that are most traded in the industry that's
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:50.280]  the $20 Liberty at $1632 and 60 cents the $10 Liberty is running 818 50 we
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:56.120]  have the walking Liberty half dollars these were minted from 1918 and 1947 at
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:03.520]  183 60 per roll of 20 we have the British sovereigns again at 285 93
[3:03:03.520 --> 3:03:08.760]  Frank said 231 50 and the ever-popular the Lakota National Silver Rounds are
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:14.000]  still available at 434 dollars and 40 cents a roll but it's a it's time to
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:20.120]  come out to a piece on the Lakota's it's 2172 now you can go online you can
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:23.720]  search these things out you're gonna pay 25 26 dollars no I know they've gone
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:29.680]  up to 25 bucks a month ago when you guys were selling them for 16 so there I
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:33.080]  mean amazing what about those Franklin halves that's really a good deal the
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:36.160]  Franklin halves are gone we had to replace that with a walking Liberty but
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:40.960]  the walking Liberty half dollars even older it's it's a great value at 918
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:46.160]  there 183 60 per roll we were real lucky to be able to find how long can you hold
[3:03:46.160 --> 3:03:50.000]  that because this is priced into the market a week or two ago how long can
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:54.360]  you hold these deals before it goes up again well that's hard to say Alex we're
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:57.560]  gonna try to hold it to the end of the week but if the market takes off it's
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:03.600]  it's gonna be almost impossible for us you bought silver and gold again you
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:07.320]  keep buying it when it's low and still selling it for the low price but you
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:11.120]  keep running out so it goes up but by the time you go up it's already gone up
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:16.280]  again so you're passing huge savings on to people yep well we'll secure a lot
[3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:20.920]  of it and when that lot is gone I mean the response has been so tremendous
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:24.200]  people calling in and ordering this that a lot of times we'll run out of what we
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:28.280]  purchased we endeavor to hold the price as long as we possibly can eight hundred

[3:04:41.520 --> 3:04:46.680]  it I mean it's a simple these are great great deals on golden silver it's a
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:50.160]  company I believe in and that I trust I think you should call right now eight

[3:04:53.680 --> 3:04:56.800]  terribly online but I got one more question for Jim newcomer when we come
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:05:02.000]  back Jim stay there we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen this is Alex Jones
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:05.680]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:05:05.680 --> 3:05:09.200]  this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[3:05:09.200 --> 3:05:13.400]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[3:05:13.400 --> 3:05:17.600]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[3:05:17.600 --> 3:05:21.600]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[3:05:21.600 --> 3:05:25.480]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:05:25.480 --> 3:05:29.120]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:32.440]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:36.400]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:40.200]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[3:05:40.200 --> 3:05:43.320]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[3:05:43.320 --> 3:05:47.400]  science a longtime sponsor of ours you can get more information at

[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:08.240]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[3:06:08.240 --> 3:06:11.960]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:15.400]  in a bread line you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:19.240]  dough and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you

[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:16.680]  we're going to webster terribly here in just a moment with the balance of the
[3:08:16.680 --> 3:08:19.560]  hour and your phone calls
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:23.960]  and i wanted to give you just a little window into this internal
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:27.400]  might as resources memorandum i get sent these
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:33.160]  about special deals they're offering and i don't know i'm supposed to do this but
[3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:36.040]  it says Lakota nation silver round
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:42.360]  overpriced 2172 or 434 dollars and 40 cents a roll
[3:08:42.360 --> 3:08:48.520]  the base cost on the trade is 20 dollars and 68 cents
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:55.080]  i mean they're making a dollar and a couple pennies on that i mean that's
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:59.960]  to mark up on these things i'm looking at gold coins here
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:05.160]  that are uh you know 231 dollars they're making five dollars on the coin
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:08.360]  i mean you can't keep the lights on for that these are specials
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:12.200]  that ted is offering and he's getting huge bulk discounts on these
[3:09:12.200 --> 3:09:16.840]  and he's buying it when gold is low and people aren't smart they don't buy when
[3:09:16.840 --> 3:09:22.040]  it's low that's when i buy they buy when it's high so ted does
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:25.800]  sells it to you at the low price when it's high
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:30.280]  win win win win win so i just wanted to explain to the listeners

[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:20.440]  no sir but have a great afternoon take care you know i didn't tell webster
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:23.320]  terribly i was going to do this by the way he's in the new obama film coming up
[3:10:23.320 --> 3:10:26.760]  one of the main kind of like the narrator of it
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:30.040]  bunch of people for this film wait to hear about it but the side issue the
[3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:32.760]  point is it's always exciting talk to tarpoli
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:36.680]  in about a month and a half as he was last year for shooting for the new film
[3:10:36.680 --> 3:10:41.640]  and so much has gone on i want to pick his brain on that and i know you do as
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:43.560]  well but tarpoli let me just throw this out at you
[3:10:43.560 --> 3:10:47.800]  because i don't know your view i know you're an economist shot in the dark
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:50.760]  and so i know you'll tell me what you really think
[3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:53.960]  do you think gold and silver in this crazy economy
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:57.320]  is something smart to get into or should folks hold on to their world
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:10:59.880]  currencies and hold on to their stocks and bonds
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:03.240]  i would strongly suggest alex first of all hi and thanks thanks for having me
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:05.880]  back um i would strongly suggest that everybody
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:09.880]  have a gold hedge uh a certain significant percentage of
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:13.080]  whatever you own ought to be in primarily gold
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:16.600]  and you can see this week we've had this uh the flap of interest
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:19.880]  in the past two weeks when standard and poor says that the
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:25.240]  the sovereign debt of the united kingdom of the british is going to be degraded
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:29.000]  down from triple a level to something less that is chunkified
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:32.920]  and then bill gross of pimp co comes out of the bond king of course and says
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:37.000]  yeah and that's going to happen to treasury bonds too that's very very uh
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:40.200]  ominous which you got right now is of course the dollar falling rather
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:44.200]  rapidly 143 against the euro remember the dollar had been
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:47.640]  for some you know crazy reasons and the financial system the dollar had been
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:52.120]  relatively strong over the last six months or so but more even more so the
[3:11:52.120 --> 3:11:55.320]  um the um the interest rate on the 30 year
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:11:59.000]  long bond of the treasury in other words this is where the when the price goes
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:03.880]  down the interest rate goes up so this was about 2.5 percent on the 30 year
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:07.720]  long bond in december and now it's 4.5 percent so that's
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:11.560]  2 percent in uh in less than six months and that's a big
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:14.360]  move for bonds they don't jump around or not supposed to
[3:12:14.360 --> 3:12:18.600]  in the same way that stocks do so i think what you're looking at right now is
[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:22.440]  inflation shading over into hyperinflation shading over into
[3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:25.880]  hyperstagflation and in the middle of that i think it's
[3:12:25.880 --> 3:12:30.520]  it's still uh probably if you still uh have a while to buy some gold
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:34.040]  uh before it starts going further up and then some people despair they said
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:38.360]  well i should have bought it when it was 400 or 500 or something like that now
[3:12:38.360 --> 3:12:42.120]  it's about a thousand i guess and uh they they think that it's too late it's
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:46.040]  not too late i think it's probably still a very good thing to have
[3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:49.320]  well absolutely but if people try to get gold and silver
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:53.000]  once the run starts and people think this is a run on it this is only the
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:56.680]  beginning of the gold rush uh historically you're not going to get it
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:12:59.080]  for any price it it's going to be really serious
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:03.640]  uh webster i see a crisis worldwide in all major currencies
[3:13:03.640 --> 3:13:06.520]  uh but centering around the pound in the dollar
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:10.040]  as as you were just saying you've been ranting and raving for years
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:14.280]  about gm and chrysler going under and what this would mean now devastating
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:18.120]  now they're saying we'll give you billions but under
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.160]  imf world bank world trade organization agreements
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:25.160]  as you know but listeners some may not just like with the stimulus package
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:29.160]  that had to be open for bids worldwide and a lot of it went overseas
[3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:32.680]  because under these globalist agreements you can't have the government
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:37.240]  quote subsidizing its industry so we're told this is socialism but it's not it's
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:41.480]  a pure cash gift to foreign offshore
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:46.120]  uh plutocratic bankers as you say and now it's in the news that not only is
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:51.400]  Hummer going to china but all all the major industry of gm the vast majority
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:55.880]  is going to opal of europe and to china and to brazil
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:14:00.280]  and that american taxpayers will fit the bill for that and the government
[3:14:00.280 --> 3:14:04.200]  will direct what type of cars are then shipped in here these little
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:07.400]  10 cans of tiny wheels i mean literally look like a
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:11.880]  a a a lunchbox with wheels i mean this is insane the level of corruption is
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:15.800]  even amazing me so as a top economist in some way i really respect
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:19.800]  is proven very accurate in the past what is happening greg palaces saying this
[3:14:19.800 --> 3:14:23.880]  is a mass looting that the corporate vultures are using government
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:27.160]  now to to divide and conquer like they've done in the third world
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:31.960]  what's really going on here well first of all it is a world economic depression
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:35.480]  of incalculable proportions and i i urge everybody
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:39.560]  uh we've just passed this milestone when general motors and christler are both
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:43.240]  bankrupt that means the united states is in a very severe
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:47.560]  economic depression so stop uh people should stop looking at the
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:51.560]  all these things they didn't go bankrupt in 29 i'm sorry to interrupt
[3:14:51.560 --> 3:14:54.520]  right now they've survived this is now the lowest stock price
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:57.640]  they've ever had and of course they didn't go bankrupt in the great depression
[3:14:57.640 --> 3:15:00.920]  but now they did and they've been driven into bankruptcy they were
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:03.960]  consciously deliberately driven into bankruptcy
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:08.120]  by the obama regime with larry summers tiny tim geithner
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:12.920]  and two villains in particular steve ratner alias ratner the rat
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:17.960]  who has been the head of this uh this uh auto task force that obama has
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:21.720]  and then this is right-hand man his running dog is a guy called brian
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:26.440]  deep d e f e and these are two wall street
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:30.680]  shackles these are the typical finance boys uh if you look back over the
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:34.200]  history of gm recent decade it has been destroyed
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:38.040]  by the finance side there's a big tension in any industrial corporation
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:41.560]  between the industrial engineers on the one side the people who know production
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:45.240]  or maybe sales and marketing and then the pure wall street
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:48.440]  characters and ever since the era of roger smith
[3:15:48.440 --> 3:15:53.000]  back in the in the 1980s and and uh approximately then
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:57.160]  the finance side of general motors has triumphed over the other side so they
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:01.080]  weakened the corporation but as as we saw at the beginning of april
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.640]  obama cynically deliberately decided that he would drive general motors into
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:08.680]  bankruptcy for the purpose among other things of
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:13.080]  busting the united auto workers the united auto workers these poor guys i
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:16.440]  sympathize with them they voted on thursday and friday
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:20.520]  to vote themselves out of existence the trade union movement in the united
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:24.920]  states has had its most catastrophic defeat in in a century
[3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:29.640]  when the ua w essentially committed suicide and accepted that deal on four
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:32.920]  o'clock uh friday afternoon and that's exactly
[3:16:32.920 --> 3:16:37.000]  webster that's exactly what you said a year plus ago about obama you said
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  he's the left cover to butcher all of what's left of the industries
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:44.040]  you imagine if george bush or john mccain would have told me to this but
[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:48.040]  obama tells him they just fall over and now the left goes yeah he's
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:52.280]  torturing yeah he's lying but he's our liar and we love him i mean this is
[3:16:52.280 --> 3:16:55.880]  total moral bankruptcy by the left in this country go ahead
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:16:59.160]  but i i hope that the that the support for obama and young these these
[3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:03.080]  deluded the kool-aid drinkers will will collapse soon but as you say right now
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:05.720]  it it hasn't done so uh...
[3:17:05.720 --> 3:17:10.040]  obama is a professional union buster that is his family business
[3:17:10.040 --> 3:17:13.480]  uh... the fort foundation and the other foundation the annenberg the joys
[3:17:13.480 --> 3:17:16.920]  the woods the camellia and so forth that he's worked for
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:19.640]  what is their business what is uh... sololinsky
[3:17:19.640 --> 3:17:22.920]  sololinsky the union buster he hates the new deal
[3:17:22.920 --> 3:17:27.880]  he hates industrial trade unionism and his racket is to organize poor people
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:31.480]  uh... people who have you know basically nothing but despair
[3:17:31.480 --> 3:17:35.480]  and use them as strike breakers and and the same thing with carbon taxes they
[3:17:35.480 --> 3:17:38.600]  are now admitting in the major british papers
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:41.960]  that this will ship all the dirty industry
[3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:45.960]  third world with no controls and then they get none of the benefits
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:49.480]  and then we have no industry here all it helps is the
[3:17:49.480 --> 3:17:51.240]  consolidators
[3:17:51.240 --> 3:17:53.480]  yeah and the asset strippers let's call them
[3:17:53.480 --> 3:17:57.160]  asset strippers the breakup orders because what obama has done therefore is
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:00.040]  to is to drive these companies into bankruptcy
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:04.920]  so that they would be at the mercy of various groups of asset strippers now
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:07.720]  i actually think opal has fared rather well
[3:18:07.720 --> 3:18:10.840]  in the sense that opal has been bought up essentially by russia
[3:18:10.840 --> 3:18:15.080]  right at spare bank of of russia that is really taken control of opal
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:18.680]  with their plans and what's on there in in the rye mine area
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.120]  of germany and that the russians obviously want to look i understand you
[3:18:22.120 --> 3:18:25.080]  like the russians you think they're being bullied on but still for national
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:26.120]  security
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:30.120]  gm's being gotten by the russians in europe the communist chinese are
[3:18:30.120 --> 3:18:30.840]  getting
[3:18:30.840 --> 3:18:34.600]  parts of it and so is brazil this is hard this is unbelievable
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:39.000]  no it's it's it's a disaster for the united states and we're paying for it
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:42.440]  that you can't blame these other people for picking up valuable things when the
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:44.840]  wall street jackals and parasites
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:49.000]  go to work let me just describe what this process is this has a name
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:53.640]  this is the musolini fascist corporate state and and let me just
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:56.680]  talk to your patients here with a definition of what that is
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:18:59.720]  the fascist corporate state first of all that corporate
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:03.160]  doesn't necessarily mean corporation in the modern term of the stock company
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:06.680]  it means a guild it means you know the master the journeyman
[3:19:06.680 --> 3:19:10.120]  and the apprentice the medieval organization so government labor
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:13.960]  and management are fused into one block they're merged
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:17.320]  but it's the banking interest the dominant it's not the government
[3:19:17.320 --> 3:19:19.880]  interest but it's not like government bureaucrats
[3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:23.080]  of some kind of you know professional cast like in china
[3:19:23.080 --> 3:19:26.920]  or it's a banking crime guild that uses government as a legitimizer of
[3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:30.440]  enforcement right it's what it's in washington as an annex of wall street
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:31.480]  a wholly owned
[3:19:31.480 --> 3:19:34.600]  a puppet well that's what's what obama is he's a wholly owned puppet
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:35.960]  of wall speed so
[3:19:35.960 --> 3:19:39.960]  fascist corporate state it's a compulsory state sponsored cartel
[3:19:39.960 --> 3:19:44.600]  to drive down wages drive down production and prop up fictitious paper values
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:47.400]  which is what we're seeing but only for a selected view
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:51.240]  only for city bank and jp morgan chase all right webster stay there let's
[3:19:51.240 --> 3:19:57.000]  break down where the economy is going and how you see things shaking up
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:01.320]  we'll also get into a bunch of other subjects like youth brigades
[3:20:01.320 --> 3:20:04.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:08.200]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[3:20:08.200 --> 3:20:11.560]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:14.840]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:17.800]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:20.360]  happen again so our friends at solutions from
[3:20:20.360 --> 3:20:24.040]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[3:20:24.040 --> 3:20:27.560]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[3:20:31.160 --> 3:20:34.520]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in

[3:20:58.040 --> 3:21:01.800]  this is alex jones for survivalseedbank.com
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:05.000]  in the new world order's war against humanity
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:09.480]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake
[3:21:09.480 --> 3:21:13.720]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[3:21:13.720 --> 3:21:17.000]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:20.200]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:24.680]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:21:24.680 --> 3:21:28.360]  if you have a demigod with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:32.680]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:21:32.680 --> 3:21:37.800]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:41.400]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:21:41.400 --> 3:21:46.360]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told
[3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:51.000]  and his real agenda get your copy of the obama deception today

[3:21:56.520 --> 3:22:00.920]  the obama deception the people strike back
[3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:04.680]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve note
[3:22:04.680 --> 3:22:08.440]  and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:12.200]  events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on
[3:22:12.200 --> 3:22:15.560]  the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:19.000]  reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:26.760]  if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a
[3:22:26.760 --> 3:22:30.200]  depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed along
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:33.480]  with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:37.240]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:40.680]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[3:22:40.680 --> 3:22:44.440]  i recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[3:22:44.440 --> 3:22:48.440]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:51.560]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for
[3:22:51.560 --> 3:22:54.120]  over six thousand years for more information call
[3:22:54.120 --> 3:22:56.840]  one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[3:22:56.840 --> 3:23:00.520]  that's one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:04.040]  more than seven hundred chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[3:23:04.040 --> 3:23:07.160]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while
[3:23:07.160 --> 3:23:09.480]  taking hot showers than when drinking the water
[3:23:09.480 --> 3:23:12.520]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:16.920]  and others are absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower filter works
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:20.200]  with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine

[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:31.400]  typically lasts 10 000 gallons or one year whichever comes first
[3:23:31.400 --> 3:23:34.840]  hospitals restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to
[3:23:34.840 --> 3:23:37.640]  reduce chlorine iron heavy metals and bacteria

[3:25:00.440 --> 3:25:02.680]  we'll talk about your new book by the way that i should be carrying the books
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:06.280]  where we carry your two books on obama and your book on 9-11 synthetic terror
[3:25:06.280 --> 3:25:09.000]  at info wars.com i should throw up at the new one
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:12.280]  surviving the cataclysm you predicted this 10 years ago it's republished and
[3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:16.200]  updated i just love people that have a track record years is so good
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:20.600]  uh... Webster it's just before we go into the the question of the fascist
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:23.320]  corporate state because it's continuing for people to understand
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:27.080]  the fascist corporate state is a state-sponsored compulsory cartel
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:31.320]  and it means that Geithner and Summers have picked the winners
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:35.400]  the winners are JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and they're trying to save
[3:25:35.400 --> 3:25:38.440]  Citibank if they can because that's Bob Rubin
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:42.760]  who is the sort of the gray eminence of this entire clique
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:48.120]  so they are going to run the General Motors bankruptcy in such a way as to
[3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:52.520]  save JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, Goldman Sachs
[3:25:52.520 --> 3:25:55.800]  and sacrifice everybody else and that's what people are screaming about that
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:25:59.240]  the other groups Oppenheimer and stairway
[3:25:59.240 --> 3:26:02.760]  and a couple of these other hedge funds have been sacrificed because they're
[3:26:02.760 --> 3:26:05.960]  not part of the state-sponsored compulsory cartel
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:10.760]  but notice what's happening production goes down wages go down unemployment
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:14.040]  goes down employment goes down jobs get to be
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:18.280]  fewer because they're destroyed but the fictitious paper claims
[3:26:18.280 --> 3:26:22.760]  of JP Morgan Chase and Citibank are propped up that's the fascist corporate
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:26.520]  state to call Obama a socialist is to do him a big favor
[3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:29.480]  that makes that makes him sound much nicer than he really is no this is a
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:33.880]  complete hoax this is a complete i know i mean let me be clear i'm not exactly
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:37.800]  this is a mass hoax to call this socialist that's what the media says
[3:26:37.800 --> 3:26:41.800]  it every day every night in hundreds of publications they print that headline
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:45.640]  but this is Marxism this is just piracy this is
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:50.200]  high seas swashbuckling knock us on the head is it not
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:53.560]  absolutely illegal now you've probably seen the greg palestar article which i
[3:26:53.560 --> 3:26:56.920]  think is very useful you could see every all these right wing characters
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:26:59.720]  saying yeah they the ua w has taken over everything
[3:26:59.720 --> 3:27:02.920]  the ua w has given up guaranteed health care
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:06.600]  for shares of stock in chrysler and general motors that are going to be
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:09.800]  worthless so the risk has been shifted to them
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:13.320]  and as far as i understand the six billion dollar payment is immediately
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:17.080]  made to jp morgan chase and city banks so they are made whole
[3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:20.840]  they get off with a whole coat and then they and then they privatize the risk
[3:27:20.840 --> 3:27:23.560]  they take taxpayer money put it into stocks
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:27.400]  floated out there and when it goes down the tubes it doesn't matter it just goes
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:31.800]  into thin air but like you said jp morgan chase they got the cash up front
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:35.560]  and we if you want to look at the the real excesses this is typical right we
[3:27:35.560 --> 3:27:40.840]  have the a i g payments from the top right from the bailout the bailout
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:45.320]  so the top gave a i g a hundred and eighty or two hundred billion dollars
[3:27:45.320 --> 3:27:48.840]  who got that money balkley's bank of great britain
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:53.480]  ten billion fifteen billion dorsche bank of germany ten to fifteen billion
[3:27:53.480 --> 3:27:56.840]  sociotation of all of france ten to fifteen billion
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:28:00.280]  union bank of switzerland perhaps the most bankrupt of all the big
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:04.760]  zombie banks another ten to fifteen billion and goldman sacks ten to fifteen
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:09.080]  and a i g a hundred and eighty billion right well then the money was conduited
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:12.360]  through a i g to them and the centerpiece of course is this
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:17.320]  london hedge fund of a i g which issued three trillion dollars of derivatives
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:21.160]  more than the gross national product of france so that that gives you precisely
[3:28:21.160 --> 3:28:24.840]  the key if you got burned by a hedge fund selling derivatives
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:28.680]  your next step is to outlaw hedge funds and to outlaw derivatives
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:32.440]  we have these characters around obama now talking about their plan
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:37.320]  to uh... regulate derivatives my plan to regulate derivatives is a shredder
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:41.080]  and a delete button no but you get rid of them you wipe them out
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:44.440]  not only are they worthless they are black hole singularities i mean like you
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:48.280]  said worthless they have negative negative value the rest of the clinic
[3:28:48.280 --> 3:28:52.840]  you gotta pay the you gotta pay the mafia garbage men to come and take them away
[3:28:52.840 --> 3:28:57.160]  unbelievable well what we're about to break a long segment coming up
[3:28:57.160 --> 3:28:59.480]  but i've got a you know get into this with you i know you're giving a
[3:28:59.480 --> 3:29:01.320]  solution so i agree with many of them
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:04.440]  let's talk about what is going to happen they're clearly not enough change
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:07.880]  course their criminal they're all in they're going for broke
[3:29:07.880 --> 3:29:10.760]  all their treasure is staked on this their blood their name
[3:29:10.760 --> 3:29:15.160]  they're going all out the youth corps are marching on tv and red and black
[3:29:15.160 --> 3:29:17.480]  uniforms now i don't know if you've seen this
[3:29:17.480 --> 3:29:24.040]  i mean we're now entering some type of strange lovey and uh brave new world
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:29.640]  mixed with twilight zone vortex where i expect to see floating pink
[3:29:29.640 --> 3:29:33.240]  panthers any moment so i want to flying pigs here
[3:29:33.240 --> 3:29:37.320]  i want to go over the worst case scenario which it appears it is
[3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:41.080]  as we go into hyper stag inflation and they don't
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:45.480]  do what should be done what is going to happen because i think at this point
[3:29:45.480 --> 3:29:49.400]  things are going to go down the tubes how do we salvage something
[3:29:49.400 --> 3:29:55.400]  let Mr. Tarpley stay with us we're on the march the empire's on the run

[3:33:09.080 --> 3:33:12.120]  all right web from the time we got with you and i want to jam in some calls as
[3:33:12.120 --> 3:33:17.320]  well i got a heavy backup time just flies only jump a couple
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:21.000]  hours plus i know you just finished two books
[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:28.200]  one on the roots of this cartel and one on their modern activities
[3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:33.880]  but as all this deteriorates faster and faster and they still prance around
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:35.960]  saying globalism is the answer when clearly
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:39.400]  their system of globalization engineered all of this
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:42.680]  whether by hooker by crook you know they're the
[3:33:42.680 --> 3:33:46.520]  progenitors of the of the problem that were under
[3:33:46.520 --> 3:33:50.600]  and then we have Geithner running around saying don't worry the dollar safe and
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:54.440]  the chinese laugh at him that's in the news and then
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:33:58.120]  the dollar starts plunging even further
[3:33:58.120 --> 3:34:01.320]  uh i tend to agree with you i mean i believe they engineered it because i
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:04.840]  have their own imf world bank documents but it's kind of like them
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:07.720]  delusional liars tend to start believing their own bull
[3:34:07.720 --> 3:34:11.160]  their own horse crap correct and i i really think they've lost control and
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:14.760]  these psychopathic thieves uh have endangered the entire shooting
[3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:18.760]  match i think that's true uh i think we're headed
[3:34:18.760 --> 3:34:22.440]  probably towards some kind of uh acute uh
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:26.040]  turn for this crisis and the words we've been living in this fool's paradise
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:29.320]  with a mugs rally a sucker rally going on in wall street
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:33.480]  but notice uh the state of california is collapsing general motors is bankrupt
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:37.880]  christer is bankrupt the toyota car sales are down 40 percent in the most
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:41.720]  recent month unemployment continues to uh
[3:34:41.720 --> 3:34:44.920]  to be very very high that was about half a million jobs lost
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:49.080]  per month every month so that's going to be a disaster now the question is
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:52.440]  when do you reach the breaking point on obama
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:57.080]  historically speaking the previous uh case of the one hundred percent
[3:34:57.080 --> 3:35:01.160]  wall street puppet president owned by the trilateral commission and bryzinski
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:04.200]  and barca fellows and so forth was of course carter
[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:09.080]  carter reached his peak what about now so to speak the at the end of april
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:14.280]  beginning of may mid-may 1977 and after that carter began to
[3:35:14.280 --> 3:35:17.720]  slide into a uh into a decline and i think that's
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:21.320]  there are signs that that's happening with with obama that the left liberals in
[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:25.400]  particular if you happen to see this campaign for america's future this
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:28.680]  borosage cutler band and hoy will go up the left
[3:35:28.680 --> 3:35:32.040]  liberals sort of the limousine liberal leader jet liberal
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:35.400]  types red merging into parts of the obama administration
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:39.560]  they're very uncomfortable with this idea of the 13 trillion going to wall
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:42.840]  street and a few hundred billion the crumbs going
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:46.680]  going to the rest of us i think there's a big problem there the question is
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:50.280]  if you've got to attack obama you've got to attack him from the left this is a
[3:35:50.280 --> 3:35:55.080]  big thing look at obama he loves to play himself off against limbaugh
[3:35:55.080 --> 3:35:58.680]  against newt gingrich know their own memo say that they say we want to make this
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:35:59.320]  about
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:03.480]  slight running for office against limbaugh limbaugh in running jack squat
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.240]  limbaugh loves the attention but he knows they're using him
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:11.160]  uh... as a distraction and of course as an ego maniac he can't get enough of it
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:15.000]  but the critique that really hurt so obama is is a left-wing critique now
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:19.800]  you got to develop some idea of of of an alternative policy and it can't be
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:23.480]  you know cut the budget and let everything liquidate into a you know
[3:36:23.480 --> 3:36:27.080]  general bankruptcy that that's just going to kill people now they've already
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:30.760]  hyperinflated things to the point uh... we need to arrest the bankers
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:34.760]  and direct all this fiat stuff into real industry so we get something
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:38.440]  let me just say one sign of life and it's just i'm surprised by this but
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:41.880]  you know michael moore right michael moore that we he's been around for a
[3:36:41.880 --> 3:36:43.240]  while people know him
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:46.360]  uh... if you look at his essay on general motors
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:50.360]  you will see that there are signs of life there in other words it's tinged
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:53.400]  with this gangrene economy stuff it's tinged with this
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:36:57.640]  alternative energy clap trap but what he says is
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:01.320]  you've got to go back to the nineteen forty two conversion of general motors
[3:37:01.320 --> 3:37:04.600]  to war production and then the reconversion
[3:37:04.600 --> 3:37:08.360]  uh... in nineteen forty five forty six back into civilian production
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:11.720]  and what could you reconvert those factories to do right because you've
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:16.120]  got unemployed workers fourteen more general motors factories closing
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:19.640]  dozens of factories now idle hundreds of thousands of unemployed
[3:37:19.640 --> 3:37:22.120]  auto workers what could you build and he says
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:25.320]  well you could build bullet trains now bullet trains would be that you know the
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:28.200]  japanese trains but of course they're obsolete now
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:31.720]  we want maglev we want magnetic levitation railways
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:35.960]  where you go from from los angeles to uh... to new york in three hours
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:40.120]  in a uh... in a uh... uh... a real car instead they're going to build cruddy
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:45.000]  local slow trains to know where with people so poor they came and afford to
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.800]  get on them instead of super trains the cities
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:51.960]  where you say oh i'm gonna shoot down the dallas on the hour train instead of four
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:55.560]  hours in a car but they won't do it man they will not do it because it's a good
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:37:58.440]  idea what you gotta fight for and with them i'm very encouraged to see that
[3:37:58.440 --> 3:38:01.960]  some of these ideas are floating around so michael moore says you can build
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:04.200]  uh... mass transit you can build maglev
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:07.160]  maybe there's an alternative energy he wants to build windmills while the
[3:38:07.160 --> 3:38:10.520]  windmills are crazy build nuclear reactors build one hundred
[3:38:10.520 --> 3:38:14.040]  high well let's back that up let's back that up you can't build windmills
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:16.200]  because for the amount of power they generate in their cost
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:19.880]  there's not a way to transfer the power without power loss for those that don't
[3:38:19.880 --> 3:38:24.520]  know power lines lose power so the substations to hold that power
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:28.120]  are too cost prohibitive from the wind centers of the country
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:33.400]  to deliver it to major mega cities now wind is good in a localized small town
[3:38:33.400 --> 3:38:37.000]  setting well it can be used for specialties when there's no other
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:38.680]  alternative but generally speaking
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:41.400]  you're going to put more energy into the windmill
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:44.200]  then you're ever going to get out of it so there are some places where you need
[3:38:44.200 --> 3:38:48.760]  that kind of thing but as a base load approach to an industrial economy it's
[3:38:48.760 --> 3:38:51.800]  a bad joke it's not a primary driver but listen before we get out of time and i
[3:38:51.800 --> 3:38:53.480]  know you want to get into solutions webster
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:56.280]  but i think people need to understand what's going to happen
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:38:59.160]  because clearly none of these are being implemented and even the people don't
[3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:01.720]  agree with your solutions they've got their own
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:05.320]  nothing but everything for wall street into the black hole everything
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:11.640]  clearly pentagon north com standing by to deliver us directly into the mall
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:17.720]  and we've got zolic uh worn stimulus sugar high won't stem unemployment so
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:21.640]  what's this double speak top neocon world bank president robert zolic
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:26.680]  literally an israeli agent publicly warns policymakers that fiscal stimulus
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:30.280]  plans are insufficient to turn around the real economy
[3:39:30.280 --> 3:39:34.680]  and rising joblessness threatens to set off political unrest across the globe
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:39.080]  and then he goes on so so so why are they making statements about political
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:42.520]  unrest knowing it's going to happen when they've engineered the policies knowing
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:45.880]  it would do that well they have there has been a lot of political unrest
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:49.400]  there's been a big uh ferment in the trade union movement in
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:52.920]  in europe there have been there have been various kinds of riots and things like
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:56.120]  this around the world and that's why i'm saying the program is absolutely
[3:39:56.120 --> 3:39:58.440]  critical no but you can get a mass movement going
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:01.960]  under these circumstances but if the democratic party collapses
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:05.720]  you've got to have an actual program to get out of the depression i would say
[3:40:05.720 --> 3:40:09.640]  that's the golden question of right now and it's the most precious wisdom in
[3:40:09.640 --> 3:40:12.920]  the world is how do you actually get out of a depression
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:15.720]  and i believe i know and that's what i put into this book
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:18.520]  surviving the cataclysm which people can get from uh
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:21.960]  from progressive press and then i hope soon from uh from you
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:26.040]  uh folks just google surviving the cataclysm was for driven partly
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:29.640]  resistance okay couple of other things going around uh the french government
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:33.240]  of all people the french government has now proposed a toben tax
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:36.280]  the securities transfer tax in other words something like a one percent
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:39.880]  sales tax on wall street bankers as they do their
[3:40:39.880 --> 3:40:43.720]  trillions of dollars only support that if it's implemented by the nations not by
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:48.280]  the very bankers themselves well it's a bit of a bit against the bankers
[3:40:48.280 --> 3:40:51.400]  themselves and they're the ones who pay it no but you understand the way the
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:55.400]  bankers have been proposing a toben but on our money transfers to bring in a
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:59.880]  global model on derivatives on on on the rest of their speculation another
[3:40:59.880 --> 3:41:03.880]  example the the banks are they have now did the price of oil up to
[3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:07.240]  sixty seven sixty eight dollars now remember who this is
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:11.160]  this is goldman sacks and morgan stanley and they operate through the london ic
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:13.480]  exchange you can see it they did it last year
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:16.280]  they got it up to a hundred and fifty hundred and sixty dollars
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:21.320]  they're trying to do it again so that's their thanks you bailed them out with
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:24.200]  the tarp your tax money went to goldman sacks and
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:27.880]  and morgan stanley which are now banks but of course as zombie banks the only
[3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:31.720]  thing they do is derivatives and propriety and now they're going to jack up
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:35.480]  energy so they all make tens of billions they've got to drive the price of of
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:39.240]  gasoline and and oil up to make some of these crazy windmills
[3:41:39.240 --> 3:41:42.440]  look more more plausible so that's what they're doing
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:46.760]  by the middle of last summer you were paying one dollar for every gallon of
[3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:51.320]  gas one dollar went to goldman sacks and morgan stanley alone
[3:41:51.320 --> 3:41:54.840]  so if you don't like that what you got to do is take measures to stop
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:41:58.760]  speculation one hundred percent margin requirements position limits
[3:41:58.760 --> 3:42:04.200]  and special status for speculators which is inferior to the status of users
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:08.680]  and and hedgers now the other aspect of it is a political resistance that i i
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:11.560]  don't know if you've talked about Sri Lanka but this seems to me to be very
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:15.640]  very very interesting the u.s and the british over decades
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:19.320]  fomented this camel tiger revolt these are terrorist
[3:42:19.320 --> 3:42:24.200]  butchers of the worst kind right suicide bombers female suicide bombers
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:27.880]  they they are pioneered all the stuff the question now is
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:32.600]  the indian ocean as the chinese lifeline right the chinese need to get oil from
[3:42:32.600 --> 3:42:37.240]  the persian gulf oil from sudan raw materials from africa so the indian
[3:42:37.240 --> 3:42:40.440]  ocean the arc of crisis in bryzinski terms is now
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:43.240]  now a key place in the middle of this you had this
[3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:48.200]  this terrorist army sponsored by the u.s and the british the liberation tigers
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:52.600]  and they have now been annihilated they're their chief this guy prop hakaran
[3:42:52.600 --> 3:42:57.880]  has been liquidated and what you saw a very interesting epiphany right the
[3:42:57.880 --> 3:43:00.520]  moment where you really see what's what in the world
[3:43:00.520 --> 3:43:05.160]  as the Sri lankan army closes in on these awful awful terrorists
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:08.440]  the british foreign secretary david milliband
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:11.480]  and the french foreign minister bernard kushner
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:16.200]  come forward and say oh no this is terrible it's a humanitarian catastrophe
[3:43:16.200 --> 3:43:21.000]  we've got now to we've got a ceasefire ceasefire means that the camel tigers
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:25.080]  escape and live to come back and kill and have more suicide bombers another day
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:28.280]  but it's just like using al-qaeda to attack the serbs
[3:43:28.280 --> 3:43:31.480]  and then they got on this airplane and i ran they find the bomb
[3:43:31.480 --> 3:43:35.560]  iran's on record saying the u.s is using al-qaeda to attack them the
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:39.800]  white house admits under bush and obama they're using sunnis
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:43.160]  to destabilize iran and then the news has the nerve
[3:43:43.160 --> 3:43:48.920]  to say that she had iran is al-qaeda i mean how dumb don't people know that
[3:43:48.920 --> 3:43:51.720]  al-qaeda is the u.s british government
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:56.280]  i had well the kla of kosovo that biden has just been visiting and the
[3:43:56.280 --> 3:44:01.240]  the camel tigers and the but i mean that's how ridiculous it is on record
[3:44:01.240 --> 3:44:05.080]  the white house puts out press releases saying we got four sunni groups
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:09.240]  attacking iran they're blowing up moz trying to blow up airplanes bombing
[3:44:09.240 --> 3:44:12.920]  things and then they got the nerve to say on the news look al-qaeda is hitting
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:16.920]  iran we've got to stop al-qaeda i mean how dumb do these people think the
[3:44:16.920 --> 3:44:21.240]  population is specifically jundula right the balochistan
[3:44:21.240 --> 3:44:25.880]  uh... u.s. backed liberation now what what the Sri lankan have done is going to
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:29.400]  be imitated and i think the pakistanis have gotten the idea
[3:44:29.400 --> 3:44:33.240]  but the the reason that that obama want to stop you again pakistan president
[3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:36.760]  goes on and says we're with al-qaeda you created al-qaeda
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:41.080]  you're using the taliban to isolate our cities you're overthrowing us
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:44.520]  with your al-qaeda and boy they didn't like that did they
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:47.720]  and the but the answer is now what the what the pakistani army seems to have
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:50.840]  done is to say what the Sri lankan have done we can do
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:53.880]  and that is to say take the conventional pakistani army
[3:44:53.880 --> 3:44:57.480]  go into the swat valley and basically wipe out the taliban
[3:44:57.480 --> 3:45:00.760]  uh... which are largely people now who have been recruited
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:05.160]  by the indians and by the cia in afghanistan and then sent into
[3:45:05.160 --> 3:45:08.840]  pakistan to overthrow the government those people seem to have been pretty much
[3:45:08.840 --> 3:45:11.960]  mowed down so about one one thousand five hundred
[3:45:11.960 --> 3:45:15.480]  so-called taliban in other words cia secret army types
[3:45:15.480 --> 3:45:18.680]  have been uh... wiped out in in the swat valley
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:22.200]  minimal losses for the pakistani army the the goal being
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:26.360]  that if you can keep the taliban and the al-qaeda out of your country
[3:45:26.360 --> 3:45:31.240]  then obama will no longer have the pretext to send these killer drones
[3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:35.240]  to destroy civilian uh... talk to me always target weddings and innocent
[3:45:35.240 --> 3:45:38.520]  groups to stir up and to get the pastures and others
[3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:43.000]  to join with taliban al-qaeda webster it's so dastardly on record al-qaeda
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:48.920]  taliban is cia mousad shin bett m i six on record
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:52.680]  right and you try to tell the public that they just can't get it
[3:45:52.680 --> 3:45:56.440]  how i mean this is on record but now it would be the difference now there is
[3:45:56.440 --> 3:46:01.080]  something new that under chinese auspices and this is due to simply what's
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:04.360]  going on like it or not they've been figured some of this stuff out
[3:46:04.360 --> 3:46:07.720]  it's called the string of pearls right the chinese say well we need to have
[3:46:07.720 --> 3:46:08.760]  thailand
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:12.760]  bermain yanmar we need bangladesh we need sri lanka we need the
[3:46:12.760 --> 3:46:16.840]  seychelles the comores we need to get over to sudan and zimbabwe
[3:46:16.840 --> 3:46:21.160]  these are your chinese allies and this is what brzezinski and obama
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:24.440]  and uh... the clinton state department are are attacking
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:28.920]  so there's got been to be a resistant and the chinese are basically showing
[3:46:28.920 --> 3:46:32.520]  them how to do it with chinese help the sri lankan have
[3:46:32.520 --> 3:46:36.120]  wiped out these camel tigers and it may well be that with chinese help
[3:46:36.120 --> 3:46:39.160]  the pakistanis are going to liberate themselves
[3:46:39.160 --> 3:46:43.320]  of the presence of these polybond and al-qaeda shift gears on a very promising
[3:46:43.320 --> 3:46:45.880]  sign in the world i think highly interesting people should know about
[3:46:45.880 --> 3:46:48.920]  it was we got to have you up longer than their future to really let you run
[3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:51.560]  all this because you're such an expert on it all
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:46:55.480]  and we really appreciate your time but i'm going back here but at the same time
[3:46:55.480 --> 3:46:59.880]  china is signing twins here with the united states in the west
[3:46:59.880 --> 3:47:04.040]  owning the majority of our debt and are they going to continue to hold the
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:07.800]  dollar how do you see things unfolding versus salute
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:10.360]  there's a big debate in china now because that
[3:47:10.360 --> 3:47:14.760]  it is of course crazy for a developing country that needs to buy
[3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:18.520]  capital goods to hold large amounts of of
[3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:21.800]  dollars paper dollars in the form of these treasury bonds
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:25.080]  but that the chinese leadership uh... that they show
[3:47:25.080 --> 3:47:28.360]  that they're really not as clever as they as they thought they were they
[3:47:28.360 --> 3:47:33.080]  seem to believe in money money in terms of paper money dollars well
[3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:37.320]  these are just green pieces of paper if you get some dollars what you damn well
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:38.520]  better do with them
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:42.440]  is going by some capital goods going by steel mills going by locomotive
[3:47:42.440 --> 3:47:45.160]  well they're starting to do that though they're the china's moving into
[3:47:45.160 --> 3:47:49.240]  copper gold do it and that was the moment the girls of laughter
[3:47:49.240 --> 3:47:53.240]  for tiny tim geithner the tax cheat the turbo tax man
[3:47:53.240 --> 3:47:56.360]  when he went to beijing university and they basically
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:48:00.840]  before them into uh... into the you know and not not existent
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:04.760]  what he said i want you to know i want you to know in the worst way
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:09.080]  that your investments in u.s. treasury bonds are safe and sound and they just
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:12.600]  all started laughing and i think that's that's a turning point of world
[3:48:12.600 --> 3:48:15.400]  history because that it's just untenable
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:20.120]  uh... because they know a slime bag corporate faith that's destroyed america
[3:48:20.120 --> 3:48:24.200]  a little spider is in there and it's all just a big joke to them they're trying
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:28.200]  to prop up their biggest market but i mean i think the decision has been made
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:29.240]  globally that
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:33.080]  it's it's it's the end and i and i guess we'll just be ruled by a bunch of
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:38.920]  geithners and summers and and uh... you know ruben running around with
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:42.360]  military in the time we've got webster
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:45.800]  then how do you see this unraveling and now have you seen the tv ads that are
[3:48:45.800 --> 3:48:48.440]  running nationally with people in black and red uniforms
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:52.120]  marching and and and and they're openly announcing that they're going to be on
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:53.800]  the streets and are on the streets
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:48:57.400]  i mean i mean it's actually happening webster it's one thing to say we think
[3:48:57.400 --> 3:49:01.240]  it's coming but i mean we are descending into hell here
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:04.920]  yeah it's it's obviously at the bad scene and then there are these things
[3:49:04.920 --> 3:49:08.040]  uh... quasi-fascist or fascist militias
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:11.560]  coming up but i heard people don't take yourself out of the equation
[3:49:11.560 --> 3:49:14.680]  this whole regime extremely vulnerable right now
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:19.080]  i agree problem is if you go forward and say you know we don't like obama but we
[3:49:19.080 --> 3:49:20.440]  want the free market
[3:49:20.440 --> 3:49:23.640]  that's a loser it's it's just it's it's not going anywhere
[3:49:23.640 --> 3:49:25.880]  they're gonna have us argue between left and right
[3:49:25.880 --> 3:49:29.480]  when it says nothing to do with it and a phony right-wing thing versus a left
[3:49:29.480 --> 3:49:30.360]  wing thing
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:33.560]  and then meanwhile they just he goes off the edge of a cliff
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:35.720]  but if you get out there and say
[3:49:35.720 --> 3:49:39.880]  sees general motors and reconverted to produce tractors
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:43.720]  nuclear reactors maglev rail modern
[3:49:43.720 --> 3:49:47.720]  capital goods that can be sold in the third world that the people in
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:50.840]  but the globalist don't want to build up the third world
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:55.000]  they want to neutralize them from industry so that they can be controlled
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:56.760]  absolutely so you've got to counter that
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:00.600]  so you can't have them in every way counter them nationally and internationally
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:04.520]  so i think it's time to uh... to organize in the words i think the uh... the
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:06.760]  obama deception your work
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:10.920]  and other things have come together now especially the the the betrayals of this

[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:32.840]  he has betrayed us on everything he has betrayed us more than any other

[3:55:14.200 --> 3:55:18.200]  okay webster look here's the deal you've got your solutions i agree with a lot of
[3:55:18.200 --> 3:55:21.720]  it we're not in control of things the people don't want what the bankers are
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:25.320]  doing they want what you're saying common sense it's not happening
[3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:29.960]  bloomberg saying how dare the american people not love that you know what's
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:33.560]  happening with gm as if you know we don't care as if we haven't been
[3:55:33.560 --> 3:55:36.840]  raped enough that's being used as a distraction of the tens of
[3:55:36.840 --> 3:55:40.440]  trillions that have you know been been sucked out right to the bankers
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:43.720]  but they're having a fake solution that is carbon taxes
[3:55:43.720 --> 3:55:47.480]  shutting down most the industry as Pelosi said in china
[3:55:47.480 --> 3:55:53.000]  categorizing and registering everything we do carbon credit ration cards
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:56.280]  i don't think the public realizes that not only are they going to bankrupt
[3:55:56.280 --> 3:56:00.840]  things their new economy is this dead economy by
[3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:04.520]  design to bring in neo feudalism and serfdom that you cover
[3:56:04.520 --> 3:56:07.560]  in the obama deception so eloquently that i hope folks will get
[3:56:07.560 --> 3:56:12.360]  an info wars dot com and show to people quickly so in closing how do we
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:16.040]  we have to not just have solutions we have to discredit
[3:56:16.040 --> 3:56:20.040]  their power grab of the whole economy that's left i mean
[3:56:20.040 --> 3:56:23.080]  there's no way to say this was a design everything they're doing is designed
[3:56:23.080 --> 3:56:25.080]  to criminally consolidate
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:28.520]  well we're all looking forward to the uh... to the next uh... product coming
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:32.040]  out of your your shop there if it's uh... july fourth or
[3:56:32.040 --> 3:56:33.640]  or thereabouts
[3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:38.040]  and uh... there may be possibly ways to uh... to regroup further i mean we may
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:39.800]  we might want to think about
[3:56:39.800 --> 3:56:42.760]  some form of conferences maybe in the uh...
[3:56:42.760 --> 3:56:47.000]  in the late summer early autumn bring together various kinds of uh...
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:50.520]  forces that are in resistance i don't feel but i wonder if i have uh... if
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:54.040]  c-span would put us back on so i go ahead it's possible bill burgers
[3:56:54.040 --> 3:56:56.840]  continuing to get to with his lawsuits
[3:56:56.840 --> 3:57:00.520]  to expose obama he's he's uh... he thought he had oral arguments in the
[3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:01.520]  third circuit
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:03.800]  in philadelphia but they've pushed him now
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:05.160]  into the autumn but
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:09.160]  at a certain point i think that that the climate of opinion begins to change
[3:57:09.160 --> 3:57:12.200]  and i think obama is is now past his peak
[3:57:12.200 --> 3:57:14.360]  and i think people should therefore take heart
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:18.480]  and we double their efforts and uh... and and keep fighting the good fight
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:21.400]  because obama is now more vulnerable in the woods
[3:57:21.400 --> 3:57:25.400]  the the idea that these left liberals at their uh... campaign for america's
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:26.600]  future conference
[3:57:26.600 --> 3:57:31.000]  or so uncomfortable about the fact that the guy is such an obvious
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:32.400]  wall street puppet
[3:57:32.400 --> 3:57:35.720]  so subservient to summer is and and uh...
[3:57:35.720 --> 3:57:37.560]  and all of these zombie bankers
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:41.360]  i think that's uh... that's a beginning to crack this edifice well i think we
[3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:44.600]  began to crack it was in saying no rights for detainees in the tortures
[3:57:44.600 --> 3:57:47.800]  going to continue and right we're gonna open new camps i mean that this is
[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:48.920]  ridiculous
[3:57:48.920 --> 3:57:51.200]  right but therefore the big the big question is
[3:57:51.200 --> 3:57:52.800]  economic program
[3:57:52.800 --> 3:57:53.920]  do you have one
[3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:57.760]  in other words can you criticize obama in a way that makes it clear that you're
[3:57:57.760 --> 3:57:59.280]  not talking about
[3:57:59.280 --> 3:58:03.000]  having the depression work its full fury on the on the population
[3:58:03.000 --> 3:58:06.480]  but you're actually proposing solutions that would work
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:09.520]  reconverting general motors to make maglev train
[3:58:09.520 --> 3:58:14.120]  that's the idea that will i think take off and and get us into the future
[3:58:14.120 --> 3:58:16.320]  well certainly that's better than just given
[3:58:16.320 --> 3:58:19.120]  fourteen point eight trillion a bunch of criminal bankers
[3:58:19.120 --> 3:58:23.880]  callback callback operation callback on the bankers well we need to
[3:58:23.880 --> 3:58:26.560]  audit the fed that's going to expose other criminals
[3:58:26.560 --> 3:58:30.440]  we need to get more states sovereignty to to expose the central government
