[00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:14.999]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:42.318]  These women were being told by CBP officers to drink out of the toilet.
[00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:47.022]  Excuse me, I think this might be Gatorade or something.
[00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:49.064]  I was just looking for some regular water.
[00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:06.336]  Water?
[00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:06.956]  Yeah.
[00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:08.337]  You mean like in the toilet?
[00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:14.578]  One of the women said that she was told by an agent to drink water out of the toilet.
[00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:16.639]  What for?
[00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:24.480]  Just to drink.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.441]  Out of the toilet.
[00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:30.462]  What you're saying is that you want us to put water on the crops.
[00:01:30.462 --> 00:01:31.282]  Yes.
[00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:31.642]  Water.
[00:01:32.438 --> 00:01:33.659]  Like out the toilet?
[00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.122]  Well, I mean, it doesn't have to be out of the toilet, but yeah, that's the idea.
[00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.383]  Out of the toilet.
[00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:39.164]  Out of the toilet.
[00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:47.271]  Do you think that we should be using more Brondo on the crops in Africa to help alleviate the food shortage and the droughts over there?
[00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:48.172]  Yes.
[00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:53.417]  Any other comments on the Brondo being used in Africa that's helping the crops?
[00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:59.422]  Definitely, if they got it over there, they should get more out there to help them out and get the resources they need to stay healthy and alive.
[00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.102]  More Brondo.
[00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:03.843]  It's got electrolytes and what plants need.
[00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:09.184]  For the last time, I'm pretty sure what's killing the crops is this Brondo stuff.
[00:02:09.184 --> 00:02:10.865]  But Brondo's got what plants crave.
[00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:11.945]  It's got electrolytes.
[00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:16.286]  Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know that if you put water on plants, they grow.
[00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:19.367]  Well, I've never seen no plants grow out of no toilet.
[00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.407]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.227]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:22.147]  Yeah, that's good.
[00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:23.728]  You sure you ain't the smartest guy in the world?
[00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:23.948]  Nah.
[00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:26.529]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.409]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.769]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.049]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.191]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.091]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.732]  Out of the toilet.
[00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:42.232]  Clown world is deadly dangerous though, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:49.014]  Every time it goes this way in any other nation, you end up with mass starvation, collapse of civilization, warlords, and death camps.
[00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:55.817]  The Democratic Party, being financed by the CHICOMS and others, is showing its true colors.
[00:02:55.817 --> 00:02:58.118]  It hasn't gone to seed.
[00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:02.161]  It's simply showing you what it's really all about.
[00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:03.282]  Wow.
[00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:04.683]  Let's just begin with this.
[00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:15.470]  Representative wants to prosecute people who mock Congress, and there's a whole bunch of people on her Twitter account praising it, saying it's time to start arresting anyone that disagrees with Democrats.
[00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.133]  That's Representative Frederica Wilson of Florida.
[00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:28.055]  And she's not a lunatic, she's an authoritarian and she's already gotten away with so much that she believes she can just do it.
[00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:34.800]  Here she is at a public speech calling for people that make fun of buffoons like her to be arrested.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:44.626]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:49.829]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:57.153]  We're gonna shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.274]  They should be prosecuted.
[00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:02.757]  She goes on to praise Big Tech and the crackdown on, well, you know who.
[00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.613]  And they have hearings in Congress where they lie about me to my face and I can't speak at the hearing while they trash me sitting up there.
[00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:19.936]  Only in the authoritarian America run by the Democrats, ladies and gentlemen, where the Republicans are all extremely intimidated at the leadership level and run screaming in fear.
[00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:26.939]  Even Fox News is like, well, maybe we should ban the Betsy Ross flag.
[00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.300]  Maybe, maybe it is bad.
[00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:30.684]  Maybe it is hurtful.
[00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:39.168]  Maybe the American flag is something that needs to be... I mean, they're having 50-50 discussions on Fox News, where one side's like, well, this is preposterous.
[00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:41.589]  Others, well, this is very reasonable.
[00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:43.809]  We told you it was coming, and it's here.
[00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.671]  Wait till we come back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:49.552]  This is just one hell of a transmission.
[00:04:49.552 --> 00:04:55.154]  The Border Patrol has come out and said that AOC's a complete liar, and they have the videos.
[00:04:57.748 --> 00:05:06.932]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.
[00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:12.454]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time with the incredible ingredients in this formula.

[00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:33.469]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the True Alpha Male Pack.
[00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:40.715]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:44.398]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.

[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.504]  Show the world what a True Alpha Male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:54.006]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today!
[00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:11.078]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:22.605]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:31.250]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:38.114]  Thank you for joining us, my friends, on this historic July 3rd, 2019.
[00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:49.301]  In defiance of the globalist attacks, their lies, their attempts to criminally set us up, their lawsuits, in defiance of all they've done, we are still on air.
[00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:50.922]  Thanks to you, the viewers.
[00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:52.123]  Thanks to you, the listeners.
[00:06:52.123 --> 00:07:01.549]  Thanks to your prayers, your spreading the word, and your financial support, we have withstood the storm and come out battered and scarred, but stronger.
[00:07:03.268 --> 00:07:15.175]  And more ready for the next phase of our take back of the Republic and then the take back of the planet for a pro-human future and destiny.
[00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:23.619]  Let me do this as good as I can because I want to just tell you what I have in the stacks here and what's breaking and what's coming out.
[00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:30.143]  You are seeing a full-on globalist attack using a classic communist
[00:07:31.843 --> 00:07:40.227]  Divide and conquer, culture war, race war, sexist war, playbook.
[00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:45.390]  We are witnessing unattempted overthrow of the country.
[00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.351]  And if Hillary would have gotten in, she would have done this regardless.
[00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.073]  But now they're doing it even though they don't have full control of the executive.
[00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:52.594]  This country
[00:07:53.692 --> 00:07:57.214]  is in a civil war between factions in the government.
[00:07:57.214 --> 00:08:09.020]  You see all the big major Fortune 500 weighing in with anti-God, anti-family, just venom meant to collapse this nation.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.341]  And it's not just in the old Cloward and Piven documents.
[00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:14.083]  It's not just in the old admitted communist blueprints.
[00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:21.688]  It's in the WikiLeaks that we're being demoralized, we're being attacked.
[00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:25.494]  Everything is being weaponized to create absolute division.
[00:08:27.128 --> 00:08:32.630]  But America is not buying it, and the system is putting out fake polls.
[00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:41.352]  Every poll you see is 10, 20, 30 points more towards nationalism, Christianity, Trump, Infowars, free speech.
[00:08:41.352 --> 00:08:47.214]  And Trump understands that now, and he's been talking about that in speeches, because that's what their own real polls they're doing are showing.
[00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:52.753]  But they are coming after our speech like a ton of bricks.
[00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:55.135]  And they're calling for violent overthrow of the government.
[00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.316]  They're calling for physical revolution.
[00:08:57.316 --> 00:08:59.197]  They're calling for any means necessary.
[00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:10.683]  And now, Representative wants to prosecute people who mock Congress, openly calls for criminal prosecution of free speech, and says she will work with those.
[00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:15.626]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, Media Matters, Microsoft, Apple, Google.
[00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:20.002]  To shut them up and shut them down.
[00:09:20.002 --> 00:09:23.624]  Remember the View host saying, shut them down, shut them up!
[00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:29.726]  And all the other shows, shut not just Alex Jones down, shut them all down.
[00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:31.127]  Shut them all up.
[00:09:31.127 --> 00:09:34.328]  I could play hours of them saying this.
[00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:39.170]  And so she's giving a little glimpse into the backroom meetings.
[00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.471]  That is going to be coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.092]  But she says,
[00:09:45.248 --> 00:09:47.969]  Arrest anyone critical of Congress.
[00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:49.850]  You're like, well that sounds preposterous!
[00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.911]  No, they're planning to make their move!
[00:09:51.911 --> 00:10:09.577]  Oh, and 40 minutes of an internal, secret, Antifa meeting, that the Orwellian called a community meeting, you get to see the slime with their mask off, the slime that crawled out of George Soros' rear end.
[00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:13.619]  You can see these grimy, slimy maggots
[00:10:15.243 --> 00:10:22.584]  And you can see all the assaults and all the things they're planning to do on July 4th, July 5th, and July 6th.
[00:10:22.584 --> 00:10:24.945]  We're going to have reporters there covering it.
[00:10:24.945 --> 00:10:27.825]  But it is just incredible.
[00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:31.526]  That's coming up.
[00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:41.468]  We also have the latest on the banning of the Betsy Ross first American flag commissioned by George Washington himself.
[00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:47.778]  That actually flew behind Obama at his inauguration.
[00:10:47.778 --> 00:10:51.399]  They are now moving to the next phase of making you hate your flag and your country.
[00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:53.160]  When you get conquered, they take your flag away.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.920]  That's just a little note in history.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.822]  New Mexico governor jumps in on Kaepernick situation, saying it's wrong.
[00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:05.223]  The California governor says that it's good what they're doing, that America's bad.
[00:11:07.093 --> 00:11:08.073]  This is just amazing.
[00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:10.514]  A majority of Democrats say they don't like America in polls.
[00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:12.494]  A majority of Republicans say they do.
[00:11:12.494 --> 00:11:16.615]  I mean, the Democrats are the globalist anti-American party.
[00:11:16.615 --> 00:11:22.257]  The New York Times publishes a big article saying America sucks and isn't good.
[00:11:22.257 --> 00:11:24.117]  That's who these slime bags are.
[00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:27.218]  They're collaborators with the foreign money.
[00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:29.318]  They're traitors and they'll sell you out.
[00:11:29.318 --> 00:11:30.399]  They'll sell your family out.
[00:11:32.378 --> 00:11:34.619]  I watched probably 20 minutes of this last night.
[00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:40.343]  There's all these different angles of it, because it goes on for reportedly over an hour.
[00:11:40.343 --> 00:11:43.965]  A well-known black rapper and a rap group comes out.
[00:11:43.965 --> 00:11:45.486]  They've got a huge bodyguard.
[00:11:45.486 --> 00:11:47.307]  They're all big black guys.
[00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:52.370]  And these little Islamic Arabs come up and start slapping them and hitting them in the head.
[00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.111]  And the black guys don't want any trouble.
[00:11:55.111 --> 00:11:56.452]  So they let them slap them and hit them.
[00:11:56.452 --> 00:11:59.274]  They keep trying to get away, so the little rats chase them.
[00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:02.598]  And get their ass totally beat in.
[00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:06.660]  Now, you have to understand.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.963]  This is like if you ever had a duck or something attack you, because it's never had anybody kick it upside the head.
[00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:13.084]  You weigh 200 pounds, it comes up attacking you.
[00:12:13.084 --> 00:12:15.766]  You just shove a shotgun in its face and blast it, if you want to.
[00:12:16.738 --> 00:12:17.599]  It's the same thing here.
[00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:25.804]  You've got guys that probably weigh 130 pounds coming up to a black dude, probably weighs 330 pounds, most of it muscle.
[00:12:25.804 --> 00:12:28.465]  A giant black bodyguard.
[00:12:28.465 --> 00:12:32.588]  I mean, I'm sure, you know, he beat up probably 95% of the population.
[00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:34.970]  Take Mike Tyson, give him a run for his money.
[00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.352]  And the other black guys are big too, okay?
[00:12:38.352 --> 00:12:41.814]  And they're well-known rappers that came from the streets, so probably not wimpy dudes.
[00:12:41.814 --> 00:12:43.395]  Probably been a couple hundred fights each.
[00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:46.429]  I mean, I grew up in Dallas.
[00:12:46.429 --> 00:12:51.191]  You just don't want to randomly start a fight with three big black dudes or four big black dudes.
[00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:56.974]  The black guys obviously don't want to end up going to jail when they hurt these guys, but they go ahead and beat the living hell out of them.
[00:12:56.974 --> 00:12:58.435]  Because, see, the black guys didn't know.
[00:12:58.435 --> 00:13:05.898]  They were there playing at a venue the night before that is in a no-go zone.
[00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:10.160]  And so they're just trying to leave and being attacked.
[00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:14.377]  That's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:31.272]  So, four or five black guys, there's also guys filming, so you see three or four of them, but there's more, they come out of their hotel, try to go to a restaurant, they're in a no-go zone, and Muslims start slapping their headphones over their heads so hard that the big black dude's bleeding.
[00:13:31.272 --> 00:13:32.914]  Now, he doesn't kill them at that point.
[00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:34.976]  I would have assaulted them, because they assaulted me.
[00:13:36.527 --> 00:13:44.913]  But it goes on and on and on until they, reportedly the guys were unconscious when they were loaded on ambulances.
[00:13:46.405 --> 00:13:53.230]  And in about 30 seconds, the black guys beat the Muslim Arabs to a pulp once they start attacking them.
[00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.313]  Now they grab and just slam their heads in the ground, and they get on top of them and just start bashing their heads in.
[00:13:57.313 --> 00:13:58.674]  That's how you kick somebody's ass.
[00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:02.917]  You slam them down on the ground, you jump on top of them, and you start breaking their jaw.
[00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:04.578]  That's how you kick somebody's ass.
[00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:06.580]  You get them on the ground and you beat their brains out.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:12.264]  Now just imagine, this happened to our reporters when they tried to go to no-go zones that the media said don't exist.
[00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:15.186]  Up to a third of Paris is a no-go zone.
[00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:20.826]  Up to a third of places like Paris are more no-go zones, and it keeps expanding.
[00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:33.293]  You bring in people that are tribal, and you bring in people that are used to running everyone they don't know out of their neighborhood, and then you worship them and kiss their ass, and they can rape women, they can rob, they can burn cars, they can steal.
[00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:34.554]  It's unbelievable.
[00:14:34.554 --> 00:14:41.157]  But see, these weren't Europeans taught to be cucked and beat up by these 120, 130 pound idiots.
[00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:47.858]  They're like, hey, dude, we don't want to hurt you, stop.
[00:14:47.858 --> 00:14:50.302]  Let me just tell you something right now.
[00:14:50.302 --> 00:14:52.666]  Slap me across the head with a pair of headphones and I'm bleeding.
[00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:53.947]  I'm going to knock you upside the head.
[00:14:53.947 --> 00:14:56.732]  These guys had such restraint.
[00:14:56.732 --> 00:14:58.654]  But see, they knew they were going to hurt him.
[00:14:58.654 --> 00:15:00.678]  And they didn't want to go to jail because they know how stuff works.
[00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.857]  But see, that's how this works in Europe, by the way.
[00:15:04.857 --> 00:15:06.598]  You defend yourself, you get arrested a lot of times.
[00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:07.679]  They did not get arrested.
[00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:09.301]  There were so many witnesses.
[00:15:09.301 --> 00:15:13.485]  By the way, while they were doing this, they were slapping women on the ass that were walking by.
[00:15:13.485 --> 00:15:17.449]  And women were complaining to the black Americans, hey, can you protect us?
[00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.150]  These guys are here doing this.
[00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.593]  So they don't tell Europeans and others from other cities that they're going into a no-go zone.
[00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:27.038]  They don't tell you you're going to an area where you're going to be attacked.
[00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:30.782]  They tried to attack Paul Watson, Joe Biggs, and the rest of my crew.
[00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:33.726]  And they had to get out of there.
[00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:35.588]  They wisely, too, got out of there.
[00:15:35.588 --> 00:15:37.129]  But this is what happens.
[00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:38.251]  We're going to go into all that.
[00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:38.971]  There's so much.
[00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:42.996]  They're demonizing the 4th of July parade.
[00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:43.677]  All of it.
[00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:44.498]  But just imagine.
[00:15:45.635 --> 00:15:54.450]  How dumb these Islamists were, because they're so used to everyone kissing their ass, they're so used to everyone folding, that now they're going to start a fight with a bunch of big black Americans.
[00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.752]  It did not end well.
[00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:56.714]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:00.722]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.722 --> 00:16:04.643]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.643 --> 00:16:06.183]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.183 --> 00:16:09.144]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.144 --> 00:16:14.685]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:15.905]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:15.905 --> 00:16:18.825]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:55.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.520]  Because of the

[00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:01.654]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:01.654 --> 00:18:02.434]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.434 --> 00:18:03.014]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:03.014 --> 00:18:03.535]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:03.535 --> 00:18:06.356]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:06.356 --> 00:18:12.480]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:21.205]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[00:18:21.205 --> 00:18:22.225]  That's it.
[00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:25.087]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:27.948]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:29.229]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:30.149]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:35.592]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:35.592 --> 00:18:38.374]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:38.374 --> 00:18:40.435]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:40.435 --> 00:18:49.679]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:51.600]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.083]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:58.083 --> 00:18:59.024]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:19:01.198 --> 00:19:02.259]  The time has come.
[00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:03.219]  The time is here.
[00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:15.247]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[00:19:15.247 --> 00:19:22.411]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status.
[00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:23.432]  And the U.N.
[00:19:23.432 --> 00:19:27.657]  and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the U.S.
[00:19:27.657 --> 00:19:35.025]  to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism, so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[00:19:35.025 --> 00:19:36.006]  This is a plan.
[00:19:36.006 --> 00:19:37.167]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[00:19:37.167 --> 00:19:39.670]  It's why you've got to keep fighting, because we're going to win this in the end.
[00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.953]  Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible.
[00:19:42.953 --> 00:19:48.998]  So I salute you, and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us, and we will continue on the face of this.
[00:19:48.998 --> 00:20:02.790]  Infowarestore.com, 50% off, store-on-free shipping, double patriot points, whatever you do, commit now to history, and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.193 --> 00:20:27.857]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:27.857 --> 00:20:36.062]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:36.062 --> 00:20:43.886]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on the July 3rd, 2019 worldwide transmission.
[00:20:43.886 --> 00:20:48.990]  Here's just a few clips of the media calling for all conservatives, libertarians, myself,
[00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:50.402]  We're good to go.
[00:21:13.456 --> 00:21:16.457]  is coming in, and they're testing and seeing what we'll put up with.
[00:21:16.457 --> 00:21:26.620]  Now Democrats are calling for arresting anyone that criticizes them online, members of Congress, and they say that they will work with Google and others to arrest you.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.641]  That's coming up in a moment.
[00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:28.701]  Why not?
[00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:30.322]  We've put up with this so far.
[00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:32.162]  Or they'll send antifa to your house.
[00:21:32.162 --> 00:21:36.444]  Or AOC will lie about you and say you raped her.
[00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:39.905]  By the way, the Border Patrol, as I told you, I talked to Border Patrol folks yesterday.
[00:21:39.905 --> 00:21:41.465]  They're getting ready to release the footage.
[00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:42.526]  They're trying to get permission.
[00:21:43.983 --> 00:21:48.284]  From Trump and from the head of the Border Patrol to release the footage.
[00:21:48.284 --> 00:21:52.526]  There's a lot of legal issues Dealing with it, but she's a public figure.
[00:21:52.526 --> 00:22:07.951]  She's lied about them and the word is they're going to release her throwing fits Screaming and yelling at everyone and lying her ass off about people drinking out of toilets And how she felt sexually threatened when they were kissing her butt They were they were trying to take selfies.
[00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:09.371]  They were trying to shake her hand.
[00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.332]  They had the charm flowing
[00:22:12.483 --> 00:22:15.365]  You really think they'll go, get out of here, whore?
[00:22:15.365 --> 00:22:16.646]  Yeah, she said she was called a whore.
[00:22:16.646 --> 00:22:18.106]  Hey, whore, get out of here!
[00:22:18.106 --> 00:22:20.528]  They'd be fired in one second!
[00:22:20.528 --> 00:22:22.449]  Who believes any of this?
[00:22:22.449 --> 00:22:25.631]  Who believes I sent child porn to the Sandy Hook parents?
[00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:28.693]  Or that I wrote a book about Sandy Hook and lost a lawsuit?
[00:22:28.693 --> 00:22:29.713]  None of it's true!
[00:22:29.713 --> 00:22:35.117]  But I'm telling you, man, these people will do anything.
[00:22:35.117 --> 00:22:39.980]  We can't even, in what, 10 states, in the 9th District,
[00:22:40.956 --> 00:22:47.300]  Has ruled that you can't wear the American flag at public schools or areas because it's a hate symbol.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:55.165]  So of course, Nike is removing it saying it's bad, the American flag.
[00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:56.646]  They are an anti-American group.
[00:22:56.646 --> 00:22:58.007]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[00:22:58.007 --> 00:23:00.749]  Here is that little compilation.
[00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:01.530]  We're going to play the new clip.
[00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:01.830]  Here it is.
[00:23:02.683 --> 00:23:05.565]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[00:23:05.565 --> 00:23:07.827]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:23:07.827 --> 00:23:09.848]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:14.912]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:23:14.912 --> 00:23:23.678]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:23:23.678 --> 00:23:28.662]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:23:28.962 --> 00:23:32.865]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:41.691]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:23:41.691 --> 00:23:43.252]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:23:43.252 --> 00:23:44.333]  I want them shut down.
[00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:45.293]  I want them silenced.
[00:23:45.293 --> 00:23:46.134]  I want them muted.
[00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:49.276]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:23:49.276 --> 00:23:50.677]  I want them shut down!
[00:23:50.677 --> 00:23:52.258]  I want them silenced!
[00:23:52.258 --> 00:23:53.479]  I want them muted!
[00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:54.740]  But don't worry.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.441]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:23:59.212 --> 00:23:59.692]  Don't worry.
[00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:04.937]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:24:04.937 --> 00:24:06.958]  And the next is arrest you.
[00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:09.861]  Antivirus can throw chemical weapons on people, acid attacks.
[00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:14.124]  They can hit you in the head with crowbars and foils.
[00:24:14.124 --> 00:24:16.066]  That's a thin sword.
[00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:16.866]  That's what they had out there.
[00:24:16.866 --> 00:24:17.487]  They had foils.
[00:24:17.487 --> 00:24:19.028]  We've watched the video.
[00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:20.429]  Kill somebody with that very easily.
[00:24:20.429 --> 00:24:21.510]  Gets behind the carotid artery.
[00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.452]  Bye-bye.
[00:24:23.452 --> 00:24:24.212]  They'd have hit him in the neck.
[00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:25.874]  It'd have been murder one.
[00:24:26.817 --> 00:24:28.839]  You organized it, you came, you went.
[00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:30.381]  Murder one.
[00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:32.262]  Shouldn't even be giving these meth heads ideas.
[00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:36.887]  But that's how you deal a kill spider with a foil, is... Karate!
[00:24:36.887 --> 00:24:38.949]  But you don't know how to use a weapon, do you, dumbass?
[00:24:38.949 --> 00:24:40.270]  So you hit him in the head.
[00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.352]  You just hit him in the head over and over again.
[00:24:42.352 --> 00:24:46.256]  That's the tough part of the body, punk.
[00:24:46.256 --> 00:24:46.376]  And...
[00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:48.953]  They're trying to murder him, though.
[00:24:48.953 --> 00:24:49.673]  Those deadly weapons.
[00:24:49.673 --> 00:24:54.396]  But the Portland mayor, the police have confirmed, and they're going to release his order.
[00:24:54.396 --> 00:24:54.816]  That's right.
[00:24:54.816 --> 00:24:55.556]  They're preparing.
[00:24:55.556 --> 00:25:00.619]  They've told the mayor, you better tell the truth and stop lying about the stand-in order or we're going to release your order.
[00:25:00.619 --> 00:25:02.340]  And they're going to release it.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.821]  All of it's going to start coming out.
[00:25:03.821 --> 00:25:05.622]  Antifa's being infiltrated everywhere.
[00:25:05.622 --> 00:25:08.744]  Criminal slime funded by Alexander Soros.
[00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:12.366]  He's now in command of an organized crime syndicate.
[00:25:12.366 --> 00:25:16.088]  He's involved in the organized crime syndicate with the migrant flows and the migrant centers.
[00:25:17.858 --> 00:25:25.700]  And they've unleashed government employees in black masks to use weapons that are designed to kill people.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.280]  Foils!
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.200]  They were calling it a crowbar.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.500]  No, it was not foils.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.201]  I mean, it was not crowbars.
[00:25:31.201 --> 00:25:32.381]  It was foils.
[00:25:32.381 --> 00:25:35.602]  A thin sword.
[00:25:35.602 --> 00:25:37.102]  A super deadly weapon.
[00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:39.623]  You know what the Three Musketeers use?
[00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:40.243]  That's what they got.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.023]  Designed to go in between cracks in armor.
[00:25:45.023 --> 00:25:50.007]  Designed to stab people in the neck, and in the stomach, and in the heart.
[00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:53.650]  And that's what they got out there, is swords.
[00:25:53.650 --> 00:26:01.457]  So, Dem Rep wants to prosecute people who mock Congress.
[00:26:01.457 --> 00:26:04.660]  Frederica Wilson, Democrat, Florida, here she is, in a public speech.
[00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:15.276]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[00:26:15.276 --> 00:26:20.462]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[00:26:20.462 --> 00:26:26.670]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:30.553]  We're going to shut them down when they make fun of Congress.
[00:26:30.553 --> 00:26:32.236]  We're going to get them arrested.
[00:26:32.236 --> 00:26:34.520]  We're going to work with big tech.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.241]  We're going to go to break.
[00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:37.505]  Joe Biggs got taken off.
[00:26:37.505 --> 00:26:38.727]  Twitter got permanently banned.
[00:26:40.563 --> 00:26:47.607]  Saying that Antifa are a bunch of criminals, that he was going to go to Portland and exercise his First Amendment, and if they attacked him, he'd defend himself.
[00:26:47.607 --> 00:26:48.827]  That's the cardinal sin.
[00:26:48.827 --> 00:26:54.630]  You don't ever fight back against meth-head city employees with acid attacks.
[00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.932]  You don't stand against them and defend yourself.
[00:26:56.932 --> 00:26:59.673]  When they come with a sword, you show your neck.
[00:26:59.673 --> 00:27:02.574]  When they come to dump acid in your eyes, you open them up for them.
[00:27:02.574 --> 00:27:03.375]  Like Clockwork Orange.
[00:27:04.497 --> 00:27:09.864]  So the thought criminal, Joe Biggs, former InfoWars reporter, will be joining us on the other side.
[00:27:09.864 --> 00:27:18.255]  Please remember that we have the same InfoWars 4th of July special that's going to have to end Friday or this weekend because we're getting ready to sell out of X2.
[00:27:18.255 --> 00:27:22.641]  Even though it will probably sell out for a month or more before we get more in, I'm going to keep selling it.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.623]  Get 50% off because I want you to see how great it is and what happens within a few weeks of taking it.
[00:27:28.623 --> 00:27:32.446]  Now, talk to a physician or others before you take this because this isn't a joke, okay?
[00:27:32.446 --> 00:27:34.027]  Pure Iodine.
[00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:34.848]  No one else has it.
[00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:36.289]  No one else sells it.
[00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:37.390]  This is true atomic.
[00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.031]  No one else has real atomic Iodine.
[00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:40.792]  They're full of baloney.
[00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.273]  This is real.
[00:27:42.273 --> 00:27:45.536]  Don't buy the stuff at the store for cuts or whatever to leave a hole in your stomach.
[00:27:45.536 --> 00:27:47.057]  This is the real stuff.
[00:27:47.057 --> 00:27:48.118]  This is pure Iodine.
[00:27:48.118 --> 00:27:50.119]  It's not bound with toxins or anything.
[00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:51.540]  It's pure.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.521]  From deep earth crystals.
[00:27:54.187 --> 00:28:06.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, the whole body operates off of it and people will die without fluoride and IQs are plunging, birth defects, all this stuff's exploding because the body starts unraveling without iodine.
[00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:11.026]  And most of the stuff is not in the plants anymore, it's not in the fields, it's not in the soils.
[00:28:11.026 --> 00:28:15.330]  You can only get it from the ocean and it's so damn polluted you get a bunch of other bad stuff when you're getting it.
[00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:19.453]  That's what the Japanese do live so long is they're mainly seafood folks and other folks that eat seafood.
[00:28:19.453 --> 00:28:21.955]  But even their life expectancy is starting to go down.
[00:28:21.955 --> 00:28:24.877]  Down because of all the toxins in the ocean.
[00:28:24.877 --> 00:28:29.000]  And the chemical bioaccumulation that takes place in fish.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.602]  And in aquatic marine life.
[00:28:33.163 --> 00:28:39.006]  So, everything's 50% off in the supplements, store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, and a bunch of other big specials.
[00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:41.748]  Too many to name, too numerous.
[00:28:41.748 --> 00:28:44.109]  Everybody's free bumper stickers in each order.
[00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:46.671]  Save info wars, get great products at the same time.
[00:28:46.671 --> 00:28:47.571]  Please take action.
[00:28:47.571 --> 00:28:50.033]  It's a revolutionary idea to fund independent media.
[00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:56.917]  So on the 4th of July, on the eve of it, celebrate the info war with purchases and sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:28:56.917 --> 00:28:58.778]  We will be back with Thought Criminal Joe Biggs.
[00:28:59.658 --> 00:29:01.620]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.945]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:08.526]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.526 --> 00:29:16.874]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.874 --> 00:29:22.579]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.739 --> 00:29:24.560]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.840]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.222]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.222 --> 00:29:33.422]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:33.422 --> 00:29:41.265]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:29:41.325 --> 00:29:43.908]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[00:29:43.908 --> 00:29:44.589]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:29:44.589 --> 00:29:45.951]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.893]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[00:29:47.893 --> 00:29:48.714]  Or HBextract.com.
[00:30:01.873 --> 00:30:05.976]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30:05.976 --> 00:30:09.137]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[00:30:09.137 --> 00:30:12.299]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:24.506]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[00:30:24.506 --> 00:30:29.589]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[00:30:29.589 --> 00:30:30.890]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:31.250]  Thank you.
[00:31:01.263 --> 00:31:02.324]  The time has come.
[00:31:02.324 --> 00:31:03.304]  The time is here.
[00:31:03.304 --> 00:31:15.332]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[00:31:15.332 --> 00:31:26.920]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.160]  I think?
[00:31:49.068 --> 00:31:53.593]  InfoWareStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[00:31:53.593 --> 00:32:00.180]  Whatever you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[00:32:00.942 --> 00:32:02.803]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[00:32:02.803 --> 00:32:04.083]  This is the maximum alert.
[00:32:04.083 --> 00:32:05.224]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[00:32:05.224 --> 00:32:06.624]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.265]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:12.766]  We need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:14.807]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:15.327]  There's a P.O.
[00:32:15.327 --> 00:32:16.588]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[00:32:16.588 --> 00:32:18.388]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[00:32:18.388 --> 00:32:19.849]  We need money to fight back.
[00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:22.671]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[00:32:22.671 --> 00:32:25.573]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.
[00:32:25.573 --> 00:32:26.974]  We have a huge sale going.

[00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:38.622]  RainForce Plus.
[00:32:38.622 --> 00:32:39.423]  TurboForce.
[00:32:39.423 --> 00:32:40.844]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:42.365]  So many more!
[00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:44.085]  Stock up on the toothpaste, the coffee.
[00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:46.586]  Sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off.

[00:32:48.347 --> 00:32:51.788]  Instead of 5% off on future orders, you get 10% off.
[00:32:51.788 --> 00:32:53.929]  Again, cancel AutoShip anytime for free.
[00:32:53.929 --> 00:32:54.949]  We need the funding.
[00:32:54.949 --> 00:32:55.990]  Thank you for your support.
[00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.991]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[00:32:58.991 --> 00:33:03.873]  We're not gonna back down.
[00:33:03.873 --> 00:33:06.514]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.512 --> 00:33:33.995]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.995 --> 00:33:36.256]  No one can rival Western architecture.
[00:33:36.256 --> 00:33:39.096]  No one can rival Western technology.
[00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:41.317]  No one can rival American freedom.
[00:33:41.317 --> 00:33:45.658]  But now, the Democratic Party is all over the news, demonizing the July 4th event.
[00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:52.064]  Demonizing the American flag, agreeing with Nike that the American flag is an evil symbol.
[00:33:52.064 --> 00:33:55.767]  The Ninth Circuit's ruled it's a hate symbol.
[00:33:55.767 --> 00:34:07.594]  These are the enemies within, and we have major representatives like Wilson of Florida coming out and saying, arrest people that make fun of members of Congress and censor the internet more.
[00:34:07.594 --> 00:34:09.896]  It's amazing.
[00:34:09.896 --> 00:34:14.099]  Also, we have new breaking news that I'll cover after Joe Biggs leaves us, that is, the next level.
[00:34:15.509 --> 00:34:21.832]  Photo shows kids laying on top of drag queens at drag queen story time.
[00:34:21.832 --> 00:34:23.452]  They shake their butts and their faces.
[00:34:23.452 --> 00:34:25.113]  They tell little girls they're really boys.
[00:34:25.113 --> 00:34:27.474]  Little boys are really girls.
[00:34:27.474 --> 00:34:29.655]  This is pedophilic training.
[00:34:29.655 --> 00:34:35.838]  Now they're even admitting in the media it's pedophilic training and they're celebrating it, saying sex with kids is good.
[00:34:35.838 --> 00:34:42.661]  Men dress as clowns many times because they're convicted sex offenders and they have to cover up their identity.
[00:34:43.677 --> 00:34:49.199]  We're going to be getting into all of that and the latest on Antifa that has been infiltrated.
[00:34:50.194 --> 00:34:50.995]  In D.C.
[00:34:50.995 --> 00:34:53.456]  and that shock footage will be playing next segment.
[00:34:53.456 --> 00:34:56.018]  Joe Biggs joins us from the streets of D.C.
[00:34:56.018 --> 00:34:58.139]  He just got off a plane from Florida.
[00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:03.563]  He's scheduled to be speaking at free speech events that Antifa has pledged to physically target.
[00:35:03.563 --> 00:35:13.230]  The Antifa groups have pledged to use acid attacks on folks at these events and at Trump's Fourth of July events coming up tomorrow and then on Friday and Saturday.
[00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.212]  They are allowed to mix the weapons in front of police, D.C.
[00:35:16.212 --> 00:35:18.033]  police to a great extent are still under Democrat control.
[00:35:19.114 --> 00:35:25.159]  And major Democrats and the DC representative is saying that they see Trump's event as terroristic.
[00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:27.200]  I have those articles and video clips coming up.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:33.726]  So they say that all of this is white supremism and that anyone with American flags will be attacked.
[00:35:33.726 --> 00:35:36.228]  So this is 4th of July, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:36.228 --> 00:35:42.353]  This is what America has turned to and what the Democrats are pushing and that was Nike's calculation.
[00:35:43.624 --> 00:35:53.650]  Is that, hey, we've made 33, 32, 34 percent each quarter after Kaepernick and his America-hating system became a spokesperson for Nike.
[00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:58.894]  SJWs go buy the overpriced Slave Factory-made shoes because it's a celebration of hating America.
[00:35:59.494 --> 00:36:01.715]  So Nike waited to the 4th of July.
[00:36:01.715 --> 00:36:02.556]  They waited.
[00:36:02.556 --> 00:36:05.117]  They shipped out the shoes to have a big stunt.
[00:36:05.117 --> 00:36:06.257]  They're great looking shoes by the way.
[00:36:06.257 --> 00:36:09.459]  I would get a pair because they're so triggering to leftists.
[00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.240]  Plus they look nice.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.461]  And they are not allowing them to be sold.
[00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:15.922]  So they could piss on America on July 4th.
[00:36:15.922 --> 00:36:21.625]  This is a wiping July 4th on their huge, stinking, Seattle-based rear end.
[00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:22.905]  So that's the echo chamber.
[00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:23.766]  And now Joe Biggs
[00:36:24.646 --> 00:36:35.409]  Simply tweeted, I remember seeing the tweets and saying to Darren McBrain, I bet he gets banned for that because thou shalt not criticize the Lord thy God Antifa and thou shalt not speak badly of them.
[00:36:35.409 --> 00:36:41.110]  He just said I'm going out there to cover this and have a rally and if anybody attacks me I'm gonna fight back.
[00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:49.152]  Well, defense is the number one crime when a meth-head leftist who's been allowed off work from the city by the mayor comes out to attack.
[00:36:49.152 --> 00:36:51.232]  So Joe, you've been banned on Twitter.
[00:36:51.232 --> 00:36:53.113]  Thanks for joining us and tell us the latest.
[00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.991]  Yeah, it was pretty funny, you know.
[00:36:55.991 --> 00:36:58.611]  I woke up yesterday and one of my buddies contacted me.
[00:36:58.611 --> 00:37:03.253]  He goes, dude, the blue checkmark thing you have on your Twitter account is gone.
[00:37:03.253 --> 00:37:07.395]  And I opened up my app, I was going to the gym and I go, oh yeah, huh, oh well.
[00:37:07.395 --> 00:37:10.916]  And then someone wrote me and they go, that's what happened to Laura Loomer right before she got banned.
[00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:14.718]  They took her blue checkmark away and then it said account suspended.
[00:37:14.718 --> 00:37:19.159]  And sure enough, I got on the DM to start talking to Michelle Malkin.
[00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:21.000]  I was like, hey, did you see that they took the badge away?
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:27.743]  She goes, yeah, do you think it's because of your coverage of Antifa over the last week since Andy Ngo was attacked in Portland?
[00:37:27.743 --> 00:37:31.664]  And I said, it has to be, because that's the only thing that's really changed of what I've been talking about on Twitter.
[00:37:31.664 --> 00:37:37.007]  And right in the middle of Michelle and I's conversation on direct message, they zapped my account.
[00:37:37.007 --> 00:37:41.628]  And I had to go through Laura and other people to get back in touch with Michelle.
[00:37:41.628 --> 00:37:47.391]  And I heard that Michelle was tweeting out looking to get ahold of me, because she's doing a whole thing on this Antifa.
[00:37:48.091 --> 00:38:01.701]  And it's just amazing, you know, you've got this guy, he's 90 pounds, this little gay Asian guy, and you have supposedly Antifa who's pro-LGBT and all this, and they're out there watching in mass numbers as this guy is being kicked and beaten on the ground.
[00:38:01.701 --> 00:38:04.203]  You know, beaten so bad that his brain is bleeding.
[00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:10.765]  I mean, not just lightly beating him up or roughing him up, to a point where he could have permanent damage for the rest of his life.
[00:38:10.765 --> 00:38:12.706]  And this is a problem that we have to deal with.
[00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:14.627]  So that's why I got really frustrated.
[00:38:14.627 --> 00:38:20.309]  And over the last few days, I've been able to organize damn near a thousand people or more that are going to be coming out to Portland.
[00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:25.894]  I've got groups from all over the country that have never even rallied together or marched together.
[00:38:25.894 --> 00:38:30.138]  We're all going to come together and stand, you know, against Antifa.
[00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:30.998]  Because you know what?
[00:38:30.998 --> 00:38:33.781]  We can't have these hooligans running around acting like they run the streets.
[00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:34.722]  We're a nation of law.
[00:38:34.722 --> 00:38:35.382]  This is America.
[00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:36.223]  We're not going to be run by
[00:38:36.343 --> 00:38:36.643]  That's right.
[00:38:36.643 --> 00:38:40.229]  And when the police stand down and there's no law and order, it's up to the people.
[00:38:40.229 --> 00:38:44.275]  It's our right and duty to protect ourselves, whether we see it in our own town or across the country.
[00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:48.741]  It's not vigilantism when you see a crime being committed and the police are standing down.
[00:38:48.741 --> 00:38:49.843]  It's a citizen's arrest.
[00:38:49.843 --> 00:38:50.825]  And when you watch
[00:38:51.966 --> 00:38:52.086]  Mr. No.
[00:39:14.238 --> 00:39:16.240]  And then the left celebrated this.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.542]  I mean, these people are just the scum of the earth.
[00:39:18.542 --> 00:39:22.606]  And the others that tried to help him, they beat them in the head with foils.
[00:39:22.606 --> 00:39:24.327]  And again, people don't know what a foil is.
[00:39:24.327 --> 00:39:32.395]  It's a long piece of metal, basically a primitive sword, that can be swung at high speed to split open skin and bone.
[00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:36.238]  You can kill somebody in about two seconds with one hitting the carotid arteries.
[00:39:36.238 --> 00:39:44.706]  Luckily, they hit him on top of the head with this and almost killed folks, but it didn't go to the neck because that's how you kill somebody real fast, Joe, as you know.
[00:39:45.814 --> 00:39:52.696]  Yeah, yeah, I got the exclusive ER pictures of that happening when his head was smashed in and they had to do all the staples.
[00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:59.438]  I mean, luckily, when you look at those injuries, this guy is lucky his actual cranium did not break and he doesn't have permanent brain damage.
[00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:02.159]  I mean, he had some massive wounds to his head.
[00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:04.899]  I mean, I haven't seen something that bad in a while.
[00:40:04.899 --> 00:40:07.240]  But that spread like wildfire and it really sparked
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:19.370]  Uh, you know, a fire under everyone's asses because now you see this one guy being attacked and now we find out about more and we see how vicious these attacks are that are going to leave permanent damage on some of these individuals.
[00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.131]  That's why, you know, we've got to do something.
[00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:22.572]  We can't sit by anymore.
[00:40:22.572 --> 00:40:29.198]  We can't let a lawless mayor and the guy they have there in Portland, we can't sit by while the cops allow this to happen.
[00:40:29.198 --> 00:40:29.818]  This is their job.
[00:40:29.818 --> 00:40:31.039]  This is what they're elected for.
[00:40:31.039 --> 00:40:34.622]  These are the oaths they took and they're refusing to do anything about it.
[00:40:34.622 --> 00:40:36.144]  So we have to go out there and do something about it.
[00:40:38.342 --> 00:40:41.243]  Let's be exactly clear about what you said and what you did.
[00:40:41.243 --> 00:40:42.884]  Antifa is meeting in meetings.
[00:40:42.884 --> 00:40:44.965]  They're publicly saying we're going to acid attack people.
[00:40:44.965 --> 00:40:46.365]  They're now doing it.
[00:40:46.365 --> 00:40:48.846]  I've seen them attack families trying to get into Trump's inauguration.
[00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:52.648]  The police did nothing again in these blue sewer cities.
[00:40:52.648 --> 00:40:53.889]  And I saw some of what you said.
[00:40:53.889 --> 00:40:56.850]  I mean, repeat to folks what you said that got you banned.
[00:40:59.011 --> 00:41:05.459]  Oh, well first, the first thing I did is I reached out to Mr. No and I said, hey, if you're ever going to go on the streets again, we're going to have your back.
[00:41:05.459 --> 00:41:13.008]  I'm going to have guys with you that will sit there and watch you to make sure you never ever get attacked again because your job as a journalist, you shouldn't have to worry about something like that.
[00:41:13.008 --> 00:41:14.430]  And that's how it started.
[00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.771]  And then...
[00:41:16.317 --> 00:41:20.419]  You know, you started getting kind of heated up because now you started finding out more people got injured.
[00:41:20.419 --> 00:41:22.220]  You know, so eventually I said, you know what?
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.660]  I'm not going to let this happen.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.881]  I'm going to come after you guys.
[00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:28.682]  I'm going to sit here and we're going to stand toe-to-toe and I'm going to bring more than you guys.
[00:41:28.682 --> 00:41:32.604]  And you're either going to stand there with us or you're going to back down and run away like the cowards you are.
[00:41:32.604 --> 00:41:37.606]  Because you only notice, they only go to these areas where there's only a couple of people where they know they can outnumber them.
[00:41:37.606 --> 00:41:39.667]  Like you said earlier, you compared them to piranhas.
[00:41:39.987 --> 00:41:41.768]  These guys aren't going to do anything by themselves.
[00:41:41.768 --> 00:41:43.329]  They have to be in those large groups.
[00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:46.371]  And my goal is to bring a group larger than theirs.
[00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:47.973]  We'll see if they actually want to do anything.
[00:41:47.973 --> 00:41:51.815]  And I guarantee when we show up in Portland, the police will all of a sudden want to do their job.
[00:41:51.815 --> 00:41:54.077]  They'll all of a sudden want to enforce the law.
[00:41:54.077 --> 00:41:57.459]  And I'm sure they'll be the ones hassling us and not Antifa.
[00:42:00.976 --> 00:42:11.302]  I hope you've been invited to the conference that Trump's holding on the 11th because your case is perfect where you just said, hey, you beat up a bunch of journalists and hurt a bunch of people.
[00:42:11.302 --> 00:42:12.982]  We're going to come out.
[00:42:12.982 --> 00:42:15.604]  We're going to defend folks defensively.
[00:42:15.604 --> 00:42:25.249]  And then you got banned for that while Antifa still, the Portland Antifa that called for all this and called for dumping stuff on people's faces, ACID, they are still all operating.
[00:42:26.482 --> 00:42:31.507]  Yeah, they're actively planning attacks and they're actively committing terrorist attacks.
[00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:33.610]  They're actually committing acts of violence.
[00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.232]  They're verbally abusing people.
[00:42:35.232 --> 00:42:36.393]  They're doxing people.
[00:42:36.393 --> 00:42:38.335]  They're getting people fired from their jobs.
[00:42:38.335 --> 00:42:41.598]  I merely told a lot of people, hey, it's getting rough out there.
[00:42:41.598 --> 00:42:43.280]  If you don't have a gun, you better buy one.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.141]  You better have ammo.
[00:42:44.141 --> 00:42:45.483]  You better learn to train with it.
[00:42:45.483 --> 00:42:46.884]  You better learn respect for that weapon.
[00:42:46.884 --> 00:42:47.605]  You better learn
[00:42:49.247 --> 00:42:50.248]  How to take care of yourself.
[00:42:50.248 --> 00:42:50.909]  How to fight.
[00:42:50.909 --> 00:42:51.611]  Go stay there.
[00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:52.412]  Let's talk about that.
[00:42:52.412 --> 00:42:54.735]  That's what I said when Antifa said they're coming to our houses to kill us.
[00:42:54.735 --> 00:42:56.879]  I said, buddy, better get guns and protect yourselves.
[00:42:59.716 --> 00:43:15.629]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:43:15.629 --> 00:43:17.350]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:28.239]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:28.960]  We're good to go.
[00:43:48.237 --> 00:43:48.918]  I don't know.
[00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:02.214]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[00:44:02.214 --> 00:44:10.102]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[00:44:10.102 --> 00:44:13.766]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[00:44:13.766 --> 00:44:14.687]  We need to end here.
[00:44:14.687 --> 00:44:16.029]  We need to be provisioned.
[00:44:16.029 --> 00:44:20.213]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[00:44:20.593 --> 00:44:24.458]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[00:44:24.458 --> 00:44:26.380]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.924]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[00:44:29.924 --> 00:44:31.365]  That just brings more people here.
[00:44:31.365 --> 00:44:34.669]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[00:44:34.669 --> 00:44:35.510]  I need gas.
[00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.032]  I need ammo politically now.
[00:44:37.412 --> 00:44:44.834]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[00:44:44.834 --> 00:44:46.255]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[00:44:46.255 --> 00:44:53.277]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[00:44:53.277 --> 00:44:54.257]  You have my commitment.
[00:44:54.257 --> 00:44:58.599]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:02.402]  There is no longer any doubt.
[00:45:02.402 --> 00:45:08.264]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[00:45:08.264 --> 00:45:10.345]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[00:45:10.345 --> 00:45:11.925]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[00:45:11.925 --> 00:45:13.066]  World government is here.
[00:45:13.066 --> 00:45:14.386]  Now is the time for decision.
[00:45:14.386 --> 00:45:17.427]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[00:45:17.427 --> 00:45:27.691]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag, and attacking the family, and that are attacking our borders, and our country, and our military, and our heritage, if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:29.692]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[00:45:29.932 --> 00:45:32.753]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:32.753 --> 00:45:34.613]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[00:45:34.613 --> 00:45:35.694]  And praying for President Trump.
[00:45:35.694 --> 00:45:36.614]  And praying for yourself.
[00:45:36.614 --> 00:45:37.674]  And praying for peace.
[00:45:37.674 --> 00:45:38.815]  Praying for justice.
[00:45:38.815 --> 00:45:41.155]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.
[00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:42.936]  Because we're running out of a lot of the best-selling items.
[00:45:42.936 --> 00:45:45.057]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[00:45:45.057 --> 00:45:46.737]  Store-wide free shipping.

[00:45:50.498 --> 00:45:50.898]  It's free.

[00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.560]  You cannot beat these deals.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.401]  The best we ever offer at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:01.544 --> 00:46:05.968]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[00:46:05.968 --> 00:46:13.615]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Awards 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[00:46:13.615 --> 00:46:16.478]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[00:46:16.678 --> 00:46:17.539]  We're good.
[00:46:36.298 --> 00:46:37.259]  I like to be expanding.
[00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:38.020]  I like to be winning.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:38.740]  I like to be fighting.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:39.921]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[00:46:39.921 --> 00:46:40.802]  That's why we're so hated.
[00:46:40.802 --> 00:46:42.423]  But we need to be retreaded.
[00:46:42.423 --> 00:46:43.644]  We need to be tuned up.
[00:46:43.644 --> 00:46:44.705]  We need to be fixed up.
[00:46:44.705 --> 00:46:46.026]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:47.567]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[00:46:47.567 --> 00:46:52.411]  And if the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:54.412]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:57.254]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[00:46:57.254 --> 00:46:58.695]  Funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[00:46:58.695 --> 00:47:00.337]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[00:47:03.261 --> 00:47:05.876]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:36.618 --> 00:47:39.681]  Don't take it lying down!
[00:47:39.681 --> 00:47:49.228]  We're not taking it lying down.
[00:47:49.228 --> 00:47:50.809]  Everything's gonna be alright.
[00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:55.874]  We're gonna defeat the globalists.
[00:47:55.874 --> 00:47:57.055]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:47:57.055 --> 00:48:02.219]  So Joe Biggs, who de facto is one of the leaders of the Proud Boys, founded by Gavin McInnes,
[00:48:03.815 --> 00:48:09.977]  Has been persecuted, attacked, and banned off Twitter for saying, we are going to go defend people's free speech against these bullies.
[00:48:09.977 --> 00:48:11.378]  If they attack us, we'll defend ourselves.
[00:48:11.378 --> 00:48:14.559]  And that is the cardinal sin.
[00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:19.120]  When the meth-head, uh, Antifa are trying to kill people to stand up against them.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:27.323]  And Joe, I've told everybody this, Matt Dredge told everybody this, everybody should create their own websites, while you're still on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere, and push people there, and do it.
[00:48:27.323 --> 00:48:29.424]  We have our own audio streaming, our own video streaming.
[00:48:31.346 --> 00:48:31.927]  I don't know.
[00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.051]  And to split off other motherships.
[00:48:54.051 --> 00:48:57.571]  Quite frankly, we've got projects doing that behind the scenes.
[00:48:57.571 --> 00:48:58.992]  They've got our phones all tapped.
[00:48:58.992 --> 00:49:00.472]  The enemy knows all that.
[00:49:00.472 --> 00:49:04.533]  They've still got people inside the FBI, inside the Justice Department, inside the CIA.
[00:49:04.533 --> 00:49:05.633]  Large numbers of them.
[00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:09.574]  In fact, a lot of antifa that's been proven are actually of national security clearances.
[00:49:09.574 --> 00:49:12.415]  We've got some hidden camera footage that they didn't know we have.
[00:49:12.415 --> 00:49:14.295]  We're going to be getting to next hour.
[00:49:14.295 --> 00:49:15.395]  We'll roll some of that in the background.
[00:49:15.395 --> 00:49:17.476]  But I'm sure you've now heard the representative
[00:49:19.008 --> 00:49:29.506]  Frederica Wilson, talk about a bozo the clown freak, she's come out and said that if people make fun of Congress, they're going to work with Big Tech to find out who you are and arrest you.
[00:49:29.506 --> 00:49:31.409]  So now she's saying arrest him for their speech.
[00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:31.769]  Here she is.
[00:49:33.831 --> 00:49:42.135]  People who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[00:49:42.135 --> 00:49:47.318]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:54.622]  We're gonna shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[00:49:54.622 --> 00:49:57.383]  Making fun of people need to be prosecuted.
[00:49:57.383 --> 00:50:01.646]  To quote Tucker Carlson, these people aren't scary at all.
[00:50:01.646 --> 00:50:02.106]  Joe Biggs.
[00:50:03.937 --> 00:50:05.978]  It's truly a clown world.
[00:50:05.978 --> 00:50:12.401]  You know, this is like... We can't even... You can't even be honest anymore.
[00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:16.003]  It's only gonna be a matter of time before honesty is completely and totally outlawed.
[00:50:16.003 --> 00:50:18.464]  I mean, what's wrong is right, what's right is wrong.
[00:50:18.464 --> 00:50:20.005]  The whole world's gonna be vice versa.
[00:50:20.005 --> 00:50:23.266]  It's just... It's insanity.
[00:50:23.266 --> 00:50:24.387]  What we're dealing with here...
[00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.350]  is a clown.
[00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:32.493]  I mean Boss Hogg's funny, she's funny, but she's said a lot of crazy stuff before and she doesn't like it.
[00:50:32.493 --> 00:50:33.274]  So I'm going to say this.
[00:50:33.274 --> 00:50:36.916]  We're going to have a contest making fun of her.
[00:50:36.916 --> 00:50:40.498]  I'm going to pay out the other $5,000 contest next week.
[00:50:40.498 --> 00:50:48.703]  We're going to have a contest for the best video or image meme of Representative Frederica Wilson.
[00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.173]  And that will be $5,000.
[00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:54.394]  And we're going to have another one for AOC.
[00:50:54.394 --> 00:50:55.955]  That one will be $10,000.
[00:50:55.955 --> 00:51:03.697]  So we're going to see how they can be made fun of, how they can be made to look ridiculous with their own statements.
[00:51:03.697 --> 00:51:11.139]  And so that's $15,000 of prizes for the next contest, the GetInfoWorksOut contest.
[00:51:11.139 --> 00:51:12.039]  That has now ended.
[00:51:12.039 --> 00:51:14.980]  I know who the winner is, but I'm going to announce that next week.
[00:51:16.092 --> 00:51:18.354]  Joe, you're there in D.C.
[00:51:18.354 --> 00:51:22.798]  for the amazing parade that Trump's set to have.
[00:51:22.798 --> 00:51:26.001]  They're calling it fascist because it's going to have the military.
[00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:29.924]  We've had that at many other 4th of July events.
[00:51:29.924 --> 00:51:37.010]  The military's been so run down, the globalists have so demoralized it with 20 plus suicides a day, all the rest of it.
[00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:42.115]  As much as the country's been put down, I think it's good that Trump's trying to get us to have confidence and pride in our nation again.
[00:51:43.271 --> 00:51:44.012]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:44.012 --> 00:51:55.368]  I mean, this gives us an opportunity not only for people who might not get to see all this cool military gear, you know, but to see it, to see those soldiers and those Marines in uniform, it gives you a sense of pride.
[00:51:55.368 --> 00:51:58.793]  It gives you a sense of that patriotism that we lost for so long.
[00:51:59.133 --> 00:52:02.136]  You know, I think it's awesome to bring something like that in right now.
[00:52:02.136 --> 00:52:07.620]  Especially when everything you see is some soccer player taking a knee, someone bashing our country.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.422]  For once, we get an opportunity.
[00:52:09.422 --> 00:52:10.202]  A day.
[00:52:10.202 --> 00:52:12.164]  I mean, LGBT gets a whole day a month.
[00:52:12.164 --> 00:52:16.488]  We get one day to sit here and let us have our patriotic day.
[00:52:16.488 --> 00:52:19.530]  You know, stop trying to get rid of our shoes.
[00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:20.791]  Stop doing all this stuff.
[00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:21.712]  You've had your whole month.
[00:52:22.415 --> 00:52:23.536]  I want July 4th.
[00:52:23.536 --> 00:52:24.457]  I want to see tanks.
[00:52:24.457 --> 00:52:26.078]  I want to see cool flyovers.
[00:52:26.078 --> 00:52:27.479]  I want to see fireworks.
[00:52:27.479 --> 00:52:29.081]  I want to see red, white, and blue shirts.
[00:52:29.081 --> 00:52:30.982]  And by the way, they're saying this never happens.
[00:52:30.982 --> 00:52:40.510]  Every year in Austin, they have B-2 bombers or B-1 bombers do low passes over the city right before it gets dark and the fireworks.
[00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.071]  Well, guess what?
[00:52:41.071 --> 00:52:43.953]  Last few years they haven't done it because the leftists that run the city go,
[00:52:45.174 --> 00:52:48.695]  They identify our military as so evil, because it's American, that they hate it.
[00:52:48.695 --> 00:52:53.217]  Well, listen, Trump doesn't have our military going into all these countries right now.
[00:52:53.217 --> 00:52:54.578]  He's trying to do peace deals.
[00:52:54.578 --> 00:52:56.978]  He's trying to get us out of Afghanistan.
[00:52:56.978 --> 00:52:58.419]  They've announced the total withdrawal.
[00:52:58.419 --> 00:52:59.860]  He's gotten us out of Syria.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:11.344]  That is a time to celebrate the fact that we've gone out, mission complete, and we should have had a military parade, but the left promised to attack it, so Trump said, fine, we'll do it during the Fourth of July as part of something larger.
[00:53:11.724 --> 00:53:16.268]  And they're saying, we've never had flyovers, we've never had... That's a damn lie!
[00:53:16.268 --> 00:53:17.309]  That is a lie!
[00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:20.391]  They have flyovers every year in D.C.
[00:53:20.391 --> 00:53:21.813]  Where's the damn Redskins Stadium?
[00:53:21.813 --> 00:53:23.454]  Right down the road.
[00:53:23.454 --> 00:53:25.756]  Before every football game, there's a flyover.
[00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:30.702]  Before any sports game, there's a flyover if it's an outdoor arena.
[00:53:30.702 --> 00:53:33.624]  By the way, for folks who don't know, the best thing you can ever go to is an air show.
[00:53:33.624 --> 00:53:38.788]  My dad took me to four or five big ones when I was a kid, a lot of little ones, and I should do that for my children.
[00:53:38.788 --> 00:53:46.754]  But, I mean, Oshkosh air shows or, you know, the World War II air shows, all of them, I mean, they're just incredible.
[00:53:46.754 --> 00:53:51.978]  And there's nothing better than fireworks and an air show and the big monuments and celebrating our country.
[00:53:51.978 --> 00:53:53.659]  No, but the globalists want us to hate our country.
[00:53:55.669 --> 00:53:58.732]  Yeah, it's pathetic what they're trying to do to it right now, you know.
[00:53:58.732 --> 00:54:00.213]  Like I said, I want my one day.
[00:54:00.213 --> 00:54:01.514]  I want to see the red, white, and blue.
[00:54:01.514 --> 00:54:03.236]  I want to feel that sense of pride.
[00:54:03.236 --> 00:54:08.400]  I want to get the goosebumps when I hear those A-10s fly over and I hear that loud engine roar.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.462]  You know, that is what it's all about.
[00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:11.363]  To see that might.
[00:54:11.363 --> 00:54:12.924]  To see that power that we have.
[00:54:12.924 --> 00:54:20.150]  To know, hey, we're safe if something happens because we've got the best men and women out there operating this stuff and that's just truly awesome.
[00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:30.397]  If the government was trying to make us wear American flags and trying to use American flags to attack innocent countries, I would say, hey, it's becoming fascist, not the flag, the use of it.
[00:54:30.397 --> 00:54:43.805]  But when the Ninth Circuit's ruling it's a hate symbol, and they're trying to take it down, and they're putting shoes out as a stunt and pulling them back, all to piss on America and say it's bad and make us all have division, then it becomes more important
[00:54:44.045 --> 00:54:52.508]  than ever to fly American flags at our houses, and to wear American flags, and to put American flags on clothing, like this Space Force shirt I'm wearing.
[00:54:52.508 --> 00:54:58.930]  That's what it's all about, because America isn't perfect, but what they're trying to replace it with is a nightmare.
[00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:09.414]  Biggs, I think they've jumped the shark here, just because Nike has made 33% larger profits since they put Kaepernick up there, because SJWs went and bought their overpriced slave-made shoes.
[00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:13.922]  The NFL's down 40% because of all their America hate.
[00:55:13.922 --> 00:55:25.392]  I think they've Major League miscalculated, saying the American flag's racist, that Betsy Ross is bad, saying we shouldn't have a 4th of July parade, saying America was never great or will never be that great.
[00:55:25.392 --> 00:55:26.753]  I mean, they've really shown their colors.
[00:55:27.927 --> 00:55:31.911]  They're catering to a smaller group, you know, quite honestly.
[00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.473]  I mean, you look at these polls, they're all lies.
[00:55:34.473 --> 00:55:36.275]  You see all these polls on TV.
[00:55:36.275 --> 00:55:38.457]  Trump today would lose to Biden.
[00:55:38.457 --> 00:55:40.459]  Trump today would lose to Sanders.
[00:55:40.459 --> 00:55:51.469]  But then you go to like that rally in Orlando and you see that many people showing up days in advance, waiting in lines through the heat, through the humidity, through rainstorms.
[00:55:51.469 --> 00:55:52.730]  It really makes you question, like,
[00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:56.205]  They're barking up the wrong tree.
[00:55:56.205 --> 00:55:58.107]  The majority wants the patriotism.
[00:55:58.107 --> 00:56:01.290]  The majority want American nationalism.
[00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:04.753]  The majority of them want to be able to have a safe home and a safe environment.
[00:56:04.753 --> 00:56:05.974]  They want to be able to protect themselves.
[00:56:05.974 --> 00:56:06.975]  They want to be entrepreneurs.
[00:56:06.975 --> 00:56:08.777]  They want to be able to have a good life.
[00:56:08.777 --> 00:56:12.921]  They don't want what this left-leaning Democrat Party is going.
[00:56:12.921 --> 00:56:13.681]  It's hell.
[00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:14.102]  That's right.
[00:56:14.102 --> 00:56:16.804]  You know, Kaepernick made $50 million.
[00:56:18.544 --> 00:56:21.585]  Born in this country, adopted by white people, and he hates white people.
[00:56:21.585 --> 00:56:23.446]  He's a flaming racist.
[00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:26.587]  And he's, you know, he's got the big Afro out there, even though he's not really a black guy.
[00:56:26.587 --> 00:56:28.848]  Looks like he's about 90% white.
[00:56:28.848 --> 00:56:34.390]  And he just signed on to be a corporate shill with Chinese funding, we know, to divide and conquer.
[00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.951]  The Chinese government is funding most of this, folks.
[00:56:36.951 --> 00:56:37.531]  That's a fact.
[00:56:38.191 --> 00:56:40.453]  They're fighting the division, all of it.
[00:56:40.453 --> 00:56:46.158]  And I'm not saying execute people, but China executes people that sow this type of discord in their own country.
[00:56:46.158 --> 00:56:48.040]  And so that's what they're really doing.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.421]  Joe Biggs, how do people find you?
[00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:53.545]  I know you've got your merch site, and that's great, and people can go there.
[00:56:53.545 --> 00:56:56.667]  You're going to turn that into a news site soon.
[00:56:56.667 --> 00:56:58.409]  We should probably get you dialed in.
[00:56:58.409 --> 00:57:00.511]  We're setting up systems where people can dial in over their phones.
[00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:02.272]  And stream live through our systems.
[00:57:02.272 --> 00:57:05.095]  We're hiring more crew to be able to do that and get up on the site.
[00:57:05.095 --> 00:57:10.259]  So let's be talking more in the future about trying to help you with some re-platforming.
[00:57:10.259 --> 00:57:12.461]  But give people your website.
[00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:14.383]  It's ssgbigs.com.
[00:57:14.383 --> 00:57:16.244]  That's Staff Sergeant Biggs dot com.
[00:57:16.244 --> 00:57:17.485]  And then I have an Instagram.
[00:57:17.485 --> 00:57:19.727]  That's ssgbigs as well.
[00:57:19.727 --> 00:57:23.370]  And I'm there in those two places predominantly right now.
[00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:25.212]  Well be sure to get over on Telegram.
[00:57:26.552 --> 00:57:29.593]  I'm on that right now, and that's building up, and a lot of other things.
[00:57:29.593 --> 00:57:32.514]  Folks, find the Patriots and spread the links.
[00:57:32.514 --> 00:57:39.317]  Don't forget, 50% off, floor-wide, for the supplements, double Patriot points, and free shipping for the 4th of July Save Info Awards special.
[00:57:39.317 --> 00:57:45.899]  And get your Space Force Americas back, red, white, and blue American flag, InfoAwards.com, t-shirt, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:45.899 --> 00:57:46.680]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.080]  God bless.
[00:57:50.163 --> 00:58:06.831]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:14.254]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[00:58:14.614 --> 00:58:16.355]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:58:16.355 --> 00:58:20.597]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:28.540]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.262]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:58:31.262 --> 00:58:36.164]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:37.345]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:58:37.345 --> 00:58:38.165]  They have side effects.
[00:58:38.325 --> 00:58:42.927]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:58:42.927 --> 00:58:44.808]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:50.957 --> 00:58:55.100]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:05.487]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:59:05.487 --> 00:59:08.629]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale.
[00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:09.129]  Of course.
[00:59:24.938 --> 00:59:42.709]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:49.393]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:59:53.246 --> 01:00:12.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.190]  The year is 2019.
[01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:18.131]  It's the eve of all nations.
[01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:18.971]  First day, July 4th.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:39.303]  And the Democratic Party is openly controlled and run by a consortium of foreign corporations and governments, and are openly involved in giant re-education of the nation, demonization of the family, demonization of free market, demonization of Christians, demonization of the born and unborn.
[01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:45.344]  In fact, coming up next segment, we're going to get into the latest targeting of the children.
[01:00:45.344 --> 01:00:48.385]  I believe it's right there in the printer.
[01:00:48.385 --> 01:00:49.245]  Forgot to bring it in here.
[01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:55.142]  They are now openly killing babies and releasing the numbers on it after they're born.
[01:00:55.142 --> 01:01:01.704]  Now, this has been going on a while, but it's all admittedly happening.
[01:01:01.704 --> 01:01:07.965]  Minnesota admits to killing six babies last year who were totally fine after they were born.
[01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:15.687]  Now, the numbers are much higher than this, but what they're doing is testing everyone right now.
[01:01:15.687 --> 01:01:17.928]  So, that is coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:21.073]  Let me just mention what else is coming up.
[01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:24.475]  I've got to get to all of this.
[01:01:24.475 --> 01:01:25.555]  It's official.
[01:01:25.555 --> 01:01:32.639]  California Democrats pushed a bill allowing illegal aliens to run the Democratic Party.
[01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:36.261]  And major cities are letting illegal aliens vote and giving them driver's licenses.
[01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:38.262]  From New York to California.
[01:01:38.262 --> 01:01:40.963]  That's how Mexico takes over the U.S.
[01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:43.245]  That's really the globalists.
[01:01:43.245 --> 01:01:43.565]  Also,
[01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:48.760]  We're gonna get into the video I talked about.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:59.704]  Watch American rapper enter a no-go zone in Europe and be attacked by Muslims.
[01:01:59.704 --> 01:02:01.245]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:04.566]  That's all coming up.
[01:02:04.566 --> 01:02:11.549]  Also, Austin, we have a report on this, has announced that the homeless can sleep anywhere, including on the sidewalk in front of your house.
[01:02:13.612 --> 01:02:15.714]  They can sleep at any park.
[01:02:15.714 --> 01:02:20.497]  They can sleep on any public property except the city council building.
[01:02:20.497 --> 01:02:25.581]  I'm not joking.
[01:02:25.581 --> 01:02:28.703]  And Greg Abbott has been talking about that.
[01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:35.428]  These are more open laws than even Seattle, which is dying because of it, and Portland,
[01:02:36.963 --> 01:02:39.185]  Poop capital in San Francisco a close second.
[01:02:39.185 --> 01:02:46.851]  They're all competing for the typhus and flesh-eating bacteria and needle and human feces capitals.
[01:02:46.851 --> 01:02:51.896]  But Austin now wants to have the same landmarks.
[01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:54.558]  I mean, just 300, 400 yards from where I sit.
[01:02:56.018 --> 01:02:57.458]  They're homeless camps.
[01:02:57.458 --> 01:03:02.260]  And they're just, they're in the wealthy areas, they're in the working class areas, they're in the industrial areas.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:10.783]  I'm in an industrial area, but I drive through middle class areas, I drive through fancy areas, and it's just piles of feces and needles and people just laid out everywhere.
[01:03:10.783 --> 01:03:18.785]  Because they get government welfare, because they're indigents, they get, you know, we're talking $50,000, $60,000 a year.
[01:03:18.785 --> 01:03:22.966]  And the local social workers skim all that money.
[01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:23.567]  They get about 20% or so.
[01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:33.237]  And so this is big business and I've been to LA, I've talked to detectives about it, I've talked to experts, I've been to Skid Row.
[01:03:33.237 --> 01:03:37.560]  And so this is something that they create.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:44.926]  These permanent zombie hordes that are crises that they then manage and that they make money off of.
[01:03:44.926 --> 01:03:46.708]  And the green belts everywhere have like
[01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:51.112]  I mean, I told people this like three years ago, they didn't believe me.
[01:03:51.112 --> 01:03:55.013]  And I videotaped it, but it was just so sad, I didn't even show it.
[01:03:55.013 --> 01:04:02.337]  I was like hiking six, seven miles out in the bush, because there's tens of thousands of acres just in one area.
[01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:05.018]  Something like 100,000 acres of greenbelt.
[01:04:05.018 --> 01:04:10.601]  But I was in this one area, and I hiked about seven miles in, and I was about to turn around, and there was a camp.
[01:04:12.202 --> 01:04:12.943]  I don't know.
[01:04:32.516 --> 01:04:35.659]  Uh, I guess because they don't even know how to go get the Democrat services and get signed on.
[01:04:35.659 --> 01:04:38.882]  So I'm just going to show up and go, well, we're from Guatemala, we live in the woods.
[01:04:38.882 --> 01:04:42.966]  We just go to the woods and we catch bass and perch and just sit in the woods.
[01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:52.113]  And it would look like grandma and grandpa and the parents and four kids, including a naked two-year-old standing in Barton Creek.
[01:04:52.113 --> 01:04:56.738]  And this is what America is, folks, a giant third world latrine.
[01:04:56.738 --> 01:04:57.198]  We'll be back.
[01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:03.629]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:05:05.003 --> 01:05:14.412]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:26.062]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:05:26.062 --> 01:05:30.246]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:05:31.147 --> 01:05:35.188]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:05:35.188 --> 01:05:42.090]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.991]  Order now at the InfoWars store.

[01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:10.727]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:10.727 --> 01:06:24.190]  Stardate, June, 2019, July 3rd.
[01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:26.770]  Planet Earth, orbiting.
[01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.731]  Standard Sun, she turns the way out, Milky Way Galaxy.
[01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:41.899]  It's heaven and hell.
[01:06:41.899 --> 01:06:44.922]  And they'll tell you black is really white.
[01:06:44.922 --> 01:06:53.410]  The moon is just the sun at night.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.332]  It's heaven and hell.
[01:06:55.332 --> 01:06:58.195]  Alright my friends, let's delve into it right now.
[01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:06.442]  We have a special guest, hasn't been on with us in years, who I've gotten to come in, who's had some really good insights.
[01:07:06.442 --> 01:07:13.448]  He was the first person, even before Ann Coulter, to tell me, watch, Donald Trump's going to run and Donald Trump's going to be president.
[01:07:13.448 --> 01:07:24.037]  That was probably nine years ago when he was driving the bus I used to have.
[01:07:25.017 --> 01:07:28.359]  With my first wife and my three children in it.
[01:07:28.359 --> 01:07:31.080]  I've got four children now.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.822]  And I remember him saying, you watch Donald Trump's going to run for president.
[01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:38.783]  Donald Trump's going to win after Obama.
[01:07:38.783 --> 01:07:40.964]  And he called a bunch of other stuff.
[01:07:40.964 --> 01:07:44.046]  He said they were going to try to block him at the electoral college.
[01:07:44.046 --> 01:07:46.727]  That's why we had to have the delegates and all the rest of it.
[01:07:46.727 --> 01:07:50.369]  So he's going to give you his crystal ball coming up.
[01:07:51.854 --> 01:07:54.895]  Bob Barnes is swishing and swashing out there as well.
[01:07:54.895 --> 01:08:06.319]  Leo Zagami's plane's a little late, or he'd already be here, but he's scheduled to be in here during the third hour, from Rome, Italy, with all the inside baseball as well.
[01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:09.240]  So look for all that today.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.081]  Mike Adams in the fourth hour.
[01:08:12.081 --> 01:08:14.782]  Okay.
[01:08:14.782 --> 01:08:20.084]  Let's just get to the latest on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and only you can stop this horror.
[01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:28.670]  A whole bunch of the drag queen story time people around the country have been busted being convicted child rapists.
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:39.658]  And the folks that kind of launched it launched the club kids movement in the 80s and 90s that is about underage children in gay bars and people having sex with them.
[01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:41.600]  Then Desmond is amazing.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.621]  One of them is also a convicted killer.
[01:08:43.621 --> 01:08:47.024]  He cut up another gay man with a buzz saw.
[01:08:48.664 --> 01:08:52.507]  And he says on tape, bring us your children, we're gonna corrupt them right now.
[01:08:52.507 --> 01:08:56.790]  There it is, pedophile and convicted child porn peddler.
[01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:58.291]  Says Desmond is amazing, is hot.
[01:08:58.291 --> 01:09:00.673]  In fact, I never covered that last week, it was too sick.
[01:09:00.673 --> 01:09:03.135]  I'm gonna do it now, print that for me please.
[01:09:03.135 --> 01:09:06.358]  He says the vampiric nature of it is what's hottest.
[01:09:06.358 --> 01:09:08.099]  And yes, the whole thing is vampiric.
[01:09:08.099 --> 01:09:11.321]  Do you notice, I tell you what they're doing, what they're up to, they later admit it.
[01:09:11.321 --> 01:09:13.443]  This is vampiric.
[01:09:13.443 --> 01:09:17.186]  Stealing the essence of children, their innocence, and then drugging them.
[01:09:18.131 --> 01:09:25.415]  And whenever Desmond is displayed with killers, they have behind him Rohibinol, Ketamine.
[01:09:25.415 --> 01:09:34.661]  These are things they take to be amnesic and so that they can be further abused in ways I'm not going to describe here.
[01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:39.184]  But let's just say 50 men loading them with HIV.
[01:09:39.184 --> 01:09:46.128]  Now, yes, there he is with the Rohibinol behind him and one of the men is a convicted
[01:09:47.648 --> 01:09:51.393]  Murderer that sliced someone up.
[01:09:51.393 --> 01:09:54.457]  Now let's continue here.
[01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:54.997]  Horror!
[01:09:54.997 --> 01:09:58.081]  Three babies were born alive in the total six.
[01:09:58.081 --> 01:09:59.062]  You read the article.
[01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:02.667]  In Minnesota last year, doctors kept them comfortable, then let them die.
[01:10:04.059 --> 01:10:06.540]  And, of course, harvested their goodies.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.760]  That's gatewaypundit.com.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.641]  It's also up on Infowars.com.
[01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:16.782]  Photos show kids laying on top of Drag Queen at Drag Queen Story Time.
[01:10:16.782 --> 01:10:21.283]  And, again, this is all part of marking their territory.
[01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:27.945]  So, at all these events, they'll get the kids up on the table, and then they'll spread their legs, swing their leg over them.
[01:10:27.945 --> 01:10:31.966]  That's one thing if you're a 25-year-old oil field worker at a tapas bar, and that's happening.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.841]  Still, it's a bad place to be.
[01:10:36.841 --> 01:10:40.543]  People are being used, there's drugs, prostitution.
[01:10:40.543 --> 01:10:42.443]  But, you know, it's America.
[01:10:42.443 --> 01:10:43.404]  Libertarian.
[01:10:43.404 --> 01:10:45.985]  Those are grown adults.
[01:10:45.985 --> 01:10:55.109]  What about when it's 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 and 11 year old kids twerking with, again, men dressed up like clowns with erections?
[01:10:55.109 --> 01:10:56.730]  Get it?
[01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.731]  And touching on him and just, it's disgusting.
[01:11:01.266 --> 01:11:02.847]  So if you're already a listener, you're missing all this.
[01:11:02.847 --> 01:11:05.209]  TV viewers, this is what's happening to children.
[01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:18.078]  So, shows a child laying on top of a drag queen at a drag event, story time, that they're happening all over the world, all coordinated, and the men aren't even having their backgrounds checked.
[01:11:18.078 --> 01:11:29.767]  But they wear clown makeup, and there's the child grabbing the man's breasts, and the children are provocatively laying across the genitals.
[01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:42.055]  And so now, they're gonna have it where the leftist women bring their children there, and then the man, dressed as a clown, lays down, and the children simulate riding horsey.
[01:11:42.055 --> 01:11:44.936]  Giddy up, horsey.
[01:11:44.936 --> 01:11:49.278]  Ride the horsey.
[01:11:49.278 --> 01:11:51.658]  I love riding horsey, Mommy!
[01:11:51.658 --> 01:11:52.939]  Can I go to the library?
[01:11:54.838 --> 01:11:58.521]  In a fat man's lap while he has an erection?
[01:11:58.521 --> 01:12:00.242]  Sure you can, baby.
[01:12:00.242 --> 01:12:05.386]  We're liberal.
[01:12:05.386 --> 01:12:08.068]  They could never do this in an ice cream truck.
[01:12:08.068 --> 01:12:10.509]  They could never get away with this in the park.
[01:12:10.509 --> 01:12:19.096]  But now, your children will stick money in their G-strings as they shake their giant blubber butts in their faces.
[01:12:19.096 --> 01:12:22.078]  They're going to play the audio and they tell them, oh, even local news in Houston.
[01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:26.332]  Shows the kids crying, going, Mommy, no!
[01:12:26.332 --> 01:12:27.073]  No!
[01:12:27.073 --> 01:12:30.996]  Scary-looking guys in demon outfits.
[01:12:30.996 --> 01:12:41.384]  Some of the events, the children have already been prepared and been vampirically fed on, so they, you know, they do go up and give them money because they're told to, but at the other events, where convicted pedophiles are running it, the children cry, go, No, Mommy!
[01:12:41.384 --> 01:12:42.845]  And the mothers go, No!
[01:12:42.845 --> 01:12:43.486]  No!
[01:12:43.486 --> 01:12:44.967]  And they shove them up on them.
[01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.190]  And the men hump them.
[01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:50.451]  In fact, here's one for TV viewers, you can see it.
[01:12:50.451 --> 01:13:00.698]  The convicted child rapist who raped a six-year-old child, isn't allowed to get anywhere near children, ran Drag Week Storytime, but in his off time, he is a dominatrix vampire.
[01:13:00.698 --> 01:13:02.740]  They're all vampires!
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:07.803]  Notice, let's scroll back up, he's not wearing war paint there.
[01:13:07.803 --> 01:13:11.126]  He's only wearing red lipstick with vampire teeth.
[01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:12.486]  Okay?
[01:13:12.486 --> 01:13:15.989]  Because, see, that's who he really is, is a vampire.
[01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:19.654]  Yeah, who do you think rapes children?
[01:13:19.654 --> 01:13:21.394]  It's spiritual.
[01:13:21.394 --> 01:13:24.295]  It's vampirism.
[01:13:24.295 --> 01:13:26.736]  Go read the article, let's put it back on the screen so people can go see for themselves.
[01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:38.181]  The convicted, this is one of the convicted pedophiles, all they do is run their license plates, that's why they come on buses now, you have to follow them back to their lair, and then you get their license and you find out they're a convicted pedophile and you call the police and they get arrested.
[01:13:39.434 --> 01:13:39.994]  Bombshell!
[01:13:39.994 --> 01:13:41.356]  Another Drag Queen story.
[01:13:41.356 --> 01:13:43.017]  Our member exposed a pedophile.
[01:13:43.017 --> 01:13:51.664]  Investigation shows Drag Queen with multiple aliases was convicted of child sex crimes.
[01:13:51.664 --> 01:13:56.288]  Photos show kids lying on top of Drag Queen at Drag Queen Storytime event.
[01:13:56.288 --> 01:14:00.912]  That's on InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and Summit.
[01:14:02.501 --> 01:14:02.701]  I don't
[01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:27.743]  There's usually only, the vampires usually operate in twos.
[01:14:27.743 --> 01:14:30.325]  There's usually a head one and another one with them.
[01:14:30.325 --> 01:14:43.575]  They're always using aliases and we've got to show they're convicted so we can get these, the familiars that are running these Drag Queen Story Times at public schools, sometimes unannounced, and at the libraries and at churches.
[01:14:43.575 --> 01:14:48.379]  We've got to get the familiars because the familiars are breaking the law having these events without background checks.
[01:14:49.532 --> 01:14:50.733]  And folks, they are familiars.
[01:14:50.733 --> 01:14:52.575]  When I use these terms, I'm not joking.
[01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:53.595]  Vampires are real.
[01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:54.736]  They just don't live forever.
[01:14:54.736 --> 01:14:58.219]  The spirits in them are old, though.
[01:14:58.219 --> 01:15:00.100]  These are vampires.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.902]  And they're self-described vampires.
[01:15:01.902 --> 01:15:04.624]  Every damn one of them!
[01:15:04.624 --> 01:15:08.267]  And what does a vampire need to be able to access your children?
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:16.961]  My carriage broke down.
[01:15:16.961 --> 01:15:18.342]  I'm carrying a very important package.
[01:15:18.342 --> 01:15:20.704]  I'd like to pay you to be able to stay here the night.
[01:15:20.704 --> 01:15:21.564]  Oh, you can stay in the barn.
[01:15:21.564 --> 01:15:25.667]  No, I... I'd like to stay in the house tonight.
[01:15:25.667 --> 01:15:28.289]  Oh, oh, and... and my master.
[01:15:28.289 --> 01:15:29.249]  Well, okay, sure.
[01:15:29.249 --> 01:15:30.550]  Here's five pieces of gold.
[01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:37.015]  You just invited Nosferatu into your home.
[01:15:37.015 --> 01:15:41.458]  And they hold the captured children like pygmies have shriveled heads.
[01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.740]  Or when the Romans would capture their enemies, they'd put their enemies' heads on a pipe.
[01:15:46.033 --> 01:15:50.157]  As barbarous as the Romans were, they'd never put a child's head on a spike.
[01:15:50.157 --> 01:15:51.738]  It's bad luck.
[01:15:51.738 --> 01:15:53.420]  Except the Dark Lord.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.741]  You don't want to work with the Dark Lord.
[01:15:57.517 --> 01:15:59.478]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:59.478 --> 01:16:04.801]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:06.382]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:06.382 --> 01:16:14.726]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:24.592]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:24.592 --> 01:16:29.095]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[01:17:15.282 --> 01:17:23.165]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:23.345 --> 01:17:25.126]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:50.026 --> 01:17:51.671]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk to owners.
[01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:53.396]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[01:17:53.396 --> 01:17:55.903]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:17:58.826 --> 01:18:00.848]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:02.869]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[01:18:02.869 --> 01:18:09.375]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:21.444]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:18:21.444 --> 01:18:24.527]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:26.689]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:18:54.631 --> 01:18:56.532]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:18:56.532 --> 01:18:57.913]  Even it is what you just saw.

[01:20:01.288 --> 01:20:03.895]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:42.418 --> 01:20:45.420]  I want to explain something, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:51.563]  I told you that pedophiles are actually vampires 20 years ago.
[01:20:51.563 --> 01:21:00.887]  And I explained that they have kind of little pot-bellied, nelly effeminate types that are the procurers.
[01:21:00.887 --> 01:21:03.269]  But that above that, there are people that...
[01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:07.493]  Look and behave and act like the governor of California.
[01:21:07.493 --> 01:21:10.455]  He looks like one, he acts like one.
[01:21:10.455 --> 01:21:12.537]  Tall, strong, handsome.
[01:21:12.537 --> 01:21:14.398]  They have that demonic look in their eye though.
[01:21:14.398 --> 01:21:18.981]  You know, kind of like the American Psycho played by Christian Bale.
[01:21:18.981 --> 01:21:21.383]  But beyond it, Christian Bale isn't a psycho.
[01:21:21.383 --> 01:21:25.846]  He couldn't fully animate the eyes, fully have the demonic light shine through.
[01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:30.135]  And so that's how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:33.915]  And when Bram Stoker wrote Dracula, he's telling you everything.
[01:21:33.915 --> 01:21:36.336]  That's actually true.
[01:21:36.336 --> 01:21:40.197]  You see, the royalty of Europe is all out of Transylvania.
[01:21:40.197 --> 01:21:43.117]  That's the original bloodline.
[01:21:43.117 --> 01:21:50.039]  And the German royalty that is now the British royalty is all related to the Count Dragon.
[01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:52.554]  Count Dracula.
[01:21:52.554 --> 01:21:54.035]  But Count Dracula didn't live forever.
[01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:55.836]  His bloodline lives on.
[01:21:55.836 --> 01:21:59.138]  It's all archetypes through the royal blood.
[01:21:59.138 --> 01:22:02.100]  But they then also drink blood.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.862]  They sacrifice children.
[01:22:04.862 --> 01:22:08.624]  Raping children is only the hors d'oeuvre.
[01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:19.671]  Now, Prince Charles, again, was best friends with Jimmy Savelle, who supplied children for killing, this is all confirmed now, for killing
[01:22:21.135 --> 01:22:24.277]  Not just for raping.
[01:22:24.277 --> 01:22:34.722]  Now, every one of these convicted child molester, drag queen, story time people, when you go into their Facebook or their Twitter, says, I'm really a vampire.
[01:22:34.722 --> 01:22:43.327]  And when you cover their events and go to their events, when they don't know you're there and you're filming, they walk around doing this.
[01:22:43.327 --> 01:22:44.208]  Show people on TV.
[01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:46.069]  I want to show folks.
[01:22:46.069 --> 01:22:47.209]  Punch me up real quick.
[01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:49.630]  They literally walk around like this.
[01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:50.311]  When they grieve, they go.
[01:22:51.878 --> 01:22:58.680]  And if you go film a gay pride parade when there's the groups of clowns, those are the servant class.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:04.381]  Just like in an anthill, you've got the drones, you've got the warriors, you've got the workers, you've got the queen.
[01:23:04.381 --> 01:23:10.082]  And so they wear ceremonial clown outfits that are used in hardcore Satanism.
[01:23:10.082 --> 01:23:13.923]  They now have hardcore Satanism events at churches they rent out in England.
[01:23:13.923 --> 01:23:17.404]  And you see it in the news over there, oh, Satanists rent church.
[01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:41.836]  uh... for a bit and then it shows them as clout that's where all that comes from places and that's why you're scared of clout you need to understand that these are man dressed up like women trying to train children to let them put their hands on and that's why
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:54.224]  They now first have them sit in their laps, they put their hand down, the drag queen lays there and the children mount them and ride horsey.
[01:23:54.224 --> 01:24:03.608]  You know it would be inappropriate if you put your daughter on your lap like that and said, ride horsey.
[01:24:03.608 --> 01:24:10.131]  I put my daughters on my knee and bounce them and ride horsey.
[01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:11.532]  Only my wife rides horsey that way.
[01:24:12.858 --> 01:24:25.344]  But you see, ladies and gentlemen, your children are going to be taken and you're going to learn how to ride horsey, lying with their genitals up against the man's genitals.
[01:24:25.344 --> 01:24:26.805]  And they all make this face.
[01:24:33.493 --> 01:24:37.096]  And a child, and the children are first scared.
[01:24:37.096 --> 01:24:41.178]  They go, you come to me, my child.
[01:24:41.178 --> 01:24:49.764]  Soon, Dracula will have his way with you, my pretty.
[01:24:49.764 --> 01:24:54.368]  And then the ruler class look like Governor Newsom.
[01:24:54.368 --> 01:24:56.329]  They look like Chuckie Schumer.
[01:24:56.329 --> 01:25:01.733]  Some are handsome, some look crazed, we all have that... Schumer can't help
[01:25:03.425 --> 01:25:06.428]  Walk around with that.
[01:25:06.428 --> 01:25:09.390]  Just that benevolent malevolence.
[01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:12.593]  Oh, we're helping you, but they're really malevolent.
[01:25:12.593 --> 01:25:14.515]  And just rubbing their hands together.
[01:25:14.515 --> 01:25:21.261]  I'm going to kick you, take your hundreds of vaccines, I'm going to brain damage you, drink your fluoride.
[01:25:21.261 --> 01:25:22.682]  I spit on your future.
[01:25:22.682 --> 01:25:23.823]  I wreck your genetics.
[01:25:23.823 --> 01:25:25.125]  I rule you.
[01:25:25.125 --> 01:25:27.547]  You're going to be twisted and fallen like me soon.
[01:25:27.547 --> 01:25:28.528]  The gates of hell.
[01:25:30.197 --> 01:25:33.778]  Chuckie Schumer is a Dracula.
[01:25:33.778 --> 01:25:35.839]  He's best buddies with his procurer.
[01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:43.943]  You know who his protégé is, right?
[01:25:43.943 --> 01:25:45.783]  Anthony Weiner.
[01:25:45.783 --> 01:25:48.124]  Here, let's show Weiner.
[01:25:48.124 --> 01:25:57.028]  You see, Schumer has Dracula eyes, but Weiner has the Nelly... That look.
[01:25:57.028 --> 01:25:59.369]  And occasionally he'll make a shark face when he sees kids.
[01:26:00.265 --> 01:26:02.406]  And they all celebrate together when they get around kids.
[01:26:02.406 --> 01:26:07.227]  I've seen Stephen Colbert makes shark face when he's at events with these guys.
[01:26:07.227 --> 01:26:12.208]  You can pull up photos of it with him with... Type in Stephen Colbert with John Podesta.
[01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:14.809]  And they're both making shark faces.
[01:26:14.809 --> 01:26:20.771]  And of course, Podesta actually sports full-size vampire teeth.
[01:26:20.771 --> 01:26:21.671]  Reportedly had them added.
[01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:24.578]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:24.578 --> 01:26:26.459]  He went and got some special implants.
[01:26:26.459 --> 01:26:27.820]  Vampire teeth.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.402]  He's sporting vampire teeth on television.
[01:26:31.402 --> 01:26:31.722]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:31.722 --> 01:26:33.203]  I looked at photos of him 20 years ago.
[01:26:33.203 --> 01:26:34.723]  Didn't have vampire teeth then.
[01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:38.485]  The dude's got vampire teeth.
[01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:40.606]  Big ones.
[01:26:40.606 --> 01:26:46.149]  Stephen Colbert is in photos of him going... They'll just flash it real quick.
[01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:48.290]  I can't even make the face.
[01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:48.970]  It's so demonic.
[01:26:58.202 --> 01:27:08.147]  And his brothers in The High Magic of the Washington Post, 2007, celebrating DeviantArt, and he says, I've got photos of naked children.
[01:27:08.147 --> 01:27:08.647]  I like it.
[01:27:08.647 --> 01:27:09.867]  It's art, and I'm going to keep it.
[01:27:09.867 --> 01:27:12.929]  And I've got a basement where I do things.
[01:27:12.929 --> 01:27:18.071]  And you got all of them that go to Lolita Island with the little girls.
[01:27:18.071 --> 01:27:21.953]  And you don't just think they have sex with the little girls, do you?
[01:27:23.956 --> 01:27:25.800]  No.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.786]  That doesn't go quite far enough, does it?
[01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:31.571]  To really get that energy.
[01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:33.676]  You gotta torture them good and long.
[01:27:35.134 --> 01:27:42.699]  That's why they've said for their democracy, their democracy, their globalist vampire democracy, where they all have councils and they vote.
[01:27:42.699 --> 01:27:45.340]  They have lower councils and high councils and they vote on what they're going to do.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.522]  And they've all voted, we're going to kill babies out in the open!
[01:27:48.522 --> 01:27:50.384]  And we're going to sexualize children now!
[01:27:50.384 --> 01:27:53.446]  And we're going to shut down all the Christians, because they're about to beat us!
[01:27:53.446 --> 01:27:55.847]  And we've got to shut them down now!
[01:27:55.847 --> 01:27:57.748]  And who do they want shut down more than anybody?
[01:27:57.748 --> 01:27:59.129]  Alex Jones.
[01:27:59.129 --> 01:28:03.372]  Because I know what a bunch of blood-drinking devils they are.
[01:28:04.565 --> 01:28:08.346]  Remember Al Gore?
[01:28:08.346 --> 01:28:12.328]  The Associated Press has a refrigerator that follows him everywhere.
[01:28:12.328 --> 01:28:14.308]  Full of blood.
[01:28:14.308 --> 01:28:18.350]  And it was noted, a whole bunch of different blood types.
[01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:27.193]  And Al Gore, according to our sources, sticks a straw in it and drinks it like a Capri Sun.
[01:28:27.193 --> 01:28:28.533]  There's only one.
[01:28:28.533 --> 01:28:29.934]  Capri Sun.
[01:28:29.934 --> 01:28:31.575]  Now, we've got a special guest coming in studio.
[01:28:31.575 --> 01:28:32.595]  We're going to cover the waterfront.
[01:28:34.062 --> 01:28:35.804]  Richard Reeves.
[01:28:35.804 --> 01:28:36.705]  My old buddy.
[01:28:36.705 --> 01:28:39.548]  I've known him a good 18 years.
[01:28:39.548 --> 01:28:40.630]  He'll be in studio.
[01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:43.953]  Almost died of a heart attack a few years ago, but he's gotten better.
[01:28:43.953 --> 01:28:48.058]  Came close, but back in the saddle again, straight ahead.
[01:28:48.058 --> 01:28:49.119]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:49.119 --> 01:28:50.480]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.782]  Newswars.com.
[01:28:51.782 --> 01:28:54.345]  Fighting the vampire forces of the New World Order.
[01:28:57.403 --> 01:28:58.624]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.624 --> 01:29:02.547]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.547 --> 01:29:04.068]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.068 --> 01:29:07.031]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.031 --> 01:29:12.595]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.595 --> 01:29:13.796]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.796 --> 01:29:16.738]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.738 --> 01:29:18.960]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.403]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.403 --> 01:29:25.745]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.066 --> 01:29:30.927]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:30.927 --> 01:29:35.928]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:35.928 --> 01:29:40.749]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.749 --> 01:29:42.110]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:45.870]  Check out all of the success stories at HBExtract.com.

[01:29:47.231 --> 01:29:47.791]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.791 --> 01:29:50.272]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:59.008 --> 01:30:00.068]  The time has come.
[01:30:00.068 --> 01:30:01.049]  The time is here.
[01:30:01.049 --> 01:30:13.072]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[01:30:13.072 --> 01:30:24.616]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[01:30:24.696 --> 01:30:25.076]  We're good.
[01:30:43.373 --> 01:30:46.817]  Do your shopping with us and we will continue on the face of this.
[01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:57.908]  InfoWareStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, whatever you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[01:30:59.853 --> 01:31:03.956]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:03.956 --> 01:31:28.456]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth, and so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is
[01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:29.637]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:59.301 --> 01:32:00.362]  The time has come.
[01:32:00.362 --> 01:32:01.342]  The time is here.
[01:32:01.342 --> 01:32:13.370]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:24.957]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[01:32:24.997 --> 01:32:25.297]  We're good.
[01:32:47.102 --> 01:32:49.044]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.198 --> 01:33:31.845]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.845 --> 01:33:34.866]  Evil's making its move against America right now.
[01:33:34.866 --> 01:33:40.509]  I'm your host Alex Jones here with my old friend and public analyst Richard Reeves.
[01:33:40.509 --> 01:33:41.910]  Richard's been out of the game for a while.
[01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:44.271]  Had a big heart attack a few years ago, but he's better now.
[01:33:44.271 --> 01:33:46.493]  It's good to have him in the studio with us.
[01:33:47.413 --> 01:33:51.037]  And he really is a smart guy when it comes to predictions and trailblazing things.
[01:33:51.037 --> 01:33:54.400]  So I'm going to get his predictions and more here in just a moment.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:10.496]  But first, please don't forget that we're particularly banned because we expose Antifa, Communism, Globalism, the Chi-Com influence, Big Tech censorship, and the fact that NAMBLA has organized with the UN, look it up, it's official NGO, non-governmental organization,
[01:34:11.417 --> 01:34:27.081]  Drag queen story times are actually sexualization of children, where you bring your children to talk about sex, talk about gender, and have men rub your children's butts, and then now have your children ride the men like they're simulated having sex with them.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:35.062]  And law enforcement, psychologists, anybody will tell you that the pedophiles test children out, is what they do.
[01:34:35.062 --> 01:34:41.703]  They touch them first, they get them used to it, so that the children can be prepared.
[01:34:41.703 --> 01:34:44.504]  And so this is total preparation for pedophilia.
[01:34:44.504 --> 01:34:52.365]  We pointed out that the TSA, major studies show, and I'm not even bashing the TSA themselves, but the whole police state measures that Congress has them do while the borders are wide open.
[01:34:55.339 --> 01:35:01.223]  What they do is, when the TSA gropes kids and all that, it's training them to let pedophiles do it later.
[01:35:01.223 --> 01:35:05.145]  That's why they stopped groping children under the age of 14.
[01:35:05.145 --> 01:35:07.827]  Because it was illegal, and people brought lawsuits.
[01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:18.474]  Okay, so, this stuff is unprecedented, and the so-called drag queens say, we're grooming your kids to be with us in the future.
[01:35:18.474 --> 01:35:22.537]  So, it's here, it's going on, and that's why they're trying to shut us down, so please,
[01:35:23.687 --> 01:35:24.608]  Stand with us.
[01:35:24.608 --> 01:35:26.068]  We stand with the children.
[01:35:26.068 --> 01:35:28.069]  We're going to continue to fight these people.
[01:35:28.069 --> 01:35:32.972]  This is the pet peeve of Google and the globalists is they are heavy into this.
[01:35:32.972 --> 01:35:39.455]  In fact, they're saying some echelons of Google and Apple and Facebook are up to a third men that dress as women.
[01:35:40.356 --> 01:35:47.161]  You have to understand that they do this as a cloaking device to get close to kids, and it's a signal of the group they're in.
[01:35:47.161 --> 01:35:49.522]  That doesn't mean all men that want to dress like women are pedophiles.
[01:35:49.522 --> 01:35:57.487]  It's this particular club, and it's very powerful, it's very sick, and it's bound together in the serious crimes they've committed.
[01:35:57.487 --> 01:36:08.855]  And they know this stuff's all coming out now, from law enforcement exposing it, so they're now trying to normalize it on Netflix and HBO, all have shows about pedophilia, Salon, New York Times,
[01:36:10.896 --> 01:36:17.078]  Vice, TV, because they know it's all coming out, so they're just trying to normalize it before it comes out.
[01:36:17.078 --> 01:36:24.861]  So now, all over the country, now your children, the man dressed as a clown lays down and your child rides them.
[01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:29.643]  Or lays on top of them, rubbing them and grabbing their breast.
[01:36:29.643 --> 01:36:33.024]  And there's photos, videos, it's all on newswars.com.
[01:36:34.269 --> 01:36:37.030]  Send this out to everyone you know.
[01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:41.331]  The child is just like, what in the hell is being done to me by my mother?
[01:36:41.331 --> 01:36:48.593]  But this is, again, the sick, sick cult, and they know what they're doing because they're being rewarded.
[01:36:48.593 --> 01:36:56.275]  These people don't have God in their lives, and they've sunken into the abyss, and now they think it's totally normal to engage in these types of satanic rituals.
[01:36:56.275 --> 01:36:58.476]  And that's exactly what this is, the corruption of the youth.
[01:36:59.877 --> 01:37:08.001]  Now there may be some useful idiots involved that don't know what they're doing, but spiritually they're having their buttons pushed to want to be part of this.
[01:37:08.001 --> 01:37:11.023]  Also, I knew about this a week ago, but I was not supposed to get into it.
[01:37:11.023 --> 01:37:20.389]  I know who else is going, but President Trump invites meme maker Carpe Donctum to the White House, President to hold social media summit on July 11th.
[01:37:20.389 --> 01:37:25.052]  I'll be releasing a video later today with an emergency message to the President with the inside baseball.
[01:37:25.872 --> 01:37:26.373]  on this
[01:37:44.406 --> 01:37:48.448]  Many AOC that just made the funny little videos, that young girl, she's been death-threaded in dots.
[01:37:48.448 --> 01:37:52.789]  She's deleted her Twitter from her family being terrorized, and so they've won on that front.
[01:37:52.789 --> 01:37:55.971]  Infowars.com, terrorizing a little girl.
[01:37:55.971 --> 01:38:03.433]  Bombshell, Portland Police say Mayor Wheeler ordered stand-down during violent antifa riots, and they say they have the proof of that.
[01:38:03.433 --> 01:38:04.634]  Also, antifa unmasked.
[01:38:06.808 --> 01:38:28.385]  News to share as infiltrates DC Antifa planning session post fascist groups entire game plan for July 6 They are unmasked in the videos will show you some of the sniveling slime another key report by David Knight CNN is Antifa that's exactly why when I said the event if it comes your house to kill you if your media or law enforcement or a Republican they're saying they're coming to your houses next to kill you
[01:38:29.145 --> 01:38:30.187]  This is official.
[01:38:30.187 --> 01:38:33.072]  You should have a battle rifle ready if they come to defend yourself.
[01:38:33.072 --> 01:38:34.134]  That's what the media said.
[01:38:34.134 --> 01:38:41.828]  I've threatened the media with battle rifles because a lot of them are CNN reporters by day, pot-bellied, Antifa by night.
[01:38:43.002 --> 01:38:45.803]  So there's all of that information coming up as well.
[01:38:45.803 --> 01:38:51.565]  And then California, Democrats push bill allowing illegal party rules.
[01:38:51.565 --> 01:38:58.847]  So that's allowing illegals to have roles in the party even at the highest levels, thus ruling California.
[01:38:58.847 --> 01:39:00.447]  So the overthrow of the U.S.
[01:39:00.447 --> 01:39:08.670]  accelerates with Beto O'Rourke campaigning in Mexico against the United States, campaigning for president in Mexico.
[01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:10.290]  That's how far all of this has come.
[01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:11.231]  Meanwhile, 27 kidnapped
[01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:15.513]  Uh, in, uh, Cancun.
[01:39:15.513 --> 01:39:16.954]  Cancun's totally collapsed.
[01:39:16.954 --> 01:39:20.937]  Total drug war there with six cartels fighting for supremacy.
[01:39:20.937 --> 01:39:27.622]  Meanwhile, one dead, five infected after mold infestation at Seattle's Children's Hospital.
[01:39:27.622 --> 01:39:29.063]  Deadly mold killing people all over the country.
[01:39:30.865 --> 01:39:39.749]  Ohio school removes 10 commandments after atheist group complains, yet Kaepernick complains and why they pulled the Betsy Ross colonial American flag.
[01:39:39.749 --> 01:39:44.952]  No, they rigged all that for 4th of July to put out the idea that the American flag is evil.
[01:39:44.952 --> 01:39:46.693]  Nike is a very evil organization.
[01:39:47.898 --> 01:39:50.638]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:39:50.638 --> 01:40:01.980]  We're also going to get to a bunch of things I haven't even mentioned yet, like CNN is now in 15th place in cable, again behind reruns of Yogi Berra, continuing.
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:07.941]  Austin announces plans to let homeless camp in your yard or anywhere else they want to, except for at the City Council.
[01:40:07.941 --> 01:40:10.602]  They, of course, exempt themselves.
[01:40:10.602 --> 01:40:15.323]  That is just some of what we're going to be breaking down.
[01:40:15.323 --> 01:40:16.423]  And then the coup de grace,
[01:40:17.247 --> 01:40:18.587]  When we come back, I've already played this one.
[01:40:18.587 --> 01:40:21.208]  I'm going to play it over and over again today.
[01:40:21.208 --> 01:40:26.270]  Democrats are now in Congress officially calling for people to be arrested that criticize them.
[01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.970]  I'm not kidding.
[01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:28.090]  You'll see that.
[01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:29.491]  Richard Reeves, my good friend.
[01:40:29.491 --> 01:40:30.331]  How long have we known each other?
[01:40:30.331 --> 01:40:31.251]  About 18 years?
[01:40:31.251 --> 01:40:33.232]  Yeah, I think we met right after 9-11.
[01:40:33.232 --> 01:40:36.653]  Right after 9-11, I said, man, I got to meet this guy, Alex Jones.
[01:40:36.653 --> 01:40:38.954]  I heard you talking about the inside job aspects of 9-11.
[01:40:38.954 --> 01:40:40.494]  I said, I got to meet you.
[01:40:40.494 --> 01:40:42.195]  And it was like around October, November.
[01:40:43.119 --> 01:40:53.929]  Two or three months after the 9-11 event, and I said, you know, this is a gentleman I need to meet, and so I went and saw you at Cable Access TV, and the rest is history, I guess, as they say.
[01:40:53.929 --> 01:41:05.340]  You have had a rough few years taking care of your 97-year-old mother while working other jobs and doing so much, and then you worked yourself to death in the Trump campaign, had a big old heart attack.
[01:41:06.277 --> 01:41:07.098]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:07.098 --> 01:41:09.401]  My mom turned 89, still taking good care of her.
[01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:13.946]  But I tell you what, I want to dive into this stuff, man, that we've got this hot stuff.
[01:41:13.946 --> 01:41:16.569]  Frederica Wilson, thank you very much.
[01:41:16.569 --> 01:41:24.478]  You know, hey, we should give her a standing ovation because in 2007, I had an interview with you, Alex, in the old studio, and we talked about, hey,
[01:41:24.838 --> 01:41:26.899]  Let's get the media to tell more lies.
[01:41:26.899 --> 01:41:28.320]  Hey, let's lie bigger.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:36.363]  And now Frederica Wilson, thank you, because she's totally uncloaked now that she doesn't even understand what America is.
[01:41:36.363 --> 01:41:38.384]  She doesn't understand the First Amendment.
[01:41:38.384 --> 01:41:39.325]  So hallelujah.
[01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:50.070]  This just further helps our cause that we can finally get these people to uncloak and give us their full-on crazy so that we can get them unelected.
[01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:54.292]  For her to win re-election, there's only two ways for her to win her next election.
[01:41:54.292 --> 01:41:58.574]  One would be total voter fraud and the other is the ignorance of the American people.
[01:41:58.574 --> 01:42:01.116]  And I just don't believe the American people are this stupid.
[01:42:01.116 --> 01:42:01.936]  I don't believe it.
[01:42:01.936 --> 01:42:09.440]  Well, I know you want to talk about this and shoot your horn, but I remember we were out in Big Bend and after that we went up to
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.024]  Up to Arizona, we went to the Grand Canyon.
[01:42:15.024 --> 01:42:18.426]  I remember you talking about Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump.
[01:42:18.426 --> 01:42:22.189]  You watch he's going to run for office and he's going to win for president.
[01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:25.452]  And you were the first person I ever heard actually predict that.
[01:42:25.452 --> 01:42:28.834]  And it came true like six years before Ann Coulter ever said it.
[01:42:28.834 --> 01:42:32.497]  You also had a lot of other predictions that came true about what happened in the campaign.
[01:42:32.497 --> 01:42:34.239]  We come back, how were you able to predict that?
[01:42:34.699 --> 01:42:41.161]  Well, in the case of some of the things that happened during the campaign, them trying to steal the delegates and all that, it's just, we know how they operate.
[01:42:41.161 --> 01:42:47.743]  And with Donald Trump, I mean, our first suspicion was that potentially he was just another ringer, that he would be another surrogate for Hillary.
[01:42:47.743 --> 01:42:50.043]  So that was a concern then, but we knew that he could win.
[01:42:50.043 --> 01:42:54.404]  I mean, absolutely, with the history and track record Trump had, he had the resources to win.
[01:42:57.995 --> 01:43:10.031]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:43:10.031 --> 01:43:12.915]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[01:43:13.255 --> 01:43:13.936]  I don't know.
[01:43:32.726 --> 01:43:33.667]  I like to be expanding.
[01:43:33.667 --> 01:43:34.448]  I like to be winning.
[01:43:34.448 --> 01:43:35.168]  I like to be fighting.
[01:43:35.168 --> 01:43:36.349]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:43:36.349 --> 01:43:37.230]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:38.851]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:43:38.851 --> 01:43:40.052]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:43:40.052 --> 01:43:41.112]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:43:41.112 --> 01:43:42.433]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[01:43:42.433 --> 01:43:43.974]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:43:43.974 --> 01:43:48.818]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:43:48.818 --> 01:43:50.819]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:43:50.819 --> 01:43:53.661]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[01:43:53.661 --> 01:43:55.122]  Funded by foreign banks and the Chai Comps.
[01:43:55.122 --> 01:43:56.764]  So go to InfowarStore.com.
[01:43:57.648 --> 01:43:59.509]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[01:43:59.509 --> 01:44:00.789]  This is the maximum alert.
[01:44:00.789 --> 01:44:01.930]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[01:44:01.930 --> 01:44:03.350]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:04.971]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[01:44:04.971 --> 01:44:09.632]  We need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:09.632 --> 01:44:11.533]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[01:44:11.533 --> 01:44:12.053]  There's a P.O.
[01:44:12.053 --> 01:44:13.294]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[01:44:13.294 --> 01:44:15.094]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[01:44:15.094 --> 01:44:16.575]  We need money to fight back.
[01:44:16.715 --> 01:44:19.377]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[01:44:19.377 --> 01:44:22.280]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.681]  We have a huge sale going.

[01:44:48.507 --> 01:44:50.650]  Again, cancel AutoShip anytime for free.
[01:44:50.650 --> 01:44:51.691]  We need the funding.
[01:44:51.691 --> 01:44:52.692]  Thank you for your support.
[01:44:52.692 --> 01:44:55.716]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[01:44:55.716 --> 01:44:56.557]  We're not going to back down.
[01:44:59.039 --> 01:45:14.902]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:45:14.902 --> 01:45:16.623]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:45:16.623 --> 01:45:27.505]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:45:27.725 --> 01:45:28.506]  We're good to go.
[01:45:57.685 --> 01:45:59.167]  Thank you.
[01:46:18.968 --> 01:46:19.148]  I think?
[01:46:36.762 --> 01:46:44.184]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[01:46:44.184 --> 01:46:45.605]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:46:45.605 --> 01:46:52.527]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[01:46:52.527 --> 01:46:53.607]  You have my commitment.
[01:46:53.607 --> 01:47:01.669]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:04.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.193 --> 01:47:24.554]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.554 --> 01:47:27.856]  He who must not be named.
[01:47:27.856 --> 01:47:30.858]  That's Wired Magazine.
[01:47:30.858 --> 01:47:34.640]  Alex Jones is Voldemort.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.841]  That was in the Physical Magazine.
[01:47:37.841 --> 01:47:42.304]  Hundreds of other similar articles calling me the one that must not be named.
[01:47:42.304 --> 01:47:46.086]  And even after they wrote those articles, Facebook said, you know what?
[01:47:46.086 --> 01:47:47.927]  Don't say his name.
[01:47:47.927 --> 01:47:49.688]  You know, say it in fullwars.com or we'll
[01:47:52.898 --> 01:47:54.500]  What incredible authoritarianism.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:48:01.166]  And now, Representative Frederica Wilson.
[01:48:01.166 --> 01:48:02.166]  Well, she says this.
[01:48:02.166 --> 01:48:02.467]  Here it is.
[01:48:03.612 --> 01:48:12.682]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[01:48:12.682 --> 01:48:17.867]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[01:48:17.867 --> 01:48:24.094]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[01:48:25.234 --> 01:48:30.218]  So Richard Reeves, this is true fascism, this is true authoritarianism.
[01:48:30.218 --> 01:48:33.120]  They've got their army attacking people, being protected.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:36.022]  They're bringing illegal aliens in to get everything free.
[01:48:36.022 --> 01:48:39.665]  They're campaigning for president in Mexico.
[01:48:39.665 --> 01:48:42.828]  They are bringing in illegal aliens to be in the California government.
[01:48:47.075 --> 01:48:50.256]  This is true un-American treason going on.
[01:48:50.256 --> 01:48:55.439]  And Frederica Wilson, like I say, she doesn't even know what America's about if she doesn't understand the First Amendment.
[01:48:55.439 --> 01:48:58.260]  So what we need to do is identify these people.
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:48:59.420]  They're uncloaking.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:02.062]  Thankfully, Frederica Wilson is a key example.
[01:49:02.062 --> 01:49:03.622]  Trump should be like Santa Claus.
[01:49:03.622 --> 01:49:09.285]  He should be starting to keep a list of who the people are in Congress and Senate that are enemies of the country.
[01:49:09.725 --> 01:49:12.286]  And he should be talking about this and twittering about this.
[01:49:30.755 --> 01:49:43.931]  Absolutely they are, and that's where if the Democrats understood, if the rank-and-file voters understood that it's you that she's trying to shut up, it's you that she doesn't want you being up and ear talking, it's you that she wants you to be quiet.
[01:49:43.931 --> 01:49:47.936]  So obviously another thing she doesn't know is that the Supreme Court
[01:49:48.536 --> 01:49:55.878]  Recently made a decision that even Trump can't even block people that send him Twitter messages that he doesn't like.
[01:49:55.878 --> 01:50:07.581]  The Supreme Court ruled that users have a right to go on there and say what they want to the politicians provided it's not something like, hey I'm gonna come kill you, like a real valid threat of violence or something like that.
[01:50:07.581 --> 01:50:08.741]  So she doesn't even know that.
[01:50:08.741 --> 01:50:10.742]  The Supreme Court already ruled on that.
[01:50:11.942 --> 01:50:15.886]  That's why Trump said, put all the conservatives you've taken off back on.
[01:50:15.886 --> 01:50:17.167]  What you're doing is illegal.
[01:50:17.167 --> 01:50:17.968]  You're election meddling.
[01:50:17.968 --> 01:50:18.549]  He said it again.
[01:50:18.549 --> 01:50:20.511]  He's getting ready to take action.
[01:50:20.511 --> 01:50:20.871]  Right.
[01:50:20.871 --> 01:50:22.132]  And he does need to take action.
[01:50:22.132 --> 01:50:27.417]  And you've talked about the antitrust issue, that they're going to do the antitrust action against the big tech companies.
[01:50:27.417 --> 01:50:28.418]  That needs to happen.
[01:50:28.418 --> 01:50:30.920]  They need to be struck with every legal
[01:50:31.963 --> 01:50:33.623]  You don't get elected because they steal the election.
[01:50:33.623 --> 01:50:34.364]  We're really screwed.
[01:50:34.364 --> 01:50:35.884]  Trump gets it, he came out today and
[01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:01.651]  We're good.
[01:51:25.794 --> 01:51:26.974]  Let it happen.
[01:51:26.974 --> 01:51:33.237]  And as a matter of fact, over the last few months, you know, the FAANG stocks have lost like a trillion in market cap or more.
[01:51:33.237 --> 01:51:37.838]  But the stock market in general has kind of stayed level because that's exactly what's been happening.
[01:51:37.838 --> 01:51:40.759]  I'm not a stock market guru or expert, but I've got some basic knowledge.
[01:51:40.759 --> 01:51:42.500]  Oh yeah, the big tech stocks are in trouble.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.801]  We did buy off Trump and here is the proof.
[01:52:04.315 --> 01:52:17.132]  So that's another angle that the FAANG stocks need to be looked at is SEC violations, Security Exchange Commission, and another thing I'd like to see Trump do is incorporate the First Amendment into the trade deals.
[01:52:17.132 --> 01:52:21.157]  Right now, you pointed out the other day that you've got the European Union and China
[01:52:21.497 --> 01:52:26.081]  Telling Google, hey, you're going to censor this, you're going to censor that, you're going to allow this, not allow that.
[01:52:26.081 --> 01:52:27.582]  Well, you know, hey, you know what?
[01:52:27.582 --> 01:52:29.724]  The United States is still the big kid on the block.
[01:52:29.724 --> 01:52:33.307]  We're the ones that should be saying, hey, we want First Amendment.
[01:52:33.307 --> 01:52:35.709]  You've got to have First Amendment in the European Union.
[01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:37.110]  Otherwise, tariff.
[01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:37.710]  That's right.
[01:52:37.710 --> 01:52:39.231]  EU and all the rest of them.
[01:52:39.231 --> 01:52:39.712]  China.
[01:52:39.712 --> 01:52:41.753]  Are dictating to us how the Internet runs.
[01:52:41.753 --> 01:52:42.114]  Exactly.
[01:52:42.114 --> 01:52:43.215]  And we go, we're libertarian.
[01:52:43.215 --> 01:52:44.155]  We don't regulate it.
[01:52:44.155 --> 01:52:46.137]  You just let the chai comms of the EU do it.
[01:52:46.297 --> 01:52:47.258]  Well, see, that's another point.
[01:52:47.258 --> 01:52:48.199]  Let me address it.
[01:52:48.199 --> 01:52:52.604]  This frustrates me that I've never heard this said on the show yet, and I want to say it right now.
[01:52:52.604 --> 01:52:57.310]  If you're the smallest real estate investor, you can have one house, and guess what?
[01:52:57.310 --> 01:53:00.613]  You are subject to all the anti-discrimination laws.
[01:53:01.254 --> 01:53:08.899]  You can't discriminate against whoever wants to rent your house if they financially qualify, if they have the basic financial qualifications.
[01:53:08.899 --> 01:53:13.802]  If they're black or gay or whatever, you cannot discriminate, and that's just a mom and pop operation.
[01:53:13.802 --> 01:53:18.364]  So you're going to tell me that big corporations are subject to our legislation?
[01:53:18.364 --> 01:53:18.905]  Are you kidding me?
[01:53:18.905 --> 01:53:20.325]  That's why we do have a government.
[01:53:21.696 --> 01:53:24.437]  We, the people from these oligarchs... Oh, damn right.
[01:53:24.437 --> 01:53:28.039]  I mean, they claim, oh, there's no discrimination on politics.
[01:53:28.039 --> 01:53:28.679]  Yes, there is.
[01:53:28.679 --> 01:53:30.120]  And there's election meddling.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.701]  And they lied to Congress.
[01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:34.262]  And they're operating as combines working together.
[01:53:34.262 --> 01:53:35.803]  And they're selling data illegally.
[01:53:35.803 --> 01:53:37.624]  There's a hundred ways to skin this cat.
[01:53:38.164 --> 01:53:39.325]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:53:39.325 --> 01:53:46.911]  So, I'd like to see, like I say, Trump, you know, that's what we're the big manufacturer of right now is the Bill of Rights.
[01:53:46.911 --> 01:53:49.793]  Let's export, let's keep our Bill of Rights and make sure we have it.
[01:53:49.793 --> 01:53:53.596]  Let's have our First Amendment, let's have all our Fourth, Fifth, Second Amendment, etc.
[01:53:53.596 --> 01:53:54.457]  But you know what?
[01:53:54.457 --> 01:54:03.184]  Donald Trump, this is your chance to step up and be the biggest man on the planet ever by bringing the Bill of Rights to the world
[01:54:03.684 --> 01:54:04.384]  V.S.A.
[01:54:04.384 --> 01:54:05.304]  threats of tariffs.
[01:54:05.304 --> 01:54:07.045]  Just say, hey, you know what, China?
[01:54:07.045 --> 01:54:10.746]  If you're going to have anti-First Amendment in your country, that's fine, but you know what?
[01:54:10.746 --> 01:54:15.607]  We're going to tariff any Internet... And then he has the total moral high ground, because he used to... Bingo.
[01:54:15.607 --> 01:54:16.967]  We used to criticize China.
[01:54:16.967 --> 01:54:18.848]  Once Obama got in, nothing.
[01:54:18.848 --> 01:54:23.649]  Two million Uyghurs taken to the other side of the country, enslaved, many of them killed.
[01:54:24.673 --> 01:54:26.314]  We have the moral high ground.
[01:54:26.314 --> 01:54:27.615]  That's what you're saying is so key.
[01:54:27.615 --> 01:54:34.759]  If he attaches the tariffs to moral issues... I mean, hell, Hollywood, if you don't let them kill babies after they're born, won't come to Georgia.
[01:54:34.759 --> 01:54:35.960]  That's a false moral issue.
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.360]  False moral equivalency.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:37.981]  But with this...
[01:54:39.141 --> 01:54:42.124]  We have the moral high ground with the EU, with China.
[01:54:42.124 --> 01:54:47.528]  If you don't support free speech, and you arrest people for their political views, we're going to lay tariffs on your ass.
[01:54:47.528 --> 01:54:50.451]  And there's nothing the leftist politicos can say.
[01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:53.554]  Trump needs to drop that bloody hammer now.
[01:54:53.554 --> 01:54:54.074]  That's right.
[01:54:54.074 --> 01:54:57.557]  And if he needs an act of Congress to make that happen, then guess what?
[01:54:57.557 --> 01:55:02.442]  Be Santa Claus, make the list, show and demonstrate who the people are that are against that idea.
[01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:04.943]  Because that's the ones we need to unelect.
[01:55:04.943 --> 01:55:06.564]  And you were asking me about predictions or whatever.
[01:55:06.564 --> 01:55:08.065]  Well, let me say this right now.
[01:55:08.065 --> 01:55:10.087]  Folks, the 2020 election... Hold on, stay there.
[01:55:10.087 --> 01:55:13.209]  We're going to get your epic predictions next hour.
[01:55:13.209 --> 01:55:14.209]  You'll be with us for 30 minutes.
[01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:18.332]  If Leo Zegami gets here on time, because I know how planes are, he just was landing soon.
[01:55:18.332 --> 01:55:19.833]  He's down the street.
[01:55:19.833 --> 01:55:23.636]  And then I've got the special report we shot that's been two days in the making.
[01:55:23.636 --> 01:55:28.479]  Our emergency message to the President slash inside the July 11th White House summit.
[01:55:29.059 --> 01:55:31.340]  That's going to premiere here at the start of the fourth hour.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:32.861]  Mike Adams is cool with that.
[01:55:32.861 --> 01:55:39.304]  Mike will be here 15 minutes after with huge, I mean, huge breaking news that ties right into what we were just mentioning.
[01:55:39.304 --> 01:55:48.768]  Bombshell, Google to block, alt, alternative anti-cancer sites, anti-vax, and anti-GMO websites at browser level.
[01:55:48.768 --> 01:55:51.790]  Shutting down consumer reports.
[01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:52.250]  You name it.
[01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:54.271]  This is so incredibly dangerous.
[01:55:54.271 --> 01:55:55.411]  We're going to be breaking it all down.
[01:55:55.411 --> 01:55:56.272]  And please don't forget.
[01:55:57.102 --> 01:56:02.385]  It's your financial support that allows me to go to Congress and confront the head of Google and yell at him.
[01:56:02.385 --> 01:56:03.586]  You're in bed with China.
[01:56:03.586 --> 01:56:04.787]  You're going to get broken up.
[01:56:04.787 --> 01:56:06.088]  You're the traitor.
[01:56:06.088 --> 01:56:09.670]  And the Congress people were nodding their heads, and the police were nodding their heads.
[01:56:09.670 --> 01:56:11.931]  And that was seen by hundreds of millions of people.
[01:56:11.931 --> 01:56:14.193]  Every major Google employee watched it.
[01:56:14.193 --> 01:56:16.474]  I'm going to go confront them all at these hearings coming up.
[01:56:16.474 --> 01:56:17.895]  I'm going to be at all the other hearings.
[01:56:17.895 --> 01:56:18.855]  Let's just be honest.
[01:56:18.855 --> 01:56:20.216]  Risking my life, folks.
[01:56:20.216 --> 01:56:21.157]  Because believe me, they are.
[01:56:21.577 --> 01:56:22.817]  Mega pissed right now.
[01:56:22.817 --> 01:56:24.278]  But I told you you've got my commitment.
[01:56:24.278 --> 01:56:25.558]  I'm not backing down.
[01:56:25.558 --> 01:56:26.818]  I'm not giving in.
[01:56:26.818 --> 01:56:29.118]  I'm not laying down, but I could give out.
[01:56:29.118 --> 01:56:31.599]  And you've seen what they're trying to set us up for felonies now.
[01:56:31.599 --> 01:56:37.540]  And that's one of the last things they do before... So we need to be strong going into this.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:42.421]  Whether we're going to make it through it, or whether it's a strong finish, the fight goes on without me or without InfoWars.
[01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:45.161]  But you need to understand, we are in dire straits.
[01:56:45.161 --> 01:56:45.782]  Everybody is.
[01:56:45.782 --> 01:56:46.602]  Our children are.
[01:56:46.602 --> 01:56:47.182]  Our country is.
[01:56:47.182 --> 01:56:48.082]  We're in a hell of a fight.
[01:56:48.482 --> 01:56:48.982]  That's right.
[01:56:48.982 --> 01:56:51.104]  Alex Jones, you signed your John Hancock.
[01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:53.726]  This man has signed his John Hancock, folks.
[01:56:53.726 --> 01:56:58.089]  He needs millions of people on AutoShip for the InfoWars store.
[01:56:58.089 --> 01:57:00.310]  AutoShip, millions of people, InfoWars store.
[01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:01.811]  Money is what wins wars.
[01:57:01.811 --> 01:57:03.212]  And guts and commitment.
[01:57:03.212 --> 01:57:04.453]  But money is the basis of it.
[01:57:04.453 --> 01:57:05.874]  You have to have material.
[01:57:05.874 --> 01:57:06.855]  You have to have the people.
[01:57:06.855 --> 01:57:07.915]  I want to expand.
[01:57:07.915 --> 01:57:08.776]  I want to fight.
[01:57:08.776 --> 01:57:09.757]  I want to win.
[01:57:09.757 --> 01:57:13.619]  And not spend all my time trying to cut costs here or find money there.
[01:57:13.619 --> 01:57:15.781]  And I spend half my time trying to fund things.
[01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:17.282]  I used to spend 20% of my time.
[01:57:17.762 --> 01:57:20.743]  Boy, I wish I spent more time back when we could make more money, because then I'd have it saved up.
[01:57:20.743 --> 01:57:21.644]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:57:21.644 --> 01:57:27.447]  The point is, is that we need a lot of money, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% off all the supplements.
[01:57:27.447 --> 01:57:28.747]  Get your fish roll with us.
[01:57:28.747 --> 01:57:31.088]  Get your great fish roll with us.
[01:57:31.088 --> 01:57:32.569]  Get your great turmeric with us.
[01:57:32.569 --> 01:57:36.130]  Get everything at InfoWorksStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:42.874]  And get the collector's edition Space Force shirt, ladies and gentlemen, with the evil American flag on the right shoulder.
[01:57:42.874 --> 01:57:43.594]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.594 --> 01:57:45.615]  Hour number three with Richard Reeves.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:48.881]  There is no longer any doubt.
[01:57:48.881 --> 01:57:54.764]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[01:57:54.764 --> 01:57:56.845]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[01:57:56.845 --> 01:57:58.405]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[01:57:58.405 --> 01:57:59.546]  World government is here.
[01:57:59.546 --> 01:58:00.886]  Now is the time for decision.
[01:58:00.886 --> 01:58:03.928]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[01:58:03.928 --> 01:58:14.173]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag, and attacking the family, and that are attacking our borders, and our country, and our military, and our heritage, if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[01:58:14.173 --> 01:58:16.194]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[01:58:16.434 --> 01:58:19.236]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:19.236 --> 01:58:21.118]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[01:58:21.118 --> 01:58:22.199]  And praying for President Trump.
[01:58:22.199 --> 01:58:23.119]  And praying for yourself.
[01:58:23.119 --> 01:58:24.180]  And praying for peace.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.321]  Praying for justice.
[01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:27.663]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.
[01:58:27.663 --> 01:58:29.424]  Because we're running out of a lot of the best-selling items.
[01:58:29.424 --> 01:58:31.566]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[01:58:31.566 --> 01:58:33.247]  Store-wide free shipping.
[01:58:33.247 --> 01:58:35.389]  50% off all the supplements and double Patriot points.
[01:58:35.389 --> 01:58:36.330]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:36.990]  Cancel any time.
[01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.551]  It's free.
[01:58:37.551 --> 01:58:39.472]  An additional 10% off on your next order.
[01:58:39.472 --> 01:58:41.073]  You cannot beat these deals.
[01:58:41.073 --> 01:58:44.896]  The best we ever offer at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:48.387 --> 01:58:49.728]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:49.728 --> 01:58:50.508]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:50.508 --> 01:58:51.088]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.088 --> 01:58:51.609]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:51.609 --> 01:58:54.430]  Yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:54.430 --> 01:59:00.554]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:59:00.554 --> 01:59:08.658]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[01:59:08.658 --> 01:59:09.339]  The approaching 2020.
[01:59:09.339 --> 01:59:10.299]  That's it.
[01:59:10.299 --> 01:59:13.161]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:13.161 --> 01:59:16.002]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:16.002 --> 01:59:17.283]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.463 --> 01:59:18.203]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:18.203 --> 01:59:23.645]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.645 --> 01:59:26.426]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:26.426 --> 01:59:28.506]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.506 --> 01:59:37.749]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.749 --> 01:59:39.650]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:46.132]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.132 --> 01:59:47.072]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:55.852]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:55.852 --> 01:59:58.613]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[01:59:58.613 --> 02:00:03.935]  Guaranteed.
[02:00:03.935 --> 02:00:12.758]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[02:00:12.758 --> 02:00:18.000]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.360]  Sundar!
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:28.286]  You know Google is helping China with Dragonfly, and you know that they're helping censor, and you know that you've sold this country out, and you won't even help the Pentagon, but you'll help the CHICOMS.
[02:00:28.286 --> 02:00:30.067]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar!
[02:00:30.067 --> 02:00:36.331]  We're aware of his lying to Congress, we're aware of him and the Dragonfly project that's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[02:00:36.331 --> 02:00:37.832]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[02:00:37.832 --> 02:00:38.872]  Sundar!
[02:00:38.872 --> 02:00:40.633]  You're engaged in treason!
[02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:43.535]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress that you're not censoring conservatives!
[02:00:43.635 --> 02:00:56.660]  The big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing, to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:01.841]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[02:01:01.841 --> 02:01:06.243]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[02:01:06.363 --> 02:01:07.884]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[02:01:07.884 --> 02:01:09.865]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[02:01:09.865 --> 02:01:12.367]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[02:01:12.367 --> 02:01:13.868]  Google is evil!
[02:01:13.868 --> 02:01:15.349]  Google is evil!
[02:01:15.349 --> 02:01:16.690]  Google is evil!
[02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:22.494]  Twitter is planning to permanently suspend Alex Jones' personal account at InfoWars.
[02:01:22.494 --> 02:01:27.957]  This comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was on Capitol Hill yesterday speaking with lawmakers.
[02:01:27.957 --> 02:01:30.339]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[02:01:30.339 --> 02:01:35.823]  The social networking site permanently banning he and his media company, InfoWars.
[02:01:36.543 --> 02:01:40.704]  I appreciate your support of the First Amendment, but I have a right to face my accusers, Jack!
[02:01:40.704 --> 02:01:43.305]  They're lying about me, and they're trying to de-platform me.
[02:01:43.305 --> 02:01:46.365]  26 companies working in concert violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:51.887]  And now, Senator Warner and Senator Wyden have said, quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex Jones.
[02:01:51.887 --> 02:01:55.388]  So, we're becoming like Cuba, we're becoming like Vietnam, we're becoming like China.
[02:01:55.388 --> 02:02:05.090]  So regardless of what people think about me or the straw men, should I have a First Amendment, or should these companies be able to violate the whole Safe Harbor Act and all that, and then ban conservatives en masse?
[02:02:06.493 --> 02:02:07.933]  Yeah, I don't know anything about your site, man.
[02:02:07.933 --> 02:02:13.154]  And we're also standing up to social media censorship.
[02:02:13.154 --> 02:02:14.255]  That's the new thing.
[02:02:14.255 --> 02:02:20.236]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[02:02:20.236 --> 02:02:21.276]  That's weird, man.
[02:02:21.276 --> 02:02:21.996]  Oh, yeah, it's really weird.
[02:02:21.996 --> 02:02:23.176]  There's no purge of conservatives?
[02:02:23.176 --> 02:02:24.377]  There's no shadow banning?
[02:02:24.377 --> 02:02:27.117]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:02:27.117 --> 02:02:27.677]  Yeah, who's this guy?
[02:02:27.677 --> 02:02:28.418]  Who'd he play for?
[02:02:28.418 --> 02:02:30.318]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:02:30.558 --> 02:02:33.320]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:37.662]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... It's happening here, but you said I don't exist.
[02:02:37.662 --> 02:02:39.704]  Is that a heckler or a pressagaggle?
[02:02:39.704 --> 02:02:40.404]  Look at this guy.
[02:02:40.404 --> 02:02:42.285]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[02:02:42.285 --> 02:02:43.846]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[02:02:43.846 --> 02:02:45.087]  I don't read all your websites.
[02:02:45.087 --> 02:02:47.568]  You're the farangy ambassador in these very hearings.
[02:02:47.568 --> 02:02:48.509]  And then he plays dumb.
[02:02:48.829 --> 02:02:55.612]  Here's the question, do you think that, does Google, does Facebook, does Twitter, do they need to be regulated like, do they need to be regulated?
[02:02:55.612 --> 02:02:56.172]  Who are you?
[02:02:56.172 --> 02:02:58.613]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are man.
[02:03:05.336 --> 02:03:05.897]  InfoWars.
[02:03:05.897 --> 02:03:07.139]  Better than Rush Limbaugh?
[02:03:07.139 --> 02:03:08.500]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:09.562]  Look at this joke over here.
[02:03:09.562 --> 02:03:10.984]  That's why the deplatforming didn't work.
[02:03:10.984 --> 02:03:15.590]  The most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:19.715]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him,
[02:03:20.615 --> 02:03:21.896]  Prevent them from speaking!
[02:03:21.896 --> 02:03:25.358]  On Twitter, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story.
[02:03:25.358 --> 02:03:31.583]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[02:03:31.583 --> 02:03:32.804]  The system self-corrected.
[02:03:32.804 --> 02:03:35.686]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[02:03:35.686 --> 02:03:39.108]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[02:03:39.108 --> 02:03:40.109]  But you saw this.
[02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:41.269]  USA Today.
[02:03:41.269 --> 02:03:42.150]  At lunch I did.
[02:03:42.150 --> 02:03:44.332]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[02:03:44.992 --> 02:03:48.955]  Today... CNN and the Democrats you know are destroying the First Amendment and needs to be stood up again.
[02:04:03.806 --> 02:04:04.026]  Yes.
[02:04:04.026 --> 02:04:11.069]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:12.149]  Look at this right here.
[02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:19.592]  The guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[02:04:19.592 --> 02:04:20.012]  You are.
[02:04:20.612 --> 02:04:21.613]  It's incredibly shameful.
[02:04:21.613 --> 02:04:22.374]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:04:22.374 --> 02:04:24.036]  You're just a... Look at you.
[02:04:24.036 --> 02:04:28.420]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:38.211]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[02:04:47.116 --> 02:04:51.800]  We'll be back with massive breaking news on so many fronts it makes my head literally spin.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:56.745]  Whatever you do, share the legs.
[02:04:56.745 --> 02:05:00.408]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:05:00.851 --> 02:05:11.256]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:05:11.256 --> 02:05:16.079]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[02:05:16.079 --> 02:05:30.566]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[02:05:30.706 --> 02:05:39.875]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[02:05:39.875 --> 02:05:48.463]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:05:48.463 --> 02:05:51.786]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[02:05:51.786 --> 02:05:55.169]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:05:56.741 --> 02:05:59.642]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[02:05:59.642 --> 02:06:01.882]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:06:01.882 --> 02:06:03.903]  Why are they doing this now?
[02:06:03.903 --> 02:06:09.084]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[02:06:09.084 --> 02:06:17.726]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:06:17.726 --> 02:06:22.707]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[02:06:23.007 --> 02:06:26.908]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[02:06:26.908 --> 02:06:35.750]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:37.291]  I have no issue with it at all.
[02:06:37.291 --> 02:06:38.391]  I want them shut down.
[02:06:38.391 --> 02:06:39.351]  I want them silenced.
[02:06:39.351 --> 02:06:40.171]  I want them muted.
[02:06:40.171 --> 02:06:43.332]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:06:43.332 --> 02:06:44.712]  I want them shut down!
[02:06:44.712 --> 02:06:46.293]  I want them silenced!
[02:06:46.293 --> 02:06:47.533]  I want them muted!
[02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:48.773]  But don't worry.
[02:06:48.773 --> 02:06:50.494]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:06:53.291 --> 02:07:01.894]  These people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[02:07:01.894 --> 02:07:07.075]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[02:07:07.075 --> 02:07:13.277]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[02:07:15.265 --> 02:07:17.727]  Stand up and give that a standing ovation.
[02:07:17.727 --> 02:07:21.809]  Rodericka, thank you so much for uncloaking to that level.
[02:07:21.809 --> 02:07:25.432]  And we know you've got a lot of cohorts in Congress that think just like you do.
[02:07:25.432 --> 02:07:26.773]  Man, I tell you what.
[02:07:26.773 --> 02:07:30.155]  If they don't get fired in 2020, it's our fault, not theirs.
[02:07:30.155 --> 02:07:32.397]  Let me ask you a question, Richard.
[02:07:32.397 --> 02:07:33.737]  You've made a lot of great predictions.
[02:07:33.737 --> 02:07:35.118]  You're a great political analyst.
[02:07:35.118 --> 02:07:37.220]  Been a friend of mine for 18 years.
[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:43.164]  Worked here at Infowars until you moved back to Fort Worth to take care of your elderly mother and then came back down here.
[02:07:47.126 --> 02:08:01.853]  Why are they coming out saying everywhere, we are going to confiscate your guns, we are going to take them, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Democratic debates, we are going to give all the illegal aliens everything free, free health care, free housing, free tuition, no one will all go bankrupt.
[02:08:01.853 --> 02:08:11.057]  Saying America sucks, saying the American flag sucks, all these major newspapers last week defended pedophilia and defended this guy when he came out and said, you know, that
[02:08:12.276 --> 02:08:13.918]  Sex with kids is great.
[02:08:13.918 --> 02:08:17.701]  Pedophile convicted child porn peddler says Desmond is amazing and is hot.
[02:08:17.701 --> 02:08:20.704]  I can't even read this stuff on air.
[02:08:20.704 --> 02:08:24.708]  Miley Cyrus is putting stuff out about Satanism and total death and you know.
[02:08:26.082 --> 02:08:32.385]  Being hell on earth, and it's not like Motley Crue trying to act cute or something.
[02:08:32.385 --> 02:08:39.209]  The energy of this, it's all ugly, it's gross, it's like sex with deformed people.
[02:08:39.209 --> 02:08:41.730]  It's real satanic type stuff.
[02:08:41.730 --> 02:08:46.712]  Real wallowing in evil, and it's all just busting out.
[02:08:46.712 --> 02:08:53.756]  I think it's because they know they're behind schedule, globalism's in trouble, so they're trying to finish all of what they had planned right at once, hoping we just give up.
[02:08:54.645 --> 02:08:56.506]  Right, Alex, I agree with you on that.
[02:08:56.506 --> 02:08:57.967]  I think we are at a jump point.
[02:08:57.967 --> 02:09:08.171]  We're either going to push back the New World Order right now and push them in the future two or three centuries, who knows how far, or it is going to come to fruition within the next 10 to 20 years.
[02:09:08.171 --> 02:09:11.633]  And so they're so arrogant, they're so cocky and overconfident right now.
[02:09:11.633 --> 02:09:12.474]  Thankfully so.
[02:09:12.474 --> 02:09:15.875]  I think it's to their detriment that they're this cocky and arrogant.
[02:09:15.875 --> 02:09:17.896]  But they think that they're going to bring this on in.
[02:09:17.896 --> 02:09:20.457]  They think they're going to bring their beast system in.
[02:09:20.457 --> 02:09:23.499]  Hence, that's why they're doing this rapid fire
[02:09:24.259 --> 02:09:26.561]  Attack on everything, First Amendment, you name it.
[02:09:26.561 --> 02:09:28.022]  All this stuff that's going on.
[02:09:28.022 --> 02:09:30.845]  The child molestation, the pedophilia, etc.
[02:09:30.845 --> 02:09:32.586]  It's all part of that system.
[02:09:32.586 --> 02:09:34.768]  They think they're going to make it come to fruition.
[02:09:34.768 --> 02:09:35.729]  I think we're going to win.
[02:09:35.729 --> 02:09:36.869]  I think we're going to push them back.
[02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:38.771]  I think we're going to push them into the future.
[02:09:38.771 --> 02:09:44.616]  I think, hey, the Bible says their day comes one day that they're going to have their B system for a day.
[02:09:44.616 --> 02:09:47.198]  Like you said, it's about a year's period of time.
[02:09:47.198 --> 02:09:50.380]  But I say, hey, the Bible doesn't say when it happens.
[02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:52.942]  I think it's only when evil totally overcomes us all.
[02:09:52.942 --> 02:09:53.483]  It's all a test.
[02:09:53.863 --> 02:09:54.323]  Right.
[02:09:54.323 --> 02:09:55.283]  It's a test.
[02:09:55.283 --> 02:09:55.763]  It's a test.
[02:09:55.763 --> 02:09:58.684]  So we've got a chance to push it all back, and we're a jump on it.
[02:09:58.684 --> 02:10:01.185]  You signed your John Hancock, like I said.
[02:10:01.185 --> 02:10:14.048]  I think at this point, you and Donald Trump are key players on the planet to bring the First Amendment to the world, and I think the biggest offensive thing we can do is bring the First Amendment to the whole world.
[02:10:14.048 --> 02:10:17.749]  The whole world should be able to go on to Google or YouTube or
[02:10:18.469 --> 02:10:24.674]  Uh, new websites that need to pop up, I mean, with these tariffs generated from the First Amendment issue.
[02:10:24.674 --> 02:10:33.500]  We could have a government system that's like the post office, and then the only check on it is lawsuit judgments or law enforcement, just like with the mail.
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:35.921]  Everything goes through, they can't stop unless it's illegal.
[02:10:35.921 --> 02:10:36.262]  Exactly.
[02:10:36.262 --> 02:10:37.623]  I never said I wanted government.
[02:10:38.823 --> 02:10:41.004]  But we already have Google's bigger than the government.
[02:10:41.004 --> 02:10:41.664]  Right, right.
[02:10:41.664 --> 02:10:42.704]  See, that's another thing too.
[02:10:42.704 --> 02:10:43.925]  It's its own system.
[02:10:43.925 --> 02:10:47.846]  We should consider Google, YouTube, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, etc.
[02:10:47.846 --> 02:10:49.766]  We should consider them countries.
[02:10:49.766 --> 02:10:58.288]  We should consider right now enemy combatant countries, foreign and domestic countries that are here actively fighting against the American way.
[02:10:58.288 --> 02:10:59.349]  But you made a great point.
[02:10:59.349 --> 02:11:04.130]  If the post office, oh this is, Trump is talking about competing groups.
[02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:07.051]  He's really having this summit that I'll document next hour.
[02:11:07.931 --> 02:11:08.471]  I don't
[02:11:31.894 --> 02:11:40.464]  You already saw Pascal, the head of the campaign, endorse Parler, which is a good, nice, mainline, conservative Twitter, but they'll let liberals on there.
[02:11:40.464 --> 02:11:47.012]  As long as you're not pushing porn or trying to kill people or doing illegal stuff, you're on there, like Twitter used to be 10 years ago.
[02:11:49.255 --> 02:11:50.096]  That is genius.
[02:11:50.096 --> 02:11:54.598]  We need to say, hey, post office, we don't want you to do banking.
[02:11:54.598 --> 02:11:56.299]  We don't want you to do all this other stuff.
[02:11:56.299 --> 02:11:58.881]  But post office was always about communication.
[02:11:58.881 --> 02:12:04.084]  And so instead of it being just 50 characters or 100 characters, it can be a paragraph.
[02:12:04.084 --> 02:12:05.485]  It can be 100 paragraphs.
[02:12:05.485 --> 02:12:06.746]  It can be two words.
[02:12:06.746 --> 02:12:09.488]  But what if Trump proposes the post office?
[02:12:10.228 --> 02:12:24.076]  To launch something, which literally you could run for like a billion dollars a year, it would have advertising on it, it would be super successful, no political correctness, no liberal, no conservative, it would just be basically, it was illegal.
[02:12:24.076 --> 02:12:27.779]  And then the government could run, and people are probably saying, you don't want government.
[02:12:27.779 --> 02:12:27.979]  No, no, no.
[02:12:29.062 --> 02:12:31.024]  This is the counterbalance to them.
[02:12:31.024 --> 02:12:33.527]  Impromptu just announces something like that.
[02:12:33.527 --> 02:12:34.888]  Twitter's stock will tank.
[02:12:34.888 --> 02:12:39.233]  I'd much rather him endorse some new conservative group that will still allow free speech.
[02:12:39.233 --> 02:12:42.777]  But conservatives have a problem with free speech sometimes, especially super right wing ones.
[02:12:44.198 --> 02:12:46.400]  But man, what if the post office came out?
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:47.701]  Because they're doing letters.
[02:12:47.701 --> 02:12:50.844]  Well, the post office should be in digital communication.
[02:12:50.844 --> 02:12:52.826]  The NSA is already reading all the damn mail.
[02:12:52.826 --> 02:12:55.209]  Have them pledge to stop reading it.
[02:12:55.209 --> 02:12:56.450]  Only public stuff would be read.
[02:12:56.450 --> 02:13:00.194]  And then literally have the post office get into digital communications.
[02:13:01.314 --> 02:13:03.276]  And they can be encrypted by the US government?
[02:13:03.276 --> 02:13:05.318]  You have a higher standard where you pay for it?
[02:13:05.318 --> 02:13:06.879]  And then you get encryption?
[02:13:06.879 --> 02:13:07.360]  Absolutely.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.345]  There should be public and private efforts to reopen the web.
[02:13:12.345 --> 02:13:14.487]  I don't think anybody's proposed what we just said.
[02:13:14.487 --> 02:13:14.827]  Right.
[02:13:14.827 --> 02:13:16.208]  Me leapfrogging off your idea.
[02:13:16.208 --> 02:13:17.770]  Me building on your idea, Richard.
[02:13:17.770 --> 02:13:22.394]  Hey guys, search engine, have the post office run its own Twitter.
[02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:24.416]  And people say, well the post office can't get anything done.
[02:13:24.416 --> 02:13:25.718]  That's a bunch of propaganda, folks.
[02:13:27.122 --> 02:13:34.306]  FedEx and UPS get subsidized by the USPS not charging enough.
[02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:39.169]  And so all of that subsidizing to that ends up basically helping them.
[02:13:39.169 --> 02:13:40.950]  And again, I'm not against free market things either.
[02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:43.652]  I'm just saying we're in a new world, a new system.
[02:13:43.652 --> 02:13:50.996]  You want to make the post office profitable, have it get in to things like Twitter and it can have its own social
[02:13:51.716 --> 02:13:54.777]  Media system where if you don't break the law, you can do anything you want on here.
[02:13:54.777 --> 02:13:58.278]  It would be just like when the government set out west.
[02:13:58.278 --> 02:14:07.861]  Anybody that can get out to Oregon, anybody that can get out to California, anybody that can get out to Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, you can get a thousand acres.
[02:14:07.861 --> 02:14:11.622]  Back in the day it was a thousand, then it got cut down to fifty or whatever you could stake off.
[02:14:11.622 --> 02:14:15.023]  That wasn't government involved, that was government getting out of the way.
[02:14:15.023 --> 02:14:17.564]  And you know how easy the government could launch its own Twitter?
[02:14:18.545 --> 02:14:19.567]  And then it can be secure?
[02:14:19.567 --> 02:14:21.970]  The military can use it?
[02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:23.453]  Again, we need that!
[02:14:23.453 --> 02:14:24.094]  We do need it.
[02:14:24.094 --> 02:14:27.019]  We do need it in public and private format, just like we talked about.
[02:14:27.019 --> 02:14:31.886]  And then if China or anybody didn't let our system in, we would then put tariffs on them!
[02:14:32.876 --> 02:14:33.377]  Absolutely.
[02:14:33.377 --> 02:14:35.218]  It'd be like the real Voice of America.
[02:14:35.218 --> 02:14:35.979]  Yes.
[02:14:35.979 --> 02:14:36.859]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:14:36.859 --> 02:14:39.562]  And that's what we call Voice of America.
[02:14:39.562 --> 02:14:40.362]  Voice of America.
[02:14:40.362 --> 02:14:42.084]  The digital Voice of America.
[02:14:42.084 --> 02:14:44.646]  We should be exporting our Bill of Rights.
[02:14:44.646 --> 02:14:48.629]  We should be definitely keeping them here, but we're the major manufacturer of the Bill of Rights right here.
[02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.829]  1776 worldwide.
[02:14:50.351 --> 02:14:51.973]  1776 worldwide.
[02:14:51.973 --> 02:14:52.814]  Let's make it happen.
[02:14:52.814 --> 02:14:54.335]  Let's make it come to fruition.
[02:14:54.335 --> 02:14:57.279]  And while we're on this, I want to talk about due process a little bit.
[02:14:57.279 --> 02:15:02.966]  Because the Founding Fathers created this country because of their belief that there was a necessity for due process.
[02:15:02.966 --> 02:15:04.187]  You've got to have due process.
[02:15:04.187 --> 02:15:05.509]  And if we don't do it, who else will?
[02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:07.030]  Yeah, absolutely, if we don't do it.
[02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:11.112]  So you and Trump had the opportunity here to bring the First Amendment worldwide.
[02:15:11.112 --> 02:15:12.793]  We need to talk about due process.
[02:15:12.793 --> 02:15:21.798]  The only reason anybody should be suspended from Twitter, Google, YouTube, or whatever public, you know, like a post office thing, like you're talking about Twitter, is there should be due process.
[02:15:21.798 --> 02:15:22.418]  And you know what?
[02:15:22.418 --> 02:15:23.779]  If it involves the First Amendment,
[02:15:24.239 --> 02:15:36.547]  The government and or the person, entity bringing the charge to have somebody yanked out of that system should be the ones that pay for it and lose their money, not John Q. Citizen having to fix whatever.
[02:15:36.547 --> 02:15:42.311]  I'm just excited by the idea of the Post Office coming out with its own Twitter and its own Facebook.
[02:15:42.311 --> 02:15:43.191]  Oh my gosh.
[02:15:43.191 --> 02:15:44.752]  That would make them so profitable too.
[02:15:44.752 --> 02:15:46.394]  We need that counterbalance.
[02:15:46.394 --> 02:15:47.734]  The Post Office is a great invention.
[02:15:47.734 --> 02:15:49.496]  We need to bring it back digitally.
[02:15:49.496 --> 02:15:50.036]  Stay with us.

[02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:57.901]  The time has come.
[02:18:57.901 --> 02:18:58.882]  The time is here.
[02:18:58.882 --> 02:19:10.913]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[02:19:10.913 --> 02:19:22.483]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[02:19:22.543 --> 02:19:22.843]  We're good.
[02:19:44.648 --> 02:19:46.570]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:28.704 --> 02:20:33.189]  Right now!
[02:20:33.189 --> 02:20:41.558]  I'm standing up against those that are destroying this country as we speak!
[02:20:41.558 --> 02:20:44.581]  And why am I fired up?
[02:20:44.581 --> 02:20:46.143]  Because this is war!
[02:20:46.143 --> 02:20:49.947]  Absolute, unabated, total war against our nation!
[02:20:51.232 --> 02:20:52.393]  We bring life.
[02:20:52.393 --> 02:20:53.514]  We bring death.
[02:20:53.514 --> 02:20:54.455]  We are men.
[02:20:54.455 --> 02:20:55.396]  We are women.
[02:20:55.396 --> 02:20:56.518]  We are the humans.
[02:20:56.518 --> 02:20:57.639]  We are the planet.
[02:20:57.639 --> 02:20:59.040]  We are God's creation.
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.483]  We are the future.
[02:21:01.483 --> 02:21:02.644]  Not you!
[02:21:02.644 --> 02:21:03.004]  Death!
[02:21:03.004 --> 02:21:03.725]  Death!
[02:21:03.725 --> 02:21:07.569]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:21:07.569 --> 02:21:08.811]  We don't fear death!
[02:21:08.811 --> 02:21:13.476]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:21:14.196 --> 02:21:22.590]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[02:21:40.283 --> 02:21:42.885]  Crashing for lies and disinformation.
[02:21:42.885 --> 02:21:47.087]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:21:47.087 --> 02:21:55.052]  All right, next segment I'm going to go through the video I've been talking about inside the terrorist planning sessions.
[02:21:55.052 --> 02:22:00.675]  Undercover video of Antifa and DC planning the acid attacks and the next terror launches.
[02:22:00.675 --> 02:22:02.656]  Also a famous
[02:22:04.907 --> 02:22:14.170]  Black rap group, hip-hop group, was in Europe and didn't know that they were doing a show in an El Gozón and Islamics tried to attack them.
[02:22:14.170 --> 02:22:17.331]  And, again, these guys might weigh 120 pounds.
[02:22:17.331 --> 02:22:24.032]  And one of these black guys weighs about 300 pounds.
[02:22:24.032 --> 02:22:25.433]  And the other black guys are good size too.
[02:22:25.433 --> 02:22:27.854]  They beg them to stop hitting them.
[02:22:27.854 --> 02:22:29.154]  And then they hurt them bad.
[02:22:30.572 --> 02:22:37.756]  But in this is a riddle that explains everything about the mouse conquering the lion.
[02:22:37.756 --> 02:22:45.160]  Because Europeans bend over so much, these guys literally thought they were King Kong when they were going up against a guy built like King Kong.
[02:22:46.164 --> 02:22:55.847]  It shows how they're totally disconnected from reality, but our groveling to Kaepernick and the system and the left, and we bow to everything they say, makes them believe they're invincible.
[02:22:55.847 --> 02:22:58.167]  That's why they're saying, OK, we're going to have sex with your kids.
[02:22:58.167 --> 02:22:59.508]  OK, we're going to take your guns.
[02:22:59.508 --> 02:23:00.748]  OK, we're going to arrest you.
[02:23:00.748 --> 02:23:01.808]  OK, we're communists.
[02:23:01.808 --> 02:23:03.509]  OK, we hate America.
[02:23:03.509 --> 02:23:08.690]  Because they in their own Seattle and San Francisco and some areas of New York bubble,
[02:23:10.014 --> 02:23:10.674]  Are in control.
[02:23:28.835 --> 02:23:30.956]  Seven and a half, eight years, when we went to Grand Canyon.
[02:23:30.956 --> 02:23:31.637]  Right.
[02:23:31.637 --> 02:23:40.842]  And I remember getting annoyed because I thought of Trump as a TV guy and the apprentice and owning casinos and having orange hair and, you know, acting confident.
[02:23:40.842 --> 02:23:43.644]  And I'll be honest, I'm turned off by establishment stuff.
[02:23:43.644 --> 02:23:45.325]  I didn't understand it was a brand Trump was pushing.
[02:23:45.865 --> 02:23:48.246]  And you're like, no, Trump's really a good guy and blah, blah, blah.
[02:23:48.246 --> 02:23:49.326]  And he knows Ronald Reagan.
[02:23:49.326 --> 02:23:50.786]  You know, see him in these Oprah interviews.
[02:23:50.786 --> 02:23:52.207]  And I'm telling you, he's going to run.
[02:23:52.207 --> 02:23:53.587]  When Obama gets out, he's going to win.
[02:23:53.587 --> 02:23:57.628]  And I knew you were smart back then, but we'd be driving, you know, 10 hours a day somewhere.
[02:23:57.628 --> 02:24:00.249]  And I'd just say, Richard, shut up.
[02:24:00.249 --> 02:24:00.909]  OK?
[02:24:00.909 --> 02:24:02.230]  He hangs out with the Clintons.
[02:24:03.294 --> 02:24:06.276]  And then even when he started running at first, I'm like, I don't know, I don't know.
[02:24:06.276 --> 02:24:07.637]  You're like, no, I'm telling you he's good.
[02:24:07.637 --> 02:24:12.520]  And so I looked into it, learned about the John Birch Society and his dad and all the rest of it.
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:12.880]  I said, OK.
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:14.161]  And then I had a good feeling about it.
[02:24:14.161 --> 02:24:16.682]  And then, you know, he's delivered pretty much now.
[02:24:16.682 --> 02:24:22.126]  But then you made a lot of predictions about how the delegates would go, how they'd try to steal them before anybody else did.
[02:24:22.126 --> 02:24:23.907]  And even then I'm like, oh, yeah, right, Richard.
[02:24:23.907 --> 02:24:25.228]  The Democrats would never dare do that.
[02:24:25.228 --> 02:24:26.448]  They did all that.
[02:24:26.448 --> 02:24:29.130]  So by the middle of the campaign, I was believing everything you said.
[02:24:29.130 --> 02:24:30.531]  It turned out to be damn accurate.
[02:24:30.791 --> 02:24:33.634]  Well, it was tomorrow's news today, like we talk about.
[02:24:33.634 --> 02:24:46.848]  I mean, you had me on with Rob Doo in December of 2015, I believe, and that's when we called out all this stuff that they're going to pull out all the stops on trying to cheat Donald Trump out of the nomination and out of... You explained how they do it.
[02:24:46.848 --> 02:24:48.350]  And we talked about it.
[02:24:48.350 --> 02:24:50.172]  That's just like... We didn't talk about it.
[02:24:50.172 --> 02:24:51.833]  You called it exactly how it happened.
[02:24:52.834 --> 02:24:53.835]  It was like you say, though.
[02:24:53.835 --> 02:24:56.657]  If you study how they do things, then you can figure it out.
[02:24:56.657 --> 02:25:07.364]  That's like, I came on with Owen Schroer directly after the 2018 election, and we talked about that, hey, the Democrats getting a little bit of power in the Congress, in the U.S.
[02:25:07.364 --> 02:25:12.987]  Congress, is probably going to make them act crazy and go crazy, and here they are, Frederica Wilson, going crazy.
[02:25:12.987 --> 02:25:13.648]  So, hey, listen.
[02:25:14.168 --> 02:25:20.951]  Shifting topics real quick though, you played the Marco Rubio thing a little while ago, and I just got to call out Marco Rubio for ring ambassador.
[02:25:20.951 --> 02:25:24.493]  You are an anti-American piece of crap!
[02:25:24.493 --> 02:25:30.756]  I mean, the thing of it is, is that he sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Alex.
[02:25:30.756 --> 02:25:35.759]  You know, what are they doing on the Senate Intelligence Committee not knowing what's going on?
[02:25:35.759 --> 02:25:38.580]  The biggest attack on the First Amendment is happening with
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:41.081]  I know nothing about attacks on free speech.
[02:25:41.081 --> 02:25:41.421]  Exactly.
[02:25:41.421 --> 02:25:45.722]  I don't know who you are, even though Marco Rubio obviously knows who I am.
[02:25:45.722 --> 02:25:49.103]  What he's saying is we've shadow banned you, you don't exist, you're in the Phantom Zone.
[02:25:49.103 --> 02:25:49.363]  Right.
[02:25:49.363 --> 02:25:55.445]  Well, Marco Rubio, if it's true, however it's true that you don't know anything about Infowars or fake or whatever it is,
[02:25:56.005 --> 02:25:58.986]  You're as useful as a screen door on a submarine.
[02:25:58.986 --> 02:26:02.287]  So just resign from the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[02:26:02.287 --> 02:26:04.068]  Resign your Senate seat.
[02:26:04.068 --> 02:26:14.812]  And furthermore, if the other people on the Senate Intelligence Committee are this ignorant about the biggest threat to the First Amendment against the United States probably ever in history, then you should all resign.
[02:26:14.812 --> 02:26:17.573]  Eliminate the committee because you're not doing your job.
[02:26:17.573 --> 02:26:21.054]  And or whoever's bringing you the information is not doing their job.
[02:26:21.534 --> 02:26:23.595]  So, I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:26:23.595 --> 02:26:25.016]  The media never showed the full clip.
[02:26:25.016 --> 02:26:26.077]  There was already a press gaggle.
[02:26:26.077 --> 02:26:27.838]  I was already there.
[02:26:27.838 --> 02:26:31.581]  And then I'm like, hey, what are you going to do about free speech being attacked?
[02:26:31.581 --> 02:26:33.842]  And he just turns and goes, who are you?
[02:26:33.842 --> 02:26:34.602]  I don't know who you are.
[02:26:34.602 --> 02:26:40.186]  And I'm like, OK, but what about the hearings, the free speech being taken when you do something, which now is the biggest issue?
[02:26:40.186 --> 02:26:41.627]  This is like a year ago.
[02:26:41.627 --> 02:26:42.988]  And he just is so arrogant.
[02:26:44.659 --> 02:26:45.700]  He was arrogant.
[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:52.747]  Like I say, to me it's unfathomable that he's trying to get away with pleading ignorance, whether it's legitimate or not.
[02:26:52.747 --> 02:26:53.949]  Either way, it's inexcusable.
[02:26:53.949 --> 02:26:55.230]  He should lose his Senate seat.
[02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:56.711]  He should resign from the committee.
[02:26:56.711 --> 02:27:00.355]  Well, look, him and Glenn Beck and all them, they hook their ponies on to other people.
[02:27:00.355 --> 02:27:02.758]  Everybody hates them, so they've already done it to themselves.
[02:27:02.758 --> 02:27:03.859]  What else you got in your sheet there?
[02:27:04.059 --> 02:27:06.821]  Well, I'd like to thank everybody for their prayers when I was sick.
[02:27:06.821 --> 02:27:13.084]  I really think it made a big difference, and thank y'all for the prayers, and thank you for continued prayers, and pray for InfoWars, pray for Alex.
[02:27:13.084 --> 02:27:13.704]  You're a tough guy.
[02:27:13.704 --> 02:27:17.707]  I mean, it took you over a year and a half, because my dad visited you a lot.
[02:27:17.707 --> 02:27:18.687]  It was rough.
[02:27:18.687 --> 02:27:21.249]  There was a time when I didn't know I was going to walk.
[02:27:21.249 --> 02:27:22.409]  I couldn't even walk.
[02:27:22.409 --> 02:27:24.010]  I had to use one of those... How bad was it?
[02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:25.231]  What kind of heart attack was it?
[02:27:25.231 --> 02:27:27.252]  Well, they were saying I had congestive heart failure.
[02:27:27.252 --> 02:27:30.574]  They said I had five organs on the verge of failing when I went in the hospital.
[02:27:30.574 --> 02:27:32.615]  I required over seven liters of fluids.
[02:27:33.215 --> 02:27:35.196]  Do you know what triggered it?
[02:27:35.196 --> 02:27:36.737]  Well, that's a good question.
[02:27:36.737 --> 02:27:39.098]  I mean, I always... You got run down when you couldn't eat?
[02:27:39.098 --> 02:27:41.460]  Well, yeah, I got run down when I couldn't eat.
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:48.443]  I remember in May of 2016 when I was out there covering the Trump campaign, I told you, hey, I thought I had food poisoning or whatever.
[02:27:48.443 --> 02:27:50.144]  And that's kind of when it all started, you know.
[02:27:50.144 --> 02:27:51.805]  So it took a few months to play out.
[02:27:51.805 --> 02:27:53.906]  But anyway, I'm doing a lot better now.
[02:27:53.906 --> 02:27:55.907]  I have another friend who got food poisoning.
[02:27:55.907 --> 02:27:58.829]  She's in perfect health and all her liver almost failed from it.
[02:27:59.309 --> 02:28:00.991]  Blue Poison is not a game.
[02:28:00.991 --> 02:28:03.953]  That was one of the organs that they said was on the verge of failing.
[02:28:03.953 --> 02:28:05.094]  And you don't even drink!
[02:28:05.094 --> 02:28:06.455]  No, I don't drink hardly at all.
[02:28:06.455 --> 02:28:08.197]  I mean, maybe a casual drink once or twice a week.
[02:28:08.197 --> 02:28:09.818]  I think I've seen you all the years I know you.
[02:28:09.818 --> 02:28:13.001]  Maybe like a birthday or a wedding, have a glass of champagne.
[02:28:13.001 --> 02:28:15.504]  It's just totally a social situation.
[02:28:15.504 --> 02:28:17.185]  Never just on my own.
[02:28:17.185 --> 02:28:19.247]  But I want to thank everybody for their prayers.
[02:28:19.247 --> 02:28:22.189]  And going back into talking about predictions mode or whatever.
[02:28:22.890 --> 02:28:26.872]  What we gotta realize is the 2020 election is now.
[02:28:26.872 --> 02:28:28.872]  The 2020 election is now.
[02:28:28.872 --> 02:28:31.974]  Right now, people are doing their filings for candidates.
[02:28:31.974 --> 02:28:36.095]  We need to have Infowarriors and Patriots filing for candidates, and I know a break's coming up.
[02:28:36.095 --> 02:28:39.717]  We'll talk about it when you come back, and then I'll get to all this other news.
[02:28:39.717 --> 02:28:46.120]  Wait till you see two tiny Islamicist Muslims try to beat up five big black guys.
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:47.220]  It's unbelievable.
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:49.001]  But this is no-go zones in Europe.
[02:28:49.001 --> 02:28:49.381]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.188 --> 02:29:06.377]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:06.377 --> 02:29:15.704]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:15.704 --> 02:29:18.987]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here.
[02:29:19.167 --> 02:29:20.968]  Right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:20.968 --> 02:29:25.169]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:29:25.169 --> 02:29:33.152]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:33.152 --> 02:29:34.412]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:34.412 --> 02:29:36.393]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[02:29:36.553 --> 02:29:37.133]  That's right.
[02:29:56.462 --> 02:29:57.863]  There is no longer any doubt.
[02:29:57.863 --> 02:30:03.726]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[02:30:03.726 --> 02:30:05.807]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[02:30:05.807 --> 02:30:07.387]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[02:30:07.387 --> 02:30:08.528]  World government is here.
[02:30:08.528 --> 02:30:09.849]  Now is the time for decision.
[02:30:09.849 --> 02:30:12.910]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:23.155]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag and attacking the family and that are attacking our borders and our country and our military and our heritage, if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[02:30:23.155 --> 02:30:25.156]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[02:30:25.396 --> 02:30:28.218]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:28.218 --> 02:30:30.080]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:31.161]  And praying for President Trump.
[02:30:31.161 --> 02:30:32.081]  And praying for yourself.
[02:30:32.081 --> 02:30:33.142]  And praying for peace.
[02:30:33.142 --> 02:30:34.283]  Praying for justice.
[02:30:34.283 --> 02:30:36.625]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.
[02:30:36.625 --> 02:30:38.406]  Because we're running out of a lot of the best-selling items.
[02:30:38.406 --> 02:30:40.528]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[02:30:40.528 --> 02:30:42.209]  Store-wide free shipping.
[02:30:42.209 --> 02:30:44.351]  50% off all the supplements and double Patriot Points.
[02:30:44.351 --> 02:30:45.292]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[02:30:45.292 --> 02:30:45.972]  Cancel any time.
[02:30:45.972 --> 02:30:46.513]  It's free.
[02:30:46.513 --> 02:30:48.434]  An additional 10% off on your next order.
[02:30:48.434 --> 02:30:50.035]  You cannot beat these deals.
[02:30:50.035 --> 02:30:53.878]  The best we ever offer at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:57.808 --> 02:31:01.891]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:01.891 --> 02:31:08.215]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:31:08.215 --> 02:31:20.424]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:31:20.424 --> 02:31:26.388]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is
[02:31:26.408 --> 02:31:27.569]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:57.282 --> 02:32:13.819]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:32:13.959 --> 02:32:18.022]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[02:32:18.022 --> 02:32:21.724]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[02:32:21.724 --> 02:32:23.486]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:32:23.486 --> 02:32:27.709]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:32:27.709 --> 02:32:35.634]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been to the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:32:35.674 --> 02:32:37.234]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:08.103 --> 02:33:09.244]  Big Brother.
[02:33:09.244 --> 02:33:11.045]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:11.045 --> 02:33:12.947]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:12.947 --> 02:33:14.628]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:14.628 --> 02:33:16.290]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:16.290 --> 02:33:20.833]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.321 --> 02:33:35.690]  Oh, there ain't nothing gonna make it happen.
[02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:38.774]  Alright, getting back to Richard Reeves and a bunch of these other articles.
[02:33:38.774 --> 02:33:42.018]  You were getting into some more predictions, some more big ideas.
[02:33:42.018 --> 02:33:44.301]  And it was the crew pointed out to me that we had, uh...
[02:33:45.723 --> 02:33:51.927]  The engineer from Massachusetts on the show who talked about the post office having email.
[02:33:51.927 --> 02:33:52.968]  It's supposedly got letters.
[02:33:52.968 --> 02:34:02.634]  It should have a email that has advertising on it, but that is free to the public as a counterbalance to these big corporations that are in bed with the Chai comms.
[02:34:02.634 --> 02:34:04.175]  Of course, that's Shiva we're talking about.
[02:34:04.175 --> 02:34:10.239]  But then I have the idea about what if the post office had a Twitter, where as long as you don't violate the law,
[02:34:10.939 --> 02:34:13.901]  He goes back to Section 230, the same immunity given to big tech.
[02:34:13.901 --> 02:34:15.382]  They've been operating as utilities.
[02:34:15.382 --> 02:34:19.684]  They say they're utilities, but they're telling you, oh, you're a conservative, you're a Christian, you can't have that.
[02:34:19.684 --> 02:34:21.926]  Joe Biggs was on First Hour.
[02:34:21.926 --> 02:34:30.271]  He said he's going to organize an event in Portland for free speech and that if Antifa attacks them again with milkshakes full of acid or clubs,
[02:34:31.636 --> 02:34:33.158]  That they would defend themselves.
[02:34:33.158 --> 02:34:35.840]  Well, that's the verboten third rail.
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:40.565]  You don't touch that, thou shalt not fight back against government employees in black masks attacking you.
[02:34:40.565 --> 02:34:41.907]  So he got banned off Twitter.
[02:34:41.907 --> 02:34:43.949]  Well, now he had a Shopify account.
[02:34:45.128 --> 02:34:48.649]  And I plugged it on there to try to support him, because he does a lot of activism.
[02:34:48.649 --> 02:34:49.870]  They banned that.
[02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:52.031]  So there is the cartelling that goes on.
[02:34:52.031 --> 02:34:58.653]  Folks, we're trying to build a platform so other people can quickly have their own site, have their own video, their audio.
[02:34:58.653 --> 02:35:00.694]  That's something that the enemy knows I'm building.
[02:35:00.694 --> 02:35:01.854]  It's why they're so pissed.
[02:35:01.854 --> 02:35:05.495]  I put millions of dollars into things around here, okay?
[02:35:05.495 --> 02:35:11.738]  And I got a lot of stuff going on, and they hold me in a position of other things I'm up to on purpose,
[02:35:12.458 --> 02:35:17.079]  With all the distractions so that I don't get all these plans completed.
[02:35:17.079 --> 02:35:21.480]  We've done a lot of inventive things to keep operating, but they've cut us down to the bone now.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:23.360]  There's no fat around here.
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:26.781]  I need funding and it's so simple.
[02:35:26.781 --> 02:35:29.161]  Everybody knows bone broth is amazing.
[02:35:29.161 --> 02:35:38.423]  They sell it for $10 a little mason jar at Whole Foods and it is good for you and it's got the chaga mushroom and a little bit of the bone broth of chicken in it that's reportedly the best and a little bit of bee pollen.
[02:35:39.943 --> 02:35:47.247]  We go out and look at whatever's the hottest range, whatever's the best, whatever works the best, and then we have it hundreds of times stronger for the price.
[02:35:47.247 --> 02:35:56.272]  It's powdered, concentrate, no fillers, chicken, bone broth, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, alfalfa root, and all the rest of it.
[02:35:56.272 --> 02:35:59.493]  And you want strength, you want stamina, you want everything.
[02:35:59.493 --> 02:36:02.835]  Ultimate bone broth mixed in with whey, mixed in with milk.
[02:36:02.835 --> 02:36:04.056]  It tastes really good when you do that.
[02:36:04.056 --> 02:36:05.356]  It tastes okay when you don't.
[02:36:05.356 --> 02:36:07.257]  Put it in water, but it doesn't mix up as well.
[02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:08.258]  It mixes great in blenders.
[02:36:09.747 --> 02:36:13.389]  And bang it back as a meal replacement, whatever, in the morning, at lunch, at night.
[02:36:13.389 --> 02:36:14.649]  It's incredible.
[02:36:14.649 --> 02:36:18.531]  And when I don't take it, I feel it in my joints, my hip, you name it.
[02:36:18.531 --> 02:36:21.493]  I mean, everybody knows how important turmeric is.
[02:36:21.493 --> 02:36:24.094]  It's chopped full of high-quality turmeric.
[02:36:24.094 --> 02:36:27.676]  Now, it's so expensive for us to get it at 95%.
[02:36:27.676 --> 02:36:30.437]  No one else has 95% curcuminoid.
[02:36:30.437 --> 02:36:31.538]  It's a patented process.
[02:36:31.538 --> 02:36:35.620]  We went to the top developers and said, you're the top brand, private label in the country.
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:36.600]  What's your curcuminoid?
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:36.980]  They said about 83%, 85%.
[02:36:39.428 --> 02:36:40.790]  And I said, what's the highest you can do?
[02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:41.250]  They said 95.
[02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:41.771]  No one does that.
[02:36:41.771 --> 02:36:44.435]  I said, I want 95.
[02:36:44.435 --> 02:36:46.978]  So we have the strongest with BODY's open tumor formula.
[02:36:46.978 --> 02:36:51.044]  What you get in bone broth is raw turmeric.
[02:36:51.044 --> 02:36:53.027]  It hasn't gone through the process, but it's still really good for you.
[02:36:53.812 --> 02:37:02.237]  Okay, but, you know, for that much tumor, it could be $500 for the big ol' keg of it if it had that much, you know, pure extract in it.
[02:37:02.237 --> 02:37:09.102]  So it doesn't have the extract, it has raw turmeric, the concentrated bone broth, the chaga mushrooms, the bee pollen.
[02:37:09.102 --> 02:37:10.923]  It's an amazing formula.
[02:37:10.923 --> 02:37:12.524]  It's 50% off.

[02:37:23.632 --> 02:37:24.433]  It's all there.
[02:37:24.433 --> 02:37:25.694]  Brain Force Plus.
[02:37:25.694 --> 02:37:27.096]  X2's about to sell out.
[02:37:27.096 --> 02:37:36.365]  And they came to me two days ago and said, hey, you got to start pulling X2 and you got to pull Brain Force Plus, the new trumpet, because it'll be sold out by next week if you do this.
[02:37:36.365 --> 02:37:39.108]  And it'll still be a while, two weeks to a month before we get the other stuff back.
[02:37:39.108 --> 02:37:40.409]  And I said, just run it out.
[02:37:41.502 --> 02:37:42.403]  Run it out.
[02:37:42.403 --> 02:37:46.745]  I want people to try it who haven't experienced X2, the missing link.
[02:37:46.745 --> 02:37:47.846]  Just find out about it for yourself.
[02:37:47.846 --> 02:37:50.148]  I want people to experience the bone broth.
[02:37:50.148 --> 02:37:50.988]  And here's something I want to say.
[02:37:50.988 --> 02:37:53.890]  We're going to go to Richard and finish these pieces.
[02:37:53.890 --> 02:37:56.172]  I am the worst.
[02:37:56.172 --> 02:37:59.173]  I know how great high quality Mother Nature supplements are.
[02:37:59.173 --> 02:38:01.255]  I know how good they work.
[02:38:01.255 --> 02:38:07.179]  And I'm the worst if I'll get on a kick and I'll take all my vitamins, my minerals, and take my products.
[02:38:08.137 --> 02:38:11.940]  And then I feel great, have better energy, my life's so much better, libido.
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:13.101]  And then slowly I forget.
[02:38:13.101 --> 02:38:15.924]  And it's always like I run out, because I don't sign up for auto-ship.
[02:38:15.924 --> 02:38:17.585]  I just go to the warehouse and get it.
[02:38:17.585 --> 02:38:18.166]  Well, now I do.
[02:38:18.166 --> 02:38:25.332]  Or a family event happens and my wife moves the lazy Susan off the dinner table.
[02:38:25.332 --> 02:38:25.972]  And then I forget.
[02:38:25.972 --> 02:38:29.475]  And then a couple months go by and I go, why do I feel like crap?
[02:38:29.475 --> 02:38:30.636]  Why am I gaining weight?
[02:38:30.636 --> 02:38:31.978]  Oh, I might be taking X2 in months.
[02:38:33.151 --> 02:38:33.991]  Why am I not?
[02:38:33.991 --> 02:38:36.713]  So, I religiously have my children take it in the morning.
[02:38:36.713 --> 02:38:38.134]  They do it themselves now.
[02:38:38.134 --> 02:38:39.314]  And I do it.
[02:38:39.314 --> 02:38:41.215]  And that's why I made the 8-pack Power Stacks.
[02:38:41.215 --> 02:38:43.757]  You've got 13 supplements together for morning and night.
[02:38:43.757 --> 02:38:45.037]  And it just changes your life.
[02:38:45.037 --> 02:38:47.058]  So, I started a few weeks ago.
[02:38:47.058 --> 02:38:49.640]  I'm going to do it through the rest of the summer.
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:55.383]  I'm predicting, because I did this before, that I'm going to lose, eating the same way I always do and everything, 30 pounds.
[02:38:57.318 --> 02:39:04.121]  By just taking the X2 and the bone broth and all the rest of it, and I still eat pizza, I still eat everything.
[02:39:04.121 --> 02:39:05.182]  Watch it happen.
[02:39:05.182 --> 02:39:09.444]  Because, you know, I lost a lot, gained some back because I've been working so hard, but under a lot of stress.
[02:39:09.444 --> 02:39:10.624]  I'm going to do it again.
[02:39:10.624 --> 02:39:12.585]  Watch the transformation happen.
[02:39:12.585 --> 02:39:15.026]  Richard Reeves, getting back into your points.
[02:39:15.026 --> 02:39:21.389]  Well, I've done a lot of research on the supplement business and all that, and I'll tell you, Alex's products are second to none.
[02:39:21.389 --> 02:39:22.150]  Top of the line.
[02:39:22.890 --> 02:39:32.777]  Folks, for July 4th, celebrate by getting on AutoShip, getting these products, get the bone broth, get the X2, get the bodies, et cetera, and sign up for AutoShip.
[02:39:32.777 --> 02:39:42.043]  Alex needs millions of people subscribed to AutoShip so he doesn't have to sit here and worry about funding the operation, just making it happen and breaking, making 1776 happen.
[02:39:42.043 --> 02:39:52.390]  See, I don't want to say all this on air because it makes the Democratic lawyers and all them happy and what they're doing, but, in the deep platform of the attacks, but, and it's okay, it's part of the plan.
[02:39:53.831 --> 02:39:59.436]  But, you know, I can mortgage my house and get four or five months of funding here.
[02:39:59.436 --> 02:40:00.697]  Maybe three or four months.
[02:40:00.697 --> 02:40:01.638]  And I'm happy to do that.
[02:40:01.638 --> 02:40:02.859]  I don't even care.
[02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:03.219]  Okay?
[02:40:03.219 --> 02:40:06.662]  It's just that that's the type of level the enemy wants to get us in the position of.
[02:40:06.662 --> 02:40:08.104]  So we need your support right now.
[02:40:09.445 --> 02:40:12.809]  We need to go on offense, and that's part of the deal, going on offense.
[02:40:12.809 --> 02:40:16.152]  Getting into those points, talking about the future, talking about what's coming up.
[02:40:16.152 --> 02:40:19.436]  Folks, the 2020 election is now.
[02:40:19.436 --> 02:40:23.961]  You need to be involved in your local politics at each level.
[02:40:23.961 --> 02:40:26.344]  If it's city council, state representative,
[02:40:26.704 --> 02:40:27.064]  We're good to go.
[02:40:41.816 --> 02:40:47.279]  And we only have six or seven months until the first primaries start to happen.
[02:40:47.279 --> 02:40:54.123]  The time to get rid of some of these people that are anti-American in the House and Senate, etc., is in the primaries.
[02:40:54.123 --> 02:40:58.525]  You have these districts that are weighted that they're going to go Democrat no matter who's running.
[02:40:58.525 --> 02:41:00.366]  It could be Lucifer himself.
[02:41:00.366 --> 02:41:02.588]  It could be Frederica Wilson herself.
[02:41:02.588 --> 02:41:05.489]  She's probably in a district where the Democrats are going to win that race.
[02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:06.470]  Well, guess what?
[02:41:06.470 --> 02:41:08.591]  The Democrat needs to lose.
[02:41:08.591 --> 02:41:10.212]  She needs to lose in her primary.
[02:41:10.532 --> 02:41:12.418]  Does she not look like a Batman villain?
[02:41:12.418 --> 02:41:14.886]  She's saying, arrest people that make fun of me.
[02:41:14.886 --> 02:41:15.909]  And it's not a joke!
[02:41:15.909 --> 02:41:17.714]  It's like this is a flaming authoritarian!
[02:41:18.504 --> 02:41:24.947]  Maybe that's the career she needs to have, Alex, is as soon as she loses her seat in the House, she can go to Hollywood and be a Batman villain.
[02:41:24.947 --> 02:41:29.408]  I would be perfectly happy to maybe even buy the ticket for that movie just to see the victory.
[02:41:29.408 --> 02:41:32.129]  But I'm telling you, the 2020 election is now.
[02:41:32.129 --> 02:41:35.471]  And Laura Loomer made a statement on the show a while back.
[02:41:35.471 --> 02:41:36.771]  I think she was incorrect about it.
[02:41:36.771 --> 02:41:40.313]  Maybe you can clue me in on the thing, on the complete thing.
[02:41:40.313 --> 02:41:43.114]  But she said that candidates for office
[02:41:43.994 --> 02:41:47.935]  Have, cannot get their social media accounts pulled.
[02:41:47.935 --> 02:41:49.595]  Do you know any more about that?
[02:41:49.595 --> 02:41:58.017]  Well, it's true that under Federal Election Commission rules, that once you're running, they see it as really hard to do because it could clearly be election meddling.
[02:41:58.017 --> 02:42:03.799]  And there are rules in advertising and things that if people take advertising from one candidate, they have to take it from all the candidates.
[02:42:03.799 --> 02:42:06.900]  So yes, Laura is, at least in theory, right.
[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:10.381]  I think it's, I think it's, I think she's correct in the statement.
[02:42:10.381 --> 02:42:12.041]  I just don't think it's been adjudicated yet.
[02:42:12.521 --> 02:42:17.887]  But, bottom line is... It's been adjudicated in other cases with TV, radio, and print.
[02:42:17.887 --> 02:42:18.348]  You're right.
[02:42:18.348 --> 02:42:20.330]  It's not been applied to social media.
[02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:21.572]  But they've been abiding by it.
[02:42:21.572 --> 02:42:26.898]  But they've been doing things like blocking members of Congress' new campaign ads and things.
[02:42:26.898 --> 02:42:27.098]  Right.
[02:42:27.438 --> 02:42:34.823]  So, but we've seen where, like in the Supreme Court case, they've already said that even Trump can't even block people that put negative comments on his Twitter.
[02:42:34.823 --> 02:42:37.344]  Well, the thing of it is, everybody just needs to run for office.
[02:42:37.344 --> 02:42:38.525]  They can run for precinct chair.
[02:42:38.525 --> 02:42:39.826]  You don't need any money.
[02:42:39.826 --> 02:42:40.827]  Run for precinct chair.
[02:42:40.827 --> 02:42:42.708]  And then open up all your social media accounts.
[02:42:42.708 --> 02:42:43.788]  And then guess what?
[02:42:43.788 --> 02:42:45.049]  We have a First Amendment law.
[02:42:45.049 --> 02:42:45.950]  But you're right.
[02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:46.470]  You're right.
[02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:47.631]  I can run for Congress.
[02:42:47.631 --> 02:42:50.112]  You can just run for precinct chair.
[02:42:50.112 --> 02:42:50.633]  No money.
[02:42:50.633 --> 02:42:51.453]  You don't need any money.
[02:42:51.453 --> 02:42:53.234]  Everybody can run for precinct chair.
[02:42:53.234 --> 02:42:53.515]  Wow.
[02:42:53.515 --> 02:42:54.455]  Richard Ruse is smart.
[02:42:54.455 --> 02:42:54.755]  You're smart.
[02:42:54.755 --> 02:42:55.136]  Everybody.
[02:42:55.936 --> 02:42:56.997]  The time has come.
[02:42:56.997 --> 02:42:57.978]  The time is here.
[02:42:57.978 --> 02:43:10.008]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[02:43:10.008 --> 02:43:21.578]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[02:43:21.598 --> 02:43:21.858]  I think?

[02:44:56.713 --> 02:44:58.734]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[02:44:58.734 --> 02:45:00.736]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[02:45:00.736 --> 02:45:07.240]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:19.329]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[02:45:19.329 --> 02:45:22.391]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[02:45:22.571 --> 02:45:24.512]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[02:45:52.512 --> 02:45:54.434]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[02:45:54.434 --> 02:45:55.675]  Even it is what you just saw.
[02:46:13.854 --> 02:46:17.515]  Total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:46:17.515 --> 02:46:21.357]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[02:46:21.357 --> 02:46:23.298]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[02:46:23.298 --> 02:46:28.280]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:31.581]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:32.421]  I need gas.
[02:46:32.421 --> 02:46:33.902]  I need ammo politically now.
[02:46:34.342 --> 02:46:40.645]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[02:46:40.645 --> 02:46:41.765]  We're unstoppable together.
[02:46:41.765 --> 02:46:43.166]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[02:46:43.166 --> 02:46:50.188]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[02:46:50.188 --> 02:46:51.169]  You have my commitment.
[02:46:51.169 --> 02:46:58.552]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[02:46:58.552 --> 02:47:01.173]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.081 --> 02:47:18.646]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.646 --> 02:47:36.280]  I'll tell you Alex, I'll never forget, you know when we went to Denver for the 2008, when Obama was up there for his, when they made him the nominee, we drove back and we had this big lightning storm.
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:36.701]  Turn this up.
[02:47:37.361 --> 02:47:38.882]  We had a big, giant lightning storm.
[02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:40.584]  It happened in a rainstorm, lightning storm.
[02:47:40.584 --> 02:47:41.125]  We were driving.
[02:47:41.125 --> 02:47:42.566]  It was the most fantastic of all ever.
[02:47:42.566 --> 02:47:43.527]  It was the most fantastic.
[02:47:43.527 --> 02:47:45.108]  And the plane's the panhandle.
[02:47:45.108 --> 02:47:46.429]  It was the most fantastic.
[02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:48.892]  We only did what it had to do.
[02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:49.752]  And we're going to say it real soon.
[02:47:49.752 --> 02:47:50.633]  It was the most fantastic.
[02:47:50.633 --> 02:47:52.895]  Well, we listened to all kinds of rock and roll.
[02:47:52.895 --> 02:47:55.898]  It was the most fantastic light show for a rock and roll show ever.
[02:47:55.898 --> 02:47:57.079]  And it went on all night.
[02:47:57.079 --> 02:47:58.320]  It went on for hours.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:47:59.341]  Yeah, it went on for hours.
[02:47:59.341 --> 02:47:59.622]  It was like...
[02:48:00.963 --> 02:48:03.586]  We had the other guys in the crew, they're sleeping in the back of the RV.
[02:48:03.586 --> 02:48:05.348]  You were drinking coffee, I was drinking beer.
[02:48:05.348 --> 02:48:10.273]  You and I were hammered down on the highway, and it was the biggest rock and roll light show ever.
[02:48:10.273 --> 02:48:11.554]  It was God putting it on.
[02:48:11.554 --> 02:48:13.537]  I mean, God put it on.
[02:48:13.537 --> 02:48:14.618]  You can't disagree on that.
[02:48:14.618 --> 02:48:16.300]  It was an unbelievable light show that we had.
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:17.982]  You were along as a truck driver many years ago.
[02:48:17.982 --> 02:48:18.943]  Did you ever see anything like that?
[02:48:19.743 --> 02:48:21.745]  Actually, you know, recently, yeah.
[02:48:21.745 --> 02:48:25.809]  We've had some storms here in Austin here recently that have been comparable to that.
[02:48:25.809 --> 02:48:38.520]  They haven't lasted as long as that one that you and I went through that's coming back from the... Man, when I was driving home the other night, the sun was setting and it was a clear sky, but over here was black and blue clouds and lightning shooting sideways.
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:39.280]  Yeah.
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:42.223]  And I went home and cooked dinner, hung out with the kids, but everybody was telling me it was incredible.
[02:48:42.403 --> 02:48:48.069]  Yeah, some of that lightning that's just like horizon to horizon that we've had recently has been incredible.
[02:48:48.069 --> 02:48:49.330]  Some of the storms.
[02:48:49.330 --> 02:48:50.752]  We've seen a lot of stuff.
[02:48:50.752 --> 02:48:51.673]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:48:51.673 --> 02:48:52.534]  Been through a lot of stuff.
[02:48:52.534 --> 02:48:53.835]  So, hey, it's good memories.
[02:48:53.835 --> 02:48:57.940]  But, hey, listen, I want to dive back into this real quick because I do need to call you out, President Trump.
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:03.764]  President Trump, I'm upset over Antifa, and I'm upset over this First Amendment issue.
[02:49:03.764 --> 02:49:20.715]  With Antifa, in March, March 11th of 2016, you had your Chicago rally cancelled because of Antifa black bloc activities, and here we are three years later, just this past weekend, these guys are getting milkshaked with chemical weapons.
[02:49:20.715 --> 02:49:21.176]  It's just
[02:49:21.656 --> 02:49:21.796]  Yes.
[02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:44.799]  Talk about this issue with Antifa.
[02:49:44.799 --> 02:49:48.320]  Pick somebody in law enforcement to go after these guys.
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:51.681]  I will say Trump's biggest supporters are upset he won't.
[02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:53.121]  He talks about it a little bit.
[02:49:53.121 --> 02:49:55.002]  People want to see him protect us.
[02:49:55.002 --> 02:49:55.602]  Absolutely.
[02:49:55.602 --> 02:49:56.742]  Think of the inauguration.
[02:49:56.742 --> 02:50:05.465]  Alex, I was recuperating from my... I watched them beat women up in front of me and we started fighting them and the biggest cop I ever saw, the guy was like 7 foot tall, big old white guy.
[02:50:05.905 --> 02:50:08.327]  And they were threatening to arrest us if we didn't stop running.
[02:50:08.327 --> 02:50:14.411]  I was with a bunch of Navy SEALs and Army guys, active duty.
[02:50:14.411 --> 02:50:15.612]  We ran them over.
[02:50:15.612 --> 02:50:20.535]  Well, then the cops came and I'm like, we're not supposed to beat their ass?
[02:50:20.535 --> 02:50:22.817]  And why should it be necessary that you should have to even...
[02:50:23.177 --> 02:50:25.238]  This was to get in!
[02:50:25.238 --> 02:50:29.239]  Well, I know, and these guys, look, Antifa, they're committing crimes before the fact.
[02:50:29.239 --> 02:50:33.001]  Look, I went to the RNC in 2008 to St.
[02:50:33.001 --> 02:50:41.704]  Paul, Minnesota, and they had the Antifa anti-racist action guys, black bloc guys, they had them up there during the McCain inauguration.
[02:50:41.704 --> 02:50:42.364]  Well, guess what?
[02:50:42.364 --> 02:50:48.146]  Did you hear of any McCain supporter getting roughed up or touched at all in 2008?
[02:50:48.146 --> 02:50:48.967]  Did you hear about it?
[02:50:48.967 --> 02:50:49.867]  No, because he was a ringer.
[02:50:50.547 --> 02:50:54.310]  Well, he was a ringer, but the thing of it is, they protected those people.
[02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:58.414]  They protected all the McCain supporters, all the attendees to the RNC.
[02:50:58.414 --> 02:51:03.298]  Nobody got touched because the police, National Guard, all the law enforcement was out.
[02:51:03.298 --> 02:51:09.723]  They had law enforcement from all over Minnesota there, protecting the people that are supporting John McCain.
[02:51:09.723 --> 02:51:12.405]  And they busted the antifa that was planning
[02:51:15.487 --> 02:51:15.968]  That's right.
[02:51:15.968 --> 02:51:16.608]  They busted him.
[02:51:16.608 --> 02:51:18.970]  And they knew about it all beforehand.
[02:51:18.970 --> 02:51:23.734]  They knew these guys were, you know, those orange construction barrels they put out on the freeway.
[02:51:23.734 --> 02:51:27.797]  They had stolen a bunch of those barrels and made makeshift shields out of them and all that.
[02:51:27.797 --> 02:51:29.218]  They knew about all that stuff.
[02:51:29.218 --> 02:51:31.040]  They had the inside knowledge as usual.
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:32.341]  It's an inside job.
[02:51:32.341 --> 02:51:36.164]  So, President Trump, get somebody, put them in charge of
[02:51:36.764 --> 02:51:40.306]  Busting Antifa and following the money trail to whoever it leads.
[02:51:40.306 --> 02:51:42.768]  We've all talked about it over and over on the show.
[02:51:42.768 --> 02:51:44.009]  We've heard it talked about.
[02:51:44.009 --> 02:51:54.776]  Let's get to where the money source of this Antifa comes from, ultimately, and in the meantime, let's get these little punks busted because they're committing crimes before they ever get to the scene of the activity.
[02:51:54.776 --> 02:51:55.576]  Because it's premeditated.
[02:51:55.576 --> 02:52:01.020]  If we're in a secret meeting going, we're going to throw acid in people's faces, even if you call us Nazis, they're not allowed to do that.
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:04.121]  So, we're going to start this video, and then we're going to start the presentation.
[02:52:30.228 --> 02:52:34.954]  The neo-Nazi group National Socialist Movement attacked Pride in Detroit.
[02:52:40.290 --> 02:52:43.912]  It's like PETA will show you footage of animals being abused and brainwash you.
[02:52:43.912 --> 02:52:51.456]  They show some Nazis and go, oh look, we're going to attack Nazis now on the 4th and on the 6th.
[02:52:51.456 --> 02:52:53.777]  So they show you a Nazi who has a right to speech.
[02:52:53.777 --> 02:52:54.817]  I don't agree with them.
[02:52:54.817 --> 02:52:58.019]  And they go, so now we're going to attack these Nazis, but they're not Nazis.
[02:52:58.019 --> 02:53:00.820]  They're Trump supporters going in to see the 4th of July.
[02:53:00.820 --> 02:53:01.961]  So see how the bait and switch works?
[02:53:02.381 --> 02:53:03.022]  Right, right.
[02:53:03.022 --> 02:53:03.803]  And that's just it.
[02:53:03.803 --> 02:53:08.588]  It's like, you know, when we're talking about the inauguration, I was recuperating from my illness.
[02:53:08.588 --> 02:53:11.231]  I actually, my wife and I were thinking about going to the inauguration.
[02:53:11.231 --> 02:53:13.934]  Had I not been, you know, recuperating, we probably would have gone.
[02:53:13.934 --> 02:53:21.302]  But think of, potentially, there might have been millions of people that did not show up at Trump's inauguration because the threats were rampant.
[02:53:21.302 --> 02:53:23.244]  They would attack families with children.
[02:53:24.252 --> 02:53:50.468]  Trying to get the entrances and the police have designated which ones Andy for we're at because they were showing her Obama's control until the Capitol Police until Trump got sworn in and all the Richie Rich's and me with my you know front passes we all got because I was right in the front row but I went back further you couldn't see Trump right in the front row see it was right under the stage I was like literally the front row I like the ticket but I went back about two rows I could actually see him and
[02:53:52.421 --> 02:53:53.146]  I wasn't elitist.
[02:53:53.146 --> 02:53:54.976]  I didn't know I was at the front by the Capitol.
[02:53:55.911 --> 02:53:59.232]  I was just entering the mall and we're like, okay, we can't get in here.
[02:53:59.232 --> 02:53:59.772]  Andy was there.
[02:53:59.772 --> 02:54:00.372]  Why are the cops?
[02:54:00.372 --> 02:54:03.073]  And we'd see women bleeding and crying and kids crying.
[02:54:03.073 --> 02:54:06.594]  And I sort of cussing at the cops, like what the F's your problem?
[02:54:06.594 --> 02:54:06.974]  Get in there.
[02:54:06.974 --> 02:54:08.674]  And the cops were like, we can't do it.
[02:54:08.674 --> 02:54:10.355]  It's not our jurisdiction or whatever.
[02:54:10.355 --> 02:54:13.756]  So I finally went to another checkpoint, another, I said, let's just go through them.
[02:54:13.756 --> 02:54:14.516]  And we went through them.
[02:54:14.516 --> 02:54:15.436]  They were hitting us and stuff.
[02:54:15.436 --> 02:54:19.377]  So one guy's like completely runs over like eight of them.
[02:54:19.377 --> 02:54:20.157]  They start bitching.
[02:54:20.157 --> 02:54:22.078]  They call the police on us for fighting them.
[02:54:22.879 --> 02:54:23.899]  Well, and that's just it.
[02:54:23.899 --> 02:54:28.383]  Now they've upped their tactics to these, you know, chemical weapon milkshakes, etc.
[02:54:28.383 --> 02:54:32.547]  So, it's just more dangerous than ever, and sooner or later, somebody's going to get killed.
[02:54:32.547 --> 02:54:36.911]  Well, let me just say, you can't take your child down to a 4th of July deal where anybody lives.
[02:54:36.911 --> 02:54:38.532]  You can't go to inauguration.
[02:54:38.532 --> 02:54:40.374]  And I'm not saying I'm Mr., you know...
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:45.342]  King Kong or something, but if somebody does something to my kids, they're dead.
[02:54:45.342 --> 02:54:47.123]  I don't care what they do to me, I'm tearing their throat out.
[02:54:47.123 --> 02:54:49.745]  I'm going to get them on the ground, I'm going to unwind their head.
[02:54:49.745 --> 02:54:51.326]  And we as Americans... I mean, it's going to happen.
[02:54:51.326 --> 02:54:53.728]  So, I mean, your head is going 360.
[02:54:53.728 --> 02:55:03.474]  And what's making me upset about that, though, is that you should never be put in a situation to start with, because President Trump, you need to take action on Antifa, and that should have happened three years ago.
[02:55:03.474 --> 02:55:05.015]  You know how easy it is to break somebody's neck?
[02:55:05.956 --> 02:55:06.556]  Pretty easy, Richard.
[02:55:06.556 --> 02:55:07.677]  I've heard you talk about it.
[02:55:07.677 --> 02:55:09.177]  I'm afraid now.
[02:55:09.177 --> 02:55:09.937]  No, no, I'm serious.
[02:55:09.937 --> 02:55:13.718]  You just grab somebody like you want to kill them and they're dead.
[02:55:13.718 --> 02:55:15.559]  And I mean, I'm just, I'm not trying to act tough here.
[02:55:15.559 --> 02:55:17.080]  They're attacking children.
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:20.161]  You're going to get your goddamn neck broken.
[02:55:20.161 --> 02:55:21.121]  You freaking, excuse me.
[02:55:21.761 --> 02:55:23.142]  Delay that if you have to.
[02:55:23.142 --> 02:55:25.625]  I can't handle it anymore.
[02:55:25.625 --> 02:55:26.686]  These people are jokes, man.
[02:55:26.686 --> 02:55:30.810]  President Trump, you cannot wait until the next election to take action on Antifa.
[02:55:30.810 --> 02:55:33.813]  You can't wait until the next election to take action on the First Amendment.
[02:55:33.813 --> 02:55:41.742]  It's like Matt Drudge said when Matt Drudge came in on his interview, I guess it was about three years ago, he said, whatever you're going to do, you got to do it now because I'm here to tell you.
[02:55:42.142 --> 02:55:42.863]  He's saying, alert!
[02:55:42.863 --> 02:55:44.065]  Build your own system, Alex!
[02:55:44.065 --> 02:55:45.486]  They're going to shut you down!
[02:55:45.486 --> 02:55:46.748]  And we did some of it.
[02:55:46.748 --> 02:55:48.390]  I wish I had that urgency.
[02:55:48.390 --> 02:55:49.312]  Most people did nothing.
[02:55:49.312 --> 02:55:55.660]  I told Joe Biggs months ago, I said, create other backup accounts, other names, shut up other systems, you're going to get banned everywhere.
[02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:56.381]  I love him.
[02:55:56.381 --> 02:55:57.302]  He didn't listen.
[02:55:57.302 --> 02:55:59.024]  I tell everybody this, they don't listen.
[02:55:59.625 --> 02:56:00.486]  Well, that's it.
[02:56:00.486 --> 02:56:01.926]  Whatever we're going to do, we've got to do it now.
[02:56:01.926 --> 02:56:02.767]  Matt Drudge said it.
[02:56:02.767 --> 02:56:06.850]  Whatever greatness you have, whatever skills you have, make it happen now.
[02:56:06.850 --> 02:56:07.510]  None of us know.
[02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:08.711]  2020 is now.
[02:56:08.711 --> 02:56:09.771]  2020 is now.
[02:56:09.771 --> 02:56:13.113]  And 2016 was everything, and now 2020 is the whole ballgame.
[02:56:13.113 --> 02:56:13.874]  Exactly.
[02:56:13.874 --> 02:56:14.314]  Exactly.
[02:56:14.314 --> 02:56:19.758]  If we don't have a massive change in 2020, if we don't fire a bunch of bad
[02:56:20.498 --> 02:56:22.879]  Congress members, if we don't fire a bunch of U.S.
[02:56:22.879 --> 02:56:25.161]  Senate members, it's on us.
[02:56:25.161 --> 02:56:26.201]  2020 is now.
[02:56:26.201 --> 02:56:31.465]  You have unprecedented access to these candidates happening right now, because this is when they're filing.
[02:56:31.465 --> 02:56:38.129]  And each InfoWarrior, at the very least, you should be filing for precinct chair, because then set up your social media accounts.
[02:56:38.129 --> 02:56:41.251]  I guarantee you then it probably won't even come to that.
[02:56:41.251 --> 02:56:43.852]  We'll probably get our First Amendment back before we even do that.
[02:56:43.852 --> 02:56:46.153]  But at the very least, we'd all have a class amendment.
[02:56:46.153 --> 02:56:49.836]  Everyone should be running to office so you can be on that stage and inject truth.
[02:56:50.836 --> 02:56:55.679]  All right, Mike Adams is going to be taking over, but I've got this special report that's like 12 minutes long.
[02:56:55.679 --> 02:56:59.462]  It's about to be posted to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:56:59.462 --> 02:57:02.224]  It is a maximum action alert.
[02:57:02.224 --> 02:57:06.226]  All of this stuff's important, but this is a maximum action alert.
[02:57:06.226 --> 02:57:08.568]  You know, if there was a bat signal, we'd fire it.
[02:57:08.568 --> 02:57:14.492]  This is an emergency message to Trump concerning tech censorship, plus
[02:57:16.303 --> 02:57:23.106]  A first look at Trump's anti-censorship or Trump's social media conference on July 11th.
[02:57:23.106 --> 02:57:24.227]  I haven't written the headline yet.
[02:57:24.227 --> 02:57:25.687]  It's going to be up in the next 10 minutes.
[02:57:25.687 --> 02:57:28.028]  TimFullWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:57:28.028 --> 02:57:31.150]  The article's going up with the video to share.
[02:57:31.150 --> 02:57:33.310]  This is not a spectator sport.
[02:57:33.310 --> 02:57:35.812]  It's a participation sport.
[02:57:35.812 --> 02:57:37.452]  1776 worldwide on the eve of July 4th.
[02:57:37.452 --> 02:57:39.713]  This is a real declaration against tyranny.
[02:57:39.713 --> 02:57:42.034]  We're going to premiere this video coming up in about five minutes.
[02:57:42.034 --> 02:57:43.375]  Get ready to share it.
[02:57:45.145 --> 02:57:46.486]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:46.486 --> 02:57:47.266]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:47.266 --> 02:57:47.826]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:47.826 --> 02:57:48.347]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:48.347 --> 02:57:51.188]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.188 --> 02:57:57.292]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.292 --> 02:58:06.097]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.097 --> 02:58:07.257]  That's it.
[02:58:07.257 --> 02:58:09.899]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:09.899 --> 02:58:12.760]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:14.041]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.201 --> 02:58:14.961]  I agree entirely.
[02:58:14.961 --> 02:58:20.404]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.404 --> 02:58:23.185]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.185 --> 02:58:25.265]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.265 --> 02:58:34.509]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.509 --> 02:58:36.410]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:42.893]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:42.893 --> 02:58:43.833]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:46.983 --> 02:58:51.772]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[02:58:53.140 --> 02:59:02.546]  And luckily, our break room at the Infowars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality Infowars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:59:02.546 --> 02:59:14.193]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:59:14.193 --> 02:59:18.376]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:59:19.296 --> 02:59:23.339]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[02:59:23.339 --> 02:59:30.244]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:59:30.244 --> 02:59:33.166]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[02:59:33.166 --> 02:59:42.852]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:49.508 --> 02:59:53.190]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:53.190 --> 03:00:09.681]  I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire.
[03:00:18.496 --> 03:00:27.801]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:27.801 --> 03:00:39.127]  Of all the insane videos, you've got to go to InfoWars.com, watch American rapper Kru brawl with Islamic invaders in Sweden, with migrants in Sweden.
[03:00:39.127 --> 03:00:42.409]  It's up on NewsWars.com, but there's 20 minutes of this footage.
[03:00:43.445 --> 03:00:45.266]  They're doing a rap show there.
[03:00:45.266 --> 03:00:47.147]  They're in a hotel, they're in a restaurant.
[03:00:47.147 --> 03:00:53.470]  These guys hit their main security guard, like a 300-pound big black guy, in the head with their headphones.
[03:00:53.470 --> 03:00:55.190]  Bloody his head, and he doesn't want to go to jail.
[03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:56.811]  He's like, hey, stop, stop.
[03:00:56.811 --> 03:00:59.272]  These little 120-pound guys keep following around.
[03:00:59.272 --> 03:01:01.893]  You go, why are they doing this?
[03:01:01.893 --> 03:01:04.695]  Because Europeans all bowed down to them.
[03:01:04.695 --> 03:01:07.856]  So you've got this rap crew, four, five, six guys.
[03:01:07.856 --> 03:01:09.317]  You can see three of them, four of them on tape.
[03:01:10.225 --> 03:01:11.846]  Others are behind the camera.
[03:01:11.846 --> 03:01:13.487]  And they keep harassing him.
[03:01:13.487 --> 03:01:15.568]  And they say, go away, leave us alone.
[03:01:15.568 --> 03:01:17.390]  They finally get their ass kicked.
[03:01:17.390 --> 03:01:20.472]  These are probably like 16-year-old little thugs doing it.
[03:01:20.472 --> 03:01:22.553]  Why would they feel so invincible?
[03:01:22.553 --> 03:01:26.135]  Why would they be like little Banny Roosters?
[03:01:26.135 --> 03:01:28.217]  Why would they be grabbing women's asses for no reason?
[03:01:28.217 --> 03:01:30.818]  Because everyone bows to them.
[03:01:30.818 --> 03:01:33.440]  Like Kaepernick saying he hates the American flag.
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:34.621]  So I want to get this rap group on.
[03:01:34.621 --> 03:01:35.841]  I'm told they're pro-Trump.
[03:01:35.841 --> 03:01:37.703]  So watch this.
[03:01:37.703 --> 03:01:38.723]  TV viewers can see this.
[03:01:38.723 --> 03:01:39.344]  You can go full screen.
[03:01:40.498 --> 03:01:41.999]  And they just keep hitting it.
[03:01:41.999 --> 03:01:43.020]  They keep saying, leave us alone.
[03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:43.601]  They walk away.
[03:01:43.601 --> 03:01:46.663]  They hit them more.
[03:01:46.663 --> 03:01:49.125]  And finally, they get their ass kicked.
[03:01:49.125 --> 03:01:56.191]  You talk about total delusional, but all they've been doing is beating Europeans up constantly with them groveling.
[03:01:57.082 --> 03:02:00.126]  And they run into Americans who aren't going to put up with it.
[03:02:00.126 --> 03:02:05.713]  And even if they weren't black guys, they were, you know, guys from, you know, who were corn farmers from Nebraska.
[03:02:05.713 --> 03:02:07.956]  They, you know, they would probably attack them quicker.
[03:02:07.956 --> 03:02:13.803]  I can't believe how these black rap group puts up with this crap so long.
[03:02:13.803 --> 03:02:14.444]  American rapper.
[03:02:16.261 --> 03:02:21.284]  A Money Son, AP Rocky, and his crew were confronted by two migrants.
[03:02:21.284 --> 03:02:22.464]  These are literal invaders.
[03:02:22.464 --> 03:02:28.187]  Arrogant, full of hate, in Sweden, who they fought later, according to videos posted to the media.
[03:02:28.187 --> 03:02:30.409]  And reportedly these guys got put in ambulances.
[03:02:30.409 --> 03:02:32.010]  But for 20 minutes, Richard Reeves
[03:02:33.070 --> 03:02:47.507]  Guys that maybe weigh 120 pounds are messing with the other black guys are probably 200 pounds one guy's like 300 pounds and I mean one of it's a bunch of big white guys or whoever the but why would they do that because they're entitled and they're used to it Richard.
[03:02:48.027 --> 03:02:48.627]  Well, they are.
[03:02:48.627 --> 03:02:53.009]  They know they're a protected class, and they think they can get away with anything, so they're just super arrogant.
[03:02:53.009 --> 03:02:54.510]  And it's just amazing.
[03:02:54.510 --> 03:03:02.934]  I mean, think of if that were in the United States, and if those were Patriot white guys, of course, if they're Antifa white guys, they can attack black guys, no problem.
[03:03:02.934 --> 03:03:05.055]  There's not going to be any kind of issue.
[03:03:05.055 --> 03:03:10.458]  But if they were Patriot Info Warrior white guys attacking big black guys, man, we'd never hear the end of it.
[03:03:10.458 --> 03:03:11.598]  They'd just be all over it.
[03:03:11.598 --> 03:03:12.859]  It would be all over us.
[03:03:13.399 --> 03:03:17.243]  So it's just amazing the arrogance that they've come to.
[03:03:17.243 --> 03:03:18.084]  Look at this photo.
[03:03:18.084 --> 03:03:21.447]  This guy's maybe 16, 17, maybe 130 pounds.
[03:03:21.447 --> 03:03:24.450]  And because it goes on for like 20 minutes, we can't play it all here.
[03:03:24.450 --> 03:03:29.375]  They're hitting the big 300 pound bodyguard and he's like, stop.
[03:03:29.375 --> 03:03:30.216]  And they hit him again.
[03:03:30.216 --> 03:03:31.797]  They hit him over and over again.
[03:03:31.797 --> 03:03:32.798]  And I can't believe they got it.
[03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:37.862]  They just literally, finally the bodyguard doesn't do anything.
[03:03:37.862 --> 03:03:43.644]  The regular rap guys literally do judo moves, throw the guys to the ground, and then stomp the hell out of them.
[03:03:43.644 --> 03:03:43.904]  I love it.
[03:03:43.904 --> 03:03:51.388]  Well, and ultimately it's a great thing they had all these video shots of it, and witnesses, etc., because had that not happened, they would have been run through.
[03:03:51.388 --> 03:03:53.709]  Well, so the bodyguard's obviously got a license, he's trained.
[03:03:54.813 --> 03:03:57.594]  He knows, if he hurts these guys, they can still sue him.
[03:03:57.594 --> 03:03:59.635]  So it's finally the rappers that beat their asses.
[03:03:59.635 --> 03:04:00.255]  Right.
[03:04:00.255 --> 03:04:06.417]  And they could be in the situation Tommy Robinson's been in with being railroaded, had it not been for all the witnesses and video shots.
[03:04:06.417 --> 03:04:10.539]  So thank God for that, and thank God that they were able to handle the situation.
[03:04:10.539 --> 03:04:18.022]  Well I agree, but the psychology of, you weigh 130 pounds, and you're punching a 300 pound black dude in the face for no reason.
[03:04:19.062 --> 03:04:25.024]  Just because they, the local news admits, yeah, they try to tell them you can't be here, you're not from here.
[03:04:25.632 --> 03:04:26.252]  Right.
[03:04:26.252 --> 03:04:28.273]  And then they tried to beat him up.
[03:04:28.273 --> 03:04:33.035]  Well, and that's how emboldened they are, though, because they think that they've got the powers that be and the system behind them.
[03:04:33.035 --> 03:04:37.978]  It's like I'll have some 130-pound little leopards come up and throw tea in my face that hadn't been caught on tape.
[03:04:37.978 --> 03:04:39.038]  Coffee has.
[03:04:39.038 --> 03:04:40.539]  And they go, come on, let's fight!
[03:04:40.539 --> 03:04:42.700]  I'm like, are you joking?
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:45.081]  And I'm going to grab their head and just slam it through a wall.
[03:04:45.081 --> 03:04:48.543]  My emergency message to Trump, get it to the four winds, it's coming up.
[03:04:48.543 --> 03:04:51.824]  We're going to post it to InfoWars.com that Mike Adams is coming up.
[03:04:51.824 --> 03:04:52.724]  Thanks, Richard Reeves.
[03:04:52.724 --> 03:04:53.245]  Great job.
[03:04:53.245 --> 03:04:53.525]  Thank you.
[03:04:54.406 --> 03:04:56.268]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[03:04:56.268 --> 03:04:57.529]  This is the maximum alert.
[03:04:57.529 --> 03:04:58.690]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[03:04:58.690 --> 03:05:00.091]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[03:05:00.091 --> 03:05:03.234]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support.
[03:05:03.234 --> 03:05:06.377]  And we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:06.377 --> 03:05:08.178]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[03:05:08.178 --> 03:05:08.799]  There's a P.O.
[03:05:08.799 --> 03:05:10.060]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:11.841]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[03:05:11.841 --> 03:05:15.845]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[03:05:15.845 --> 03:05:16.465]  That's right.
[03:05:34.511 --> 03:05:38.236]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[03:05:38.236 --> 03:05:39.077]  We're not going to back down.
[03:06:08.638 --> 03:06:14.523]  President Trump has signaled to the world that he's preparing to take action against big tech censorship.
[03:06:14.523 --> 03:06:21.990]  He's announced a July 11, 2019 anti-censorship social media conference to be held at the White House.
[03:06:21.990 --> 03:06:27.014]  On the agenda will be ways to tackle big tech censorship and strike back.
[03:06:27.014 --> 03:06:34.261]  The president is also keen on promoting new independent anti-censorship platforms like Parler and Gab.
[03:06:34.861 --> 03:06:48.364]  Our sources tell us, and President Trump has confirmed in public statements, that he's also preparing to take anti-trust action against big tech combines and cartels that have formed a monopoly over information and are meddling in the 2020 election.
[03:06:48.364 --> 03:06:58.747]  Thanks to Project Veritas, we have even more proof from their own mouths that Google is actively already meddling in the 2020 election and plans to deliver it to the Democrats.
[03:07:00.157 --> 03:07:27.633]  InfoWars analysis shows the most effective way for President Trump to take legal and lawful action against big tech tyranny and manipulation of the upcoming election is to simply declare that all critical infrastructure federal employees, including the armed services, not be allowed to visit Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, Apple, and other platforms that are openly, like Huawei, working with the Chai Comps.
[03:07:27.633 --> 03:07:29.534]  This will bring the tyrants to their knees.
[03:07:30.254 --> 03:07:37.716]  Similar executive orders, similar to the President's order on colleges banning free speech, should also be implemented.
[03:07:37.716 --> 03:07:47.779]  That federal funds on projects and contracts will be denied, including advertising to the Big Four tech giants until they stop meddling in U.S.
[03:07:47.779 --> 03:07:48.919]  elections.
[03:07:48.919 --> 03:07:55.141]  And now a word from myself, Alex Jones, and constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, on why you, President Trump, must act now.
[03:07:58.356 --> 03:08:02.502]  President Trump, Alex Jones here with an emergency briefing.
[03:08:02.502 --> 03:08:10.773]  And as you know, in the past four years, I've given you briefings over the phone, but also directly via the internet that have turned out to be critically accurate.
[03:08:11.667 --> 03:08:16.511]  Because we're here on the ground giving you intel that you may not be getting in Washington.
[03:08:16.511 --> 03:08:19.254]  And constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here with me as well.
[03:08:19.254 --> 03:08:20.795]  He's had his ear to the ground.
[03:08:20.795 --> 03:08:25.820]  He's been studying this and he's been at the heart of some of the major cases against big tech censorship.
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:35.909]  Now, I know you're planning to rein in big tech and their out of control behavior, especially after the conclusive Project Veritas video that came out two weeks ago.
[03:08:35.909 --> 03:08:36.610]  But President Trump,
[03:08:37.791 --> 03:08:49.434]  Atlantic Monthly and others have written headlines by the neocons saying, oh Trump's all talk, big tech don't worry about the president, do whatever you want, censor conservatives.
[03:08:49.434 --> 03:08:56.116]  What you've got to understand, Mr. President, is that China and the EU are already bringing in fines and regulations.
[03:08:56.116 --> 03:08:57.576]  You've talked about this.
[03:08:57.576 --> 03:08:59.057]  You know this.
[03:08:59.057 --> 03:09:00.917]  Against big tech based in the U.S.
[03:09:00.917 --> 03:09:04.618]  So even if you don't regulate, they're regulating.
[03:09:04.618 --> 03:09:06.619]  So you're not going to allow foreign governments to have this
[03:09:07.537 --> 03:09:09.818]  Power vacuum opened up for him.
[03:09:09.818 --> 03:09:18.041]  And I know you've been giving proper orders and directives for antitrust and for lawsuits, just like you did with your executive order on universities.
[03:09:18.041 --> 03:09:18.682]  That was beautiful.
[03:09:18.682 --> 03:09:22.143]  So you're not going to discriminate against conservatives or Christians.
[03:09:22.143 --> 03:09:33.588]  And I understand that a lot of your underlings don't carry out your orders, but I'm just here to tell you ahead of your big summit coming up on the 11th of this month that
[03:09:35.356 --> 03:09:42.618]  Leadership and a strong message to big tech is all that's going to turn this around.
[03:09:42.618 --> 03:09:55.241]  Because even if you are going to win the 2020 election, which all the real numbers show you are, they're planning on stealing it and they don't want you to have a voice or a support base when they do it.
[03:09:55.241 --> 03:09:56.582]  And from my expert analysis,
[03:09:57.685 --> 03:10:02.029]  You don't have a prayer of winning, despite the fact you're probably 20 points ahead in real polls.
[03:10:02.029 --> 03:10:03.370]  We all know that.
[03:10:03.370 --> 03:10:05.993]  You're loved out there on the street across this country.
[03:10:05.993 --> 03:10:10.877]  It doesn't matter if you don't have the voice and if you don't have control.
[03:10:10.877 --> 03:10:14.961]  And if you're not standing up to big tech, they're the same crew that's going to steal the election from you.
[03:10:14.961 --> 03:10:20.206]  So you've got to go after them with less than 18 months out decisively now.
[03:10:20.566 --> 03:10:23.569]  Robert Barnes, step up here and talk directly to the President.
[03:10:23.569 --> 03:10:26.452]  Big Tech believes that the President is bluffing.
[03:10:26.452 --> 03:10:41.587]  Big Tech believes they can continue on their path, they're doubling down on their path to meddle in the elections, to corrupt the elections, to rig the elections by what they're doing with their algorithms, by what they're doing with censorship, by what they're doing with blacklisting, by what they're doing with demonetizing.
[03:10:41.587 --> 03:10:44.510]  And unless they think that this summit is just a show summit,
[03:10:44.830 --> 03:10:47.211]  They think this summit is not consequential.
[03:10:47.211 --> 03:10:55.856]  They think the president is simply bluffing, doesn't have the cards, doesn't have the chips, doesn't have the chutzpah to move forward and do something real and significant and consequential.
[03:10:55.856 --> 03:11:05.941]  So that is why it is critical and essential and fundamental for the president to do to Big Tech what he did in terms of going right to North Korea and getting the peace talks renegotiated and back going again.
[03:11:05.941 --> 03:11:13.105]  He must do the same with Big Tech to make clear that he has the real chips, he has the real cards, and he has the real guts to take real action.
[03:11:13.545 --> 03:11:18.647]  Just like you've done on Mexico and the borders and making them put 14,000 troops at the border.
[03:11:18.647 --> 03:11:19.967]  You know what to do.
[03:11:19.967 --> 03:11:21.508]  And I know you're giving the right orders.
[03:11:21.508 --> 03:11:25.129]  But just as you said, big tech brags that you won't follow through.
[03:11:25.129 --> 03:11:27.310]  They think they own Washington.
[03:11:27.310 --> 03:11:32.871]  So if you won't stand up to them on this, it's seen as a bellwether, a test to steal the election.
[03:11:32.871 --> 03:11:40.334]  Judicial Watch just proved 1.5 million fake voters in California, way beyond the 3.3 million nationwide you talked about.
[03:11:41.340 --> 03:11:46.984]  You know that if you don't exercise power against them right now, they're going to take that election from you.
[03:11:46.984 --> 03:11:47.645]  Exactly.
[03:11:47.645 --> 03:11:49.186]  So now is the time to act.
[03:11:49.186 --> 03:12:01.554]  July 11th is the time to make clear to Big Tech that you will not be bullied, that you are not bluffing, and that in fact the President of the United States will exercise the power of the presidency to protect the freeness and fairness of our elections.
[03:12:01.554 --> 03:12:03.155]  You did the right thing on Huawei.
[03:12:03.155 --> 03:12:03.616]  Visionary.
[03:12:04.451 --> 03:12:07.992]  That's 5G isn't even in yet in 98% of the country.
[03:12:07.992 --> 03:12:10.113]  You have big tech allied with China.
[03:12:10.113 --> 03:12:13.234]  You have Google and Apple that have moved there a year and a half ago.
[03:12:13.234 --> 03:12:15.955]  You've got them helping oppress their own people.
[03:12:15.955 --> 03:12:19.397]  And then they tell you, oh, we're not spying on anybody.
[03:12:19.397 --> 03:12:20.937]  Oh, we're not election meddling.
[03:12:20.937 --> 03:12:22.018]  It's all a lie.
[03:12:22.558 --> 03:12:25.379]  And it's a paper tiger, a paper dragon.
[03:12:25.379 --> 03:12:43.764]  If you will simply announce antitrust investigations, if you will simply unleash the FBI for national security issues with Apple moving its code keys to everyone's iPhone and device to China, which was in Reuters a year and a half ago, if you'll simply go after them, these authoritarians will back down.
[03:12:43.764 --> 03:12:50.866]  But these would-be dictators of America don't have any respect for you because you're a decent businessman.
[03:12:52.529 --> 03:12:56.548]  And you've been trying to negotiate and be friendly and give them a carpet of gold.
[03:12:57.665 --> 03:13:00.427]  All they recognize is a carpet of bombs.
[03:13:00.427 --> 03:13:02.228]  And that means political resistance.
[03:13:02.228 --> 03:13:09.293]  They have been demonizing and attacking and suing and raping your constituency because they hate you so much.
[03:13:09.293 --> 03:13:10.774]  And you're the ultimate target.
[03:13:10.774 --> 03:13:12.515]  And your family is.
[03:13:12.515 --> 03:13:14.296]  And now you have the Project Veritas proof.
[03:13:14.296 --> 03:13:22.742]  You have Senator Wyden saying, I want the Donald subreddit shut down, the biggest website in the world that supports you and produces most of the memes.
[03:13:23.522 --> 03:13:25.844]  You're the target, and you know it.
[03:13:25.844 --> 03:13:36.511]  So I hope this summit, which we've got the inside baseball on, isn't just to pat people on the head and make sure your constituents don't get pissed, and you promise to make it a campaign issue and go after Big Tech if you win again.
[03:13:36.511 --> 03:13:38.553]  You're not going to win again.
[03:13:39.093 --> 03:13:40.814]  They're going to fix the election.
[03:13:40.814 --> 03:13:41.755]  They're going to steal it.
[03:13:41.755 --> 03:13:43.036]  Their Russiagate failed.
[03:13:43.036 --> 03:13:43.637]  They're pissed.
[03:13:43.637 --> 03:13:45.058]  They're coming back crazier.
[03:13:45.058 --> 03:13:46.099]  We've done the research.
[03:13:46.099 --> 03:13:47.019]  We know what's happening.
[03:13:47.019 --> 03:13:48.661]  We know about Section 230.
[03:13:48.661 --> 03:13:52.884]  We know about the combines, the monopolies, the EU regulations.
[03:13:52.884 --> 03:14:00.710]  What do you want to advise the President in closing are his most important points to hit to be able to stop big tech from selling this country out?
[03:14:00.990 --> 03:14:05.751]  The President must exercise the power of the Presidency to protect the freeness and fairness of elections.
[03:14:05.751 --> 03:14:30.198]  That means unleash the Federal Trade Commission on these consumer protection violations, unleash the Department of Justice and the antitrust investigations, and in fact create a special counsel to investigate whether or not these CEOs committed perjury before Congress when they lied repeatedly last year and they're lying repeatedly this year about their efforts to control the elections, meddle in the elections, and censor free speech on the Internet.
[03:14:30.558 --> 03:14:37.406]  Exercise that power now, and he can change the script for 2020, so that an honest election puts him back in the presidency where he belongs.
[03:14:37.406 --> 03:14:39.088]  So, the president's watching this.
[03:14:39.088 --> 03:14:41.070]  They're at the Oval Office, they're on Air Force One.
[03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:42.531]  We know he sees his reports.
[03:14:42.531 --> 03:14:43.973]  Great patriots, get it to him.
[03:14:43.973 --> 03:14:46.696]  From the Secret Service, you name it, we salute you.
[03:14:46.696 --> 03:14:48.318]  What else does he need to know as a roadmap?
[03:14:48.318 --> 03:14:50.340]  Obviously, he's got all the facts, he understands this.
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:51.521]  He's already given most of these orders.
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:57.206]  How does he reign in these rogue groups who think they're so powerful?
[03:14:57.206 --> 03:15:01.371]  Big Tech's only powerful because we thought it was part of America and we turned it loose.
[03:15:01.371 --> 03:15:05.256]  They've shown they disdain America, like a bunch of snot-nosed SJWs.
[03:15:05.256 --> 03:15:07.820]  What else does the president do legislatively?
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:11.741]  Executively, to the criminal justice system, what are the other tools?
[03:15:11.741 --> 03:15:23.225]  The other tools are to push Senator Hawley's legislation to condition future Section 230 immunity on protection of free speech and the protection against election meddling that Senator Hawley's bill is currently in the Senate to do.
[03:15:23.225 --> 03:15:29.507]  He can also announce all of these steps, these critical executive and legislative and public steps at the summit itself.
[03:15:29.827 --> 03:15:42.655]  He needs to confront them directly, confront them individually, confront them on camera in front of the world, so that the world know, use the power of the bully pulpit, as well as the presidential power, to change the electoral environment, so that we have free and fair elections.
[03:15:42.655 --> 03:15:47.038]  Because the only way that's going to happen is if the president exercises his presidential power.
[03:15:47.038 --> 03:15:49.140]  And there's another huge way, Mr. President.
[03:15:49.140 --> 03:15:50.381]  You already know this.
[03:15:50.381 --> 03:15:52.202]  Brad Parscale, you're amazing.
[03:15:53.305 --> 03:15:54.526]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.526 --> 03:15:58.449]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.449 --> 03:15:59.990]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:02.952]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.952 --> 03:16:08.515]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.515 --> 03:16:09.716]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.716 --> 03:16:12.658]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.658 --> 03:16:14.880]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:19.323]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:16:25.702 --> 03:16:29.444]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:29.444 --> 03:16:30.524]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:30.524 --> 03:16:32.345]  You're not a live underground gopher.

[03:17:54.104 --> 03:17:55.425]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:17:55.425 --> 03:17:56.225]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:17:56.225 --> 03:17:56.785]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:56.785 --> 03:18:00.127]  Hey, uh, yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.127 --> 03:18:06.251]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.251 --> 03:18:14.976]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[03:18:14.976 --> 03:18:15.996]  That's it.
[03:18:15.996 --> 03:18:18.858]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:18.858 --> 03:18:21.719]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.719 --> 03:18:23.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:23.920]  I agree entirely.
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:29.361]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.361 --> 03:18:32.142]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:32.142 --> 03:18:34.202]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.202 --> 03:18:43.444]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.444 --> 03:18:45.364]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.

[03:18:51.846 --> 03:18:52.786]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:55.012 --> 03:18:59.174]  I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the huge July 4th specials.

[03:20:35.154 --> 03:20:38.617]  Now, they blocked that being spread, so spread it from NewsWars.com.
[03:20:38.617 --> 03:20:42.139]  It's going up as we speak.
[03:20:42.139 --> 03:20:45.301]  So get it out, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:45.301 --> 03:20:49.724]  Also, pro-PETO journalist and journal to join Antifa.
[03:20:50.865 --> 03:20:53.569]  in DC to throw acid on people.
[03:20:53.569 --> 03:20:55.151]  That's being announced.
[03:20:55.151 --> 03:20:57.495]  There is just so much more.
[03:20:57.495 --> 03:21:04.084]  Muslim youths attack police station in France screaming Allah Akbar and unprecedented attacks trying to burn the police station down.
[03:21:05.632 --> 03:21:06.553]  It's all happening.
[03:21:06.553 --> 03:21:10.134]  It's all on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:21:10.134 --> 03:21:15.357]  Please don't forget that we've got to rebroadcast tomorrow, but if all hell breaks loose, I'm going to be in here live.
[03:21:15.357 --> 03:21:16.858]  I'll be back Friday live.
[03:21:16.858 --> 03:21:19.499]  The War Room's coming up today in about 40 minutes.
[03:21:19.499 --> 03:21:24.422]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com with news that dovetails with all of this is coming up.
[03:21:24.422 --> 03:21:26.343]  The authoritarians are making their move.
[03:21:26.963 --> 03:21:30.365]  This is an incredible time to be alive, but we need to get this message to Trump.
[03:21:30.365 --> 03:21:31.445]  Hit his Twitter.
[03:21:31.445 --> 03:21:32.326]  Hit his Facebook.
[03:21:32.326 --> 03:21:34.267]  Hit his White House email.
[03:21:34.267 --> 03:21:34.927]  Send this out.
[03:21:34.927 --> 03:21:37.308]  The President will see this report.
[03:21:37.308 --> 03:21:39.950]  I'll call some of my sources and try to get him to watch it as well.
[03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:42.151]  He doesn't always watch it, but a lot of times he does.
[03:21:42.151 --> 03:21:49.414]  Especially if you flood him with emergency measures to Donald Trump concerning Big Tech censorship and July 11th Social Media Summit.
[03:21:49.414 --> 03:21:53.136]  You can also report it to that website at whitehouse.gov about the censorship.
[03:21:53.136 --> 03:21:54.497]  The President needs to be flooded.
[03:21:55.177 --> 03:21:55.917]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:21:55.917 --> 03:22:00.658]  What is astonishing today is how well delineated the lines are now between the anti-American factions and the pro-American factions.
[03:22:00.658 --> 03:22:02.919]  The Democrat Party no longer even pretends to love this country.
[03:22:20.686 --> 03:22:25.269]  They're out there announcing all kinds of agendas that would destroy America from within.
[03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:35.737]  They claim that America is running concentration camps and yet what the left wants to do is actually put conservatives and Christians into actual concentration camps.
[03:22:35.737 --> 03:22:40.741]  And by the way, it's not a concentration camp at the border if you can turn around and just go home.
[03:22:40.741 --> 03:22:43.463]  That's simply a processing
[03:22:44.162 --> 03:22:45.663]  It's clear that Colin Kaepernick
[03:23:12.326 --> 03:23:14.609]  He was never interested in police brutality.
[03:23:14.609 --> 03:23:17.211]  He was always anti-America.
[03:23:17.211 --> 03:23:19.353]  He hates the symbols of America.
[03:23:19.353 --> 03:23:22.195]  He hates symbols of freedom and liberty.
[03:23:22.195 --> 03:23:33.266]  And he has brought Nike to the point where it's now obvious that Nike itself hates America, along with many other corporations such as Google, Apple,
[03:23:33.826 --> 03:23:35.126]  We're good to go.
[03:23:50.549 --> 03:23:54.211]  Twitter and Facebook and Google, they will ban organics.
[03:23:54.211 --> 03:23:55.953]  They will ban natural health websites.
[03:23:55.953 --> 03:24:02.157]  They will ban sites that criticize the dangers of GMOs or herbicides or pesticides or vaccines.
[03:24:02.157 --> 03:24:06.960]  But they will not ban left-wing domestic terrorism groups.
[03:24:06.960 --> 03:24:12.984]  And this is why I agree with what Robert Barnes and Alex said in that special report.
[03:24:12.984 --> 03:24:16.026]  President Trump must take decisive action.
[03:24:16.026 --> 03:24:17.727]  He must unleash the regulatory
[03:24:18.638 --> 03:24:19.558]  I don't know.
[03:24:31.681 --> 03:24:38.248]  But it is the proper role of government to go after corporations when those corporations are threatening the rights of individuals.
[03:24:38.248 --> 03:24:45.476]  And, in effect, the tech giants today are running a massive criminal cartel to steal the election.
[03:24:45.476 --> 03:24:54.305]  This is election meddling at a scale that Robert Mueller could have only dreamed of when he was fabricating his delusions of Russian interference in the election.
[03:24:55.285 --> 03:24:59.909]  In truth, the interference in the election is these tech giants.
[03:24:59.909 --> 03:25:01.210]  And they are doing it deliberately.
[03:25:01.210 --> 03:25:03.292]  They're engineering it every day.
[03:25:03.292 --> 03:25:09.398]  And if President Trump does not rise to the occasion and stop this, I don't see that he can get elected.
[03:25:09.398 --> 03:25:18.886]  I mean, even as disastrous as the Democrats are right now, you saw the debates, you saw the clown show, you saw how disastrous their ideas are.
[03:25:18.886 --> 03:25:21.648]  The only ideas they have are bad ideas.
[03:25:21.648 --> 03:25:22.049]  And yet,
[03:25:22.859 --> 03:25:35.644]  If President Trump does not take decisive action to stop this collusion of censorship among the criminal cartels of the tech giants, then Trump supporters will have no voice.
[03:25:35.644 --> 03:25:40.185]  Trump supporters will have no opportunity to debate in the public space.
[03:25:40.185 --> 03:25:42.366]  We're all being silenced every day.
[03:25:42.366 --> 03:25:50.989]  More channels being silenced and Trump will not win unless he takes decisive action and I hope that message is getting through to him very clearly.
[03:25:51.798 --> 03:25:53.679]  Another important point.
[03:25:53.679 --> 03:25:55.840]  Alex said this earlier in the show.
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:58.701]  The civil war in America has begun.
[03:25:58.701 --> 03:26:04.023]  The left is waging it and the right is doing nothing.
[03:26:04.023 --> 03:26:07.184]  The conservatives are just letting America be overrun.
[03:26:07.184 --> 03:26:09.985]  The left has launched a civil war.
[03:26:09.985 --> 03:26:11.546]  The left has launched their brown shirts.
[03:26:12.188 --> 03:26:24.298]  They've launched their terror wing, which is engaged in domestic terrorism, violence, the use of potentially lethal weapons against journalists like Andy Ngo and many others.
[03:26:24.298 --> 03:26:40.992]  The left is out of control and they will not stop until they are forced to be stopped by the intervention of probably the federal government or perhaps Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, which is exactly what needs to happen.
[03:26:41.624 --> 03:26:44.065]  And I agree with what Stuart Rhodes said the other day.
[03:26:44.065 --> 03:26:53.830]  Trump needs to put on his commander-in-chief hat, and he needs to invoke the Insurrection Act, and he needs to authorize action against Antifa terrorists.
[03:26:53.830 --> 03:26:58.453]  He needs to label them, designate them, a domestic terrorist organization.
[03:26:58.453 --> 03:27:06.917]  And after doing that, allow law enforcement to clean them out, arrest them, prosecute them, get them off the streets.
[03:27:06.917 --> 03:27:09.018]  These are radical, rabid,
[03:27:09.682 --> 03:27:13.906]  Terrorists committing acts of violence against innocent Americans.
[03:27:13.906 --> 03:27:15.947]  And of course, they're all wearing masks.
[03:27:15.947 --> 03:27:17.469]  And it's time to unmask them.
[03:27:17.469 --> 03:27:20.571]  And it's time to defang them, so to speak.
[03:27:20.571 --> 03:27:22.092]  It's time to take them off the streets.
[03:27:22.092 --> 03:27:26.256]  And it's time for American conservatives to stand their ground.
[03:27:27.290 --> 03:27:29.752]  Now, a word of warning in all of this.
[03:27:29.752 --> 03:27:38.499]  It's very clear to me that the entire media wants a conservative with a concealed carry permit to open fire on Antifa terrorists.
[03:27:38.499 --> 03:27:47.106]  They want to see that bloodshed and they would, of course, they would twist the story, they would edit the video, they would change the camera angles.
[03:27:47.904 --> 03:27:51.426]  They would do what they did to, was it Nick Sandman?
[03:27:51.426 --> 03:28:08.978]  The young Catholic school student who was completely smeared by the media even though he was only standing his ground and peacefully smiling as these radical left-wing activists continued to threaten him and smear him and try to get him to do something.
[03:28:08.978 --> 03:28:16.643]  But the media wants conservatives to open fire in self-defense because the media wants the narrative and it will go exactly like this.
[03:28:17.702 --> 03:28:28.886]  Today, Trump supporters openly shot and killed innocent, innocent progressives who were carrying milkshakes.
[03:28:28.886 --> 03:28:31.067]  That's going to be the story they want.
[03:28:31.067 --> 03:28:36.169]  They'll even take off the Antifa masks and show you the person without the Antifa garb, whatever it takes.
[03:28:36.169 --> 03:28:40.971]  They're going to try to twist the story and they want armed conflict to take place.
[03:28:40.971 --> 03:28:44.072]  Much more analysis straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:44.072 --> 03:28:45.472]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:28:45.472 --> 03:28:46.893]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:28:53.638 --> 03:29:04.682]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:55.645 --> 03:29:59.708]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:29:59.708 --> 03:30:02.891]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[03:30:02.891 --> 03:30:06.053]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks, as you've seen.
[03:30:06.053 --> 03:30:16.581]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you could say about people, that you knew they were liars.
[03:30:16.581 --> 03:30:18.282]  You went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[03:30:18.282 --> 03:30:23.386]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[03:30:23.626 --> 03:30:25.167]  You know that love is right back at you.
[03:30:25.167 --> 03:30:33.111]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[03:30:33.111 --> 03:30:38.134]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[03:30:38.134 --> 03:30:39.334]  The enemy could win.
[03:30:39.334 --> 03:30:41.476]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[03:30:41.476 --> 03:30:42.676]  We're being used by God.
[03:30:42.676 --> 03:30:43.917]  You're being used by God.
[03:30:43.917 --> 03:30:44.857]  This is Providence.
[03:30:44.857 --> 03:30:49.360]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[03:30:49.360 --> 03:30:53.042]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:30:55.089 --> 03:30:56.150]  The time has come.
[03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:57.131]  The time is here.
[03:30:57.131 --> 03:31:09.161]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[03:31:09.161 --> 03:31:20.691]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[03:31:20.791 --> 03:31:21.131]  We're good.
[03:31:39.451 --> 03:31:42.893]  Do your shopping with us, and we will continue on the face of this.

[03:31:54.915 --> 03:31:55.075]  It's
[03:32:14.138 --> 03:32:14.839]  We're good to go.
[03:32:43.542 --> 03:32:45.625]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:13.047 --> 03:33:16.310]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:33:16.310 --> 03:33:24.156]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:33:24.156 --> 03:33:25.817]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.817 --> 03:33:28.479]  Mike Adams filling in here from Natural News.
[03:33:28.479 --> 03:33:36.145]  Now this year, 2019, is the 30th anniversary of the discovery of so-called cold fusion.
[03:33:37.034 --> 03:33:44.541]  Coal Fusion, which has since been renamed Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, LENR, just pronounced LENR.
[03:33:44.541 --> 03:33:55.331]  Coal Fusion was first announced by two scientists, very widely recognized scientists, named Fleischmann and Pons, at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 1989.
[03:33:57.546 --> 03:34:04.268]  Now, what they had observed was excess heat production in a reaction that could not be a simple chemical reaction.
[03:34:04.268 --> 03:34:14.450]  It had to be, in fact, a low-energy nuclear reaction involving, in that case, a palladium matrix and heavy water, also known as deuterium.
[03:34:14.450 --> 03:34:21.552]  Now, this cold fusion reaction was never called cold fusion by the discoverers of it, Fleischmann and Pons.
[03:34:21.552 --> 03:34:26.433]  In fact, that name was put on them as the attacks began to happen.
[03:34:26.986 --> 03:34:38.114]  I want you to understand that the attacks you see today on Alex Jones, Infowars, or even myself or others in the independent media, the exact same thing was run against Fleischmann & Pons in 1989.
[03:34:38.114 --> 03:34:46.841]  Except they did not have their own websites to fight back with because the internet hardly even existed in 1989.
[03:34:46.841 --> 03:34:52.425]  So the entire establishment, including the entire what we would call mainstream media today, they colluded.
[03:34:53.143 --> 03:35:01.890]  To destroy the reputation of Fleischmann and Pons, they colluded to cover up one of this discovery, which is one of the greatest discoveries in human history.
[03:35:01.890 --> 03:35:11.738]  And the reason they did that was because there were billions of dollars being funded into the realm of so-called hot fusion.
[03:35:11.738 --> 03:35:19.264]  Hot fusion, which still has not produced a single excess calorie of heat to this day, as far as I know.
[03:35:21.089 --> 03:35:29.976]  Hot Fusion is still not working, and the current estimates are that Hot Fusion will take until the year 2060 just to produce a feasibility result.
[03:35:29.976 --> 03:35:41.064]  There's an organization named ITER, I-T-E-R, that's being constructed in France that is working on Hot Fusion with international money to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.
[03:35:41.064 --> 03:35:45.627]  But getting back to 1989, it was the Department of Energy that got involved.
[03:35:45.627 --> 03:35:48.890]  The DOE helped shut down Cold Fusion.
[03:35:49.716 --> 03:36:03.444]  And because the DOE really rules over nuclear energy production and the nuclear designs that we have today are engineered to produce nuclear fuel as a byproduct.
[03:36:03.444 --> 03:36:14.430]  And this is what has enabled, for example, former President Barack Obama to commit acts of treason by funneling nuclear technology to countries like Iran
[03:36:15.197 --> 03:36:19.960]  In some cases, claiming that it's just peacetime energy production.
[03:36:19.960 --> 03:36:25.023]  Or, back in the case of Bill Clinton, providing nuclear technology to North Korea.
[03:36:25.023 --> 03:36:27.405]  They said it was peacetime nuclear energy.
[03:36:27.405 --> 03:36:30.027]  It's infrastructure for the people of these countries.
[03:36:30.027 --> 03:36:34.109]  In truth, it's all designed to generate nuclear weapons.
[03:36:34.109 --> 03:36:42.535]  And in the case of Barack Obama, those nuclear weapons being funneled to Iran with international money laundering from the Obama administration
[03:36:43.223 --> 03:36:51.447]  Plus, nuclear fuel being sold through the Clinton... Well, how should we say this?
[03:36:51.447 --> 03:37:02.012]  Hillary Clinton and her foundation were part of the movement of nuclear fuel out of the United States, through Canada, to Russia, which eventually ended up in the hands of Iran.
[03:37:02.012 --> 03:37:03.833]  And this was all done by design.
[03:37:04.508 --> 03:37:08.010]  This was all done in order to provide Iran with nuclear weapons.
[03:37:08.010 --> 03:37:15.015]  And it all traces back to 1989, the attacks on Cold Fusion and why they had to keep the hot fusion realm alive.
[03:37:15.015 --> 03:37:20.379]  Understand that the globalists today, they want international nuclear war.
[03:37:20.379 --> 03:37:22.300]  They want destabilization.
[03:37:22.300 --> 03:37:27.924]  And most of all, they want enemies of America to be well armed with nuclear weapons.
[03:37:27.924 --> 03:37:30.206]  And in fact, these Democrats, like Bill Clinton,
[03:37:30.896 --> 03:37:38.617]  And Barack Obama have worked diligently over these years to provide the enemies of America with nuclear weapons capabilities.
[03:37:38.617 --> 03:37:42.078]  And their efforts will continue if there's another Democrat in the White House.
[03:37:42.078 --> 03:37:43.638]  They will do the same thing.
[03:37:43.638 --> 03:37:47.339]  Understand, and I think it's become apparent today, these people hate America.
[03:37:47.339 --> 03:37:49.359]  They want to see America destroyed.
[03:37:49.359 --> 03:37:51.920]  They wouldn't mind seeing America nuked.
[03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:59.601]  They certainly wouldn't mind seeing America's allies nuked, such as Israel in the Middle East, for example, or Japan being nuked by North Korea.
[03:38:00.433 --> 03:38:01.574]  Japan is a U.S.
[03:38:01.574 --> 03:38:11.140]  ally today, of course, and Japan is someone that helps bring stability to that region, a nation that helps bring stability.
[03:38:11.140 --> 03:38:13.361]  So it's very crucial to understand history here.
[03:38:13.361 --> 03:38:18.824]  A lot of you maybe haven't heard about cold fusion or low-energy nuclear reactions.
[03:38:18.824 --> 03:38:23.967]  If you want to get up to date on that, there is a podcast site that I made note of here.
[03:38:23.967 --> 03:38:26.089]  It's called coldfusionnow.org.
[03:38:27.415 --> 03:38:38.805]  And there, there's a host named Ruby, what is it, Carrot, Ruby Carrot, and she interviews people and she brings podcasts about what's happening in the realm of cold fusion.
[03:38:38.805 --> 03:38:42.549]  The truth is that these cold fusion experiments are being replicated now.
[03:38:42.549 --> 03:38:53.639]  They have been successfully recreated in hundreds of laboratories across the world, including laboratories in Japan, laboratories in Europe, in the United States, and other countries.
[03:38:54.270 --> 03:39:00.495]  And in fact, corporations like Toyota have invested money in low-energy nuclear reaction research.
[03:39:00.495 --> 03:39:08.901]  And believe it or not, Google is also invested through one of its subsidiaries in low-energy nuclear reaction research.
[03:39:08.901 --> 03:39:17.027]  What's fascinating to me is that when you have all these climate change cultists running around saying, oh, the climate's going to destroy us all.
[03:39:17.027 --> 03:39:18.809]  They say carbon dioxide is bad.
[03:39:18.809 --> 03:39:21.451]  They say fossil fuels will be the end of all of us.
[03:39:22.802 --> 03:39:29.765]  There's hardly... I can't think of one of them that has gone out and said, we need cold fusion.
[03:39:29.765 --> 03:39:32.086]  We need low-energy nuclear reactions.
[03:39:32.086 --> 03:39:33.807]  That technology exists.
[03:39:33.807 --> 03:39:36.648]  It has been covered up by the Department of Energy, i.e.
[03:39:36.648 --> 03:39:40.870]  the war machine in America, the military-industrial complex.
[03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:44.831]  And it is exactly individuals like President Trump who threatens to
[03:39:46.607 --> 03:39:52.953]  Cause an upheaval that could unleash this technology for the benefit of humankind.
[03:39:52.953 --> 03:40:02.882]  Imagine heating your home in the winter with a small machine that is no bigger than a modern day computer server.
[03:40:02.882 --> 03:40:07.727]  You know, smaller than your dishwasher, but it heats your home.
[03:40:08.484 --> 03:40:09.885]  We're virtually free.
[03:40:09.885 --> 03:40:20.012]  Imagine eating businesses, warehouses, and farm and agricultural buildings, which consume a tremendous amount of fossil fuels throughout the winters.
[03:40:20.012 --> 03:40:25.777]  All of that is producing CO2, which I say CO2 is a healing molecule.
[03:40:25.777 --> 03:40:26.877]  It's a greening molecule.
[03:40:26.877 --> 03:40:27.698]  It's good for plants.
[03:40:28.394 --> 03:40:40.599]  But the climate change people say CO2 is a poison and a pollutant, and yet you don't see them saying, let's use cold fusion to heat homes and buildings and farms and warehouses and schools.
[03:40:40.599 --> 03:40:45.361]  You don't see them saying that, which proves they're not really interested in solving the problem.
[03:40:45.361 --> 03:40:47.002]  They just want something to complain about.
[03:40:47.577 --> 03:40:49.779]  They're whiners, just like everything the left does.
[03:40:49.779 --> 03:40:51.019]  They want victims.
[03:40:51.019 --> 03:40:55.763]  They want the dead dad and the dead child in the river crossing the border.
[03:40:55.763 --> 03:40:57.804]  They want destitution.
[03:40:57.804 --> 03:40:59.145]  They want homelessness.
[03:40:59.145 --> 03:41:05.650]  Austin just passed a law to have tent cities and shantytowns all over the public streets and sidewalks of Austin.
[03:41:05.650 --> 03:41:08.512]  They want to turn Austin into San Francisco, I guess, or Seattle.
[03:41:09.139 --> 03:41:14.180]  And you have all these liberal cities are now expanding into mass homelessness.
[03:41:14.180 --> 03:41:15.641]  That is by design.
[03:41:15.641 --> 03:41:17.721]  Understand that's on purpose.
[03:41:17.721 --> 03:41:19.762]  They want problems in our world.
[03:41:19.762 --> 03:41:22.603]  They don't want any solutions whatsoever.
[03:41:22.603 --> 03:41:29.525]  So when Trump comes along and says, I'm going to bring solutions to this, Trump says, I'm going to solve this international trade disparity.
[03:41:29.525 --> 03:41:35.426]  Trump says, I'm going to, I'm going to fight this currency war against China, which is constantly devaluing its own currency.
[03:41:35.426 --> 03:41:37.587]  Trump is a solutions oriented kind of guy.
[03:41:38.300 --> 03:41:40.562]  And that's why he is hated by the establishment.
[03:41:40.562 --> 03:41:42.764]  Because the establishment needs problems.
[03:41:42.764 --> 03:41:46.908]  The establishment needs scarcity of fossil fuels.
[03:41:46.908 --> 03:41:52.953]  They cannot allow solutions to be publicized and shared with the public.
[03:41:52.953 --> 03:41:57.037]  Look, we already have the answers, folks, to all of these problems.
[03:41:57.037 --> 03:41:59.959]  We can create essentially free heat.
[03:41:59.959 --> 03:42:01.380]  We have the answers to cancer.
[03:42:01.380 --> 03:42:03.803]  We can solve the cancer epidemic.
[03:42:03.803 --> 03:42:05.164]  We know how to solve
[03:42:06.028 --> 03:42:07.129]  Joblessness.
[03:42:07.129 --> 03:42:08.851]  We know how to solve homelessness.
[03:42:08.851 --> 03:42:12.514]  We know how to stop infectious diseases from spreading.
[03:42:12.514 --> 03:42:15.096]  We have, in fact, we have advanced propulsion systems.
[03:42:15.096 --> 03:42:20.621]  We know how to travel and explore other planets with much greater efficiency.
[03:42:20.621 --> 03:42:28.068]  All these solutions exist, but they're all being suppressed and shut down by the establishment that wants to keep humanity weak.
[03:42:28.695 --> 03:42:33.817]  And keep humanity enslaved and keep you dumbed down and keep you ignorant.
[03:42:33.817 --> 03:42:37.998]  Google and the tech giants have become realms of anti-knowledge.
[03:42:37.998 --> 03:42:39.999]  They no longer allow you to find real knowledge.
[03:42:39.999 --> 03:42:43.060]  It's all about teaching you falsehoods and lies.
[03:42:43.060 --> 03:42:46.341]  That's the reality of the world in which we live today and that's what we're fighting.
[03:42:46.341 --> 03:42:48.342]  Tear that down and free humanity.
[03:42:48.342 --> 03:42:50.783]  We'll be back with much more right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:53.502 --> 03:42:57.728]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.728 --> 03:43:08.121]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.121 --> 03:43:11.265]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[03:43:11.425 --> 03:43:11.826]  I don't know.
[03:43:27.549 --> 03:43:45.319]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.319 --> 03:43:52.023]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:53.493 --> 03:43:56.055]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[03:43:56.055 --> 03:44:03.943]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[03:44:03.943 --> 03:44:07.606]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[03:44:07.606 --> 03:44:08.527]  We need to end here.
[03:44:08.527 --> 03:44:09.848]  We need to be provisioned.
[03:44:09.848 --> 03:44:13.131]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward
[03:44:13.131 --> 03:44:13.331]  We're good.
[03:44:31.278 --> 03:44:37.585]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[03:44:37.585 --> 03:44:38.686]  We're unstoppable together.
[03:44:38.686 --> 03:44:40.108]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[03:44:40.108 --> 03:44:47.135]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[03:44:47.135 --> 03:44:48.116]  You have my commitment.
[03:44:48.116 --> 03:44:52.481]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[03:44:54.824 --> 03:44:56.226]  There is no longer any doubt.
[03:44:56.226 --> 03:45:02.113]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[03:45:02.113 --> 03:45:04.156]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[03:45:04.156 --> 03:45:05.738]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[03:45:05.738 --> 03:45:06.879]  World government is here.
[03:45:06.879 --> 03:45:08.221]  Now is the time for decision.
[03:45:08.221 --> 03:45:11.225]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[03:45:11.305 --> 03:45:21.509]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag, and attacking the family, and that are attacking our borders, and our country, and our military, and our heritage, if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[03:45:21.509 --> 03:45:23.750]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:26.571]  And that means buying products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:26.571 --> 03:45:32.653]  And that means praying for Infowars, and praying for President Trump, and praying for yourself, and praying for peace, praying for justice.
[03:45:32.653 --> 03:45:34.934]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.
[03:45:35.094 --> 03:45:36.755]  Because we're running out of a lot of the best-selling items.
[03:45:36.755 --> 03:45:38.877]  We have store-wide free shipping.

[03:45:55.379 --> 03:45:56.440]  The time has come.
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:45:57.420]  The time is here.
[03:45:57.420 --> 03:46:09.446]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[03:46:09.446 --> 03:46:16.589]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status.
[03:46:16.789 --> 03:46:17.610]  And the U.N.
[03:46:17.610 --> 03:46:21.834]  and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the U.S.
[03:46:21.834 --> 03:46:29.201]  to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism, so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[03:46:29.201 --> 03:46:30.201]  This is a plan.
[03:46:30.201 --> 03:46:31.363]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[03:46:31.363 --> 03:46:33.865]  It's why you've got to keep fighting, because we're going to win this in the end.
[03:46:34.025 --> 03:46:37.146]  Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible.
[03:46:37.146 --> 03:46:43.167]  So I salute you, and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us, and we will continue on the face of this.
[03:46:43.167 --> 03:46:57.150]  InfoWareStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, whatever you do, commit now to history, and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[03:46:57.150 --> 03:46:59.771]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.287 --> 03:47:16.988]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:47:16.988 --> 03:47:19.289]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:47:19.289 --> 03:47:25.230]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.230 --> 03:47:28.230]  I guarantee you that you're not ready for what's coming.
[03:47:28.230 --> 03:47:35.852]  The reason I know you're not ready is because I've been prepping in one way or another for over 20 years and I'm not ready.
[03:47:35.852 --> 03:47:36.612]  Unless you are
[03:47:37.384 --> 03:47:41.985]  Sort of a lifelong professional prepper, there's no way you can be ready for what's coming.
[03:47:41.985 --> 03:47:51.348]  And when I say what's coming, I'm talking about an accelerating, cascading collapse of what you know as civil society and the infrastructure that serves that society today.
[03:47:51.348 --> 03:47:58.210]  So this segment is going to be about collapse and some of the things that you can do to insulate yourself right now.
[03:47:58.210 --> 03:48:00.631]  I was, um, there's a
[03:48:01.405 --> 03:48:05.626]  By the way, a couple of movies that you need to watch or re-watch that I'm going to recommend here.
[03:48:05.626 --> 03:48:10.407]  Number one, remember Book of Eli with Denzel Washington?
[03:48:10.407 --> 03:48:23.451]  And his character was roaming through a collapsed post-apocalyptic world where there had been some kind of war, some kind of grid-down scenario, maybe nuclear war, it wasn't really clear in the movie.
[03:48:23.451 --> 03:48:28.372]  But in that scenario, all the ammo had already been used.
[03:48:29.099 --> 03:48:32.721]  So this was the post-ammunition world.
[03:48:32.721 --> 03:48:49.549]  Now, it's important to realize that no matter how much ammunition you stockpile, and those of us who are patriots, of course, think maybe we have plenty of ammunition, there's a point where it runs out and the manufacture of ammunition requires a complex society.
[03:48:49.549 --> 03:48:53.631]  So it's not so easy to make clean-burning gunpowder.
[03:48:54.324 --> 03:48:57.126]  It's not so easy to make the brass casings.
[03:48:57.126 --> 03:48:59.528]  It's not so easy to make the primers.
[03:48:59.528 --> 03:49:01.089]  Right now, you buy those things online.
[03:49:01.089 --> 03:49:05.553]  You buy the bullets, you buy the powder, you buy the brass, you buy the primers.
[03:49:05.553 --> 03:49:10.637]  You know, you put them together in your reloading center in your garage or whatever.
[03:49:10.637 --> 03:49:13.980]  But imagine a world where you can't buy those components.
[03:49:13.980 --> 03:49:15.461]  How do you make those on your own?
[03:49:15.461 --> 03:49:16.442]  You can't.
[03:49:16.442 --> 03:49:19.004]  It requires a complex society to make those pieces.
[03:49:19.801 --> 03:49:45.512]  And when society collapses, that complexity, what we call the specialization of those certain things, like the ability to smelt metals and create metal alloys and so on, the ability to refine gunpowder raw materials and so on, those specializations collapse and you end up in a very rudimentary society which has to return to some level of agrarian society where people are growing most of their own food in order to survive.
[03:49:45.512 --> 03:49:48.773]  And the weapon systems that are used in those times are, guess what?
[03:49:49.540 --> 03:49:53.423]  Edged weapons, that's what was depicted in the movie with Denzel Washington.
[03:49:53.423 --> 03:49:59.567]  Edged weapons, and bow and arrow, and yes, your crossbow.
[03:49:59.567 --> 03:50:02.449]  Because everybody's got a crossbow for some reason out there.
[03:50:02.449 --> 03:50:03.189]  And guess what?
[03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:06.652]  It actually has a purpose after the ammunition runs out.
[03:50:06.652 --> 03:50:09.273]  But that could be a long period of time after collapse.
[03:50:09.273 --> 03:50:14.337]  Ammo will reign supreme for a period of time, because guess what?
[03:50:14.337 --> 03:50:17.239]  Firearms work even when the power grid collapses.
[03:50:17.839 --> 03:50:21.342]  And this is what I find hilarious about the whole argument about smart guns.
[03:50:21.342 --> 03:50:27.966]  So you see these liberal anti-gun politicians always pushing smart guns in their cities.
[03:50:27.966 --> 03:50:29.767]  They want everybody to buy a smart gun.
[03:50:29.767 --> 03:50:31.208]  Well, what's a smart gun?
[03:50:31.208 --> 03:50:34.230]  It's a gun that has electronics, which will fail.
[03:50:34.230 --> 03:50:39.154]  So everybody who has a smart gun... I mean, look, if I'm in a post-collapse scenario,
[03:50:39.918 --> 03:50:47.142]  And I've got my BCM-AR, my Recce 14.5 inch barrel or whatever.
[03:50:47.142 --> 03:50:54.247]  I would love to fight with a bunch of people who have smart guns, because all their guns will fail.
[03:50:54.247 --> 03:51:05.754]  The batteries will run out, the circuit boards will be blown out by EMP weapons or solar flares, or that fingerprint scan won't work that day because they're sweating too much because they're taking rounds.
[03:51:05.754 --> 03:51:06.214]  You know what I mean?
[03:51:07.111 --> 03:51:08.351]  I would never buy a smart gun.
[03:51:08.351 --> 03:51:09.852]  I would never rely on a smart gun.
[03:51:09.852 --> 03:51:14.573]  I would never even rely entirely on electronic optics.
[03:51:14.573 --> 03:51:15.753]  You got to have iron sights.
[03:51:15.753 --> 03:51:18.014]  You got to make sure your backup sights work.
[03:51:18.014 --> 03:51:22.895]  So firearms work even when the power grid goes down.
[03:51:22.895 --> 03:51:25.156]  Think about the world.
[03:51:25.156 --> 03:51:32.798]  Even we talk about cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin or Mark of the Beast, Facebook's new Libra coin, I think they call it, global coin.
[03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:38.152]  All those cryptocurrencies stop working when the power grid goes down.
[03:51:38.152 --> 03:51:39.773]  What still works?
[03:51:39.773 --> 03:51:43.875]  Again, depicted in the movie, The Book of Eli, what has value?
[03:51:43.875 --> 03:51:45.755]  Clean water has value.
[03:51:45.755 --> 03:51:47.936]  Gold and silver coins have value.
[03:51:47.936 --> 03:51:51.398]  Working flip-open lighters have value.
[03:51:51.398 --> 03:51:52.959]  Edge weapons have value.
[03:51:52.959 --> 03:51:58.661]  Firearms have value, and especially ammunition has value because it's very scarce at that point.
[03:51:58.661 --> 03:52:02.123]  So don't forget how quickly society can collapse.
[03:52:03.154 --> 03:52:27.756]  There's also another movie out there called Captive State that I strongly recommend you watch, and it basically presents the same premise as the Colony series, which talks about a non-Earth extraterrestrial alien force occupying Earth and controlling society, and human beings being put into slave camps to work for the aliens.
[03:52:27.756 --> 03:52:28.357]  And the reason
[03:52:29.648 --> 03:52:34.309]  The reason this movie is so important to watch, Captive State is very well done.
[03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:36.470]  It's a very realistic kind of aura.
[03:52:36.470 --> 03:52:40.230]  The settings and the acting is all absolutely amazing.
[03:52:40.230 --> 03:52:43.611]  John Goodman stars in this movie along with some younger stars.
[03:52:43.611 --> 03:52:44.691]  It's a fantastic film.
[03:52:44.691 --> 03:52:46.632]  I strongly recommend you watch it.
[03:52:46.632 --> 03:52:51.293]  But look how quickly some factions of humankind
[03:52:51.946 --> 03:53:03.270]  I think it's good to watch this and to understand that when it comes down to it, whether we're talking about occupation by United Nations troops or whether we're talking about, you know, something more out there like what's depicted in the film.
[03:53:17.652 --> 03:53:23.894]  Most people will turn against humanity if given some reward for doing so.
[03:53:23.894 --> 03:53:25.854]  Very few people operate with ethics.
[03:53:25.854 --> 03:53:31.256]  Very few people will stand their ground with morality and the rule of law.
[03:53:31.256 --> 03:53:36.557]  Very few people will do what's right when it is so much easier for them to do what's wrong.
[03:53:36.557 --> 03:53:41.358]  And so, when you think about the collapse of society today, we're already seeing this emerge.
[03:53:41.358 --> 03:53:43.799]  We're seeing Antifa, terrorists, take to the streets.
[03:53:44.756 --> 03:53:49.920]  And beat people, and rob people, and violently assault people with deadly weapons.
[03:53:49.920 --> 03:53:51.781]  People who are innocent journalists.
[03:53:51.781 --> 03:53:55.324]  In fact, in the case of Andy Ngo, a gay conservative journalist.
[03:53:55.324 --> 03:53:56.365]  I think he's conservative.
[03:53:56.365 --> 03:53:57.145]  Maybe he's not.
[03:53:57.145 --> 03:53:58.947]  Maybe he's more libertarian.
[03:53:58.947 --> 03:54:09.374]  He's a gay journalist, and they attacked him, showing how quickly they were willing to turn against humanity, and turn against their own so-called philosophy.
[03:54:09.374 --> 03:54:13.117]  Antifa also recently defaced a Chick-fil-A restaurant.
[03:54:14.387 --> 03:54:21.430]  And they're putting graffiti, they're trying to destroy private property, they're trying to destroy businesses.
[03:54:21.430 --> 03:54:23.611]  And they do this in the name of love.
[03:54:23.611 --> 03:54:38.517]  So understand that this escalation of violence will always be carried out in the name of love and peace and tolerance by the very same lunatics on the left who are filled with hatred, filled with violence, filled with bigotry.
[03:54:39.449 --> 03:54:46.453]  And they will target people based on the color of their skin, or based on their political philosophies.
[03:54:46.453 --> 03:54:50.355]  And the collapse of society is accelerating so rapidly right now.
[03:54:50.355 --> 03:54:57.019]  It's also being accelerated with this attempt by the left to flood the United States with illegal migrants.
[03:54:57.019 --> 03:54:59.320]  Illegal aliens.
[03:54:59.320 --> 03:55:05.784]  By flooding the southern border of the United States, they place a burden on all southern states.
[03:55:05.784 --> 03:55:07.445]  You know, Texas, Arizona, California, and so on.
[03:55:08.286 --> 03:55:13.449]  And by doing that, what they do is they destabilize part of society.
[03:55:13.449 --> 03:55:21.714]  And they require then a shifting of resources to deal with those individuals taking away resources from things like law and order.
[03:55:21.714 --> 03:55:27.298]  When you have to send police to deal with these illegals like what happened in New Mexico.
[03:55:27.298 --> 03:55:33.782]  They took state police from all across the state and they sent them into Albuquerque to manage a migrant detention center.
[03:55:36.147 --> 03:55:39.228]  And by doing that, it took away these resources from across the state.
[03:55:39.228 --> 03:55:42.550]  So then you start to have lawlessness spreading out across America.
[03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:46.512]  You have increased costs to society based on the lawlessness.
[03:55:46.512 --> 03:55:48.553]  You have more home robberies.
[03:55:48.553 --> 03:55:49.933]  You have more rapes.
[03:55:49.933 --> 03:55:52.315]  You have more crimes that have to be prosecuted.
[03:55:52.315 --> 03:55:54.936]  This is what helps bring down society.
[03:55:54.936 --> 03:56:01.799]  This invasion of America is a planned event to destroy the United States of America from within.
[03:56:02.478 --> 03:56:06.122]  This is why President Trump must invoke the Insurrection Act.
[03:56:06.122 --> 03:56:09.426]  He must deploy the military to the border.
[03:56:09.426 --> 03:56:11.328]  He must stop this invasion.
[03:56:11.328 --> 03:56:22.121]  And frankly, he must arrest and indict all of those on the radical left who are complicit in this invasion, including these twisted federal judges who think they run the country.
[03:56:22.890 --> 03:56:27.972]  It's time to just send in the military police, arrest those judges, and say, you are not the president.
[03:56:27.972 --> 03:56:31.973]  Your little district decision here does not control America.
[03:56:31.973 --> 03:56:36.055]  We have a right to defend our country, a right to defend our nation.
[03:56:36.055 --> 03:56:44.258]  One other point in all of this, you may have noticed yesterday, the internet was down virtually every website that you know, from Drudge, Gateway Pundit, maybe InfoWars.
[03:56:44.258 --> 03:56:47.099]  I know Natural News was down for, I think, 12 minutes or so.
[03:56:47.099 --> 03:56:50.460]  It was a cloud flare problem.
[03:56:50.993 --> 03:56:59.621]  That cascaded throughout the system, and it brought almost everything down that you can imagine, and it caused havoc and chaos throughout the day.
[03:56:59.621 --> 03:57:08.549]  We have seen more and more of these failures across the Internet recently, showing the massive vulnerabilities of the telecom and Internet infrastructure.
[03:57:08.549 --> 03:57:16.896]  We are seeing the Internet is not resilient, it is not robust, and it can be brought down by one problem with one provider, in this case, Cloudflare.
[03:57:17.771 --> 03:57:21.133]  That can also be exploited as a kill switch.
[03:57:21.133 --> 03:57:30.718]  In other words, someone could force Cloudflare to take down all those websites by recreating the same problem they experienced the other day, and it would take down most of the internet.
[03:57:30.718 --> 03:57:37.941]  So, we are not resilient, we are not robust, and our society is subject to a cascading, accelerating failure.
[03:57:37.941 --> 03:57:39.462]  That's the truth about what's happening.
[03:57:39.462 --> 03:57:40.282]  Thanks for watching today.
[03:57:40.282 --> 03:57:42.584]  Mike Adams here for InfoWars.com.
[03:57:42.584 --> 03:57:43.044]  Get prepared.
[03:57:43.882 --> 03:57:55.938]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[03:57:55.938 --> 03:57:58.822]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[03:57:59.783 --> 03:58:06.766]  Okay, but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000 that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[03:58:06.766 --> 03:58:09.928]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[03:58:09.928 --> 03:58:11.549]  I want to expand, not contract.
[03:58:11.549 --> 03:58:14.010]  And for six months, we've not been able to stand still.
[03:58:14.010 --> 03:58:18.333]  The enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[03:58:18.613 --> 03:58:19.574]  I like to be expanding.
[03:58:19.574 --> 03:58:20.335]  I like to be winning.
[03:58:20.335 --> 03:58:21.055]  I like to be fighting.
[03:58:21.055 --> 03:58:22.236]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[03:58:22.236 --> 03:58:23.117]  That's why we're so hated.
[03:58:23.117 --> 03:58:24.739]  But we need to be retreaded.
[03:58:24.739 --> 03:58:25.940]  We need to be tuned up.
[03:58:25.940 --> 03:58:27.021]  We need to be fixed up.
[03:58:27.021 --> 03:58:28.342]  We never have time to get in a drive-up.
[03:58:28.342 --> 03:58:29.883]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[03:58:29.883 --> 03:58:34.728]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[03:58:34.728 --> 03:58:36.729]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[03:58:36.729 --> 03:58:39.572]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[03:58:39.572 --> 03:58:41.013]  Funded by foreign banks and the Chi-Com.
[03:58:41.013 --> 03:58:42.655]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[03:58:44.394 --> 03:58:45.735]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:58:45.735 --> 03:58:46.515]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:58:46.515 --> 03:58:47.075]  Thanks for holding.
[03:58:47.075 --> 03:58:47.616]  Hey, Alex.
[03:58:47.616 --> 03:58:50.437]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:58:50.437 --> 03:58:56.541]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:58:56.541 --> 03:59:05.346]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:59:05.346 --> 03:59:06.326]  That's it.
[03:59:06.326 --> 03:59:09.148]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:59:09.148 --> 03:59:12.009]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:59:12.009 --> 03:59:13.290]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.450 --> 03:59:14.210]  I agree entirely.
[03:59:14.210 --> 03:59:19.653]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.653 --> 03:59:22.455]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:59:22.455 --> 03:59:24.516]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:59:24.516 --> 03:59:33.760]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.760 --> 03:59:35.661]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:59:35.661 --> 03:59:42.144]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:42.144 --> 03:59:43.085]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:59:46.563 --> 03:59:49.175]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
