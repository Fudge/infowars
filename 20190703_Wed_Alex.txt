[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:43.000]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are disgrace.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.000]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  These women were being told by CBP officers to drink out of the toilet.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  Excuse me, I think this might be Gatorade or something. I was just looking for some regular water.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  Water? Yeah.
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  You mean like in the toilet?
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  One of the women said that she was told by an agent to drink water out of the toilet.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  What for?
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  Just to drink.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  Out of the toilet.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  What you're saying is that you want us to put water on the crops.
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.000]  Yes.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  Water, like out the toilet?
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  Well, I mean it doesn't have to be out of the toilet, but yeah, that's the idea.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  Out of the toilet.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Out of the toilet.
[01:39.000 --> 01:47.000]  Do you think that we should be using more brondo on the crops in Africa to help alleviate the food shortage and the droughts over there?
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  Yes.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  Any other comments on the brondo being used in Africa that's helping the crops?
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  Definitely if they got it over there, they should get more out there to help them out and get the resources they need to stay healthy and alive.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  More brondo. It's got electrolytes and what plants need.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  For the last time, I'm pretty sure what's killing the crops is this brondo stuff.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  The brondo's got what plants crave. It's got electrolytes.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know that if you put water on plants, they grow.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  Well, I've never seen no plants grow out of no toilet.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  That's good. You sure you ain't the smartest guy in the world?
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  Yeah.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:27.000 --> 02:28.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  Out of the toilet.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  Clown world is deadly dangerous so, ladies and gentlemen, every time it goes this way and any other nation you end up with
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  mass starvation, collapse of civilization warlords and death camps.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  The Democratic party, being financed by the chai cons and others, is showing its true colors.
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.480]  gone to seed, it's simply showing you what it's really all about. Wow. Let's just begin with this.
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.200]  Representative wants to prosecute people who mock Congress, and there's a whole bunch of people
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.000]  on her Twitter account praising it, saying it's time to start arresting anyone that disagrees
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.120]  with Democrats. That's Representative Frederica Wilson of Florida. And she's not a lunatic,
[03:21.120 --> 03:27.200]  she's an authoritarian, and she's already gotten away with so much that she believes she can just
[03:27.200 --> 03:33.520]  do it. Now here she is at a public speech calling for people that make fun of buffoons like her
[03:34.080 --> 03:43.280]  to be arrested. Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are this
[03:43.280 --> 03:51.680]  grace. And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable. We're going to shut them down
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.000]  and work with whoever it is to shut them down, and they should be prosecuted.
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.720]  They should be prosecuted. She goes on to praise Big Tech and the crackdown on, well, you know who.
[04:03.840 --> 04:06.640]  And they have hearings in Congress where they lie about me to my face,
[04:06.640 --> 04:11.680]  and I can't speak at the hearing while they trash me sitting up there. Only in the authoritarian
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.040]  America run by the Democrats, ladies and gentlemen, where the Republicans are all extremely intimidated
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.320]  at the leadership level and run screaming in fear. Even Fox News was like, well, maybe we should ban
[04:24.000 --> 04:32.240]  the Betsy Ross flag. Maybe it is bad. Maybe it is hurtful. Maybe the American flag is something
[04:32.240 --> 04:38.000]  that needs to be. I mean, they're having 50-50 discussions on Fox News where one sides act,
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.120]  well, this is preposterous. Well, this is very reasonable. We told you it was coming,
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.720]  and it's here. Wait till we come back, ladies and gentlemen. This is just one hell of a transmission.
[04:49.360 --> 04:55.120]  The Border Patrol has come out and said that AOC is a complete liar, and they have the videos
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.160]  of her basically herself assaulting the Border Patrol inside.

[06:04.320 --> 06:08.400]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[06:08.400 --> 06:18.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:22.480 --> 06:30.960]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.960 --> 06:40.240]  Thank you for joining us, my friends, on this historic July 3rd, 2019. In defiance of the
[06:40.240 --> 06:45.200]  globalist attacks, their lies, their attempts to criminally set us up, their lawsuits,
[06:46.160 --> 06:51.200]  in defiance of all they've done, we are still on air. Thanks to you, the viewers, thanks to you,
[06:51.200 --> 06:56.480]  the listeners, thanks to your prayers, your spreading the word, and your financial support we
[06:56.480 --> 07:04.560]  have with Stood the Storm and come out battered and scarred, but stronger and more ready for the
[07:04.560 --> 07:11.120]  next phase of our take back of the Republic and then the take back of the planet for a pro-human
[07:11.120 --> 07:20.800]  future and destiny. Let me do this as good as I can because I want to just tell you what I have
[07:20.800 --> 07:27.520]  in the stacks here and what's breaking and what's coming out. You are seeing a full-on globalist
[07:27.520 --> 07:37.760]  attack using a classic communist divide and conquer, culture war, race war, sexes war, playbook.
[07:40.080 --> 07:46.400]  We are witnessing an attempted overthrow of the country and if Hillary would have gotten in,
[07:46.400 --> 07:50.480]  she would have done this regardless, but now they're doing it even though they don't have full
[07:50.480 --> 07:56.400]  control of the executive. This country is in a civil war between factions and the government.
[07:57.040 --> 08:02.960]  You see all the big major Fortune 500 weighing in with anti-God, anti-family,
[08:04.080 --> 08:11.120]  just venom meant to collapse this nation and it's not just in the old Cloward and Piven documents,
[08:11.120 --> 08:19.200]  it's not just in the old admitted communist blueprints, it's in the WikiLeaks that we're being
[08:19.200 --> 08:25.440]  demoralized, we're being attacked. Everything is being weaponized to create absolute division,
[08:26.960 --> 08:33.440]  but America is not buying it and the system is putting out fake polls. Every poll you see is
[08:33.440 --> 08:40.160]  10, 20, 30 points more towards nationalism, Christianity, Trump, info wars, free speech.
[08:41.120 --> 08:44.880]  And Trump understands that now and he's been talking about that in speeches because that's
[08:44.880 --> 08:49.920]  what their own real polls they're doing or showing, but they are coming after our speech
[08:50.560 --> 08:54.960]  like a ton of bricks and they're calling for violent overthrow of the government,
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.520]  they're calling for physical revolution, they're calling for any means necessary and now
[09:00.240 --> 09:07.840]  representative wants to prosecute people who mock Congress, openly calls for criminal prosecution
[09:07.840 --> 09:13.040]  of free speech and says she will work with those, the Southern Barbery Law Center, the ADL, Media
[09:13.040 --> 09:21.280]  Matters, Microsoft, Apple, Google to shut them up and shut them down. Remember the view host
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.480]  saying shut them down, shut them up and all the other shows, shut not just Alex Jones down,
[09:26.480 --> 09:32.880]  shut them all down, shut them all up. I could play hours of them saying this
[09:34.080 --> 09:36.400]  and so she's giving a little glimpse into the back room meetings.
[09:36.400 --> 09:44.000]  That is going to be coming up at the start of the next segment that she says,
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.920]  arrest anyone critical of Congress. You're like, well, that sounds preposterous. No,
[09:49.920 --> 09:56.240]  they're planning to make their move. Oh, and 40 minutes of an internal secret
[09:57.040 --> 10:03.120]  anti-famating that they are well-ingly called a community meeting, you get to see the slime
[10:03.120 --> 10:07.840]  with their mask off, the slime that crawled out of George Soros's rear end.
[10:09.440 --> 10:18.320]  You can see these grimy, slimy maggots and you can see all the assaults and all the things
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.520]  they're planning to do on July 4th, July 5th and July 6th. We're going to have reporters,
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.480]  they're covering it, but it is just incredible. That's coming up.
[10:28.480 --> 10:40.080]  We also have the latest on the banning of the Betsy Ross first American flag commissioned by
[10:40.080 --> 10:45.360]  George Washington himself that actually flew behind Obama at his inauguration.
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.640]  They are now moving to the next phase of making you hate your flag and your country.
[10:51.280 --> 10:55.120]  When you get conquered, they take your flag away. That's just a little note in history.
[10:55.120 --> 11:02.320]  The New Mexico governor jumps in on cabinet situation saying it's wrong. The California
[11:02.320 --> 11:08.000]  governor says that it's good what they're doing, that America is bad. This is just amazing. The
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  majority of Democrats say they don't like America in polls. The majority of Republicans say they
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.520]  do. I mean, the Democrats are the globalist anti-American party. The New York Times publishes
[11:17.520 --> 11:24.160]  a big article saying America sucks and isn't good. That's who these slime bags are. The
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.680]  collaborators with the foreign money. They're traitors and they'll sell you out. They'll sell
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.960]  your family out. Also, I watched probably 20 minutes of this last night. There's all these
[11:34.960 --> 11:41.360]  different angles of it because it goes on for reportedly over an hour. A well-known black
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.560]  rapper, a rap group, comes down. They've got a huge bodyguard. They're all big black guys.
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.320]  These little Islamic Arabs come up and start slapping them and hitting them in the head.
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.640]  The black guys don't want any trouble, so they let them slap them and hit them. They keep trying
[11:56.640 --> 12:04.560]  to get away so the little rats chase them and get their ass totally beat in. Now, you have to
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.200]  understand. This is like if you've ever had a duck or something attacking because it's never had
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.520]  anybody kick it upside the head. You weigh 200 pounds. It comes up attacking you. You just have
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.400]  a shotgun in its face blast it if you want to. It's the same thing here. You've got guys that
[12:18.400 --> 12:25.600]  probably weigh 130 pounds coming up to a black dude probably weighs 330 pounds most of it muscle.
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.720]  A giant black bodyguard. I mean, I'm sure he'd beat up probably 95% of the population,
[12:32.720 --> 12:36.160]  take Mike Tyson to give him a run for his money. The other black guys are big too.
[12:38.240 --> 12:42.080]  They're well-known rappers that came from the streets. Probably not wimpy dudes. Probably been
[12:42.080 --> 12:48.080]  a couple hundred fights each. I grew up in Dallas. You just don't want to randomly start a fight
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.640]  with three big black dudes or four big black dudes. The black guys obviously don't want to end
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.800]  up going to jail when they hurt these guys, but they go ahead and beat the living hell out of them
[12:56.800 --> 13:01.840]  because see the black guys didn't know they were there playing at a venue the night before
[13:03.200 --> 13:12.080]  that is in a no-go zone. And so they're just trying to leave and being attacked. That's up on
[13:12.080 --> 13:18.160]  infowars.com and newswars.com. So four or five black guys, there's also you guys filming,
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.800]  see three or four, but there's more. They come out of their hotel, try to go to a restaurant,
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.440]  they're in a no-go zone and Muslims start slapping their headphones over their heads so hard that
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.080]  the big black dudes bleeding. Now he doesn't kill them at that point. I would have assaulted them
[13:34.080 --> 13:43.120]  because they assaulted me, but it goes on and on and on until they reportedly the guys were
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.800]  unconscious when they were loaded on ambulances. And in about 30 seconds the black guys beat the
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.880]  Muslim Arabs to a pulp once they start attacking them. Now they grab and just slam their heads in
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.680]  the ground and they get on top of them and just start bashing their heads in. That's how you kick
[13:57.680 --> 14:02.000]  somebody's ass. You slam them down the ground, you jump on top of them, and you start breaking their
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.400]  jaw. That's how you kick somebody's ass. You get them on the ground and you beat their brains out.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.640]  Now just imagine, this happened to our reporters when they tried to go to no-go zones. The media
[14:10.640 --> 14:18.320]  said don't exist. Up to a third of Paris is a no-go zone. Up to a third of places like Paris
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.520]  or more are no-go zones and it keeps expanding. You bring in people that are tribal and you bring
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.360]  in people that are used to running everyone they don't know out of their neighborhood and then you
[14:27.360 --> 14:32.320]  worship them and kiss their ass and they can rape women, they can rob, they can burn cars, they can
[14:32.320 --> 14:40.640]  steal. It's unbelievable. But see, these weren't Europeans taught to be cucked and beat up by these
[14:40.640 --> 14:49.280]  120, 130-pound idiots. They're like, hey dude, we don't want to hurt you. Stop. Let me just tell
[14:49.280 --> 14:52.640]  you something right now. Slap me across the head with a pair of headphones and I'm bleeding. I'm
[14:52.640 --> 14:57.680]  going to knock you upside the head. These guys had such restraint but see, they knew they were going
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.000]  to hurt them and they didn't want to go to jail because they know how stuff works. But see,
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.480]  that's how this works in Europe by the way. You defend yourself. You get arrested a lot of times.
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.160]  They did not get arrested. There were so many witnesses. By the way, while they were doing
[15:10.160 --> 15:14.720]  this, they were slapping women on the ass that we're walking by and women were complaining to
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.520]  the black Americans, hey, can you protect us? These guys are here doing this. So they don't
[15:19.520 --> 15:24.000]  tell Europeans and others from other cities that they're going into a no-go zone. They don't tell
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.480]  you you're going to an area where you're going to be attacked. They tried to attack Paul Watson,
[15:29.120 --> 15:34.960]  Joe Biggs, and the rest of my crew and they had to get out of there. They wisely as two got out
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.960]  of there. But this is what happens. We're going to go into all that. There's so much. They're
[15:38.960 --> 15:47.440]  demonizing the Fourth of July parade. All of it. But just imagine how dumb these Islamists were
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.360]  because they're so used to everyone kissing their ass. They're so used to everyone folding that now
[15:51.360 --> 15:55.520]  they're going to start a fight with a bunch of big black Americans. It did not in well.
[15:55.520 --> 16:02.480]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.280]  ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then,
[16:07.280 --> 16:11.200]  and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped
[16:11.200 --> 16:15.200]  thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.080]  too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:20.080 --> 16:28.400]  tax case. Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.800]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.600]  system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.160]  you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.880]  on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:48.880 --> 16:53.360]  off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.680]  the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[16:57.680 --> 17:02.000]  to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer

[18:02.880 --> 18:07.360]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talk to a lot of people
[18:07.360 --> 18:11.920]  here out in New York City. And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.400]  wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because
[18:16.400 --> 18:20.480]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public,
[18:20.480 --> 18:24.560]  the approaching 2020. That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his
[18:24.560 --> 18:28.000]  presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.600]  a time to be praying, my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[18:31.600 --> 18:36.160]  is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love
[18:36.160 --> 18:40.000]  to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.920]  80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles. And
[18:45.920 --> 18:50.000]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. We're going to
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.960]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you, sir, for calling.
[18:58.960 --> 19:06.720]  The time has come. The time is here. The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.040]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world could
[19:11.040 --> 19:15.920]  come here and get everything free, but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it. When our nation
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.040]  is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse
[19:21.040 --> 19:26.720]  into third world status. And the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe
[19:26.720 --> 19:32.400]  and the U.S. to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.560]  the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela. This is a plan. That's why we've got to
[19:36.560 --> 19:40.000]  stay on air. It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end. Thanks
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.400]  to you and your support. That's what makes it all possible. So I salute you and I thank you,
[19:44.400 --> 19:48.800]  but I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on in the face of this.
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.160]  InfowarsStore.com, 50% off, store line free shipping, double patriot points, whatever you do,
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.080]  commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important
[19:58.080 --> 20:10.080]  things you can do in the fight against the globalist. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:10.080 --> 20:30.080]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:30.080 --> 20:39.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on the July 3rd,
[20:39.680 --> 20:47.760]  2019 worldwide transmission. Here's just a few clips of the media calling for all conservatives,
[20:47.760 --> 20:52.400]  libertarians, myself, Christians to be taken off the internet and they're taking
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.040]  focus on the family off of many of these platforms. They're taking mainline
[20:57.040 --> 21:02.960]  life site about pro-life off of apples telling some of the biggest Christian publishing groups.
[21:02.960 --> 21:07.440]  You're saying the earth is 6,000 years old. We say that's not scientific. You're not allowed to
[21:07.440 --> 21:14.720]  be on Google. You're not allowed to be on Apple. They're just a reign of terror is coming in and
[21:14.720 --> 21:19.360]  they're testing and seeing what we'll put up with. Now Democrats are calling for arresting anyone
[21:19.360 --> 21:24.480]  that criticizes them online, members of Congress and they say that they will work with Google and
[21:24.480 --> 21:30.080]  others to arrest you. That's coming up in a moment. Why not? We've put up with this so far
[21:30.080 --> 21:35.440]  or they'll send antifa to your house or AOC will lie about you and say you raped her.
[21:36.240 --> 21:39.120]  By the way, the board patrol as I told you, I talked to board patrol folks yesterday,
[21:39.760 --> 21:42.480]  they're getting ready to release the footage. They're trying to get permission
[21:43.840 --> 21:48.720]  from Trump and from the head of the board of patrol to release the footage. There's a lot of
[21:48.720 --> 21:54.560]  legal issues dealing with it, but she's a public figure. She's lied about them and the word is
[21:54.560 --> 21:58.560]  they're going to release her throwing fits, screaming and yelling at everyone and lying
[21:58.560 --> 22:04.240]  her ass off about people drinking out of toilets and how she felt sexually threatened when they
[22:04.240 --> 22:09.440]  were kissing her butt. They were trying to take selfies. They were trying to shake her hand. They
[22:09.440 --> 22:16.080]  had the charm flowing. You really think they'll go get out of here whore. She said she was called
[22:16.080 --> 22:21.760]  a whore. Hey whore, get out of here. They'd be fired in one second. Who believes any of this?
[22:22.320 --> 22:27.200]  Who believes I said child porn to the Sandy Hook parents or that I wrote a book about Sandy Hook
[22:27.200 --> 22:34.960]  and lost a lawsuit? None of it's true. But I'm telling you, man, these people will do anything.
[22:34.960 --> 22:43.280]  We can't even in what 10 States and the night district has ruled that you can't wear the American
[22:43.280 --> 22:50.560]  flag in public schools or areas. It's just a hate symbol. So of course, Nike is removing it, saying
[22:50.560 --> 22:59.840]  it's bad, the American flag. They are an anti-American group. I'm sorry. I'm ranting. Here is that
[22:59.840 --> 23:03.920]  little compilation. We're going to play the new clip here at us. I want them shut down. I want
[23:03.920 --> 23:08.720]  them silenced. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society. Why are they doing this
[23:08.720 --> 23:17.120]  now? Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long. Exactly. So Alex Jones has been
[23:17.120 --> 23:22.000]  banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him. They banned his little
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.880]  underling Paul Joseph Watson. Now that they kick them off the platform, that's great for now,
[23:26.880 --> 23:31.600]  but it doesn't roll back the clock. You have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second
[23:31.600 --> 23:36.880]  Amendment right now. I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts
[23:36.880 --> 23:41.440]  of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the Internet.
[23:41.440 --> 23:46.000]  I have no issue with it at all. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.560]  I think they are horrible for our society. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them
[23:52.560 --> 24:01.120]  muted. But don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything. Don't worry. These people
[24:01.120 --> 24:08.560]  are terrifying or anything. And the next is, arrest you. And if you can throw chemical weapons on
[24:08.560 --> 24:15.840]  people, acid attacks, they can hit you in the head with crowbars and foils. That's a thin sword.
[24:15.840 --> 24:19.600]  That's what they had out there. They had foils. We've watched the video. Kill somebody with that
[24:19.600 --> 24:24.640]  very easily. Get some of the crowded artery. Bye-bye. They'd have hit him in the neck. They'd
[24:24.640 --> 24:30.960]  have been murder one. You organized it, you came, you went. Murder one shouldn't even give them these
[24:30.960 --> 24:37.040]  methods ideas. But that's how you really kill somebody with the foil, is carotids. But you don't
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.040]  know how to use a weapon, do you, dumbass? So you hit them in the head. They just hit them in the
[24:41.040 --> 24:48.000]  head over and over again. That's the tough part of the body. Punk. And they're trying to murder
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.680]  them, though, those deadly weapons. But the Portland mayor, the police have confirmed,
[24:51.680 --> 24:56.560]  and they're going to release his order. That's right. They're preparing. They've told the mayor,
[24:56.560 --> 24:59.760]  you better tell the truth and stop lying about the stand-on order or we're going to release your
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.320]  order. And they're going to release it. All of it's going to start coming out. Antifa's being
[25:04.320 --> 25:11.120]  infiltrated everywhere. Criminal slime funded by Alexander Soros. He's now in command of an organized
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.680]  crime syndicate. He's involved the organized crime syndicate with the migrant flows and the migrant
[25:15.680 --> 25:23.760]  centers. And they've unleashed government employees in black mask to use weapons that are designed
[25:23.760 --> 25:30.560]  to kill people. Foils. They were calling a crowbar. No, it was not foils. I mean, it was not
[25:30.560 --> 25:38.480]  crowbars. It was foils. A thin sword. A super deadly weapon. You know what the three musketeers use?
[25:38.480 --> 25:45.920]  That's what they got. Designed to go in between cracks and armor. Designed to stab people in the
[25:45.920 --> 25:53.760]  neck and in the stomach and in the heart. And that's what they got out there. His swords. So
[25:56.880 --> 25:59.840]  dimwrap wants to prosecute people who mock Congress.
[25:59.840 --> 26:09.360]  Fredrica Wilson, Democrat Florida. Here she is in a public speech. Those people who are online
[26:09.920 --> 26:18.800]  making fun of members of Congress are disgrace. And there's no need for anyone to think that
[26:18.800 --> 26:25.040]  is unacceptable. We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down.
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.320]  And they should be prosecuted. We're going to shut them down when they make fun of Congress.
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.360]  Well, I'll get them arrested. We're going to work with big tech. We're going to go to break. Joe
[26:35.360 --> 26:42.480]  Big's got taken off. Twitter got permanently banned for saying that Antifa are a bunch of criminals
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.320]  that he was going to go to Portland and exercise his first amendment. And if they attacked him,
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.680]  he'd defend himself. That's the cardinal sin. You don't ever fight back against meth heads,
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.280]  city employees with acid attacks. You don't stand against them and defend yourself. When they come
[26:57.280 --> 27:02.080]  with a sword, you show your neck. When they come to dump acid in your eyes, you open them up for
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.840]  them like clockwork orange. So the thought criminals, Joe Big's former info wars reporter,
[27:07.840 --> 27:13.360]  will be joining us on the other side. Please remember that we have the same info wars for
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.360]  the July special that's going to have to end Friday or this weekend because we're getting ready to
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.520]  sell out of X2. Even though it will probably sell out for a month or more before we get more in,
[27:21.520 --> 27:26.880]  I'm going to keep selling it at 50% off because I want you to see how great it is and what happens
[27:26.880 --> 27:30.880]  within a few weeks of taking it. Now talk to a physician or others before you take this because
[27:30.880 --> 27:36.640]  this isn't a joke. Okay. Pure iodine. No one else has it. No one else sells it. This is true
[27:36.640 --> 27:42.640]  atomic. No one else has real atomic iodine. They're full of baloney. This is real. Don't buy the
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.880]  stuff at the store for cuts or whatever. Leave a hole in your stomach. This is the real stuff.
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.480]  This is pure iodine. It's not bound with toxins or anything. It's pure from deep earth crystals.
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the whole body operates off of it and people will die without fluoride and
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.680]  IQs are plunging, burnt defects, all the stuff's exploding because the body starts unraveling without
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.080]  iodine and most of the stuff is not in the plants anymore. It's not in the fields. It's not in the
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.240]  soils. You can only get it from the ocean and it's so damn polluted. You get a bunch of other
[28:14.240 --> 28:17.440]  bad stuff when you're getting it. That's what the Japanese do live so long as they're mainly
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.200]  seafood folks and other folks that eat seafood, but even their life expectancy is just starting to go
[28:21.200 --> 28:27.760]  down, down because of all the toxins in the ocean and the chemical bioaccumulation that takes place
[28:27.760 --> 28:36.640]  at fish and in aquatic marine life. So everything's 50% off in the supplements, store-wide free
[28:36.640 --> 28:41.600]  shipping, double patriot points and a bunch of other big specials, too many to name, too numerous.
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.560]  Everybody's free bumper stickers in each order, save info wars, get great products at the same time,
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.960]  please take action. It's a revolutionary idea to fund independent media. So on the 4th of July,
[28:50.960 --> 28:55.840]  on the eve of it, celebrate the info war with purchases and sign up for auto ship additional
[28:55.840 --> 29:01.920]  10% off. We will be back with thought criminal Joe Biggs. Heart disease is on the rise, clogged
[29:01.920 --> 29:07.200]  arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the

[30:05.760 --> 30:10.640]  Ears and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented
[30:10.640 --> 30:15.440]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart
[30:15.440 --> 30:19.680]  to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw all those lies against us last week,
[30:19.680 --> 30:23.280]  the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it
[30:23.280 --> 30:27.840]  up and found out the truth and so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and
[30:27.840 --> 30:32.000]  I feel your love in my heart. I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.160]  you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because
[30:36.160 --> 30:41.760]  I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm going to be destroyed and
[30:41.760 --> 30:46.400]  it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key
[30:46.400 --> 30:50.960]  chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God. This is providence
[30:50.960 --> 30:54.560]  so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[31:01.120 --> 31:06.800]  The time has come. The time is here. The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces
[31:06.800 --> 31:11.120]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders and that the whole world could
[31:11.120 --> 31:16.000]  come here and get everything free but that we the citizens have to pay for it. When our nation
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.640]  is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will
[31:20.640 --> 31:26.240]  collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves
[31:26.240 --> 31:32.240]  in Europe and the US to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we
[31:32.240 --> 31:36.320]  can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela. This is a plan. That's why
[31:36.320 --> 31:39.360]  we've got to stay on air. It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in
[31:39.360 --> 31:44.160]  the end. Thanks to you and your support. That's what makes it all possible so I salute you and I
[31:44.160 --> 31:48.880]  thank you but I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on the face of this.

[32:54.320 --> 32:57.760]  funding. Thank you for your support. We're getting a lot of support right now but we need a lot to
[32:57.760 --> 33:15.440]  go into this dark night. We're not going to back down. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.440 --> 33:28.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.840 --> 33:38.080]  No one can rival Western architecture. No one can rival Western technology.
[33:38.880 --> 33:44.560]  No one can rival American freedom. But now, the Democratic Party is all over the news demonizing
[33:44.560 --> 33:50.960]  the July 4th event, demonizing the American flag, agreeing with Nike that the American flag is an
[33:50.960 --> 33:57.200]  evil symbol. The night circuits ruled it's a hate symbol. These are the enemies within and we have
[33:57.200 --> 34:03.280]  major representatives like Wilson of Florida coming out and saying arrest people that make
[34:03.280 --> 34:10.960]  fun of members of Congress and censor the internet more. It's amazing. Also, we have new breaking
[34:10.960 --> 34:17.280]  news that I'll cover after Joe Biggs leaves us that is the next level. Photo shows kids laying
[34:17.280 --> 34:23.680]  on top of drag queens at drag queen story time. They shake their butts in their faces. They tell
[34:23.680 --> 34:29.360]  little girls they're really boys. Little boys are really girls. This is pedophilic training.
[34:29.360 --> 34:33.520]  And now they're even admitting in the media it's pedophilic training and they're celebrating it.
[34:33.520 --> 34:39.280]  Saying sex with kids is good. Men dress as clowns many times because they're convicted sex offenders
[34:39.280 --> 34:46.960]  and they have to cover up their identity. We're going to be getting into all of that and the
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.400]  latest on Antifa that has been infiltrated in D.C. and that shock footage will be playing
[34:52.400 --> 34:58.000]  next segment. Joe Biggs joins us from the streets of D.C. He just got off a plane from Florida.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.480]  He's scheduled to be speaking at free speech events that Antifa has pledged to physically
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.920]  target. The Antifa groups have pledged to use asset attacks on folks at these events and at
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.600]  Trump's Fourth of July events coming up tomorrow and then on Friday and Saturday they are allowed
[35:13.600 --> 35:17.680]  to mix the weapons in front of police D.C. police to a great extent are still in their Democrat
[35:17.680 --> 35:23.760]  control and major Democrats and the D.C. representative is saying that they see Trump's
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.080]  event as terroristic. I have those articles and video clips coming up so they say that all of
[35:28.080 --> 35:34.480]  this is white supremacism and that anyone with American flags will be attacked. So this is Fourth
[35:34.480 --> 35:40.800]  of July ladies and gentlemen this is what America has turned to and what the Democrats are pushing
[35:40.800 --> 35:48.400]  and that was Nike's calculation is that hey we've made 33, 32, 34 percent each quarter after
[35:48.400 --> 35:55.280]  Kaepernick and his America hating system became the spokesperson for Nike. SJWs go by the overpriced
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.640]  slave factory made shoes because it's a celebration of hating America. So Nike waited till the Fourth
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.920]  of July, they waited, they shipped out the shoes to have a big stunt. They're great looking shoes by
[36:05.920 --> 36:10.160]  the way. I would get a pair because they're so triggering the leftist plus they look nice
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.560]  and they are not allowing to be sold so they could pitch on America on July 4th. This is a
[36:16.560 --> 36:23.440]  wiping July 4th on their huge stinking Seattle based rear end. So that's the echo chamber and now Joe
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.800]  Biggs simply tweeted I remember seeing the tweets and saying to Darren McBrain I bet he gets banned
[36:28.800 --> 36:35.120]  for that because thou shalt not criticize the Lord thy God Antifa and thou shalt not speak badly of
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.160]  them he just said I'm going out there to cover this and have a rally and if anybody attacks me
[36:40.160 --> 36:45.760]  I'm gonna fight back well defense is the number one crime when a methad leftist who's been allowed
[36:45.760 --> 36:51.040]  off work from the city by the mayor comes out to attack. So Joe you've been banned on Twitter
[36:51.040 --> 36:56.320]  thanks for joining us and tell us the latest. Yeah it was pretty funny you know I woke up
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.360]  yesterday and one of my buddies contacted me he goes dude the blue checkmark thing you have
[37:01.360 --> 37:05.600]  on your Twitter account is gone and I opened up my app I was going to the gym and I go oh yeah
[37:06.400 --> 37:10.160]  oh well and then someone wrote me and they go that's what happened to Laura Loomer right before
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.280]  she got banned they took her blue checkmark away and then instead of counts suspended and sure enough
[37:16.160 --> 37:19.840]  I got on the on the DM to start talking to Michelle Malkin I was like hey did you see
[37:19.840 --> 37:24.080]  that they took the badge away she goes yeah do you think it's because of your coverage of Antifa
[37:24.080 --> 37:28.800]  over the last week since Andy Knoe was attacked in Portland and I said it has to be because that's
[37:28.800 --> 37:32.000]  the only thing that's really changed of what I've been talking about on Twitter and right in the
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.640]  middle of Michelle and I's conversation on direct message they zap my account and I had to go through
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.880]  Laura and other people to get back in touch with Michelle and I heard that Michelle was tweeting
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.320]  out looking to get a hold of me because she's doing a whole thing on this Antifa and it's just
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.480]  amazing you know you've got this guy he's 90 pounds this little gay Asian guy and you have supposedly
[37:54.480 --> 37:58.880]  Antifa who's pro LGBT and all this and they're out there watching in mass numbers and this guy's
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.720]  being ticked and beaten on the ground you know beaten so bad that his brain is bleeding I mean
[38:04.720 --> 38:09.280]  not just lightly beating him up or roughing him up to a point where he could have permanent damage
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.280]  for the rest of his life and this is a problem that we have to deal with so that's why I got
[38:13.280 --> 38:18.560]  really frustrated and over the last few days I've been able to organize damn near a thousand people
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.120]  or more they're going to be coming out to Portland I've got groups from all over the country that
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.680]  have never even rallied together or marched together we're all going to come together and stand
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.640]  you know against Antifa because you know what we can't have these hooligans run around acting
[38:32.640 --> 38:36.400]  like they run the streets or a nation of laws this is America we're not going to be run by that's
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.560]  right when the police stand down and there's no law and order it's up to the people it's our right
[38:40.560 --> 38:45.120]  and duty to protect ourselves whether we sit in our own town or across the country it's not
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.280]  vigilanteism when you see a crime being committed and the police are standing down it's a citizen's
[38:49.280 --> 38:56.480]  arrest and when you watch uh mr. no they're hitting him with quick set concrete that's liquid that
[38:56.480 --> 39:01.920]  that's an action attack some of the concrete is set so it bounces off the back of his head
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.840]  that's what causes brain to bleed so that's a brick they bash him in the back of the head
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.120]  all because they recognize that he's a journalist and they all gang up on him like a bunch of
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.440]  piranhas or a bunch of hyenas and and then the left's celebrated this I mean that these people
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.440]  are just the scum of the other than others that tried to help him they beat them in the head with
[39:21.440 --> 39:27.600]  foils and again people don't don't know what a foil is it's a long piece of metal uh basically a
[39:27.600 --> 39:33.520]  primitive sword that can be swung at high speed to split open skin and bone you can kill somebody
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.600]  in about two seconds with one hitting the carotid arteries luckily they hit him on top of the head
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.960]  with this uh and almost killed folks but uh didn't go to the to the neck because that's how you kill
[39:42.960 --> 39:50.000]  somebody real fast joe as you know yeah yeah I got the exclusive uh ER pictures of that happening uh
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.760]  when his head was smashed in and they had to do all the staples I mean luckily when you look at
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.800]  those injuries this guy is lucky his his actual cranium did not break and he doesn't have permanent
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.520]  brain damage I mean he had some massive wounds to his head I mean I haven't seen something that bad
[40:03.520 --> 40:09.120]  in a while um but that spread like wildfire and it really sparked uh you know a fire under
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.120]  ever uh under everyone's ass is because now you see this one guy being attacked and now we find
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.440]  out about more and we see how vicious these attacks are that are going to leave permanent damage on
[40:17.440 --> 40:22.400]  some of these individuals um that's why you know we've got to do something we can't sit by anymore
[40:22.400 --> 40:27.280]  we can't let a lawless lawless mayor um and the guy to have there in Portland we can't sit by while
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.600]  the cops uh allow this to happen this is their job this is what they're elected for these are the
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.520]  oaths they took and they were refusing to do anything about it so we have to go out there do
[40:35.520 --> 40:42.240]  something about it let's be exactly clear about what you said what you did and if it is meeting
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.160]  and meetings they're publicly saying we're going to ask and attack people they're now doing it
[40:46.160 --> 40:50.160]  I've seen them attack families trying to get into Trump's inauguration the police did nothing again
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.840]  in these blue sewer cities uh and I saw some of what you said I mean repeat the folks what you
[40:55.840 --> 41:02.400]  said that got you banned oh well first the first thing I did is I I reached out to Mr. No and I
[41:02.400 --> 41:05.600]  said hey if you ever going to go on the streets again we're going to have your back I'm going to
[41:05.600 --> 41:10.080]  have guys with you that will sit there and watch you to make sure you never ever get attacked again
[41:10.080 --> 41:13.120]  because your job is a journalist you shouldn't have to worry about something like that and that's
[41:13.120 --> 41:18.480]  how it started and then you know you started getting kind of heated up because now you started
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.560]  finding out more people got injured you know so eventually I said you know what I'm not going to
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.320]  let this happen I'm going to come after you guys I'm going to sit here and we're going to stay in
[41:26.320 --> 41:30.000]  toe to toe and I'm going to bring more than you guys and you either going to stand there with us
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.760]  or you're going to back down and run away like the cowards you are because you only notice they
[41:33.760 --> 41:37.440]  only go to these areas where there's only a couple of people where they know they can outnumber
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.040]  them like you said earlier you compared them to piranhas these guys aren't going to do anything
[41:41.040 --> 41:45.680]  by themselves they have to be in those large groups and my goal is to bring a group larger than
[41:45.680 --> 41:49.040]  theirs we'll see if they actually want to do anything and then I guarantee you when we show up
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.640]  in Portland the police will all of a sudden want to do their job they'll all of a sudden want to
[41:52.640 --> 41:57.440]  enforce the law and I'm sure that they'll be the ones hassling us and not in Tifa
[42:00.720 --> 42:05.920]  I hope you've been invited to the conference that Trump's holding on the 11th because
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.400]  your case is perfect where you just said hey you beat up a bunch of journals and heard a
[42:10.400 --> 42:15.760]  bunch of people we're going to come out we're going to defend folks defensively and then you
[42:15.760 --> 42:21.520]  got banned for that while Antifa still the Portland Antifa that called for all this and called for
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.680]  dumping stuff on people's faces acid they are still all operating yeah they they're actively
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.240]  planning attacks and they're actively committing terrorist attacks they're actually committing
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.880]  acts of violence they are verbally abusing people they are doxing people they're getting people
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.600]  fired from their jobs I merely told a lot of people hey it's getting rough out there if you
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.280]  don't have a gun you better buy one you better have ammo you better learn to train with it
[42:45.280 --> 42:50.160]  you better learn respect for that weapon you do better learn um how to take care of yourself
[42:50.160 --> 42:53.600]  how to fight just stay there let's talk about that that's what I said when Antifa said they're
[42:53.600 --> 42:56.880]  coming to our houses to kill us I said everybody better get guns to protect yourselves
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.840]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other
[43:03.840 --> 43:09.040]  thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed
[43:09.040 --> 43:13.440]  by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not
[43:13.440 --> 43:18.000]  being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.440]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.360]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.760]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.680]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[43:35.680 --> 43:39.840]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.960]  manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info
[43:44.960 --> 43:50.240]  wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[43:50.240 --> 43:54.880]  ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[43:54.880 --> 44:01.040]  black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you only very very clear with everybody
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.840]  about all of this we're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.320]  the final mega counts we have do their criminal activity and their and their digital fraud and
[44:10.320 --> 44:15.200]  we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year we need to in here we need to be
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.440]  provisioned and you've got my total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the
[44:19.440 --> 44:24.480]  enemy fearlessly i'm loving every minute of this because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm
[44:24.480 --> 44:29.040]  bloody and then i'm up politically i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack
[44:29.040 --> 44:33.760]  back with lies that just brings more people here so i'm in one hell of a fight so are you and i need
[44:33.760 --> 44:39.680]  war bonds i need gas i need ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.600]  flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable
[44:43.600 --> 44:46.880]  we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise a couple
[44:46.880 --> 44:51.120]  million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will
[44:51.120 --> 44:55.920]  stand with us and i will never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.920]  more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this there is no longer any
[45:01.920 --> 45:06.960]  doubt multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent malice style
[45:06.960 --> 45:11.760]  overthrow of the us our borders are being totally collapsed already born babies are being killed
[45:11.760 --> 45:15.920]  world government is here now is the time for decision now is the time for everyone watching

[45:27.040 --> 45:31.200]  take action and that means word of mouth about this broadcast and that means buying products

[48:28.960 --> 48:34.080]  streaming uh bright the on has done this so folks have a place to host their own videos
[48:34.880 --> 48:39.520]  mike adams has done that we're we're trying to set up a program where people like you can have a
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.520]  platform on our systems and promote your own platform so you have audio and video streaming
[48:43.520 --> 48:48.160]  that's just one click interface we're almost up to that level to kind of be a mother ship
[48:48.160 --> 48:55.680]  uh to support other folks uh and to split off other mother ships but frankly we've got projects
[48:55.680 --> 49:00.240]  doing that uh behind the scenes they've got our phones all tapped the enemy knows all that
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.400]  so they've still got people inside the fbi inside the justice department inside the cia
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.240]  large numbers of them like a lot of anti-foot's been proven are actually have national security
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.640]  clearances uh we've got some hidden camera footage that they didn't know that we have we're
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.400]  going to be getting to uh next hour we'll roll some of that in the background but i'm sure you've
[49:16.400 --> 49:24.320]  now heard representative fredrica wilson talk about a bozo the clown freak she's come out and said
[49:24.320 --> 49:28.400]  that if people make fun of congress they're going to work with big tech to find out who you are and
[49:28.400 --> 49:36.160]  arrest you so now she's saying arrest people for their speech here she is people who are online
[49:36.720 --> 49:45.920]  making fun of members of congress are this grace and there's no need for anyone to think that is
[49:45.920 --> 49:52.080]  unacceptable we're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and
[49:52.080 --> 49:58.240]  they should be prosecuted making fun of people need to be prosecuted to quote ducker carlson
[49:59.120 --> 50:07.040]  these people aren't scary at all joe biggs it's truly a clown world you know this is like
[50:08.880 --> 50:13.600]  we can't even you can't even be honest anymore it's only gonna be a matter of time before
[50:13.600 --> 50:18.480]  honesty is completely and totally outlaw i mean what's wrong is right what's right is wrong the
[50:18.480 --> 50:24.400]  whole world's going to be vice versa it's it's insanity what we're dealing with here
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.520]  is a clown i mean boss hogs funny she's funny but she's said a lot of crazy stuff before and she
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.960]  doesn't like it so i'm going to say this we're going to have a contest making fun of her i'm
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.720]  going to i'm going to pay out the other five thousand dollar contest next week we're going to
[50:40.720 --> 50:50.400]  have a contest for the best video or or image meme of representative fred rico wilson and that will
[50:50.400 --> 50:56.640]  be five thousand dollars then we have another one for aoc that one will be ten thousand dollars
[50:57.680 --> 51:02.480]  so we're going to see how they can be made fun of how they can be made to look ridiculous with
[51:02.480 --> 51:08.160]  their own statements and so that's uh fifteen thousand dollars of prizes for the next contest
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.200]  or the get info wars out contest uh that has now ended i know the winner as i've announced that
[51:13.920 --> 51:21.120]  next week joe you're there in dc for the amazing parade that trump set to have
[51:22.640 --> 51:27.120]  they're calling it fascist because it's gonna have the military we've had that at many other
[51:27.120 --> 51:33.840]  for the july events um the military's been so run down the globalists have have so demoralized
[51:33.840 --> 51:38.320]  it with 20 plus suicides a day all the rest of it as much as the country's been put down i think
[51:38.320 --> 51:43.840]  it's good that trump's trying to get us to have confidence and pride in our nation again yeah exactly
[51:43.840 --> 51:49.120]  i mean this this gives us an opportunity not only for people who might not get to see all this cool
[51:49.120 --> 51:54.320]  military gear you know but to see it to see those soldiers and those marines and uniform it gives you
[51:54.320 --> 51:59.280]  a sense of pride it gives you a sense of that patriotism that we lost for so long you know i
[51:59.280 --> 52:03.040]  think it's i think it's awesome to bring something like that in right now especially when everything
[52:03.040 --> 52:09.200]  you see is some soccer player taking a knee someone bashing our country for once we get an opportunity
[52:09.200 --> 52:15.280]  a day i mean lgbt gets a whole day a month we get one day to sit here and let us have our
[52:15.280 --> 52:20.640]  patriotic day you know stop stop trying to like get rid of our shoes stop doing all this stuff like
[52:20.640 --> 52:26.240]  you've had your whole month i want july 4th i want to see tanks i want to see cool flyovers i want to
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.320]  see fireworks i want to see red white and blue shirts and by the way they're saying this never
[52:30.320 --> 52:38.560]  happens every year in austin they have b2 bombers or or b1 bombers do low passes over the city right
[52:38.560 --> 52:42.720]  before it gets dark and the fireworks but guess what last few years they haven't done it because the
[52:42.720 --> 52:48.000]  leftists that run the city go oh they identify our military is so evil because it's american
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.480]  that they hate it well listen trump doesn't have our military uh going into all these countries
[52:52.480 --> 52:57.040]  right now he's trying to do peace deals he's trying to get us out of afghanistan they've
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.760]  announced the total withdrawal he's gotten us out of syria that is a time to celebrate uh the
[53:01.760 --> 53:06.320]  fact that we've gone out mission complete and we should have had a military parade but the left
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.880]  promised to attack it so trump said fine we'll do it during the fourth of july as part of something
[53:10.880 --> 53:17.200]  larger and they're saying we've never had flyovers we've never had that's a damn lie that is a lie
[53:17.200 --> 53:22.800]  they have flyovers every year in dc where's a damn redskins stadium right down the road
[53:22.800 --> 53:29.360]  before before every football game there's a flyover before any sports game there's a flyover
[53:29.360 --> 53:33.280]  if it's an outdoor arena by the way folks don't know the best thing you can ever go to is an air
[53:33.280 --> 53:37.200]  show my dad took me to four or five big ones when i was a kid a lot of little ones and i i should do
[53:37.200 --> 53:43.920]  that for my children uh but i mean oscosh air shows or uh you know the world war two air shows all
[53:43.920 --> 53:48.480]  all of them i mean they're they're just incredible and there's nothing better than fireworks in an
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.280]  air show and the big monuments and celebrating our country no but the globalists want us to hate our
[53:53.280 --> 53:59.440]  country yeah it's pathetic what they're trying to do to right now you know like i said i want my
[53:59.440 --> 54:03.520]  one day i want to see the red white and blue i want to feel that sense of pride i want to get
[54:03.520 --> 54:08.640]  the goosebumps when i hear those eight tens fly over and i hear that loud engine roar you know
[54:08.640 --> 54:14.160]  that is what it's all about to see that might to see that power that we have to know hey we're
[54:14.160 --> 54:18.640]  safe if something happens because we've got the best men and women out there uh operating this
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.600]  stuff and that's just truly awesome and again if the government was trying to make us wear american
[54:23.600 --> 54:28.160]  flags and trying to use american flags to attack innocent countries i would say hey it's becoming
[54:28.160 --> 54:33.040]  fascist not the flag the use of it but when they're the ninth circuits ruling it's a hate symbol and
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.240]  they're trying to take it down and they're uh putting shoes out as a stunt and pulling them back
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.840]  all to piss on america and say it's bad and make us all have division then it becomes more important
[54:43.840 --> 54:49.200]  than ever to fly american flags at our houses and to wear american flags and to put american flags
[54:49.200 --> 54:54.720]  on clothing i like this space for shirt i'm wearing that's what it's all about because america
[54:54.720 --> 54:59.600]  isn't perfect but what they're trying to replace it with is a nightmare uh because i think they've
[54:59.600 --> 55:06.320]  jumped the shark here just because nike has made 33 larger profits since they put cavernic up there
[55:06.320 --> 55:12.480]  because sjw has went and bought their overpriced slave made shoes the nfl is down 40 because of
[55:12.480 --> 55:17.680]  all their america hate i think they've major league miscalculated uh saying american flags
[55:17.680 --> 55:22.480]  racist that betsey ross is bad uh you know saying we shouldn't have a fourth of july parade
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.720]  saying america was never great will never be that great i mean they've really shown their colors
[55:27.760 --> 55:32.800]  they're catering to a smaller uh group you know quite honestly i mean you look at these polls
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.800]  are all lies you you see all these polls on tv uh trump uh today would lose to biden trump today
[55:38.800 --> 55:44.000]  would lose to uh sanders but then you go to like that or a rally in orlando and you see that many
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.440]  people showing up days in advance waiting in lines through the heat through the humidity through
[55:49.440 --> 55:56.800]  rainstorms um it really makes you question like they're barking up the wrong tree the majority
[55:56.800 --> 56:02.560]  wants the patriotism the majority want american nationalism the majority of them want to be able
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.080]  to have a safe home and a safe environment they want to be able to protect themselves they want
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.160]  to be entrepreneurs they want to be able to have a good life they don't want what this uh left
[56:10.160 --> 56:16.720]  leaning uh democrat party is going that's hell that's right you know cappernick made 50 million
[56:16.720 --> 56:22.160]  dollars born in this country adopted by white people and he hates white people he's a flaming
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.480]  racist and he's you know he's got the big afro out there even though he's not really a black guy
[56:26.480 --> 56:31.680]  looks like he's about 90 white and he's just he just signed on to be a corporate shill with
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.880]  chinese funding we know to divide and conquer the chinese government is funding most of this folks
[56:36.880 --> 56:42.480]  that's a fact they're funding the division all of it and i'm not saying execute people but china
[56:42.480 --> 56:46.800]  executes people that sow this type of discord in their own country and so that's what they're
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.000]  really doing uh joe bigs how do people find you i know you've got your merch site and and that's
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.880]  great and and people can go there you're gonna turn that into a news site uh soon uh we should
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.800]  probably get you dialed in we we're setting up systems where people can dial in over their phones
[57:00.800 --> 57:04.720]  and stream live through our systems we're hiring more crew to be able to do that and get up on the
[57:04.720 --> 57:10.080]  site so let's be talking more in the future about trying to help you with some uh replatforming
[57:10.080 --> 57:16.880]  but give people your website uh it's ssgbigs.com that's staffsgtbigs.com and then i have an
[57:16.880 --> 57:23.280]  instagram that's ssgbigs as well and i'm there in those two places uh predominantly right now
[57:23.280 --> 57:28.960]  well be sure to get over on telegram uh i'm on that right now and and that's building up and a
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.160]  lot of other things folks find the patriots and spread the links don't forget 50 off store
[57:34.160 --> 57:38.720]  wide for the supplements double patriot points and free shipping for the 4th of july save it for
[57:38.720 --> 57:43.600]  our special and get your space force america's back red white and blue american flag info awards
[57:43.600 --> 57:51.360]  dot com t shirt info wars store dot com thank you joe bigs god bless i talk about this on the air
[57:51.360 --> 57:55.760]  and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements
[57:55.760 --> 57:59.920]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits
[57:59.920 --> 58:03.680]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.520]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[58:07.520 --> 58:11.440]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people
[58:11.440 --> 58:14.640]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the
[58:14.640 --> 58:19.840]  left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.760]  their supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through
[58:25.760 --> 58:29.760]  the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say
[58:29.760 --> 58:34.240]  it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature
[58:34.240 --> 58:38.160]  and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects
[58:38.160 --> 58:42.800]  not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest
[58:42.800 --> 58:51.920]  info war store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[58:51.920 --> 58:58.560]  the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting
[58:58.560 --> 59:03.120]  structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting
[59:03.120 --> 59:08.800]  one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[59:08.800 --> 59:14.800]  this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining
[59:14.800 --> 59:19.760]  self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.760]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[59:23.760 --> 59:27.520]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether
[59:27.520 --> 59:31.600]  it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that
[59:31.600 --> 59:36.240]  actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[59:36.240 --> 59:41.200]  support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[59:41.200 --> 59:45.280]  and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and
[59:45.280 --> 59:49.360]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[59:49.360 --> 01:00:07.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.440]  the year is 2019
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:22.720]  it's the eve of the nation's first day july 4th and the democratic party is openly controlled and
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:29.520]  run by a consortium of foreign corporations and governments and are openly involved in giant
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.200]  reeducation of the nation demonization of the family demonization of free market demonization
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.560]  of christians demonization of the born and unborn in fact coming up next segment
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:47.600]  we're going to get to the latest targeting of the children i believe it's right there in the
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.840]  printer forgot to bring it in here they are now openly killing babies and releasing the numbers
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.680]  on it after they're born now this has been going on a while but it's all admittedly happening
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.720]  minnesota admits to killing six babies last year who were totally fine after they were born
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:14.720]  now the numbers are much higher than this but what they're doing is testing everyone right now
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.440]  so that is coming up in the next segment let me just mention what else is coming up i've got to
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:28.560]  get to all of this it's official california democrats push bill allowing illegal aliens
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.800]  to run the democratic party and major cities are letting illegal aliens vote and giving them
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.960]  driver's license from new york to california that's how mexico takes over the u.s but it's
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:50.320]  really the globalist also we're going to get into the video i talked about watch american rapper
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.400]  enter a no-go zone in europe and be attacked by muslims
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:02.640]  it's pretty amazing that's all coming up
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.920]  also austin we have a report on this has announced that the homeless can sleep anywhere including
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.800]  on the sidewalk in front of your house they can sleep at any park they can sleep on any public
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:27.520]  property except the city council building i'm not joking and greg abbott has been talking about that
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:35.360]  these are these are more open laws than even seattle which is dying because of it and portland
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.640]  the poop capital in san francisco a close second they're all competing for the typhus
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:47.840]  and uh flesh eating bacteria and needle and human feces capitals but to austin now
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.480]  wants to have the same landmarks i mean just 300 400 yards from where i shit
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.080]  they're homeless camps and they're just they're in the wealthy areas they're in the working class
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.720]  areas they're in the industrial areas i'm in an industrial area but i drive through middle class
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.840]  areas i drive through fancy areas and it's just piles of feces and needles and people just laid
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.160]  out everywhere because they get government welfare because they're indigents they get up you know we're
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:24.240]  talking 50 60 000 a year and the local social workers skim all that money they get about 20 or so
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.160]  and so this is big business and i've been to la i've talked to detectives about it i've talked to
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.920]  experts i've been to skidrobe and so this is something that they they they they they create
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:43.840]  these permanent zombie hordes that are crises that they then manage uh and that they make money off
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.200]  of and the green belts everywhere have like i mean i told people this like three years ago they
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:55.120]  didn't believe me and i and i've i've videotaped it but it was just so sad i'd even show it i i was
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:01.440]  like i can six seven miles out in the bush because there's tens of thousands of acres just one area
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.440]  so like a hundred thousand acres of green belt but i was in this one area and i and i talked about
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:13.520]  seven miles in and i was about to turn around and there was a camp of guatemalan's because
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.080]  i can tell by their dress i talked to them say guatemalan they nodded they had ten cans with
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.800]  string on it and they were catching fish they had fire going and they dug a hole they were
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.280]  crapping in so so they weren't homeless people like the drug addicts they had just come here and

[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:29.440]  so
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:48.480]  i want to explain something ladies and gentlemen i told you that pedophiles are actually vampires
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:56.400]  20 years ago and i explained that they have kind of little potbellied nelly effeminate types
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:06.080]  that are the procurors but that above that there are people that look and behave and act like
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.880]  the governor of california he looks like one he acts like one tall strong handsome they have that
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.080]  demonic look in their eye though you know kind of like the american psycho played by christian
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:24.480]  bail but beyond it christian bail isn't a psycho he couldn't fully animate the eyes fully have the
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:30.960]  demonic light shine through and so that's how it works ladies and gentlemen and when brams broker
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:38.080]  wrote dracula he's telling you everything that's actually true you see the the royalty of europe
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:45.680]  is all out of transylvania that's the original bloodline and the the german royalty that is now
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:53.280]  the british royalty is all related to the count dragon count dracula but count dracula didn't

[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.320]  but the whole police state measures that their the congress has them do while the borders are wide open
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:35:00.000]  and what they do is when the tsa gropes kids and all that it it's training them to allow to let
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.280]  pedophiles do it later that's why they stopped groping children under the age of 14 because it
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:12.080]  was illegal and people brought lawsuits okay so uh this stuff is unprecedented and the and the so

[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.840]  if your media or law enforcement or a republican they're saying they're coming to your houses next
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.880]  to kill you this is official you should have a battle rifle ready if they come to defend yourself
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.400]  that's what the media said i've threatened the media with battle rifles because a lot of them are
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:44.400]  seeing in reporters by day bot bellied antifa by night uh so there's all of that information
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:51.760]  coming up as well and then california democrats push bill allowing illegal party rules so that's
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:58.640]  allowing illegals uh to have roles in the party even at the highest levels thus ruling california
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:04.000]  so the overthrow of the u.s accelerates with beto orork campaigning in mexico against the united
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.800]  states campaigning for president uh in mexico that's how far all of this has come meanwhile
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:18.400]  27 kidnapped uh in uh cancun cancuns totally collapsed total drug war there with six cartels
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:26.240]  fighting for supremacy meanwhile one dead five infected after mold infestation at seattle's
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.840]  children's hospital deadly mold killing people all over the country ohio school removes 10
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.960]  commandments after uh atheist script and planes yet cavernant complaints and while they pull the
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.880]  betsy ross colonial american flag no they rigged all that for fourth of july to put out the idea
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:49.440]  that the american flag is evil nineties are very evil organization so that's all coming up as well
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:56.400]  we're also uh going to get to a bunch of things i haven't even mentioned yet uh like cnn is now in
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:03.520]  15th place in cable again behind reruns of yogi bear up continuing austin announces plans to let
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.760]  homeless camp in your yard or anywhere else they want to except for at the city council
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:15.280]  they of course exempt themselves uh that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down and
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.360]  then the coup de grace when we come back i've already played this one to play it over and over
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.720]  again today democrats are now in congress officially calling for people to be arrested
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.920]  that criticize them i'm not kidding you'll see that richard reeves my good friend of how we do
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.880]  each other about 18 years yeah i think we met right after 9 11 right after 9 11 i said man i
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.520]  got to meet this guy alex jones i heard you talking about the inside job aspects of 9 11 i said i got
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.440]  to meet you and it was like around october november uh two three months after the 9 11 event that i
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.160]  said i you know this is a gentleman i need to meet and so i went and saw you at cable access tv
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.960]  and uh the rest is history i guess as they say you have had a rough few years taken care of your
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.960]  90-something-year-old mother uh while working other jobs and uh doing so much and then you work
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.520]  yourself to death of the trump campaign had a big old heart attack well that's right my mom turned
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.600]  89 still taking good care of her but i tell you what i want to dive into this stuff man that we've
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:17.600]  got this hot stuff uh frederick uh fredericka wilson thank you very much you know hey we should
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:23.360]  give her a standing ovation because in 2007 i had an interview with with you alex in the old studio
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:29.120]  and we talked about hey let's get the media to tell moralize hey let's lie bigger and now fredericka
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.960]  wilson thank you because you know she's totally uncloaked now that she doesn't even understand
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.960]  what america is she doesn't understand the first amendment so hallelujah i think that this just
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:46.400]  further helps our cause that we can finally get these people to uncloak and give us their full
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:52.320]  on crazy so that we can get them unelected for her to win re-election there's only two ways for
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:57.600]  her to win her next election one would be total voter fraud and the other is the ignorance of
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.760]  the american people and i just don't believe the american people are this stupid i don't believe it
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.760]  well i know you want to talk about this and shoot your horn but i remember we were out in big big
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:16.080]  bin and after that we went up to up to uh arizona we went to the grand canyon i remember you talking
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:20.400]  about donald trump donald trump donald trump he watched he's gonna run for office and and he's
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.200]  gonna win for president and he was the first person i ever heard accurately predict that
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:30.400]  and it came true like six years before inculter ever said it you also had a lot of other predictions
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.560]  that came true about what happened in the campaign we come back how were you able to predict that
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:37.680]  well in the case of some of the things that happened in the campaign them trying to steal
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.960]  the delegates and all that it's just we know how they operate and with donald trump i mean our first
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.760]  suspicion was is potentially just another ringer that he would be another surrogate for hillary so
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.080]  that was a concern then but we knew that he could win i mean absolutely with the history and track
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:58.560]  record trump had he had the resources and win or predictions straight ahead i just want listeners
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.440]  understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against us and we're seeing a lot of
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.960]  orders right now with the save info wars 50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.720]  marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.200]  a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.480]  thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:24.800]  crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product i want to expand
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.200]  not contract and for six months we've not just been a standstill the enemy's been winning and i
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:34.000]  have labored and labored and labored and labored on this i like to be expanding i like to be
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.680]  winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we need
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.160]  to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have time to get into dry
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:47.360]  out we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.440]  gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me or you or anybody else i mean the democrats

[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.120]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:08.480]  thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.960]  a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:17.280]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.800]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:26.720]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.120]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:35.040]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.200]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:44.480]  manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.000]  audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.240]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:46:00.880]  platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you only very very clear with everybody about all
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:05.280]  of this we're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.680]  final mega counts we have do their criminal activity and their and their digital fraud and
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:14.560]  we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year we need to in here we need to be
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.800]  provisioned and you've got my total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.840]  enemy fearlessly i'm loving every minute of this because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.400]  bloody and then i'm up politically i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.560]  back with lies that just brings more people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:38.880]  i need war bonds i need gas i need ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.960]  if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.560]  we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise a couple million
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.120]  dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:56.080]  and i will never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:04.800]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:10.800]  you
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:32.800]  alex jones he who must not be named that's wired magazine alex jones is Voldemort
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:40.720]  i was in the physical magazine hundreds of other similar articles calling me the one that
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.640]  must not be named and even after they wrote those articles facebook said you know what don't say his
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:54.800]  name don't say him full wars dot com or we'll ban you what incredible authoritarianism and now
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:07.920]  representative fred rica wilson well she says this here it is those people who are online making
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:16.480]  fun of members of congress are this grace and there's no need for anyone to think that is
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.640]  unacceptable we're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:29.280]  they should be prosecuted so richard reeves this is true fascism this is true authoritarianism
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.400]  um they've got their army anti-fighting people being protected they're bringing illegal aliens in
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:40.560]  to get everything free they're campaigning uh for president in mexico um they are bringing
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:46.560]  illegal aliens to be in the california government uh this is true this is the overthrow of the
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.760]  country this is absolute true un-american treason going on and fred rica wilson like i say she
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:56.000]  doesn't even know what america is about if she doesn't understand the first amendment so what we
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.200]  need to do is identify these people they're uncloaking thankfully fred rica wilson is a key
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.840]  example trump should have to be like santa claus he should be starting to keep a list of who the
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:11.200]  people are in congress and senate that are enemies of the country and he should be talking about this
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:15.600]  and twittering about this and they'll call that an attack when he says the press is saying overthrow
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.280]  the country america's bad he says well they're they're the enemy of america they then say he's
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.400]  censoring them no he's calling out enemies they're the ones attacking she's the one attacking
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.960]  and we have to call them out because she knows what she's doing that they are moving towards
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.320]  real authoritarianism richard absolutely they are in that's where if the democrats understood if
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:39.360]  the rank and file voters understood that it's you that she's trying to shut up it's you that she
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.880]  doesn't want you being uppity or talking uh it's you that she wants you to be quiet so obviously
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:50.640]  another thing she doesn't know is that the supreme court recently made a decision that even trump
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.160]  can't even block people that send him twitter messages that he doesn't like uh the supreme
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:01.760]  court ruled that the users have a right to go on there and say what they want to the politicians
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:06.320]  provided it's not something like hey i'm gonna come kill you like a real valid threat of violence
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.480]  or something like that so she doesn't even know that the supreme court already already ruled on
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.840]  that that's why that's why trump said put all the conservatives you've taken off back on what
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.320]  you're doing is illegal your election meddling he said it again he's getting ready to take action
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.160]  right and he does need to take action and you've talked about the antitrust issue that they're
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.640]  going to do the antitrust action against the big tech companies that needs to happen they need to
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:34.960]  be struck with every legal piece of the arsenal that we can strike them with i think that if you
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:41.200]  own stock in these companies you should be looking in calling it the sec because potentially these
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:47.360]  fang stocks the facebook apple amazon netflix and google that's why i think why trump has dragged
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:51.200]  his feet a little bit because he knows he could take the economy it could take down the economy
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.320]  but guess what trump look in 2000 they took down the economy you don't get elected because they
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.000]  still the election we're really screwed that's right so if the stock market is going to crash
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.680]  trump gets it he came out today and said we're in a war with china and the u they're printing and
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:08.480]  pumping money he goes the world's going into a bubble we can't fix it all we can do is battle back
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:13.680]  with the bubble and he's right we need to start injecting in more money in the economy to to to
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:19.360]  outgrow all of this so that the stock market stays up even when he slits the throat politically
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.800]  of these traderist organizations so a lot of blood's going to come out of the stock market when we
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:27.840]  do this that's okay blood transfusion it back in let it let it happen and as a matter of fact over
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:32.720]  the last few months you know the fang stocks have lost like a trillion in market cap or more
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.880]  and but the stock market in general has kind of stayed level because that's exactly what's been
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:41.120]  happening is i'm not stock market guru or expert but i've got some basic knowledge oh yeah the big
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.280]  tech stocks are in trouble because people know they've already hurt their brand with all this
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.880]  censorship and notice they went down another 50 something billion within three days of the veritas
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:56.480]  thing coming out because wall street went okay that's the head of their censorship saying this is to
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:01.440]  stop trump that will destroy them in court right that's like a top russian going we did buy off
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.560]  trump and here is the proof you know so that's another angle that the fang stocks need to be
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.600]  looked at is sec violations security exchange commission and another thing i'd like to see
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:18.400]  trump do is incorporate the first amendment into the trade deals right now you pointed out the other
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:23.120]  day that you've got the european union in china telling google hey you're going to censor this
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.440]  you're going to censor that you're going to allow this not allow that well you know hey you know what
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:31.680]  the united states is still the big kid on the block we're the ones that should be saying hey
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.960]  we want first amendment you've got to have first amendment in the european union otherwise tariff
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.920]  that's right EU and all the rest of them china are dictating to us how the internet runs exactly
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.320]  let me go we're libertarian we don't regulate it you just let the chai cons of the EU do it well
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.400]  see that's another point let me let me address it this frustrates me that i've never heard this said
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:54.720]  on the show yet and i want to say it right now if you're the smallest real estate investor you
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.960]  could have one house and guess what you are subject to all that all the anti-discrimination laws
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:06.000]  you can't discriminate against whoever wants to rent your house if they financially qualify if they
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.720]  have the basic finance financial qualifications if they're black or gay or whatever you cannot
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:15.600]  discriminate and that's just a mom and pop operation so you're not you're going to tell me that big
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.840]  corporations are subject to you know our legislation are you kidding me that's why we do have a
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:25.920]  government is to protect we the people from these old damn right i mean they claim oh you there's no
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:31.520]  discrimination on politics yes there is and there's election meddling and they lied to congress
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:35.680]  and they're operating as combines working together and they're selling data illegally
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:41.520]  there's a hundred ways to skin this cat absolutely absolutely so i'd like to see like say trump
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:46.800]  you know that's what that's what we're the big manufacturer of right now is the bill of rights
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:50.880]  let's export let's keep our bill of rights to make sure we have it let's have our first amendment
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:55.440]  let's have all our fourth fifth second amendment etc but you know what donald trump this is your
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:02.160]  chance to step up and be the biggest man on the planet ever by bringing the bill of rights
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:07.680]  to the world via say threats of tariffs just say hey you know what china if you're gonna have
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:11.680]  anti-first amendment in your country that's fine but you know what we're gonna tariff any
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.800]  in and then he has the total moral high ground because used to bingo we used to criticize china
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:22.880]  once obama got in nothing two million Uighurs taken to the other side of the country enslaved
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.440]  many of them killed we have the moral high ground in fact you that's what you're saying is so key
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.560]  if he attaches the tariffs to moral issues i mean hell hollywood if you don't let them kill
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.200]  babies after they're born won't come to georgia that's a false moral issue false moral equivalency
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.240]  but with this we have the moral high ground with the e you with with with china if you
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.720]  don't support free speech and you arrest people for their political views we're gonna lay tariffs
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:51.840]  on your ass and there's nothing the leftist politicos can say that trump needs to drop that
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.360]  bloody hammer now that's right and if he needs an act of congress to make that happen then guess what
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.720]  be santa claus make the list show and demonstrate who the people are that are against that idea
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.480]  because that's the ones we need to unelect and you were asking me about predictions or whatever

[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:55.120]  hey alec yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:59.600]  people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:04.080]  with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:08.480]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:13.040]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.480]  it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:20.240]  praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alec is i know they're
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:25.200]  trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.280]  until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:35.040]  shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:39.920]  like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:44.880]  if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people

[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:08.640]  i am here because there is a concerted effort by the democratic party and multinational corporations
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:14.480]  in big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices info wars founder alex jones is
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:19.920]  calling out alleged collusion between google and democrats sundar you know google is helping
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.560]  china with dragonfly and you know that they're helping censor and you know you know that you've
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:28.720]  sold this country out and you won't even help the pedagogical help the chikoms you bet on the
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:32.880]  wrong country sundar we're aware of his lying to congress we're aware of him in the dragonfly
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:36.720]  project that's already been operational for years inside the chinese government now it's just being
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:41.920]  rolled out the general public sundar you're engaged in treason you've had google executives lie to
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:48.320]  congress the big tech companies and the head of apple admit that they met with senator warner
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:52.960]  who's running this whole thing to begin shutting down conservatives or the democrats threatened
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.640]  to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to him i know we had alex jones in the
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:04.320]  room earlier promoting conspiracy theories alex jones obviously is a one of conspiracy theorists
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:09.680]  whose brand is bullying you didn't call me to testify in america i have a right to face my accusers
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:16.320]  and you congressman doge are a liar and a fraud google is evil google is evil google is evil
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:22.560]  and twitter is planning to permanently suspend alex jones's personal account at info wars this
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:28.320]  comes after twitter ceo jack dorsey was on capitol hill yesterday speaking with lawmakers twitter
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:34.960]  gives alex jones the boot to the social networking site permanently banning he and his media company
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.840]  info wars but i have a right to face my accusers jack they're lying about me and they're trying to
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:47.120]  de-platform me 26 companies working in concert violating the germany trust act and now
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.760]  senator warner and senator weiden have said quote there's thousands of sites worse than alex jones
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:55.840]  so we're becoming like cuba we're becoming like vietnam we're coming like china so regardless of
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:00.560]  what we'll think about me or the straw men should i have a first amendment or should these companies
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.040]  be able to to violate the whole safe arbor hack to all that and then ban conservatives en masse
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:13.040]  i don't know anything about your site man and we're also standing up to social media censorship
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:18.960]  that's the new thing our interview was cut short because he was confronted by alex jones of info
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.040]  wars right here in the hallway it's weird man oh yes really where there's no purge of conservatives
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.520]  i don't know we shadow banning are you concerned about bias in social media yeah who's this that
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:32.560]  we deploy concern about bias in social media well i think the bigger bias is against freedom of
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:37.040]  expression everybody should be there's a there's a look i i support going after here but you say
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:41.440]  i don't exist it's not a heckler i'd oppress the gaggle look at this guy he's saying that i don't
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:45.280]  exist and they're doing i just don't know who you are man i don't read your websites you're the
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.760]  for ringing ambassador and these very heroes and then he plays dumb here's the question info wars
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:54.640]  dot com you know it is does google does facebook does that's why you're going to be regulated like
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:01.040]  like do they need to be like marco rubio snake this is a bad boy here all right man yeah who are you
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.200]  my friend this guy i swear to god i don't know who i'm gonna be platforming tens of millions of views
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.600]  info wars bigger than russia lembaugh he knows who info wars is playing this joke over here that's
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:13.440]  why the platforming didn't work the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:18.800]  has been the radio show host alex jones for many on the left the view seems to have become that if
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:25.280]  you can't beat them prevent them from speaking on twitter the top tweet links to an info wars story
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:31.920]  this is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized the system
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:36.400]  self-corrected that's not that shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore it should be a usa
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:42.400]  article the last time i checked um but you saw this you at usa today at lunch i did yeah and this
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:46.800]  and i also saw the system system corrected even the new york times calls it a crackdown
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:51.760]  on conservatives and applying to deep platform conservatives from from the internet and communicating
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:57.440]  with each other today just like communist china we need you to act now and move against big tech
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:02.880]  censorship president trump cnn and the democrats you know are destroying the first amendment and
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:06.880]  needs to be stood up against these are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.840]  they are extremists and that's why facebook uh decided to get rid of them look at this right
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:17.200]  there's a guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that trump's wrong
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:21.840]  there's no censorship with conservatives or patriots you are incredibly shameful how are you
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.760]  doing alex you're just a look at you look what you are literally an anti-american anti-free speech
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.640]  power shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment but instead
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:42.240]  a tap dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:51.840]  we'll be back with massive breaking news on so many fronts that makes my head literally stand
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.120]  whatever you do share the links
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:02.240]  info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:07.600]  self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:12.400]  getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:17.920]  press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:22.960]  way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:27.280]  that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:31.680]  audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:35.680]  audience spends their whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:39.680]  products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:44.560]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech support letting
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.800]  the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:53.360]  ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:59.120]  press and free speech with free markets i want them shut down i want them silence i want them
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:04.480]  muted i think they are horrible for our society why are they doing this now well it's a good question
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:11.440]  as to why they waited this long but yes exactly yeah i mean so alice alps jones has been banned
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.080]  from facebook for a long period of time but now they banned him they banned his like little
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:20.960]  underling paul joseph watson now that they kick them off the platform that's great for now
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:25.680]  but it doesn't roll back the clock but you have also excesses in the first amendment and the second
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:30.240]  amendment right now you know i don't think that the four the forefathers said well you can say
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:34.560]  you know all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world literally spread it through
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:39.520]  the internet i have no issue with it at all i want them shut down i want them silence i want
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:46.160]  them muted i think they are horrible for our society i want them shut down i want them silenced
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:54.560]  i want them muted but don't worry these people aren't terrifying or anything those people who are
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:05.120]  online making fun of members of congress are this grace and there's no need for anyone to think
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:11.680]  that is unacceptable we're gonna shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:19.440]  and they should be prosecuted stand up give that a standing ovation rika thank you so much
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.560]  uncloking to that level and we know you've got a lot of cohorts in congress to think just like
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:31.280]  you do man i'll tell you what if they don't get fired in 2020 it's our fault not theirs let me
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:35.120]  ask you a question richard you've made a lot of great predictions you're a great political analyst
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:40.240]  with a friend of mine for 18 years worked here at info wars till you moved back to
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:44.320]  Fort Worth take care of your elderly mother and then came back down here but
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:50.880]  why are they coming out saying everywhere we are going to confiscate your guns we are going
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:55.200]  to take the new york times washington post cnn democratic debates we are going to give all
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.160]  the illegal aliens everything free free health care free housing free tuition no one will all go
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:06.560]  bankrupt saying america sucks saying american flag sucks all these major newspapers last week
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:11.040]  defended pedophilia and defended this guy when he came out and said you know that
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:17.040]  sex with kids is great pedophile convicted child porn peddler says desmond is amazing
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:22.800]  and is hot i can't even read this stuff on air uh mildly cyrus is putting stuff out about satanism
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:29.760]  and total death and you know being a being hell on earth and and it's it's not like mildly crew
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.280]  trying to act cute or something i mean that the energy of this it's all ugly it's gross it's it's
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:42.080]  like sex with deformed people and and and i mean i mean it's real satanic type stuff real
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:47.920]  wallowing in in in evil and it's all just busting out i think it's because they know they're behind
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:52.480]  schedule globalisms and troubles so they're trying to finish all of what they had planned right at
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:57.840]  once hoping we just give up right alex i agree with you on that i think we are at a jump point
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:02.720]  we're either going to push back the new world order right now and push them in the future
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.960]  two or three centuries who knows how far or it is going to come to fruition within the next 10
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:12.320]  to 20 years and so they're so arrogant they're so cocky and overconfident right now thankfully so
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:16.720]  i think it's to their detriment that they're this cocky and arrogant but they think that they're
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:21.120]  going to bring this on in they think they're going to bring their b system in uh hence that's why
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:26.560]  they're doing this uh rapid fire attack on everything first amendment you name it all
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:32.400]  this stuff that's going on the child uh molestation the pedophilia etc it's all part of that system
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:35.840]  they think they're going to make it come to fruition i think we're going to win i think
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.840]  we're going to push them back i think we're going to push them into the future i think uh hey
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.640]  the bible says their day comes one day that they're going to have uh their b system for a day like
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:50.320]  you said it's about a year's period of time but i say hey the bible doesn't say when it happens i
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:55.600]  think it's only when evil totally overcomes us all it's all a test right it's a test it's a test
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:59.920]  so we've got a chance to push it all back and we're at jump point you signed your john hand cock
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:06.960]  like i said i think at this point you and donald trump are key players on the planet to bring
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:12.320]  the first amendment to the world and i think the biggest offensive thing we can do is bring the
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:17.200]  first amendment to the whole world the whole the whole world should be able to go on to google or
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.760]  youtube or uh new websites that need to pop up i mean with these tariffs generated from the first
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:28.320]  amendment issue we can have a government system that's like the post office and then the only
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:33.760]  check on it is is is lawsuit judgments or law enforcement just like with the mail everything
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:37.760]  goes through they can't stop it unless it's illegal exactly i never said i wanted government
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:41.760]  but but but but but we already have googles bigger than the government right right this
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:47.360]  has nothing to do with its own system we should consider google youtube apple amazon netflix
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:52.640]  etc we should consider them countries we should consider right now enemy combatant countries
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:58.320]  foreign and domestic countries that are here actively fighting against the american way so
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:03.920]  you made a great point if the post office oh this isn't trump is talking about competing groups
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:09.840]  he's really having this summit that i'll document next hour uh to decide who it is they want a
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:15.200]  champion and so this is trump's gonna be squeezing the oranges and squeezing the papayas and you
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.720]  know you know checking the what he's about to bet on is what's happening and so i know a lot of
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:23.520]  the folks that are getting called up there i know that you know inside scoop i'm not gonna name names
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:27.040]  till they're ready but you know one of his carpe doctor he told me about it last week he's on next
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:34.960]  monday but trump is it is going to you already saw pascal the head of the campaign indoors parlor
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:40.480]  which is a good nice you know mainline conservative twitter but they'll let liberals on there as
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:44.800]  long as you're not pushing porn or trying to kill people uh are you know doing illegal stuff you're
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:52.080]  on there like twitter used to be you know 10 years ago uh and so that is genius we need to say hey
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.080]  post office we don't want you to do banking we don't want you to do all this other stuff
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.520]  but post office was always about communication and so instead of it being just 50 characters or
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:07.120]  100 characters it can be uh paragraph it can be a hundred paragraphs it can be two words but
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:12.480]  what if trump proposes the post office to launch something which literally you can run for like a
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:17.440]  billion dollars a year it would have advertising on it it would be super successful no political
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:24.560]  correctness no liberal no conservative it would just be basically uh it was illegal and and then
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.000]  the government could run and people are probably saying what you don't want government no no no
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.760]  this is the counterbalance to them impromptu just announces something like that twitter
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:38.240]  stock will tank i'd much rather him endorse some new conservative group that they'll still allow
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:42.160]  free speech but conservatives have a problem with free speech sometimes especially you know super
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:47.920]  right wing ones but man what if the post office came out because they're doing letters well the
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:52.640]  the post office should be in digital communication the the NSA is already reading all the damn mail
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:57.520]  had the had them pledged to stop reading it only public stuff would be read uh and then
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.320]  literally have the post office get into digital communications and they could be encrypted by
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:06.080]  the u.s government you have a higher standard where you pay for it and then you get encryption
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:12.960]  absolutely there should be public and private efforts to reopen the web i don't think anybody's
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.520]  proposed what we just said right me leapfrogging off your idea me building on your idea richard
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:23.280]  hey guys search engine have the post office run its own twitter and people say oh the post office
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:31.600]  can't get anything done that's a bunch of propaganda folks the fedex and ups gets subsidized by the
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:38.400]  usps not charging enough and so uh all of that subsidizing to that ends up basically helping
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:42.880]  them and again i'm not against free market things either i'm just saying we're in a new world a new
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:49.440]  system you want to make the post office profitable have it get into uh things like twitter and it
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:54.320]  can have its own social media system where if you don't break the law you can do anything you want
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:59.760]  on here it would be just like when the government's set out west anybody that get out to oregon
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:05.360]  anybody get out to california anybody get out to montana wyoming you know new mexico arizona
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.440]  colorada you can get a thousand acres back in the day was a thousand then it you know got cut
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.000]  down to 50 or whatever you can stake off that wasn't government involved that was government getting
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.640]  out of the way and you know how easy the government could launch its own twitter oh and then and then
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:24.080]  it could be secure the military could use it yeah and you know again we we need that we do need it we
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:28.480]  do need it in public and private format just like we talked about and then if china or anybody didn't
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:35.120]  let our system in we would then put tariffs on them absolutely it'd be like the real voice of america
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:40.720]  yes yes absolutely and that's what we call voice of america there we are voice of america the digital
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.840]  voice of america we should be exporting our bill of rights we should be definitely keeping them here
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:52.240]  but we're the major manufacturer of the bill of rights right 1776 worldwide 1776 worldwide let's make
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:56.880]  it happen let's make it come to fruition and while we're on this i want to talk about due process a
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.360]  little bit because the founding fathers created this country because of their belief that there was a
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.680]  necessity for due process you got to have due process and if we don't do it who else will yeah
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:10.240]  absolutely if we don't do it so you and trump had the opportunity here to bring the first amendment
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:15.200]  worldwide we need to talk about due process the only reason anybody should be suspended from
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.440]  twitter google youtube or whatever public uh you know like a post office thing like you're talking
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:24.080]  about twitter is there should be due process and you know what if it involves the first amendment
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:29.360]  the government and or the person entity bringing the charge to have somebody yanked out of that
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:36.080]  system should be the ones that pay for it and lose their money not john q citizen having to
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:42.080]  i'm just excited by the idea of the post office coming out with its own twitter and its own facebook
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:47.040]  oh my god that would make it so profitable too we need that counterbalance the post office is a

[02:20:55.440 --> 02:21:03.840]  are the humans we are the planet we are god's creation we are the future not you death coming
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:11.120]  to you live from the front lines of the info war we don't share death defending the republic from
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:16.560]  enemies born and domestic and it's time for humanity stand up in the info war
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.800]  let's say i don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:33.040]  believe you got one
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:46.720]  crashing the lies and disinformation info wars the most banned network in the world
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:51.760]  all right next segment i'm going to go through the video i've been talking about
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.960]  inside the terrorist planning sessions undercover video of antifun dc planning the
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:07.920]  acid attacks and the next chair launches also a famous black rap group hip hop group was in europe
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:12.880]  and didn't know that they were doing a show in an ogo zone and islamics tried to attack them
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:21.040]  and again these guys might weigh 120 pounds and then and then one is black guys look he
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:27.440]  weighs about 300 pounds and the other black guys are good size too they they beg them to stop hitting
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:33.600]  them and then they they hurt them bad but in this is a riddle that explains everything about the
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:41.280]  mouse conquering the lion because europeans bend over so much these guys literally thought they
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:47.120]  were king kong when they were going up against a guy built like king kong it shows how they're
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:52.800]  totally disconnected from reality but are groveling to capernick and the system in the left and we
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.880]  bowed everything they say makes them believe they're invincible that's why they're saying okay we're
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:00.560]  going to have sex with your kids okay we're going to take your guns okay we're going to arrest you
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.640]  okay we're communists okay we hate america because they in their own seattle and san francisco
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:12.800]  and in some areas of new york bubble are in control richard reeves you you got a big list
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:17.680]  of things you want to get into you predicted i think i took your horn you said i'm telling you
[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:26.240]  trump's gonna win this was back when my middle daughter was about three and she's 11 now so
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:31.440]  this was about eight years ago seven and a half eight years when we went to grand canyon right
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:36.480]  and i remember getting annoyed because i thought of trump and there was a tv guy and the apprentice
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:41.760]  and only casinos and have an orange hair and you know acting confident and i'll be honest i'm turned
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:46.400]  off by establishment stuff i didn't understand was a brand trump was pushing and you're like no
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:49.920]  trump's really a good guy and blah blah blah and he knows ronald reagan you know to see me these
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.480]  opera interviews and i'm telling you he's gonna run when obama gets out he's gonna win and i knew
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:57.920]  you were smart back then but we'd be driving you know 10 hours a day somewhere and i'd just say
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:04.880]  richard shut up okay he hangs out with the clinton's and then even when he started running it first
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:09.120]  i'm like i don't know i don't know you're like no i'm telling you he's good and then my and so i
[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:12.880]  looked into it learned him about the john burt society his dad and all the rest of us said okay
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:16.640]  then i had a good feeling about it and then you know he's delivered pretty much now but
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:20.720]  then you made a lot of predictions about how the delegates how the delegates would go how they try
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:24.240]  to steal them before anybody else didn't even then i'm like oh yeah right richard the democrats
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.320]  would never dare do that they did all that so by the middle of the campaign i was believing
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:32.320]  everything you said that turned out to be damn accurate well it was tomorrow's news today like
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:39.440]  we talk about uh i mean you had me on with rob do in december of 2015 i believe and that's when
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.040]  we called out all this stuff that they're going to pull out all the stops on trying to cheat don
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:48.400]  trump out of the nomination and and i explained how they do it and we talked about it and that's
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:53.520]  just like we didn't talk about it you called it exactly how it happened well it was like you say
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.240]  though if you study how they do things then you can figure it out uh that's like uh i came on with
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:04.720]  oan shroyer directly after the 2018 election and we talked about that hey the democrats getting a
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:09.440]  little bit of power in the congress in the uh u.s congress is probably going to make them act crazy
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:14.720]  and go crazy and here they are for erica wilson going crazy so hey listen uh shifting topics
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:18.240]  real quick though is you played the marco rubio thing a little while ago and i just got to call
[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:25.360]  out marco rubio for ring the ambassador you are an anti-american piece of crap i mean the thing of it
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:31.600]  is is that he sits on the senate intelligence committee alex he you know what are they doing
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:36.880]  on the senate intelligence committee not knowing what's going on the biggest attack on the first
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:41.840]  amendment is happening with i know nothing about attacks on free speech exactly i don't know who
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:47.120]  you are even though marco rubio obviously knows who i am what he's saying is we've shadow banned you
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:52.480]  you don't exist you're in the fandom zone right well marco rubio if if it's true however it's true
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:57.600]  that you don't know anything about info wars or fake whatever it is you're as useful as a screen
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:03.760]  door on a submarine so just resign from the senate intelligence committee resign your senate seat
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:09.520]  and furthermore if the other people on the senate intelligence committee are this ignorant about the
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.840]  biggest threat to the first amendment against the united states probably ever in history then you
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.560]  should all resign eliminate the committee because you're not doing your job and or whoever's bringing
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:24.320]  the information is not doing their job so i mean it's just by the way the media never showed the
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:28.880]  full clip there was already a press gaggle i was already there and then i'm like hey what are you
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:34.160]  gonna do about free speech being attacked and he just turns it goes who are you i don't know who
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:37.840]  you are and i'm like okay but what about the hearings the free speech being taken will you
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:42.880]  do something which now is the biggest issue this is like a year ago and he just is so arrogant
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:49.200]  he was arrogant and it's just like say to me it's unfathomable that he's trying to get away
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:54.160]  with pleading ignorance whether it's legitimate or not either way it's inexcusable he should
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:58.640]  lose his senate seat he should resign from the committee and tell him and glenn back and all
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:01.920]  then the hook their ponies on to other people everybody hates them so they've already done
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.360]  it themselves what else you got in your sheet there well i'd like to thank everybody for their
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:09.360]  prayers when i was sick i really think it made a big difference and thank y'all for the prayers
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.920]  and thank you for continued prayers and pray for info wars pray for alex you're a tough guy i mean
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:17.280]  you took you over a year and a half you mean because my dad visited you a lot i thought i mean you

[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:35.440]  the hospital i required over seven liters of fluids to keep you know what triggered it well
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:39.920]  that's a good question i mean i always have you got run down you could eat well yeah i had
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:44.480]  i got run down when i could eat and remember in may of uh 2016 when i was out there covering the
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:48.960]  trump campaign i told you hey i thought i had uh food poisoning or whatever and that's kind of when
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:53.440]  it all started you know so it took a few months to play out but uh anyway i'm doing a lot better

[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:13.920]  minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:18.240]  those lies against us last week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were

[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:59.440]  info wars the most banned network in the world i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks
[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:03.440]  into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:07.920]  back five six years ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:11.600]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:15.680]  doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey
[02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:19.520]  we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:22.400]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:27.920]  headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:33.760]  under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:37.680]  they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:42.240]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:46.240]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:51.840]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:33:01.600]  triple eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:16.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:32.640]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:37.040]  oh they're eating nothing going to make it happen all right getting back to richard reeves and
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:41.120]  i went to these other articles you were getting into some more predictions some more big ideas
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:49.520]  and it was the crew pointed out to me that we had the engineer from massachusetts on the show who
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:54.960]  talked about the post office having email it's supposedly got letters it should have a email
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:59.680]  that has advertising on it but that is free to the public uh as a counterbalance to these big
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:04.000]  corporations that are in bed uh with the chai comms of course that's sheva we're talking about
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.280]  but then i have the idea about what if the post office had a twitter where as long as you don't
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:14.080]  violate the law it goes back to section 230 the same immunity given to big tech they've been
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:18.160]  operating as utilities they say they're utilities but they're telling you oh you're a conservative
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:22.640]  you're a christian you can't have that joe bigs was on first hour he said he's going to organize
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:28.240]  an event in portland for free speech and that if antifa attacks them again with uh milkshakes full
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:36.160]  of acid or clubs that they would defend themselves well that's the verboten third rail you don't
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:39.760]  touch that they'll shout not fight back against government employees and black mask attacking
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:46.080]  you so he got banned off twitter well now he had a Shopify account and i plugged it on air to try
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:51.440]  to support him because he does a lot of activism they banned that so there is the carteling that
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:57.440]  goes on folks we're trying to build a platform so other people can quickly have their own site
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:01.200]  have their own video their audio that's something that the enemy knows i'm building it's why they're
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:06.480]  so pissed i put millions of dollars in the things around here okay and i got a lot of stuff going
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:11.680]  on and they they they they they hold me in a position of other things i'm up to on purpose
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:17.680]  with all the distractions so that i don't get all these plans completed we've done a lot of
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:22.480]  inventive things to keep operating but they've cut us down to the bone now there's no fat around here
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:29.520]  i need funding and it's so simple everybody knows bone broth is amazing they sell it for
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:33.120]  ten dollars a little mason jar at Whole Foods and it is good for you and it's got the chaga
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.520]  mushroom and a little bit of the uh bone broth of chicken in it that's reportedly the best and
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:42.480]  a little bit of bee pollen we go out and look at whatever's the hottest range whatever's the best
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:48.000]  whatever works the best and then we have it hundreds of times stronger for the price it's powdered

[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:15.680]  watch the transformation happen richard reams getting back into your points well i've done a
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.240]  lot of research on the supplement business and all that and i'll tell you alex's products are
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:27.120]  second to none top of the line folks for july 4th celebrate by getting on auto ship getting these
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:33.440]  products get the bone broth get the x2 get the bodies etc and sign up for auto ship alex needs
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:38.400]  millions of people subscribe to auto ship so he doesn't have to sit here and worry about funding
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:43.680]  the operation just making it happen and breaking making 1776 happened so i don't want to say all
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:47.520]  this on air because it makes the the the democratic lawyers and all them happy and what they're doing
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:54.400]  but in the deep platform of the attacks but and it's okay it's part of the plant uh but you know
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:59.680]  i can mortgage my house and get four or five months of funding here and three maybe three
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:04.880]  four months and i'm happy to do that i don't even care okay it's just that that's the type of level
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.920]  the enemy wants to get us the position of show we need your support right now we need to go on
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:14.320]  offense and that's part of the deal going on offense getting into those points talking about
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:20.640]  the future talking about what's coming up folks the 2020 election is now you need to be involved
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:26.880]  in your local politics at at each level if it's city council state representative us
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.840]  representative senator etc get involved because during this time of the year alex people have
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:36.320]  an opportunity to come face to face with the marco rubios people have an opportunity to come
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:40.880]  face to face with the frederica wilson's and talk to them about what they're doing and what's
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:47.120]  going on and that we only have six or seven months till the first primaries start to happen
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:52.400]  the time to get rid of some of these people that are anti-american in the house and senate etc
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:57.280]  is in the primaries you have these districts that are waited that they're going to go democrat no
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.880]  matter who's running it could be lucifer himself it could be frederica wilson herself she's probably
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:07.680]  in a district where the democrats going to win that race well guess what the democrat needs to lose
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:13.440]  she needs to lose in her primary does she not look like a batman villain she's saying arrest people
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:18.960]  that make fun of me and it's not a joke it's like this is a flaming authoritarian maybe that's the
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:23.600]  career she needs to have alex is as soon as she loses her seat in the house she can go to hollywood
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.840]  and be a batman villain i would be perfectly happy to maybe even buy a ticket for that movie just
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:34.160]  the victory but i'm telling you the 2020 election is now and laura lumar made a statement on the
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:39.120]  show a while back i think she was incorrect about it maybe you can clue me in on the on the thing on
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:46.320]  the complete thing but she said that candidates for office have cannot get their social media
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.960]  accounts pulled uh do you do you know any more about that well it's true that under federal
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:56.080]  election commission rules that once you're running they see it as really hard to do because it could
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.320]  clearly be election meddling and there are rules and advertising and things that if people take
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:05.520]  advertising from one candidate they have to take it from all the candidates so yes laura is at least
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:10.480]  in theory right i think uh it's i think it's i think she's correct in the statement i just
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.320]  don't think it's been adjudicated yet but bottom line is that it's been adjudicated in other cases
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:20.720]  with tv radio and print you're right right it's not been applied to social media but they've been
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:25.200]  abiding by it but they've been doing things like blocking uh members of congress's you know new
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:30.480]  campaign ads and things right so but we've seen where like in the supreme court case they've already
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:35.120]  said that even trump can't even block people that put negative comments on his twitter well the thing
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:39.120]  of it is is everybody just needs to run for office they can run for precinct chair you don't need any
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:43.680]  money run for precinct chair and then open up all your social media accounts and then guess what
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:47.920]  we have a first amendment law but you're right you're right i can run for congress you can just
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:53.680]  run for precinct chair no money you don't need any money you can run everybody wow wow richard
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:59.360]  rees is smart you're smart everybody the time has come the time is here the globalists are openly
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:04.320]  activating their anti-american forces to demonize the american people the very existence of our
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.960]  borders and that the whole world could come here and get everything free but that we the citizens
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:13.760]  have to pay for it when our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy if we don't have major innovation
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:19.600]  and major booms we will collapse into third world status and the un and others admit they're using
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:25.920]  giant migrant waves in europe and the us to collapse the countries to kill capitalism and bring in
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:30.640]  socialism so we can go the way of the old soviet union north korea and venezuela this is a plan

[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:09.440]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges

[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.600]  yeah uh we've had some storms here in austin here recently that they have been comparable to that
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.000]  they haven't lasted as long as that one that you and i went through that coming back from the
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.160]  man when i was driving home in the night the sun was setting and it was clear sky
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:40.240]  but over here was black blue clouds and lightning shooting sideways yeah and uh i went home and
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:42.880]  dinner hung out with the kids but everybody was telling me it was incredible yeah some of that
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:47.840]  lightning that's just like a horizon horizon uh that we've had recently has been incredible so
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:52.400]  it's some of the storms but we've seen a lot of stuff yeah absolutely been through a lot of stuff
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:56.560]  so hey it's good memories but hey listen i want to dive back into this real quick because i do need
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:02.320]  to call you out president trump president trump i'm upset over antifa and i'm so upset over this
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:10.560]  the first amendment issue with antifa in march march 11th of 2016 you had your chicago rally
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:16.560]  canceled because of antifa black block activities and here we are three years later just this past
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:22.640]  weekend these guys are getting milk milkshaked with chemical weapons it's just incomprehensible
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:28.000]  that there's an action on that president trump you're one of the few men on the planet that can
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.520]  go and just talk about that you know have you ever noticed ever since 2015 when he announced
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:38.800]  in 2015 that he could just simply talk about an issue he can simply talk about things and changes
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:45.680]  on that issue start to happen president trump talk about this issue with antifa pick somebody in
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:50.960]  law enforcement to go after these guys and i will say trump's biggest supporters are upset he won't
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.920]  he talks about it a little bit he people want to see him protect us absolutely think of the
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:00.480]  inauguration alex i was recuperating from my i watched him beat women up in front of me and i
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.080]  got we got we started fighting them and the cops came up the biggest cop ever saw the guy was like
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:08.160]  seven foot tall big old white guy and they were threatening to arrest us and we didn't stop running
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:15.440]  them we i was with a bunch of navy seals and army guys and we were active duty we ran them over
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:20.320]  well and the cops came and like we're gonna i'm like we're not supposed to beat their ass well
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:23.840]  and why shouldn't it be necessary that you should have to even just defend yourself it's
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:29.120]  supposed to get in well i know and these guys look antifa they're committing crimes before the fact
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:36.880]  look i went to the dn the rnc in 2008 to st paul minnesota and they had the antifa anti-racist
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:42.000]  action guys black black guys they had them up there during the mccain inauguration well guess
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:48.400]  what did you hear of any mccain supporter getting roughed up or touched at all in 2008 did you hear
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:54.160]  about no he was a ringer well he was a ringer but the thing of is they protected those people
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:59.840]  they protected all the mccain supporters all the attendees to the rnc nobody got touched because
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:05.280]  the police national guard all the law enforcement was out they had law enforcement from all over
[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:11.120]  minnesota they're protecting the people that are supporting john mccain and now and they busted the
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:16.800]  antifa that was planning the uh the model of cocktail attacks that's right they busted him and
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:21.280]  they knew about it all beforehand they they knew that these guys were you know those orange uh
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:25.680]  construction barrels they put out on the freeway they had stolen a bunch of those barrels and made
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:30.000]  makeshift shields out of them and all that they knew about all that stuff they they had the inside
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:36.080]  knowledge as usual it's an inside job so president trump gets somebody put them in charge of
[02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:41.520]  of busting antifa and following the money trail to whoever it leads we've all we've all talked about
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:45.760]  it over and over on the show we've heard it talked about let's get to where the money source of this
[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:51.040]  antifa comes from ultimately and in the meantime let's get these little punks busted because they're
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:55.520]  committing crimes before they ever get to the scene of the activity because it's premeditated if
[02:51:55.520 --> 02:51:59.600]  we're in a secret meeting knowing we're going to throw acid in people's faces even if you call us
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:03.360]  nazis they're not allowed to do that right in fact in fact here's a clip the video is up on info
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:09.040]  wars dot com and news wars dot com antifa unmask if you're a radio listener you've got to go see
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:17.120]  this video they are so pathetic they all look like characters of rat-like creatures uh so let's
[02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:23.680]  roll some of them a meeting uh in secret planning their attacks so we're going to start this video
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:41.600]  and then we're gonna start the presentation and again it's like peter will show you footage
[02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:47.520]  of animals being abused brainwash you they show some nazis and go oh look it goes on before and
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:52.800]  they go we're gonna attack nazis now on the fourth and on the sixth so they show you a nazi who has
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:57.120]  a right to speech i don't agree with them and they go so now we're gonna attack these nazis but
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:01.120]  they're not nazis they're trump supporters going in to see the fourth is your life so see how the
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:05.920]  bait and switch works right right and that's just it is like you know when we're talking about the
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:10.320]  inauguration i was recuperating from my illness i actually my wife and i were thinking about going
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:14.400]  the inauguration had i not been uh you know recuperating we probably would have gone but think
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:19.200]  of potentially there might have been millions of people that did not show up at trump's inauguration
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:23.120]  because the threats were rampant i want to explain something they would attack families with children
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:28.560]  trying to get the entrances and the police had designated which ones and before we're at because
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:34.080]  there were cylinder obama's control until the capital police until uh trump got sworn in and
[02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:40.240]  all the richie riches and me with my you know fronts passes we all got because i was right in
[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:43.200]  the front row but i went back further because you couldn't see trump right in the front row
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:47.120]  because he was right under the stage i was like literally the front row i had like the ticket
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:52.800]  but i went back about two rows i could actually see him uh and everybody but i i wasn't the
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:58.000]  latest i didn't know either at the front by the capital i was just entering the mall and we're
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.760]  like okay we can't get in here and he was there why are the cops and we see women bleeding and
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:06.720]  crying and kids crying and and i sort of cussing at the cops like what the after problem get in
[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:11.040]  there in the cops were like we can't do it it's not our jurisdiction or whatever so i finally
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:14.400]  went to another checkpoint another i said let's just go through them and we went through them
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:19.120]  they were hitting us and stuff so one guy's like it run completely runs over like eight of them
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:23.920]  they start bitching they call the police on us for fighting them well and that's just it now
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:29.200]  they've upped their tactics to these uh you know chemical weapon milkshakes etc so it's just more
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.760]  dangerous than ever and sooner or later someone's gonna get killed uh you know let me just say you
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:38.320]  can't take your child down to a fourth of july deal where antifa is you can't go to inauguration
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:43.680]  and i'm i'm i'm gonna stand on mr you know king kong or something but if somebody did something
[02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:47.280]  with my kids they're dead i don't care what they do to me i'm tearing the throat out i mean i'm
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:51.680]  gonna get them on the ground i'm gonna unwind their head and we as a man it's gonna happen so i mean
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:56.240]  your your head is going 360 and what's making me upset about that though is that you should never
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:01.360]  be putting the situation to start with because it president trump you need to take action on
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:06.880]  antifa and that should have easy to break somebody's neck well it's pretty easy i've heard you
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:12.160]  talk about it yeah i'm i'm afraid now no i'm serious you just grab somebody just like you
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:15.680]  want to kill them and they're dead and i mean i'm just i'm not trying to act tough here they're
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:22.160]  attacking children you're going to get your goddamn neck broken you freaking excuse me delay that if
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:27.360]  you have to just i can't handle it anymore president i can't these people are jokes man president trump
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:31.600]  you cannot wait till the next election to take action on antifa you can't wait till the next
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.760]  election to take action on the first amendment it's like matt drudge said when matt drudge came in
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.000]  on his interview i guess it was about three years ago he said whatever you're gonna do you got to
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:44.160]  do it now because i'm here to tell you he was here saying alert build your own system alex right
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.720]  they're gonna shut you down and we did we did some of it i wish i had that urgency well most people
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.280]  did nothing i told joe biggs months ago i said create other backup accounts other other names
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:57.120]  set up other systems you're gonna get banned everywhere did and i love him he didn't listen
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:01.840]  i tell everybody this they don't listen well that's it whatever we're gonna do we got to do it now
[02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:06.720]  matt drudge said it whatever greatness you have whatever skills you have make it happen now
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:12.960]  none of us know 2020 is now 2020 2016 was everything and now 2020 is the whole ball game
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:19.680]  exactly exactly if we don't have a massive change in 2020 if we don't fire a bunch of bad
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:26.480]  congress members if we don't fire a bunch of us senate members it's on us 2020 is now you have
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:31.280]  unprecedented access to these candidates happening right now because this is when they're filing
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:36.480]  and each info warrior at the very least you should be filing for precinct chair because then set up
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:41.440]  your social media accounts i guarantee you then it probably won't even come to that we'll probably
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:45.520]  get our first amendment back before we even do that but at the very least we'd all have a class
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.000]  amendment everyone should be running the office class so you can be on that stage and inject truth
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.720]  bingo all right my cat i'm just going to be taken over but i've got this special report that's like
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:57:01.040]  12 minutes long it's about to be posted to info wars.com and news wars.com it is a maximum
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:06.640]  action alert all of this stuff's important but this is a maximum action alert you know if there
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:14.400]  was a bat signal we'd fire it this is a emergency message to trump concerning tech censorship plus

[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:53.600]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:58.320]  one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:03.120]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:08.080]  they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys
[02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:11.520]  into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:15.520]  than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:19.840]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived

[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:45.120]  it's up on news wars.com but there's 20 minutes of this footage they're doing a rap show there
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:50.320]  they're at a hotel in a restaurant these guys hit their main security guards like a 300 pound big
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:55.360]  black guy in the head with their headphones bloody his head and he doesn't want to go to jones like
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:01:00.480]  hey stop stop these little 120 pound guys keep falling around you go why are they doing this
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:07.680]  because europeans all bow down to them so you've got this rap crew four five six guys
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:12.880]  you can see three up four of them on tape others are behind the camera and they keep harassing
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:17.920]  them and they say go away leave us alone they finally get their ass kicked these are probably
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:23.200]  like 16 year old little thugs doing it why would they feel so invincible why would they be like
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:29.280]  little banny roosters why would they be grabbing women's asses for no reason because everyone
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:34.480]  bows to them like cappernick saying he hates the american flag someone to get this rap group on
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:39.360]  i've told their president so watch this and tv viewers can see this you can go full stream
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:44.160]  and they just keep hitting them they keep saying leave us alone they walk away they hit them more
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:51.600]  and finally they get their ass kicked you talk about total delusional that all they've been doing
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:59.120]  is beating europeans up constantly with them groveling and they run into americans who aren't
[03:01:59.120 --> 03:02:02.800]  going to put up with it and i even though they weren't black guys they were you know guys from
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:07.520]  you know who were corn farmers from Nebraska they you know they would probably attack them
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:14.000]  quicker i can't believe how how these black rap group puts up with this crap so long american
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:22.240]  rapper a money son ap rocky and his crew work in front of by two migrants these are literal invaders
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:28.160]  arrogant full of hate in sweden who they fought later according to videos posted to media and
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:33.600]  reported these guys got put in ambulances but for 20 minutes richard reeves guys that maybe
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:38.640]  weigh 120 pounds are messing with the other black guys are probably 200 pounds one guy's like 300
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:45.200]  pounds and uh i mean one of it's a bunch of big white guys or whoever the but why would they do
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:48.960]  that because they're entitled and they're used to it richard well they are they know they're
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:52.800]  a protected class and they think they can get away with anything so they're just super arrogant
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:58.560]  and it's just amazing i mean think of if that were in the united states and if those were uh
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:02.800]  patriot white guys of course if they're anti-file white guys they can attack black guys no problem
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:07.360]  there's not going to be any kind of issue but if they were patriot info warrior white guys
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:12.160]  attacking big black guys man we'd never hear the end of it they'd just be all over it would be
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:17.920]  all over us so uh it's just amazing the arrogance that they've come to wise we look at this photo
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:23.600]  this guy's maybe 16 17 maybe 130 pounds and because it goes off like 20 minutes we can't play it all
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:29.760]  here they're hitting the big the big 300 pound bodyguard and he's like stop and they hit him
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:35.360]  again they hit him over and over again and i can't believe they got and finally they just literally
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:41.200]  finally the bodyguard doesn't do anything the regular rap guys literally do judo moves throw
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:45.120]  the guys the ground and then stomp the hell out of them i love it well and ultimately it's a great
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.400]  thing they had all these uh video shots of it and witnesses etc because had that not happened
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:55.760]  they would have been run so the bodyguards obviously got a license he's trained he knows he
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:00.080]  hurts these guys they can still sue him so it's finally the rappers that beat their asses right
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:04.720]  and they could be in the situation tommy robinson's been in with being railroaded had it not been
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:09.120]  through all the witnesses and video shots so thank god for that and and thank god that they
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:15.280]  were able to handle the situation well i agree but the psychology of you weigh 130 pounds and you're
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:21.200]  punching a 300 pound black did the face for the reason just because they the the the local news
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:26.880]  it meant yeah they tried to tell him you can't be here you're not from here right and then they
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:30.400]  tried to beat him up i mean well and that's how emboldened they are though because they think
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:34.640]  that they've got the powers to be in the system behind it's like i'll have some 130 pound little
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:39.760]  leps come up and throw tea in my face that hadn't been caught on tape copy has and they they go come

[03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:13.440]  president trump has signaled to the world that he's preparing to take action against big tech
[03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:20.720]  censorship he's announced at july 11th 2019 anti censorship social media conference to be held at
[03:06:20.720 --> 03:06:26.800]  the white house on the agenda will be ways to tackle big tech censorship and strike back
[03:06:26.800 --> 03:06:33.120]  the president is also keen on promoting new independent anti censorship platforms like
[03:06:33.120 --> 03:06:38.240]  parlor and gab our sources tell us and president trump has confirmed in public statements that
[03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:43.840]  he's also preparing to take antitrust action against big tech combines and cartels that have
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:49.920]  formed a monopoly over information and are meddling in the 2020 election thanks to project veritas
[03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:55.360]  we have even more proof from their own mouths that google is actively already meddling in
[03:06:55.360 --> 03:07:02.560]  the 2020 election and plans to deliver it to the democrats info wars analysis shows the most effective
[03:07:02.560 --> 03:07:08.080]  way for president trump to take legal and lawful action against big tech tyranny and manipulation
[03:07:08.080 --> 03:07:14.400]  of the upcoming election is to simply declare that all critical infrastructure federal employees
[03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:21.440]  including the arm services not be allowed to visit twitter facebook youtube google
[03:07:21.440 --> 03:07:28.240]  apple and other platforms that are openly like huawei working with the chai comms this will bring
[03:07:28.240 --> 03:07:33.680]  the tyrants to their knees similar executive orders similar to the president's order on
[03:07:33.680 --> 03:07:39.920]  colleges banning free speech should also be implemented that federal funds on projects and
[03:07:39.920 --> 03:07:47.120]  contracts will be denied including advertising to the big four tech giants until they stop meddling
[03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:52.160]  in us elections and now a word for myself alex jones the constitutional lawyer robert barnes
[03:07:52.160 --> 03:08:01.680]  on why you president trump must act now president trump alex jones here with an emergency briefing
[03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:07.120]  and as you know in the past four years i've given you briefings over the phone but also
[03:08:07.120 --> 03:08:12.480]  directly via the internet that have turned out to be critically accurate because we're here on
[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:17.040]  the ground giving you intel that you may not be getting in washington and constitutional
[03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:21.600]  lawyer robert barnes is here with me as well he's had his ear to the ground he's been studying this
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:26.720]  and he's been at the heart of some of the major cases against big tech censorship now i know you're
[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:32.960]  planning to rein in big tech and they're out of control behavior especially after the conclusive
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:38.720]  project veritas video that came out two weeks ago but president trump atlantic monthly and others
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:44.160]  have written headlines by the neocons saying oh trump's all talk big tech don't worry about
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:50.160]  the president do whatever you want censor conservatives what you've got to understand
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:56.080]  mr president is that china and the e you are already bringing in fines and regulations you've
[03:08:56.080 --> 03:09:02.720]  talked about this you know this against big tech basically us so even if you don't regulate
[03:09:02.720 --> 03:09:08.160]  they're regulated so you're not going to allow foreign governments to have this power vacuum
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:14.480]  opened up for them and i know you've been giving proper orders and directives for antitrust and
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:19.040]  for lawsuits just like you did with your executive order on universities that was beautiful so you're
[03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:23.200]  not going to discriminate against conservatives or christians and i understand that a lot of your
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:28.480]  underlings don't carry out your orders but i'm just here to tell you ahead of your big summit
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:40.880]  coming up on the 11th of this month that leadership and a strong message to big tech is all that's
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:46.320]  going to turn this around because even if you are going to win the 2020 election which all the
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:51.120]  real numbers show you are they're planning on stealing it and they don't want you to have a
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:59.200]  voice or a support base when they do it and from my expert analysis you don't have a prayer of winning
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:03.920]  despite the fact you're probably 20 points ahead in real polls we all know that you're loved out
[03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:09.760]  there on the street across this country it doesn't matter if you don't have the voice and if you don't
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:13.840]  have control and if you're not standing up to big tech they're the same crew that's going to steal
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:20.400]  the election from you so you've got to go after them with less than 18 months out decisively now
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:25.680]  robert barnes step up here and talk quickly the president big tech believes that the president is
[03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:30.800]  bluffing big tech believes they can continue on their path they're doubling down on their path
[03:10:30.800 --> 03:10:36.000]  to meddling the elections to corrupt the elections to rig the elections by by what they're doing with
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:39.600]  their algorithms by what they're doing with censorship by what they're doing with blacklisting
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:44.720]  by what they're doing with demonetizing and unless they think at this summit is just a show summit
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:49.280]  they think this summit is not consequential they think the president is simply bluffing doesn't
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:53.680]  have the cards doesn't have the chips doesn't have the chutzpah to move forward and do something
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:10:58.560]  real and significant and consequential so that is why it is critical and essential and fundamental
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:02.960]  for the president to do to big tech what he did in terms of going right to north korea and getting
[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:08.160]  the peace talks renegotiated and back going again he must do the same with big tech to make clear
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:13.600]  that he has the real chips he has the real cards and he has the real guts to take real action just
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:18.480]  like you've done on mexico and the borders and making them put 14 000 troops to the border
[03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:22.800]  you know what to do and i know you're giving the right orders but just as you said big tech
[03:11:22.800 --> 03:11:28.080]  brags that you won't follow through they think they own washington so if you won't stand up to
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:34.240]  him on this it's seen as a bellwether a test to steal the election traditional watch just proved
[03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:40.320]  1.5 million fake voters in california way beyond the 3.3 million nationwide you talked about
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:45.920]  you know that if you don't exercise power against them right now they're going to take that election
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:52.080]  from you exactly so now is the time to act july 11th is the time to make clear to big tech
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:56.080]  that you will not be bullied that you are not bluffing and that in fact the president of the
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:00.080]  united states will exercise the power of the presidency to protect the freedom and fairness
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:06.400]  of our elections you did the right thing on huawei visionary that's 5 g isn't even in yet 98
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:11.280]  percent of the country you have big tech allied with china you have google and apple that have
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:16.320]  moved there a year and a half ago you've got them helping oppress their own people and then
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:22.400]  they tell you oh we're not spying on anybody oh we're not election meddling it's all a lie
[03:12:22.400 --> 03:12:30.080]  and it's a paper tiger a paper dragon if you will simply announce antitrust investigations if you
[03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:36.320]  will simply unleash the fbi for national security issues with apple moving its code keys to everyone's
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:41.760]  iphone and device to china which was in roiders year and a half ago if you'll simply go after them
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:47.760]  these authoritarians will back down but these would be dictators of america don't have any
[03:12:47.760 --> 03:12:54.640]  respect for you because you're a decent businessman and you've been trying to negotiate and be friendly
[03:12:54.640 --> 03:13:00.720]  and and you know give them a carpet of gold all they recognize is a carpet of bombs that means
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:07.280]  political resistance they have been demonizing and attacking and suing and raping your constituency
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.720]  because they hate you so much and you're the ultimate target and your family is and now you
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:18.880]  have the project veritas proof you have senator widen saying i want the donald subreddit shutdown
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:24.640]  the biggest website in the world that supports you and produces most of the memes you're the target
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:30.000]  and you know it so i hope this summit which we've got the inside baseball on is it just a pat people
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:34.160]  on the head make sure your constituents don't get pissed and you promise to make it a campaign
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:39.840]  issue and go out for big tech if you win again you're not going to win again they're going to fix
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:44.160]  the election they're going to steal it they're russia gate failed they're pissed they're coming back
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:49.040]  crazier we've done the research we know what's happening we know about section 230 we know about
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:55.200]  the combines the monopolies the eu regulations what do you want to advise the president in closing
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:14:00.800]  are his most important points to hit to be able to stop big tech from selling this country out
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:04.800]  the president must exercise the power of the presidency to protect the freedom and fairness
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:09.200]  of elections that means that unleash the federal trade commission on these consumer protection
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:14.320]  violations unleash the department of justice and the antitrust investigations and in in fact
[03:14:14.320 --> 03:14:19.840]  create a special council to investigate whether or not they these ceo's committed perjury before
[03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:25.120]  congress when they lied repeatedly last year and they're lying repeatedly this year about their
[03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:30.400]  efforts to control the elections metal in the elections and censor free speech on the internet
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:35.280]  exercise that power now and he can change the script for 2020 so that an honest election puts
[03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:39.360]  him back in the presidency where he belongs so the president's watching this they're at the
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:44.080]  oval officer on air force one we know he sees his reports great patriots get it to him from a
[03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:48.640]  secret service you name it we salute you what else does he do though it's a roadmap obviously he's
[03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:53.680]  got all the facts he understands this he's already given most of these orders but but but how does he
[03:14:53.680 --> 03:14:58.560]  rein in this these rogue groups who think they're so powerful big text only powerful because we
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:03.200]  thought it was part of america and we turned it loose they've shown they disdain america like a
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:09.280]  bunch of snot-nosed sjw's what else does the president do legislatively executively through
[03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:13.440]  the criminal justice system what are the other tools the other tools are to push senator holly's
[03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:18.880]  legislation to condition future section 230 immunity on protection of free speech and the
[03:15:18.880 --> 03:15:23.200]  protection against election meddling that senator holly's bill is currently in the senate to do he
[03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:28.720]  can also announce all of these steps these critical executive and legislative and public steps at the
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:33.920]  summit itself he needs to confront them directly confront them individually confront them on camera
[03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:38.160]  in front of the world so that the world know use the power of the bully pulpit as well as the
[03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:42.560]  presidential power to change the electoral environment so that we have free and fair elections
[03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:46.800]  because the only way that's going to happen is if the president exercises his presidential power
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:53.520]  and there's another huge way mr president you already know this rad parskills you're amazing hi

[03:18:02.240 --> 03:18:06.640]  and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:11.680]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:16.400]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:19.920]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:23.920]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the

[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:34.800]  this message to trump hit his twitter hit his facebook hit his white house email send this out
[03:21:34.800 --> 03:21:39.600]  the president will see this report i'll call some of my sources and try to give him to watch it as well
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:44.640]  that he doesn't always watch it but a lot of times he does especially if you flood him with emergency
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:49.200]  measures to donald trump concerning big tech censorship and july 11th social media summit
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:52.960]  you can also report it to that website at whitehouse.gov about the censorship
[03:21:52.960 --> 03:21:57.040]  the president needs to be flooded with this information that's what he looks at is what
[03:21:57.040 --> 03:22:00.640]  he's flooded with he cares about what you think and what you're saying we're really shaping the
[03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:05.440]  future here on how we're going to take action now going to mike adams of naturalnews.com
[03:22:05.440 --> 03:22:12.960]  thank you alex uh what is astonishing today is how well delineated the lines are now between the
[03:22:12.960 --> 03:22:18.720]  anti-american factions and the pro-american factions the democrat party no longer even
[03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:23.680]  pretends to love this country they're out there announcing all kinds of agendas that would destroy
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:29.520]  america from within they claim that america is running concentration camps and yet what the
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:35.520]  left wants to do is actually put conservatives and christians into actual concentration camps
[03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:39.680]  and by the way it's not a concentration camp at the border if if you can turn around and just go
[03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:48.240]  home that's that's simply a processing facility on a humanitarian basis and aoc continues to lie
[03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:54.080]  about it and exaggerate what's going on there but it's astonishing to me how quickly the left has
[03:22:54.080 --> 03:23:01.840]  become anti-america how quickly they have professed their hatred for this country in fact rush limbaugh
[03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:06.720]  even made a point the other day i think it was yesterday that collin capernick it's clear from
[03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:12.880]  his attack about the american flag on the nike shoes it's clear that collin capernick he was never
[03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:19.120]  interested in police brutality he was always anti-america he hates the symbols of america
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:25.760]  he hates symbols of freedom and liberty and he has brought nike to the point where it's now obvious
[03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:34.880]  that nike itself hates america along with many other corporations such as google apple and twitter
[03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:42.480]  and facebook that are clearly demonstrating anti-america bias for example twitter will not take
[03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:49.520]  down the antifa accounts even though antifa is clearly a domestic terrorist organization at this
[03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:55.840]  point twitter and facebook and google they will ban organics they will ban natural health websites
[03:23:55.840 --> 03:24:02.000]  they will ban sites that criticize the dangers of gmo's or herbicides or pesticides or vaccines
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:08.400]  but they will not ban left-wing domestic terrorism groups and this is why i agree with
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:15.840]  what robert barnes and alex said in that special report president trump must take decisive action
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:22.720]  he must unleash the regulatory giants of government to go after these tech giants in the interest of
[03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:28.480]  protecting individual speech and none of us are fans of big government running roughshot over the
[03:24:28.480 --> 03:24:33.680]  rights and civil liberties of individuals but it is the proper role of government to go after
[03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:39.520]  corporations when those corporations are threatening the rights of individuals and in effect
[03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:45.680]  the tech giants today are running a massive criminal cartel to steal the election this is
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:51.440]  election meddling at a scale that robert muhler could have only dreamed of when he was fabricating
[03:24:51.440 --> 03:24:57.680]  his delusions of russian interference in the election in truth the interference in the election
[03:24:57.680 --> 03:25:02.560]  is these tech giants and they are doing it deliberately they're engineering it every day
[03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:08.480]  and if president trump does not rise to the occasion and stop this i don't see that he can get
[03:25:08.480 --> 03:25:14.480]  elected i mean even as disastrous as the democrats are right now you saw the debates you saw the
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:22.000]  clown show you saw how disastrous their ideas are the only ideas they have are bad ideas and yet
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:29.120]  if president trump does not take decisive action to stop this collusion of censorship
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:34.480]  among the criminal cartels of the tech giants then trump supporters will have no voice
[03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:40.640]  trump supporters will have no opportunity to debate in the public space we're all being
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:46.960]  silenced every day more channels being silenced and trump will not win unless he takes decisive
[03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:52.720]  action and i hope that message is getting through to him very clearly another important point
[03:25:52.720 --> 03:26:00.560]  alex said this earlier in the show the civil war in america has begun the left is waging it
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:06.720]  and the right is doing nothing the right is just the conservatives are just letting america be
[03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:12.320]  overrun the left has launched a civil war the left has launched their brown shirts they've
[03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:18.240]  launched their terror wing which is engaged in domestic terrorism violence the use of
[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:25.440]  potentially lethal weapons against journalists like andy no and many others the left is out of
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:33.680]  control and they will not stop until they are forced to be stopped by the intervention of
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:40.000]  probably the federal government or perhaps trump invoking the insurrection act which is exactly
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:45.280]  what needs to happen and i agree with what stewart rode said the other day trump needs to put on his
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:51.760]  commander in chief hat and he needs to invoke the insurrection act and he needs to authorize action
[03:26:51.760 --> 03:26:57.360]  against antifa terrorists he needs to label them designate them a domestic terrorist organization
[03:26:58.240 --> 03:27:06.160]  and after doing that allow law enforcement to clean them out arrest them prosecute get them
[03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:12.640]  off the streets these are radical rabid terrorists committing acts of violence against innocent
[03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:18.240]  americans and of course they're all wearing and it's time to unmask them and it's time to
[03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:22.480]  defang them so to speak it's time to take them off the streets and it's time
[03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:29.600]  for american conservatives to stand their ground now a word of warning in all of this
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:35.680]  it's very clear to me that the entire media wants a conservative with a concealed carry permit
[03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:42.800]  to open fire on antifa terrorists they want to see that bloodshed and they would of course they would
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:48.480]  twist the story they would edit the video they would change the camera angles they would do what
[03:27:48.480 --> 03:27:56.160]  they did to was was it nick sandman the the the young catholic school student who was completely
[03:27:56.160 --> 03:28:01.520]  smeared by the media even though he was only standing his ground and peacefully smiling as
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:07.040]  these radical left-wing activists continue to to threaten him and smear him and try to get him to
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:14.000]  do something but the media wants conservatives to open fire in self-defense because the media
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:20.560]  wants the narrative and it will go exactly like this oh today trump supporters openly
[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:28.720]  shot and killed innocent innocent uh uh progressives who were carrying milkshakes
[03:28:28.720 --> 03:28:33.280]  that's going to be the story they want they'll even take off the antifa masks and show you
[03:28:33.280 --> 03:28:37.680]  the person without the antifa garb whatever it takes they're going to try to twist the story
[03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:43.120]  and they want armed conflict to take place much more analysis straight ahead here on the
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:46.880]  alice jones show this is mike adams we'll be right back after this break

[03:32:15.760 --> 03:32:20.000]  experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:24.160]  founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[03:32:24.160 --> 03:32:28.480]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then
[03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:32.640]  ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[03:32:32.640 --> 03:32:37.200]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[03:32:37.200 --> 03:32:42.320]  persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the
[03:32:42.320 --> 03:32:46.880]  that they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and
[03:32:46.880 --> 03:32:51.600]  freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation
[03:32:51.600 --> 03:32:59.600]  lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:20.800]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:33:20.800 --> 03:33:29.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show mike adams filling in here for natural news now this year
[03:33:29.280 --> 03:33:38.480]  2019 is the 30th anniversary of the discovery of so-called cold fusion cold fusion which has
[03:33:38.480 --> 03:33:45.520]  since been renamed low energy nuclear reactions lenr just pronounced liner cold fusion was first
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:52.480]  announced by two scientists very widely recognized scientists named fleishman and ponds at the
[03:33:52.480 --> 03:34:00.240]  university of utah salt lake city 1989 now what they had observed was excess heat production
[03:34:00.800 --> 03:34:06.880]  in a reaction that could not be a simple chemical reaction it had to be in fact a low energy
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:13.600]  nuclear reaction involving in that case a palladium matrix and heavy water also known as deuterium
[03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:20.960]  now this cold fusion reaction was never called cold fusion by the discoverers of it fleishman
[03:34:20.960 --> 03:34:27.760]  and ponds in fact that name was put on them as the attacks began to happen i want you to understand
[03:34:27.760 --> 03:34:33.520]  that the attacks you see today on alex jones info wars or even myself or others in the independent
[03:34:33.520 --> 03:34:40.480]  media the exact same thing was run against fleishman and ponds in 1989 except they did not have
[03:34:40.480 --> 03:34:47.360]  their own websites to fight back with because the internet hardly even existed in 1989 so the entire
[03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:53.520]  establishment including the entire what we would call mainstream media today they colluded to destroy
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:59.200]  the reputation of fleishman and ponds they colluded to cover up one of this this discovery which is
[03:34:59.200 --> 03:35:05.520]  one of the greatest discoveries in human history and the reason they did that was because there were
[03:35:05.520 --> 03:35:13.200]  billions of dollars being funded into the realm of so-called hot fusion hot fusion which still
[03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:19.840]  has not produced a single excess calorie of heat to this day as far as as far as i know
[03:35:20.880 --> 03:35:24.320]  hot fusion is not still not working and the current estimates are that hot fusion will
[03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:30.560]  take until the year 2060 just to produce a feasibility result there's an organization
[03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:36.880]  named iter it er that's being constructed in france that is working on hot fusion with
[03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:42.320]  international money to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars but getting back to 1989 it
[03:35:42.320 --> 03:35:50.160]  was the department of energy that got involved the doe helped shut down cold fusion and because the
[03:35:50.160 --> 03:35:58.560]  doe really rules over nuclear energy production and the nuclear designs that we have today are
[03:35:58.560 --> 03:36:06.000]  engineered to produce nuclear fuel as a byproduct and this is what has enabled for example former
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:13.840]  president barack obama to commit acts of treason by funneling nuclear technology to countries like
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:20.400]  iran in some cases claiming that it's just a peacetime energy production or back in the
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:26.880]  case of bill clinton providing nuclear technology to north korea they said it was peacetime nuclear
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:31.920]  energy it's infrastructure for the people of these countries in truth it's all designed to
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:38.320]  generate nuclear weapons and in the case of barack obama those nuclear weapons being funneled to
[03:36:38.320 --> 03:36:44.960]  iran with international money laundering from the obama administration plus nuclear fuel being
[03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:52.960]  sold through the clinton well how should we say this the hillary clinton and her foundation were
[03:36:52.960 --> 03:36:58.800]  part of the movement of nuclear fuel out of the united states through canada to russia which
[03:36:58.800 --> 03:37:05.520]  eventually ended up in the hands of iran and this was all done by design this was all done in order
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:11.920]  to provide iran with nuclear weapons and it all traces back to 1989 the attacks on cold fusion
[03:37:11.920 --> 03:37:16.880]  and why they had to keep the hot fusion realm alive understand that the globalists today
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:23.760]  they want international nuclear war they want destabilization and most of all they want
[03:37:23.760 --> 03:37:29.760]  enemies of america to be well armed with nuclear weapons and in fact these democrats like bill
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:36.240]  clinton and barack obama have worked diligently over these years to provide the enemies of america
[03:37:36.240 --> 03:37:40.960]  with nuclear weapons capabilities and their efforts will continue if there's another democrat
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:45.360]  in the white house they will do the same thing understand i think it's become apparent today
[03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:51.760]  these people hate america they want to see america destroyed they wouldn't mind seeing america nuked
[03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:56.320]  they certainly wouldn't mind seeing america's allies nuked such as israel in the middle east
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:38:03.760]  for example or japan being nuked by north korea and japan is a u.s ally today of course and
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:10.400]  japan is someone that helps bring stability to that region or a nation that helps bring stability
[03:38:10.400 --> 03:38:15.760]  so it's very crucial to understand history here a lot of you maybe haven't heard about cold fusion
[03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:22.800]  or low energy nuclear reactions if you want to get up to date on that there is a podcast site
[03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:30.800]  that i made note of here it's called coldfusionnow.org and there there's a host named ruby uh what is
[03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:36.880]  it carrot ruby carrot and she interviews people and she brings podcasts about what's happening
[03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:42.400]  in the realm of cold fusion the truth is that these cold fusion experiments are being replicated now
[03:38:42.400 --> 03:38:49.120]  they have been successfully recreated in hundreds of laboratories across the world including laboratories
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:55.200]  in japan laboratories in europe in the united states and other countries and in fact corporations
[03:38:55.200 --> 03:39:01.360]  like toyota have invested money in low energy nuclear reaction research and believe it or not
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:07.440]  google is also invested through one of its subsidiaries in low energy nuclear reaction
[03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:13.120]  research what's fascinating to me is that when you have all these climate change cultists running
[03:39:13.120 --> 03:39:19.200]  around saying oh the climate's going to destroy us all they say carbon dioxide is bad they say
[03:39:19.200 --> 03:39:25.840]  fossil fuels will be the end of all of us there's hardly i can't think of one of them
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:33.040]  that has gone out and said we need cold fusion we need low energy nuclear reactions that technology
[03:39:33.040 --> 03:39:39.200]  exists it has been covered up by the department of energy i.e the war machine in america the military
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:46.800]  industrial complex and it is exactly individuals like president trump who threatens to cause
[03:39:47.840 --> 03:39:55.360]  upheaval that could unleash this technology for the benefit of humankind imagine eating your home
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:40:02.800]  in the winter with a small machine that is no bigger than a modern day computer server
[03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:10.640]  you know smaller than your dishwasher but it heats your home for virtually free imagine
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:16.240]  eating businesses warehouses and farm and agricultural buildings which consume a tremendous
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:24.720]  amount of fossil fuels throughout the winters all of that is producing co2 which i say co2 is a
[03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:29.440]  healing molecule it's a greening molecule it's good for plants but the climate change people
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:36.080]  say co2 is a poison and a pollutant and yet you don't see them saying let's use cold fusion
[03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:41.440]  to heat homes and buildings and and farms and warehouses and schools you don't see them saying
[03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:46.240]  that which proves they're not really interested in solving the problem they just want something to
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:51.600]  complain about their winers just like everything the left does they want victims they want the
[03:40:51.600 --> 03:40:58.960]  dead dad and the dead child in the river crossing the border they want destitution they want homelessness
[03:40:58.960 --> 03:41:03.760]  austin just passed a law to have tent cities and shanty towns all over the public streets and
[03:41:03.760 --> 03:41:09.840]  sidewalks of austin they want to turn austin into san francisco i guess or seattle and you have all
[03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:16.400]  these liberal cities are now expanding into mass homelessness that is by design understand that's
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:23.040]  on purpose they want problems in our world they don't want any solutions whatsoever so when trump
[03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:27.680]  comes along it says i'm going to bring solutions to this trump says i'm going to solve this international
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:32.880]  trade disparity trump says i'm going to i'm going to fight this currency war against china which is
[03:41:32.880 --> 03:41:38.880]  constantly devaluing its own currency trump is a solutions oriented kind of guy and that's why he
[03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:43.440]  is hated by the establishment because the establishment needs problems the establishment
[03:41:43.440 --> 03:41:52.160]  needs scarcity of fossil fuels they cannot allow solutions to be publicized and shared with the public
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:58.800]  look we already have the answers folks to all of these problems we can we can create essentially
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:05.040]  free heat we have the answers to cancer we can solve the cancer epidemic we know how to solve
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:11.200]  a joblessness we know how to solve homelessness we know how to stop infectious diseases from
[03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:16.160]  spreading we have in fact we have advanced propulsion systems we know how to travel
[03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:22.560]  and explore other planets with much greater efficiency all these solutions exist but they're
[03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:28.480]  all being suppressed and shut down by the establishment that wants to keep humanity weak
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:34.480]  and keep humanity enslaved and keep you dumbed down and keep you ignorant google and the tech
[03:42:34.480 --> 03:42:40.080]  giants have become realms of anti-knowledge they no longer allow you to find real knowledge it's all
[03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:44.880]  about teaching you falsehoods and lies that's the reality of the world and wish we live today and
[03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:49.920]  that's what we're fighting tear that down and free humanity we'll be back with much more right here on
[03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:59.120]  the alex jones show info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a
[03:42:59.120 --> 03:43:04.480]  self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people
[03:43:04.480 --> 03:43:09.280]  getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent
[03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:14.800]  press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a
[03:43:14.800 --> 03:43:19.840]  way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:24.160]  that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:28.560]  audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the
[03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:32.560]  audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on
[03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:36.560]  products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:41.680]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech support letting the
[03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:46.160]  audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate
[03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:50.880]  american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free
[03:43:50.880 --> 03:43:56.640]  speech with free markets only very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the
[03:43:56.640 --> 03:44:01.120]  season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:05.280]  do their criminal activity in there and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've
[03:44:05.280 --> 03:44:10.640]  got capital to go six months a year we need to end here we need to be provisioned and you've got my
[03:44:10.640 --> 03:44:14.960]  total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm loving
[03:44:14.960 --> 03:44:19.280]  every minute of this because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up
[03:44:19.280 --> 03:44:24.000]  politically i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies that just
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:28.720]  brings more people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and i need war bonds i need
[03:44:28.720 --> 03:44:34.080]  gas i need ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with
[03:44:34.080 --> 03:44:38.160]  product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable
[03:44:38.160 --> 03:44:41.600]  together i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars
[03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:45.920]  right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and i
[03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:50.560]  will never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding
[03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:56.800]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this there is no longer any doubt multinational
[03:44:56.800 --> 03:45:02.480]  companies and governments are funding an attempted violent malice style overthrow of the us our borders
[03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:07.120]  are being totally collapsed already born babies are being killed world government is here now is
[03:45:07.120 --> 03:45:11.040]  the time for decision now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're
[03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:14.640]  on and if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the american flag and
[03:45:14.640 --> 03:45:18.400]  attacking the family and that are attacking our borders and our country and our military and our
[03:45:18.400 --> 03:45:22.240]  heritage if you want to defend that then now's the time to take action and that means word of
[03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:26.960]  mouth about this broadcast and that means buying products and info or store dot com and that means
[03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:31.360]  praying for info wars and praying for president trump and praying for yourself and praying for peace
[03:45:31.360 --> 03:45:35.440]  praying for justice we're running it through july fourth but it's got to end because we're running
[03:45:35.440 --> 03:45:40.160]  out a lot of the best selling items we have store wide free shipping store wide free shipping 50

[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:02.560]  the globalists are openly activating their anti-american forces to demonize the american people the
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:07.120]  very existence of our borders and that the whole world could come here and get everything free
[03:46:07.120 --> 03:46:11.920]  but that we the citizens have to pay for it when our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy if we
[03:46:11.920 --> 03:46:16.960]  don't have major innovation and major booms we will collapse into third world status and the
[03:46:16.960 --> 03:46:23.280]  un and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in europe and the us to collapse the countries
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:28.080]  to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go the way of the old soviet union north
[03:46:28.080 --> 03:46:32.240]  korea and venezuela this is a plan that's why we've got to stay on air it's why you've got to keep
[03:46:32.240 --> 03:46:36.080]  fighting because we're going to win this in the end thanks to you and your support that's what
[03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:40.880]  makes it all possible so i salute you and i thank you but i ask you again do your shopping with us

[03:46:57.040 --> 03:46:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:10.160 --> 03:47:17.600]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's
[03:47:17.600 --> 03:47:22.000]  mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:25.040 --> 03:47:29.920]  i guarantee you that you're not ready for what's coming the reason i know you're not ready
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:34.880]  is because i've been prepping in one way or another for over 20 years and i'm not ready
[03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:40.400]  unless you are sort of a lifelong professional prepper there's no way you can be ready
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:45.520]  for what's coming and when i say what's coming talking about and celebrating cascading
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:51.120]  collapse of what you know as civil society and the infrastructure that serves that society today
[03:47:51.120 --> 03:47:54.880]  so this segment is going to be about collapse and some of the things that you can do to insulate
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:48:03.680]  yourself right now i was um there's a by the way a couple of movies that you need to watch
[03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:08.720]  or rewatch so i'm going to recommend to hear number one remember book of elie with densel
[03:48:08.720 --> 03:48:16.320]  washington and his character was roaming through a collapse post apocalyptic world where there had
[03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:21.840]  been some kind of war some kind of a grid down scenario maybe nuclear war it wasn't really clear
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:30.160]  in the movie but in that in that scenario all the ammo had already been used so this was the post
[03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:36.800]  ammunition world now it's important to realize that no matter how much ammunition use stockpile
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:42.080]  and those of us who are patriots of course think maybe we have plenty of ammunition there's a
[03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:49.840]  point where it runs out and the the manufacture of ammunition requires a complex society so you
[03:48:49.840 --> 03:48:57.200]  it's not so easy to make clean burning gunpowder it's not so easy to make the brass casings it's
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:02.640]  not so easy to make the primers right now you buy those things online you buy the bullets you buy the
[03:49:02.640 --> 03:49:07.200]  the powder you buy the brass you buy the primers you know you put them together and you're reloading
[03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:12.960]  center in your garage or whatever but imagine a world where you can't buy those components
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:18.960]  how do you make those on your own you can't it requires a complex society to make those pieces
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:25.520]  and when society collapses that complexity what we call the specialization of those certain things
[03:49:25.520 --> 03:49:31.600]  like the ability to to smelt metals and create metal alloys and so on the ability to refine gun
[03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:37.280]  powder raw materials and so on those specializations collapse and you end up in a very rudimentary
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:43.280]  society which has to return to some level of agrarian society where people are growing most
[03:49:43.280 --> 03:49:48.160]  of their own food in order to survive and the weapon systems that are used in those times are
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:53.920]  guess what edge weapons that's what was depicted in the movie with Denzel Washington as weapons
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:50:01.680]  and bow and arrow and yes your crossbow because everybody's got a crossbow for some reason out
[03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:07.200]  there and guess what it actually has a purpose after the ammunition runs out but that could be
[03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:13.680]  a long period of time after collapse ammo will reign supreme for a period of time because guess
[03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:18.960]  what firearms work even when the power grid collapses and this is what I find hilarious
[03:50:18.960 --> 03:50:24.240]  about the whole argument about smart guns so you see these liberal anti-gun politicians always
[03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:30.080]  pushing smart guns in their cities they want everybody to buy a smart gun well what's a
[03:50:30.080 --> 03:50:37.040]  smart gun it's a gun that has electronics which will fail so everybody who has a smart gun I mean
[03:50:37.040 --> 03:50:46.080]  look if if I'm in a post-collapse scenario and I've got my BCM AR like my recce 14.5 inch barrel
[03:50:46.080 --> 03:50:52.800]  whatever I would love to fight with a bunch of people who have smart guns because all their
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:50:58.480]  guns will fail the batteries will run out the circuit boards will be blown out by EMP weapons
[03:50:58.480 --> 03:51:04.000]  or solar flares or that fingerprint scan won't work that day because they're sweating too much
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:08.480]  because they're they're taking rounds you know what I mean I would never buy a smart gun I would
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:15.040]  never rely on a smart gun I would never even rely entirely on electronic optics you got to have
[03:51:15.040 --> 03:51:21.600]  iron sights you got to make sure you back up sights work so firearms work even when the power grid
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:28.480]  goes down think about the world even we talk about cryptocurrency whether it's bitcoin or
[03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:35.120]  mark of the beast facebook's new libra coin I think they call it global coin all those cryptocurrency
[03:51:35.120 --> 03:51:41.840]  stop working when the power grid goes down what still works again depicted in the movie the book
[03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:49.840]  of Eli what has value clean water has value gold and silver coins have value working flip open
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:55.760]  lighters have value as weapons have value firearms have value and especially ammunition has value
[03:51:55.760 --> 03:52:03.200]  because it's very scarce at that point so don't forget how quickly society can collapse there's
[03:52:03.200 --> 03:52:09.440]  also another movie out there called captive state that I strongly recommend you watch and it basically
[03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:16.240]  presents the same premise as the colony series which talks about and a non-earth terrestrial
[03:52:16.240 --> 03:52:23.600]  extraterrestrial alien force occupying earth and controlling society and human beings being put into
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:31.520]  slave camps to work for the aliens and the reason the reason these move this movie is so important
[03:52:31.520 --> 03:52:37.760]  to watch captive state is very well done it's a very realistic kind of aura settings and the acting
[03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:43.680]  is all absolutely amazing john goodman stars in this movie along with some younger stars it's a
[03:52:43.680 --> 03:52:51.280]  fantastic film I strongly recommend you watch it but look how quickly some factions of humankind
[03:52:51.920 --> 03:52:58.240]  turn against humanity and agree to work for the aliens in this case this is a fictional account
[03:52:58.240 --> 03:53:03.200]  a fictional movie of course but it says something important about humanity and I think it's good
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:08.880]  to watch this and to understand that when it comes down to it whether we're talking about
[03:53:08.880 --> 03:53:14.400]  occupation by united nations troops or whether we're talking about you know something more
[03:53:14.960 --> 03:53:22.000]  out there like what's depicted in the film most people will turn against humanity if given
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:27.440]  some reward for doing so very few people operate with ethics very few people will stand their ground
[03:53:27.440 --> 03:53:34.640]  with morality and the rule of law very few people will do what's right when it is so much easier
[03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:39.760]  for them to do what's wrong and so when you think about the collapse of society today we're already
[03:53:39.760 --> 03:53:47.200]  seeing this emerge we're seeing antifa terrorists take to the streets and beat people and rob people
[03:53:47.200 --> 03:53:52.080]  and violently assault people with deadly weapons people who are innocent journalists in fact in
[03:53:52.080 --> 03:53:57.040]  the case of Andy no a gay conservative journalist I think he's conservative maybe maybe he's not
[03:53:57.040 --> 03:54:03.840]  maybe he's more libertarian he's a gay journalist and they attacked him showing how quickly they
[03:54:03.840 --> 03:54:10.000]  were willing to turn against humanity and turn against their own a so-called philosophy antifa
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:18.240]  also recently defaced a chick filet restaurant and they they're putting graffiti they're they're
[03:54:18.240 --> 03:54:22.240]  trying to destroy private property they're trying to destroy businesses and they do this in the name
[03:54:22.240 --> 03:54:28.320]  of love so understand that this escalation of violence will always be carried out in the name
[03:54:28.320 --> 03:54:36.000]  of love and peace and tolerance by the very same lunatics on the left who are filled with hatred
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:42.800]  filled with violence filled with bigotry and they will target people based on the color skin or
[03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:49.200]  based on their political philosophies and the collapse of society is accelerating so rapidly
[03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:54.320]  right now it's also being accelerated with this attempt by the left to flood the United States
[03:54:54.320 --> 03:55:02.560]  with illegal migrants illegal aliens by flooding the southern border of the United States they place
[03:55:02.560 --> 03:55:09.520]  a burden on all southern states you know Texas Arizona California and so on and by doing that
[03:55:09.520 --> 03:55:16.800]  what they they do is they destabilize part of society and they require then a shifting of resources
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:21.840]  to deal with those individuals taking away resources from things like law and order when you
[03:55:21.840 --> 03:55:27.760]  have to send police to deal with these illegals like what happened in new Mexico they took state
[03:55:27.760 --> 03:55:33.360]  police from all across the state and they sent them into albuquerque to manage a migrant detention
[03:55:33.360 --> 03:55:39.760]  center and by doing that they took away these resources from across the state so then you start
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:45.840]  to have lawlessness spreading out across america you have increased costs to society based on the
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:51.120]  lawlessness you have more home robberies you have more rapes you have more crimes that have to be
[03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:59.200]  prosecuted this is what helps bring down society this invasion of america is a planned event to
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:04.640]  destroy the united states of america from within this is why president trump must invoke the
[03:56:04.640 --> 03:56:12.080]  insurrection act he must deploy the military to the border he must stop this invasion and frankly
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:17.920]  he must arrest and indict all of those on the radical left who are complicit in this invasion
[03:56:17.920 --> 03:56:24.000]  including these twisted federal judges who think they run the country it's time to just send in
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:29.120]  the military police arrest those judges and say you are not the president your little district
[03:56:29.120 --> 03:56:34.400]  decision here does not control america we have a right to defend our country a right to defend our
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:39.760]  nation one other point in all of this you may have noticed yesterday the internet was down
[03:56:39.760 --> 03:56:44.160]  virtually every website that you know from drudge a gateway pundit maybe info wars i
[03:56:44.160 --> 03:56:51.600]  know natural news was down for i think 12 minutes or so it was a cloud flare a problem that cascaded
[03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:56.400]  throughout the system and it brought almost everything down that you can imagine and it caused
[03:56:57.440 --> 03:57:01.440]  havoc and chaos throughout the day we have seen more and more of these failures across
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:07.200]  the internet recently showing the massive vulnerabilities of the telecom and internet
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:13.120]  infrastructure we are seeing the internet is not resilient it is not robust and it can be
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:19.200]  brought down by one problem with one provider in this case cloud flare that can also be exploited
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:25.760]  as a kill switch in other words someone could force cloud flare to take down all those websites by
[03:57:25.760 --> 03:57:29.680]  recreating the same problem they experienced the other day and it would take down most of the
[03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:35.760]  internet so we are not resilient we are not robust and our society is subject to a cascading
[03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:40.320]  accelerating failure that's the truth about what's happening thanks for watching today mike
[03:57:40.320 --> 03:57:46.080]  adams here for info wars dot com get prepared i just want listeners understand money is what
[03:57:46.080 --> 03:57:50.400]  allows us to beat this and stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the
[03:57:50.400 --> 03:57:56.080]  save info wars 50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:58:00.640]  like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move
[03:58:00.640 --> 03:58:04.320]  a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't
[03:58:04.320 --> 03:58:08.000]  pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:12.800]  millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for six months we've
[03:58:12.800 --> 03:58:17.440]  not just been a standstill the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored and labored and
[03:58:17.440 --> 03:58:21.280]  labored on this i like to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we are
[03:58:21.280 --> 03:58:25.680]  winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned
[03:58:25.680 --> 03:58:29.680]  up we need to be fixed up we never have time to get into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us
[03:58:29.680 --> 03:58:34.960]  and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really going to plant child porn on us then they're
[03:58:34.960 --> 03:58:39.040]  going to kill me or you or anybody else i mean the democrats now are going into a full revolutionary
[03:58:39.040 --> 03:58:45.200]  fervor funded by foreign banks in the chicom so go to info war store dot com let's talk to marcus in
[03:58:45.200 --> 03:58:49.600]  new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath
[03:58:49.600 --> 03:58:54.000]  of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i can tell you is
[03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:59.040]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get
[03:58:59.040 --> 03:59:03.600]  trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the
[03:59:03.600 --> 03:59:08.480]  eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of
[03:59:08.480 --> 03:59:12.160]  his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a
[03:59:12.160 --> 03:59:16.080]  time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know
[03:59:16.080 --> 03:59:21.280]  they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air
[03:59:21.280 --> 03:59:25.280]  until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do
[03:59:25.280 --> 03:59:31.040]  shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[03:59:31.040 --> 03:59:35.920]  like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even
[03:59:35.920 --> 03:59:40.880]  if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
