[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  God and sinners reconciled Joyful all ye nations writhed
[00:29.000 --> 00:39.000]  Rise, Join the triumph of the skies With the angelic hopes proclaimed,
[00:39.000 --> 00:52.000]  Price is born in Bethlehem The new Morn King
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  I'll sure take Jesus over Dr. Fauci
[00:55.000 --> 01:18.840]  The best we'll ever be
[01:18.840 --> 01:20.840]  and all the evidence we've got.
[01:20.840 --> 01:23.840]  But first, I thought we'd start this transmission
[01:23.840 --> 01:24.840]  with a bit of fiction.
[01:24.840 --> 01:27.840]  We've got Fauci hyping up his PCR tests.
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.840]  They're 96% fake and fictitious.
[01:29.840 --> 01:32.840]  You've got them hyping up death numbers
[01:32.840 --> 01:35.840]  for tens of thousands that died of heart attacks and cancer,
[01:35.840 --> 01:36.840]  saying COVID-19 did it.
[01:36.840 --> 01:38.840]  That's all admitted.
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.840]  And now he's been on TV saying that,
[01:41.840 --> 01:42.840]  we'll play the clip in a moment,
[01:42.840 --> 01:47.840]  that he gave Santa Claus the vaccine
[01:47.840 --> 01:54.840]  and so it is safe for him to come down your chimney.
[01:54.840 --> 01:57.840]  Well, this vaccine protecting you from COVID-19
[01:57.840 --> 02:00.840]  is as believable as a 400-pound giant elf
[02:00.840 --> 02:04.840]  in a red and white outfit coming down your chimney.
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.840]  But don't worry, Governor Whitmer's been super creepy,
[02:07.840 --> 02:09.840]  Miss Police State, up into Michigan,
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.840]  saying that, oh, Santa is basically dying of COVID
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.840]  and the rest of it and just total fear monitoring.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.840]  So their theater, their fiction,
[02:18.840 --> 02:20.840]  is mixing with the rest of the fiction
[02:20.840 --> 02:23.840]  as they try to expropriate every form of western culture.
[02:23.840 --> 02:27.840]  Here is Fauci.
[02:27.840 --> 02:30.840]  Well, I have to say I took care of that for you
[02:30.840 --> 02:33.840]  because I was worried that you'd all be upset.
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.840]  So what I did a little while ago,
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.840]  I took a trip up there to the North Pole.
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.840]  I went there and I vaccinated Santa Claus myself.
[02:41.840 --> 02:45.840]  I measured his level of immunity and he is good to go.
[02:45.840 --> 02:47.840]  He can come down the chimney.
[02:47.840 --> 02:49.840]  He can leave the presence.
[02:49.840 --> 02:52.840]  He can leave and you have nothing to worry about.
[02:52.840 --> 02:56.840]  Santa Claus is good to go.
[02:56.840 --> 02:57.840]  But they're now telling you,
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.840]  even if you take the COVID vaccine, it may not protect you.
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.840]  You may still be able to spread it.
[03:01.840 --> 03:05.840]  Sorry, you're still got to wear a mask forever.
[03:05.840 --> 03:08.840]  CNN is reporting that they want to make it like seatbelts.
[03:08.840 --> 03:10.840]  You will never leave your house again without it
[03:10.840 --> 03:13.840]  and you will get time in jail if you don't wear it.
[03:13.840 --> 03:17.840]  This is the total complete absolute cult of control.
[03:17.840 --> 03:20.840]  Oh, and by the way, the CDC is now reporting
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.840]  thousands of people have been hospitalized,
[03:24.840 --> 03:28.840]  some of which are in comas
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.840]  after taking the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine.
[03:32.840 --> 03:35.840]  And they've only vaccinated.
[03:35.840 --> 03:39.840]  They're now saying one-tenth of 1% of the country.
[03:39.840 --> 03:41.840]  So they haven't even gotten near 1% of the country
[03:41.840 --> 03:43.840]  being vaccinated.
[03:43.840 --> 03:45.840]  They've got 1,000-plus people with adverse reactions.
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.840]  I've got it right here for you.
[03:46.840 --> 03:48.840]  That's all coming up.
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.840]  I thought adverse reactions don't exist.
[03:52.840 --> 03:57.840]  This is a giant criminal takeover.
[03:57.840 --> 04:00.840]  This is a giant power grab,
[04:00.840 --> 04:03.840]  the likes of which the planet has never seen.
[04:03.840 --> 04:06.840]  And Senator Paul, who's a medical doctor, has pointed out
[04:06.840 --> 04:10.840]  that it's all about a cultic submission
[04:10.840 --> 04:12.840]  to the establishment.
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.840]  This has nothing to do with the reality,
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.840]  nothing to do with science,
[04:20.840 --> 04:22.840]  nothing to do with facts.
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.840]  Every single bit of it has to do with power
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.840]  and control and a global medical ID.
[04:31.840 --> 04:38.840]  And that's what's really out of control is the EEOC
[04:38.840 --> 04:40.840]  has now come out and said,
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.840]  employers can make you take a vaccine.
[04:42.840 --> 04:44.840]  Can they make you get an abortion?
[04:44.840 --> 04:46.840]  Are those employers going to sign a waiver
[04:46.840 --> 04:48.840]  that if you get sick or die from the vaccine,
[04:48.840 --> 04:50.840]  they're going to take care of your family?
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.840]  Of course, the answer is no.
[04:51.840 --> 04:53.840]  The EEOC is another communist,
[04:53.840 --> 04:55.840]  globalist criminal organization
[04:55.840 --> 04:57.840]  disgusting Nazi science.
[04:57.840 --> 05:00.840]  They're Nazis.
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.840]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[05:02.840 --> 05:05.840]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[05:05.840 --> 05:07.840]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[05:07.840 --> 05:09.840]  I'm going to get ahold of you since Monday
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.840]  when I heard you got that fresh shipment
[05:11.840 --> 05:14.840]  of living defense in from Utah.
[05:14.840 --> 05:16.840]  I said, man, I got to get on that show
[05:16.840 --> 05:18.840]  and give him an update.
[05:18.840 --> 05:21.840]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones' show,
[05:21.840 --> 05:24.840]  I'm going to tell the world about living defense
[05:24.840 --> 05:26.840]  and what it did for me personally.
[05:26.840 --> 05:29.840]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20,
[05:29.840 --> 05:32.840]  thanks to this info for store products.
[05:32.840 --> 05:35.840]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night,
[05:35.840 --> 05:37.840]  so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[05:37.840 --> 05:39.840]  So what my contention is,
[05:39.840 --> 05:42.840]  why don't we start this new year off right
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.840]  with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense?
[05:45.840 --> 05:48.840]  Now, you got to follow that up with the Microsoft Act.
[05:48.840 --> 05:49.840]  I learned that.
[05:49.840 --> 05:51.840]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[05:51.840 --> 05:53.840]  We didn't know. We didn't screen your call.
[05:53.840 --> 05:54.840]  We had no idea.
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.840]  And I go to you a year later
[05:56.840 --> 05:58.840]  and you're here telling people about living defense,
[05:58.840 --> 06:08.840]  living defense, living defense.
[06:08.840 --> 06:12.840]  On the first part of the journey,
[06:12.840 --> 06:16.840]  I was looking at all the life.
[06:16.840 --> 06:20.840]  There were plants and birds and rocks and things.
[06:20.840 --> 06:24.840]  There were sand and hills and rain.
[06:24.840 --> 06:28.840]  The first thing I met was a fly with the buzz
[06:28.840 --> 06:32.840]  and the sky with no clouds.
[06:32.840 --> 06:36.840]  The heat was hot and the ground was dry,
[06:36.840 --> 06:40.840]  but the air was full of sound.
[06:40.840 --> 06:44.840]  I've been through the desert on a horse with no name.
[06:44.840 --> 06:48.840]  It felt good to be out of the rain.
[06:48.840 --> 06:52.840]  In the desert, you can't remember your name
[06:52.840 --> 06:55.840]  because there ain't no one to give you no thanks.
[06:55.840 --> 06:57.840]  We are back live.
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.840]  We are taking off another worldwide transmission.
[07:02.840 --> 07:05.840]  It is December 20th on this Sunday broadcast.
[07:05.840 --> 07:08.840]  4 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.840]  4 p.m., 6 minutes, 50-something seconds.
[07:12.840 --> 07:15.840]  All right, we have advisor to President Trump
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.840]  and one of the lawyers behind the scenes
[07:18.840 --> 07:20.840]  that's actually been tracking what's happening,
[07:20.840 --> 07:22.840]  I don't believe it at that.
[07:22.840 --> 07:24.840]  Barnes doesn't want that known,
[07:24.840 --> 07:26.840]  but that's actually known by the enemy.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.840]  Robert Barnes has been all over the country
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.840]  working for Trump, exposing what's going on.
[07:30.840 --> 07:32.840]  He'll be with us in the second hour.
[07:32.840 --> 07:35.840]  He told me a month ago everything else was a red herring,
[07:35.840 --> 07:37.840]  the computers, all of it.
[07:37.840 --> 07:40.840]  The key is the signatures being ignored
[07:40.840 --> 07:43.840]  in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and other states.
[07:43.840 --> 07:46.840]  President Trump has given a speech,
[07:46.840 --> 07:49.840]  an interview on a show with Rudolf Giuliani
[07:49.840 --> 07:51.840]  that's all about the signatures,
[07:51.840 --> 07:53.840]  and that is the irrefutable fraud
[07:53.840 --> 07:56.840]  that even the Supreme Court cannot ignore.
[07:56.840 --> 07:59.840]  They just ignored the signatures in Georgia,
[07:59.840 --> 08:01.840]  where Trump's only losing by 13,000 points,
[08:01.840 --> 08:03.840]  13,000 votes.
[08:03.840 --> 08:07.840]  Remember, Trump was winning by hundreds of thousands of votes
[08:07.840 --> 08:10.840]  until they closed up the CNN center
[08:10.840 --> 08:12.840]  where they were counting votes, not joking,
[08:12.840 --> 08:15.840]  said a waterman had broken, wasn't true,
[08:15.840 --> 08:17.840]  then pulled out all those suitcases
[08:17.840 --> 08:20.840]  each ballot on video repeatedly through a machine illegally.
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.840]  I mean, you talk about open and shut,
[08:22.840 --> 08:24.840]  but let me give you the big news.
[08:24.840 --> 08:26.840]  Again, I'm Alan Schoens, your host.
[08:26.840 --> 08:30.840]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday transmission.
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.840]  I told you on Friday Trump was considering martial law.
[08:34.840 --> 08:37.840]  I told you three weeks ago Trump was considering martial law.
[08:37.840 --> 08:39.840]  I told you November 4th,
[08:39.840 --> 08:45.840]  Trump was considering martial law over a month ago.
[08:45.840 --> 08:53.840]  Now, how did I know a month and 15 days ago something like that?
[08:53.840 --> 08:56.840]  Because I understand history and I know what's going on.
[08:56.840 --> 09:00.840]  So when I use terms like Trump considering martial law,
[09:00.840 --> 09:03.840]  I'm not just pulling that out of the ether
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.840]  to have a shocking name or a shocking term to get your attention.
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.840]  It's because that's what's being discussed.
[09:11.840 --> 09:14.840]  That's what's going on.
[09:14.840 --> 09:17.840]  Now, just because it was talked about in the Oval Office,
[09:17.840 --> 09:20.840]  doesn't mean Trump's going to do it.
[09:20.840 --> 09:22.840]  It doesn't mean I support it.
[09:22.840 --> 09:25.840]  We're simply telling you what's going on.
[09:25.840 --> 09:28.840]  Here are the headlines today dealing with it.
[09:28.840 --> 09:32.840]  Heated Oval Office meeting included talk of special counsel,
[09:32.840 --> 09:40.840]  martial law, as Trump advisors clash, CNN.
[09:40.840 --> 09:42.840]  Now, do I just believe CNN?
[09:42.840 --> 09:45.840]  No, they usually lie, but I made some calls and checked
[09:45.840 --> 09:47.840]  and indeed that did go on.
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.840]  But then John Bolton spun it that Trump supported it
[09:51.840 --> 09:54.840]  and then it was his idea Trump said that was fake news.
[09:54.840 --> 09:57.840]  Let's continue with these headlines.
[09:57.840 --> 10:01.840]  President Trump tweets out martial law equals fake news
[10:01.840 --> 10:03.840]  knowing there are several options on the table.
[10:03.840 --> 10:07.840]  Gateway pundit breaking Trump calls on Americans to march on D.C.
[10:07.840 --> 10:09.840]  January 6th to stop foreign takeover.
[10:09.840 --> 10:11.840]  That's the biggest news of the day.
[10:11.840 --> 10:13.840]  He's calling on you now.
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.840]  He needs your help.
[10:14.840 --> 10:15.840]  We need your help.
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.840]  America needs to stand up.
[10:17.840 --> 10:20.840]  We need 10 million people there on January 6th.
[10:20.840 --> 10:23.840]  The mayor has announced, oh, no indoor dining.
[10:23.840 --> 10:24.840]  No, blah, blah, blah.
[10:24.840 --> 10:25.840]  That'll keep you from coming.
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.840]  Everybody just ignore her.
[10:27.840 --> 10:29.840]  Ignore these tyrants.
[10:29.840 --> 10:31.840]  If you were a Black Lives Matter communist, she'd love you.
[10:31.840 --> 10:34.840]  We're going to descend on the swamp January 6th.
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.840]  The president's going to be attending their rallies.
[10:36.840 --> 10:38.840]  He's announced he's going to be there.
[10:38.840 --> 10:40.840]  This is going to be mega massive.
[10:40.840 --> 10:47.840]  Dumbest ex adviser Boelton of her CNN interview about appalling
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.840]  I did to return election and rerun the election under martial law.
[10:53.840 --> 10:55.840]  I've said this over and over again.
[10:55.840 --> 10:57.840]  You don't call it martial law.
[10:57.840 --> 10:59.840]  You call it a national emergency.
[10:59.840 --> 11:03.840]  Then it gets into the Constitution and different ways to do it.
[11:03.840 --> 11:06.840]  Because we're already under check on control.
[11:06.840 --> 11:09.840]  We're already going under global receivership.
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.200]  bankrupted by design. The blue cities and blue states are already under their own COVID
[11:14.200 --> 11:20.000]  cover martial law with the mask and the lockdowns and all of it that Democrats and communists
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.480]  and socialists are bringing back in every country they controlled except for China.
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.640]  Because the globalists have all moved their factories to China from Germany, from the
[11:28.640 --> 11:34.960]  UK, from France, from Canada, from Australia, from New Zealand, from the US. Hell, factories
[11:34.960 --> 11:40.240]  have left Mexico and gone to China. And so the globalists have made their investment
[11:40.240 --> 11:45.040]  there. We're all turned off. China's been open for six months, plus completely, and
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.480]  they are getting all the business and all the jobs. Even Bloomberg reported on Friday,
[11:49.480 --> 11:57.240]  the biggest jump in China investment ever. Because we're under lockdown and China has
[11:57.240 --> 12:05.240]  had their top world leaders, their top political analysts on national TV. We've played the
[12:05.240 --> 12:10.720]  clubs that Carlson has saying America will never reopen. We control their top government
[12:10.720 --> 12:17.320]  people. COVID will kill them. It will kill their economy. They are over. America will
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.720]  no longer exist, meaning the virus won't kill you, but the lockdown will. We've already
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.640]  played those clubs five or six times. But think about that. And the average leftist wears
[12:27.640 --> 12:33.120]  a mask, doesn't go out. Once they're stimulus checked, they've got a third round of stimulus
[12:33.120 --> 12:41.240]  checks. $900 billion are trying to send out. While your real industry, your real jobs is
[12:41.240 --> 12:49.600]  being destroyed. And Trump is striking back. Scoop, Axios, Pentagon, Holtz, Biden transition
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.560]  briefings, as he's under criminal investigation as being a communist Chinese spy along with
[12:54.560 --> 13:01.120]  his son. We told you this on Friday before it was even in the news about martial law.
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.520]  A storm is coming. Trump considers direct action against foreign interference in election.
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.400]  But the question is, is it martial law? Is it a national emergency? How is it implemented?
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.880]  President Trump signs bill to bar Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchange. I mean,
[13:16.880 --> 13:25.400]  it is on, on, on. So this is a larger debate and a larger discussion. I'm going to talk
[13:25.400 --> 13:32.720]  about it with it, with constitutional lawyer Robert Mars next hour. But the larger question
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.760]  is, when you're already under multinational corporate banking martial law, when you're
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.720]  already being bankrupted, when you're already being told you got to have a world ID to travel
[13:41.720 --> 13:45.480]  outside your country because Gigi Ping says so and the U.N. is in charge of Bill Gates
[13:45.480 --> 13:50.920]  as your doctor and you're told you're not essential. And the federal government's basically
[13:50.920 --> 13:56.040]  halfway sold out, surrounded by traders. The states don't know what's going on. Then
[13:56.040 --> 14:02.000]  if the president was to arrest a bunch of Chinese agents like Swallowswell and the rest of them,
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  would that be martial law because the Justice Department won't do its job? No, that would
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.360]  be the country surviving and standing up to have outside foreign threat, an existential
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.720]  threat, because we're already losing the country. The country's already going away. We're already
[14:16.720 --> 14:23.000]  under a form of martial law. And so I don't understand the debate and the discussion
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.800]  about what we're going to do. We'll either submit, they'll put Biden in, he'll keep the
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.960]  economy shut, we'll go totally bankrupt, we'll be completely domesticated, we'll continue
[14:31.960 --> 14:38.160]  racial and cultural division. And basically this country will be broken up under world
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.400]  government or we as a culture stop working with big corporations, we as a culture call
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.480]  out the chai comms, we as a people say no to the system and come together and resist
[14:48.480 --> 14:54.560]  it peacefully through civil disobedience and then hopefully other politicians and followers
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.280]  ride that wave to victory, but I don't expect to see leadership out of them. We've seen
[14:59.280 --> 15:04.920]  some leadership from Trump, but that's about it. Real leadership comes from the grassroots
[15:04.920 --> 15:08.440]  and that's what we're doing here. You heard about world government, the chai comms, the
[15:08.440 --> 15:16.040]  new world order, global lockdowns, lockstep, disease X controlled viral releases here.
[15:16.040 --> 15:20.000]  You didn't hear about it on other shows because they're not actually reading the Rockefeller
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.440]  Foundation White Papers. They're not actually researching how the real world works. They
[15:24.440 --> 15:29.880]  tune in, you know, to Hollywood shows and to HBO and think that all of that is what
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.480]  goes on in the world. What's the latest sporting event? Instead of actually knowing what the
[15:35.480 --> 15:39.760]  global controllers are up to. It's the difference between having the lights on in your house
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.200]  and not having the lights on. There was between, you know, having eyesight and not having eyesight.
[15:44.200 --> 15:49.640]  But once you're aware of it, there's no going back. But make no mistake. One of my producers
[15:49.640 --> 15:54.400]  said tonight before we went live, we are in uncharted territory now. We're going to come
[15:54.400 --> 16:01.960]  back with force inoculations announced by the federal government. The year 2021 is
[16:01.960 --> 16:08.000]  almost here. And so we're launching our New Year's specials right now. We've got two different
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.480]  big sales. We've got Super Bowl Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's
[16:12.480 --> 16:18.440]  Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off. We've got Bodies, Vaso Beats and Knockout, part of the
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.640]  New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack at 40% off. But if you get both of these packs
[16:23.640 --> 16:30.040]  together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double Patriot points, the best deal ever.
[16:30.040 --> 16:34.320]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to infowarstore.com today
[16:34.320 --> 16:38.880]  and take advantage of this. And you can't lose because it funds the info war again,
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.640]  get the great products infowarstore.com and fund the second American Revolution worldwide
[16:43.640 --> 16:49.920]  at a time that it's more critical than ever. Again, the year 2021 is here and I am committed
[16:49.920 --> 16:53.920]  to you to fight against the globalist harder than ever. So thank you so much for keeping
[16:53.920 --> 17:20.920]  info wars in the fight. Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[17:20.920 --> 17:25.200]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation,
[17:25.200 --> 17:29.160]  all the rest of them, at the end of 2021, at the end of 2030, it's here. And only gets
[17:29.160 --> 17:34.400]  worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[17:34.400 --> 17:40.480]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil and stopping
[17:40.480 --> 17:46.200]  abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not
[17:46.200 --> 17:52.560]  expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are
[17:52.560 --> 18:00.640]  all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[18:00.640 --> 18:06.280]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations, the big corporations,
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.240]  the globalist, big tech and big farmer are all pushing the covers most deadly thing in
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.960]  history, even though statistically, it's a very weak flu or cold. But if you are deficient,
[18:15.960 --> 18:19.040]  then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing
[18:19.040 --> 18:24.720]  homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical
[18:24.720 --> 18:30.120]  officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically
[18:30.120 --> 18:35.200]  bioweapons and are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically.
[18:35.200 --> 18:39.120]  When they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate
[18:39.120 --> 18:42.560]  them all the time, or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record
[18:42.560 --> 18:47.080]  it does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases. But they
[18:47.080 --> 18:50.480]  tell you, save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.920]  the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't
[18:54.920 --> 18:58.880]  dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous, because the media says it's safe.
[18:58.880 --> 19:00.280]  They do it.

[20:03.040 --> 20:10.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.040 --> 20:40.040]  You're a monster, Mr. Grinch. Your heart's an empty hole. Your brain is full of spiders.
[20:40.040 --> 20:47.040]  You're a monster, Mr. Grinch. Your heart's an empty hole. Your brain is full of spiders.
[20:57.840 --> 21:04.840]  You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch. I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half
[21:04.840 --> 21:11.640]  foot pole. You're a vile one.
[21:11.640 --> 21:16.840]  Trump has been against the lockdowns. Trump got roped into supporting the vaccine. He
[21:16.840 --> 21:20.200]  believes it would end the fear and riddle with the economy, which he knows is already
[21:20.200 --> 21:23.840]  starving millions of people to death in the third world. When we shut down, the third
[21:23.840 --> 21:30.600]  world dies. Legal bankrupt, they starved to death. So I know why Trump did what he did,
[21:30.600 --> 21:35.040]  but I still think he got snookered big time on this, and now more and more he's saying
[21:35.040 --> 21:42.040]  that, but with 31 days out from the inauguration of himself for that communist Chinese frontman,
[21:42.040 --> 21:48.200]  Joe Biden. We need Trump to level with the American people about the Chinese virus,
[21:48.200 --> 21:52.920]  about the fear, about Bill Gates, about the New World Order. Now, you remember a month
[21:52.920 --> 21:59.920]  ago, a week ago, three days ago, I said, Trump is considering martial law. And I said, that
[22:01.080 --> 22:05.160]  doesn't mean martial law is a good thing. It's a lot of different things. But I said,
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.400]  if you're already occupied, if you're already overrun, that's when martial law is used,
[22:09.400 --> 22:15.040]  if it is what you'd call the good martial law. And it tends to never go away once you're
[22:15.040 --> 22:22.040]  under it. The problem is we're already under the medical tyranny of the globalist. And
[22:22.040 --> 22:26.440]  so after Trump met with General Flynn and others yesterday, and the story got leaked
[22:26.440 --> 22:33.440]  out about martial law as a trial balloon, he posed with photos of Andrew Jackson, President
[22:35.120 --> 22:41.200]  Jackson, President Lincoln, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Now, what does that tell
[22:41.200 --> 22:48.200]  you? It's pretty clear. But Trump has been telegraphing this for a long time. He counted
[22:48.200 --> 22:55.200]  on the Supreme Court. He counted on the systems. Now he has all the evidence. And a Communist
[22:55.840 --> 23:01.840]  Chinese agent is about to be put in as the president who's totally compromised, and President
[23:01.840 --> 23:06.840]  Trump cannot allow that to happen. That's why they kept telling you that President Trump
[23:06.840 --> 23:11.840]  was a Russian agent because he wasn't a Russian agent. He doesn't even hire lobbyists. No
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.840]  one tells him what to do. With all these other modern presidents, he doesn't even hire lobbyists.
[23:16.840 --> 23:20.560]  With all these other modern presidents, they have committees that sit together and get
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.360]  bought off and then tell the president they control what to do. And so that's why they're
[23:26.360 --> 23:32.960]  so angry. And now we're at this point where we're discussing what the president should
[23:32.960 --> 23:39.960]  do. And he's actually trial ballooning using the military to go after Communist Chinese
[23:39.960 --> 23:46.960]  agency in the United States and hold a new emergency election in these five states. They're
[23:46.960 --> 23:52.200]  the ones that stole the election. They're the ones that started this fight. They're the
[23:52.200 --> 23:59.200]  ones that did all of this. And so President Trump puts out the idea of martial law through
[23:59.480 --> 24:06.480]  his surrogates, then comes out and says, I'm not proposing it to CNN. But the truth is
[24:06.480 --> 24:12.480]  he understands the public doesn't understand where we're at and how we're being captured
[24:12.480 --> 24:19.480]  by a foreign power. If a foreign power is taking you over, if we were invaded by a foreign
[24:19.480 --> 24:25.480]  nation, what would the federal government do? It would declare a martial law in those
[24:25.480 --> 24:32.480]  areas and we would go to war with that foreign army. And so now we sit here playing games
[24:32.480 --> 24:36.480]  with this foreign takeover and saying, oh, we're against martial law. We're against
[24:36.480 --> 24:40.480]  a police state when it's the police state of the globalist and the police state of
[24:40.480 --> 24:47.480]  the UN and the police state of the chai comms that we're going under. The question is, do
[24:47.480 --> 24:55.480]  you trust President Trump to take action against that system? I don't think it's going to end
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.480]  up happening. I don't think he has the men willing to do it. So I don't think that's a
[24:59.480 --> 25:04.480]  problem you're going to have to worry about. Maybe I'm wrong. But why don't all you goody
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.480]  two shoes, so upset that I even talk about America declaring an emergency to stop this
[25:09.480 --> 25:13.480]  foreign takeover, think about the fact that we're under a foreign takeover and you will
[25:13.480 --> 25:19.480]  be under them January 20th and they're never going to take that boot off your neck without
[25:19.480 --> 25:26.480]  a fight. Better the devil you know, the devil you don't know. And this isn't some lesser
[25:26.480 --> 25:31.480]  of two evils. Trump cares about America. He wants our own sovereignty. He's fought hard.
[25:31.480 --> 25:38.480]  When he gets the information, he makes the right decision. And they hate Trump and they
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.480]  want to remove Trump. And they're training Chinese troops in Canada, but they won't have
[25:43.480 --> 25:48.480]  to have him invade. They'll be invited in. You know, we've recognized under Trump, the
[25:48.480 --> 25:55.480]  conservative that clearly won the election in Venezuela, Trump was blown away today whenever
[25:55.480 --> 26:03.480]  Joe Biden said we don't recognize the conservative. We love the communist. So that's where this
[26:03.480 --> 26:09.480]  is going. And it's only going to get worse. And so that's the reality of where we are.
[26:09.480 --> 26:14.480]  We're under medical tyranny, martial law. They're bringing in the tracking apps. They're
[26:14.480 --> 26:21.480]  bringing in the control systems. GG Ping runs the planetary system. And we are inside of
[26:21.480 --> 26:26.480]  this right now. And so that's a discussion when I host the new show tomorrow morning,
[26:26.480 --> 26:33.480]  when I'm going to take at least 50 calls over three hours. 8am to 11am American Journal,
[26:33.480 --> 26:38.480]  just like Washington Journal and C-SPAN, but National Journal. I take your phone calls
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.480]  from all over the world, quite frankly, but it's mainly about the United States. And we'll
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.480]  be discussing all of this and what you think President Trump should do 8am tomorrow. I had
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.480]  a bow and shroyer who's going to be hosting my show, the Alex Jones show, and then I am
[26:51.480 --> 26:56.480]  going to take off a few days to get some rest and try to really focus on the decisions
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.480]  we've got to make because as one of the crew members said before we went live today, we
[27:01.480 --> 27:08.480]  are in uncharted territory. And as dialed in as I am and as focused as I am, I need a
[27:08.480 --> 27:16.480]  little bit of time to turn my engine off and really get close to God and decide what I
[27:16.480 --> 27:20.480]  think is the best thing to do. And then I'll come on here and I'll tell you. But at this
[27:20.480 --> 27:26.480]  point, I don't think anybody knows what to do. We are all in above our heads. We're over
[27:26.480 --> 27:31.480]  our eyeballs and we're in uncharted territory, uncharted territory, a foreign multinational
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.480]  global corporate government takeover of a bunch of corporate heads and people that have
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.480]  always been unaccountable. Unlike soldiers, they never face retribution, they never face
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.480]  actual threat, they just carry out their cold blooded control and their manipulation of
[27:46.480 --> 27:52.480]  society with absolute impunity. And so if I know one thing, it's this. The discussion
[27:52.480 --> 27:58.480]  about the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the Gaetzes and the Prince Charles's of
[27:58.480 --> 28:03.480]  the world that admit they're doing this lockdown to make us poor and admit they hate us and
[28:03.480 --> 28:08.480]  admit they want to depopulate us. As soon as we start realizing they're the ones behind
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.480]  everything happening and as soon as we start speaking out against them and as soon as we
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.480]  start saying we're not going to submit to them and as soon as they get the blame for
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.480]  what they've done and the millions that have already starved to death during this lockdown
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.480]  is the sooner we're going to get relief, but they don't have skin in the game and they
[28:26.480 --> 28:31.480]  don't even get political pressure for what they've done. And so they think they're invincible
[28:31.480 --> 28:38.480]  because they hide their modern warfare behind vaccines and 5G and GMO. But the world's
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.480]  waking up. Now wait till I get to this, not next segment of the segment after, but let
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.480]  me hit. Major federal agency announces forced inoculations coming and the first thing
[28:47.480 --> 28:52.480]  Trump needs to do tomorrow is sign an executive order on vaccine freedom saying no forced
[28:52.480 --> 28:57.480]  inoculations. He's said it in a lot of speeches, but I want to see it out of his mouth.
[28:57.480 --> 29:05.480]  Imagine a dystopic novel or dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[29:05.480 --> 29:10.480]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.480]  with drugs that mask greatest vaccines that actually change your very DNA. That's where
[29:16.480 --> 29:20.480]  you are in the year 2020. Global government of the United Nations. All these authoritarian
[29:20.480 --> 29:26.480]  groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power and control
[29:26.480 --> 29:31.480]  and that they're not even worried about killing 19. That's what Klaus Schwab and others have
[29:31.480 --> 29:35.480]  said. Think about how insane that is. Oh, and big tech's got to track you. They've got
[29:35.480 --> 29:39.480]  to trace you. They've got to control you. You've got to have absolutely your house white.
[29:39.480 --> 29:44.480]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because my God, this thing has 110 to
[29:44.480 --> 29:50.480]  1% chance of killing you. Give your ability to get cancer or heart attack. This is their
[29:50.480 --> 29:55.480]  takeover. Imagine on America's death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold. Yeah,
[29:55.480 --> 30:01.480]  that's fair monitoring. That's mind control. The best product. I'm not supposed to be
[30:01.480 --> 30:04.480]  biased, but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't tried Turbo Force, you need to
[30:04.480 --> 30:09.480]  try it. I've tried Turbo Force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[30:09.480 --> 30:13.480]  I put Turbo Force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.480]  as far as the products go, Turbo Force is my favorite and all the Infowars products are
[30:17.480 --> 30:21.480]  down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other
[30:21.480 --> 30:27.480]  people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give
[30:27.480 --> 30:30.480]  that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going
[30:30.480 --> 30:34.480]  to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[30:34.480 --> 30:37.480]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens
[30:37.480 --> 30:40.480]  very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.480]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only
[30:44.480 --> 30:47.480]  one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know
[30:47.480 --> 30:50.480]  what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health and that's
[30:50.480 --> 30:54.480]  why you need to go to Infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[30:54.480 --> 30:58.480]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's
[30:58.480 --> 31:03.480]  bad and the Turbo Force is good. You must guard your humanity. You must guard your
[31:03.480 --> 31:08.480]  children's humanity. You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists
[31:08.480 --> 31:13.480]  have set themselves up as the guardians of this world, but they are the ones that are
[31:13.480 --> 31:17.480]  overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet. They are the ones that are now
[31:17.480 --> 31:24.480]  engaged in genetic takeover of every human on Earth to the GMO crops. And now they've
[31:24.480 --> 31:30.480]  moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[31:30.480 --> 31:38.480]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses, which are then inserted into your
[31:38.480 --> 31:46.480]  genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines
[31:46.480 --> 31:52.480]  and then remember you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether
[31:52.480 --> 31:55.480]  it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like
[31:55.480 --> 31:59.480]  another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[31:59.480 --> 32:06.480]  The post-industrial world. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio
[32:06.480 --> 32:14.480]  de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is
[32:14.480 --> 32:19.480]  a post-industrial world. Plough Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister
[32:19.480 --> 32:25.480]  of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might
[32:25.480 --> 32:31.480]  want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[32:31.480 --> 32:36.480]  It is making the population poor by designs. We can be controlled with a medical
[32:36.480 --> 32:45.480]  technology over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuilding in their
[32:45.480 --> 32:50.480]  dystopic image. We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting for a pro-human
[32:50.480 --> 32:55.480]  future and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others and
[32:55.480 --> 33:21.480]  identify it. God bless you. Visit us and spread the word at infowars.com.
[33:21.480 --> 33:27.480]  Hey, check this out. There is a new app coming to a cell phone near you that will display
[33:27.480 --> 33:35.480]  and verify your coronavirus vaccine status. A green check mark on your profile ID means
[33:35.480 --> 33:42.480]  you're good to go. And this is being promoted as the end of the coronavirus lockdowns because
[33:42.480 --> 33:46.480]  they're saying this is going to allow everybody to get back to normal again. You can go back
[33:46.480 --> 33:52.480]  to restaurants and your bars and movie theaters. They're all going to open back up again to
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.480]  full capacity. And all they got to do is make sure that everyone inside or everyone that
[33:57.480 --> 34:05.480]  enters has proof that they got the vaccine and that it can be verified at the door with
[34:05.480 --> 34:12.480]  the app. And I think a lot of people who might be afraid to take the vaccine right now, they're
[34:12.480 --> 34:17.480]  going to go ahead and do it anyway because this way they're allowed to go places again
[34:17.480 --> 34:24.480]  and we can all get back to normal and live our lives again. Business as usual, right?
[34:24.480 --> 34:30.480]  Right. That's how they're promoting this anyway and you understand you're probably not going
[34:30.480 --> 34:34.480]  to be able to get a job without it or you're not going to be able to continue to work where
[34:34.480 --> 34:39.480]  you are right now unless you have proof that you've taken the vaccine. Now, here's what
[34:39.480 --> 34:45.480]  they want you to do. First and foremost, they want you to get out there and go get the vaccine.
[34:45.480 --> 34:52.480]  It's your duty to save mankind. Next, they want you to download one of these apps. There's
[34:52.480 --> 34:59.480]  already a lot of them to choose from. You can get the MyGP app. They got the Common Pass
[34:59.480 --> 35:09.480]  or here's one, the A-O-K Pass, Secure, Privates and Portable. And then you allow these apps to download
[35:09.480 --> 35:16.480]  your medical records and boom, just like that, you're good to go. You get a nice green check mark
[35:16.480 --> 35:24.480]  on your ID and businesses will, well, they will now allow you to enter or they will stop you
[35:24.480 --> 35:30.480]  at the door, deny you entrance if you don't have the mark.
[35:30.480 --> 35:37.480]  Labor and employment lawyer Helen Rella says your boss could force you to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.480]  There's going to be applied pressure on people who operate.
[35:41.480 --> 35:45.480]  Okay, so that's a report from last Wednesday by Darren McBrain. It's a banned out video.
[35:45.480 --> 35:49.480]  I want to show you just part of it. That's just a small part of the report. The COVID
[35:49.480 --> 35:55.480]  VAC verification app. Don't leave home without it. Well, ZZ Pink said 10 months ago, this will be
[35:55.480 --> 35:58.480]  the model of the world. You'll have apps on your phone to leave your house. It's the global
[35:58.480 --> 36:04.480]  social credit score. Again, I'm Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us on your local
[36:04.480 --> 36:12.480]  stations out there. We are broadcasting worldwide live on this Sunday transmission.
[36:12.480 --> 36:17.480]  But notice just a few weeks ago or just last week we're telling you it's going to be mandatory
[36:17.480 --> 36:22.480]  through the employers. Oh, well, that's not mandatory. But all the big banks, all the big
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.480]  corporations are already linking up saying it will be to get on a plane to have a job.
[36:27.480 --> 36:31.480]  But then they admit on the insert, oh, if you're pregnant, don't take this. Oh, if you're young,
[36:31.480 --> 36:35.480]  don't take this. Oh, you've got an autoimmune problem. Don't take this. If you've got any
[36:35.480 --> 36:42.480]  allergy to anything, peanuts, penicillin, bee stings, do not take this. And then we're
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.480]  like, oh, well, don't take it. Like, oh, your conspiracy theorists, nobody's having any problems.
[36:47.480 --> 36:55.480]  This is from the CDC website. This is PBS with a direct link, PBS television with a direct link.
[36:55.480 --> 37:02.480]  And this is the latest numbers as of two days ago. The numbers are always a few days behind.
[37:02.480 --> 37:08.480]  And this is registrants that took the vaccines and the adverse reactions, health impacts,
[37:08.480 --> 37:18.480]  putting them in the hospital, or keeping them out of work. 3,150 people are out of work from
[37:18.480 --> 37:24.480]  the 112,000 people that have so far taken the vaccine. It just started a few days ago.
[37:24.480 --> 37:30.480]  Here's some of the headlines. Nurses faints while talking to press about COVID-19 vaccine.
[37:30.480 --> 37:38.480]  They're saying, oh, it's very rare. Really, CDC issues new guidelines, launches probe after
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.480]  thousands negatively affected following COVID-19 vaccine. This is from the CDC. We just showed
[37:44.480 --> 37:49.480]  you the numbers. Here's the Epic Times report posted up on infowars.com. So they tell you,
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.480]  it's safe and effective. But remember, Bill Gates will cover this next segment, famously
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.480]  said that 700,000 people will get sick or die from his vaccine. He also admitted 80% from
[38:01.480 --> 38:07.480]  the Pfizer vaccine. That's what this is. Get sick. And when you talk about that, they
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.480]  go, oh, that couldn't be true. We have Bill Gates on video saying it. Why is Bill Gates
[38:11.480 --> 38:17.480]  in charge of what goes in your body? What planet, what freakazoid world did we wake up
[38:17.480 --> 38:23.480]  to where this is happening? Look at this. This is out of Fox News, because again, they're
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.480]  telling you, oh, there's nobody getting sick. Nobody's having a problem. One woman collapsed
[38:29.480 --> 38:37.480]  in Tennessee, a nurse. Oh, look, vaccinations at Chicago area hospital to resume after four
[38:37.480 --> 38:44.480]  workers experience adverse reactions. Four of the nurses have gotten sick. And that's
[38:44.480 --> 38:49.480]  just what happens at the time you get it. Imagine the long term effects. Oh, sorry, those haven't
[38:49.480 --> 38:55.480]  happened yet. And here's the big scary news right here. Federal agency says employers
[38:55.480 --> 39:00.480]  can require workers to get COVID-19 vaccine. You saw Darren McBrane's report from just
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.480]  last week where people are saying, you watch, they're going to make employers do it and
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.480]  make airlines and hotels do it with a digital system that tracks you. So that's a castle
[39:09.480 --> 39:15.480]  society right there. And sure enough, federal agency announced this week that employers
[39:15.480 --> 39:19.480]  can legally require their workers to take a COVID-19 vaccine and can prevent them from
[39:19.480 --> 39:26.480]  entering the workplace if they refuse. Also, the New York Bar Association said it should
[39:26.480 --> 39:31.480]  be the law everyone must take it, including pregnant women. The damn insert says pregnant
[39:31.480 --> 39:40.480]  women shouldn't take it. But now lawyers and now the EEOC, more lawyers, leftist lawyers,
[39:40.480 --> 39:47.480]  SJWs, they say you're going to take it because it's all about their power over your body.
[39:47.480 --> 39:52.480]  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued guidelines claiming that requiring
[39:52.480 --> 39:57.480]  COVID tests would not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and that though
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.480]  employers can't require certain medical exams like blood tests, COVID vaccine does not apply.
[40:01.480 --> 40:08.480]  Yeah, taking your blood is not a problem. But going in with the mRNA vaccine and with
[40:08.480 --> 40:15.480]  messenger RNA and that's programming RNA to program your cells. Oh, some corporation
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.480]  programming my cells, taking over my cells, that's not a problem. I mean, when a man,
[40:21.480 --> 40:27.480]  they teach feminists that a baby is a parasite because a sperm and egg meat creates a new
[40:27.480 --> 40:31.480]  creature and attaches to your placenta that's there to catch the baby and love it, you're
[40:31.480 --> 40:35.480]  designed to do it. They call that rape. But when Bill Gates plunges a needle into you
[40:35.480 --> 40:41.480]  with mRNA to reprogram all your cells, so you can travel or have a job, that's not rape,
[40:41.480 --> 40:47.480]  that's not coerced. Of course it is. It violates every form of law. The Geneva Convention, it
[40:47.480 --> 40:52.480]  violates the Nuremberg Code. This is an insane action. You go, why are they doing it? Because
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.480]  they can't help themselves. It's the nature of these mad scientists. The Nazis were mad
[40:57.480 --> 41:02.480]  scientists. They do it over and over again. Meanwhile, German doctor, anti-vaxxers should
[41:02.480 --> 41:09.480]  be denied intensive care if they need it. What do I need intensive care from the vaccine?
[41:09.480 --> 41:16.480]  And then Rand Paul, doctor, mask mandates are all about submission, just like under
[41:16.480 --> 41:22.480]  Islam. And now CNN says, oh, soon you will wear masks forever, like your seatbelts, it
[41:22.480 --> 41:28.480]  will just become normal. This is totally unnatural. This is a total cult takeover, and it's all
[41:28.480 --> 41:33.480]  based on giant exaggerated lies, hundreds and hundreds of percent, what's actually happening.
[41:33.480 --> 41:38.480]  Refusing to wear a mask should be as taboo as drunk driving. Scientist chief says, yes,
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.480]  you're dirty, you're bad, you've got to wear a mask, you've got to submit. Christmas
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.480]  miracle, though, Fauci confirms he vaccinated Santa Claus with COVID vaccine just as ridiculous
[41:49.480 --> 41:56.480]  as all the propaganda. Meanwhile, in London and Italy, in her full holiday lockdowns,
[41:56.480 --> 42:03.480]  England's COVID mutation, 70% more infectious live updates, I predicted fake new upgrades
[42:03.480 --> 42:08.480]  and mutations. It's all crap. The PCR tests are all crap. The inventor of the test said
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.480]  it was a fraud. I told you a month ago, I talked to one of the main biotech company
[42:13.480 --> 42:18.480]  owners. I'll leave it at that. And he said, I ran into him at a law firm. And he said,
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.480]  Alex, don't take that mRNA vaccine. It's deadly. It shuts off your immune system, or
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.480]  will turn it way up. It's all a fraud. It's all a power grab. It's all evil. And I said,
[42:29.480 --> 42:33.480]  please come on. Oh, no, I can't do that. See, no one can come on and tell you, even though
[42:33.480 --> 42:38.480]  it's all right here. This is such a crazy operation where they're going to normalize.
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.480]  You getting cancer, your neighbor dying, you get the autoimmune disease. And then they
[42:42.480 --> 42:47.480]  admit that a bunch of these mRNA vaccines have HIV in them. That's all admitted now.
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.480]  My God, this is insane. This is the globalist carrying out eugenics. And everyone's supporting
[42:53.480 --> 42:56.480]  it, is doing it through ignorance or because they're globalist scum.
[42:59.480 --> 43:01.480]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[43:01.480 --> 43:04.480]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[43:04.480 --> 43:09.480]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get ahold of you since Monday when I heard you
[43:09.480 --> 43:14.480]  got that fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.480]  that show and give him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones
[43:19.480 --> 43:25.480]  show, I'm going to tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally.
[43:25.480 --> 43:31.480]  Now look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20, thanks to the info for store products. And by the
[43:31.480 --> 43:36.480]  way, I bought $800 worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[43:36.480 --> 43:42.480]  So what my my contingent is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody
[43:42.480 --> 43:47.480]  getting a couple bottles of living defense. Now you got to follow that up with the Microsoft
[43:47.480 --> 43:52.480]  VX. I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen
[43:52.480 --> 43:57.480]  your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later and you're telling people about
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.480]  living defense, living defense, living defense.
[43:59.480 --> 44:06.480]  The year 2021 is almost here. And so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[44:06.480 --> 44:10.480]  We've got two different big sales. We've got Super Bowl Vitality, Turbo Force and Ultra
[44:10.480 --> 44:16.480]  12, part of the New Year's resolution, Energize Pack 40% off. We've got bodies,
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.480]  vaso beats and knockout part of the New Year's resolution revitalized pack at 40% off.
[44:21.480 --> 44:27.480]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double
[44:27.480 --> 44:31.480]  Patriot points. The best deal ever. I want to thank you all for your support and encourage
[44:31.480 --> 44:36.480]  you to go to infowarstore.com today and take advantage of this and you can't lose because
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.480]  it funds the info war again, get the great products infowarstore.com and fund the second
[44:41.480 --> 44:45.480]  American Revolution worldwide at a time that it's more critical than ever.
[44:45.480 --> 44:51.480]  Again, the year 2021 is here and I am committed to you to fight against the globalist harder
[44:51.480 --> 44:55.480]  than ever. So thank you so much for keeping info war in the fight. Without your support,
[44:55.480 --> 45:16.480]  we couldn't do any of it.
[45:25.480 --> 45:53.480]  Thank you.
[45:53.480 --> 46:19.480]  Thank you.
[46:19.480 --> 46:45.480]  Thank you.
[46:45.480 --> 47:03.480]  Thank you.
[47:03.480 --> 47:31.480]  Thank you.
[47:31.480 --> 47:35.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. I'm Alan Jones, your host. And
[47:35.480 --> 47:45.480]  we're here weekdays 11am to 3pm central. And we return Sundays 4 to 6pm. And now we've
[47:45.480 --> 47:54.480]  added Sunday Live with Owen Schreuer, Tom Papert, Harrison Smith and others 6 to 8pm central.
[47:54.480 --> 48:00.480]  And it's what I call our new free to air radio by that. We have six minutes of ads in our
[48:00.480 --> 48:05.480]  multiple stations, but no ads for us. A lot of stations are picking it up. We're trying
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.480]  to reach out to my other affiliates and say, hey, would you like us to cut some of the ads
[48:09.480 --> 48:16.480]  on my shows so that you can pick us up? And their answer is like, no, we'll just take all
[48:16.480 --> 48:22.480]  your ads. Well, I got a radio partnership with Ted Anderson and GCN. They're great guys
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.480]  and they got half the ads. But I'm working on that for you, folks, because we want less
[48:26.480 --> 48:38.480]  ads here. That's what we're pushing for. Okay. Let me try to put it to you this way. I'm
[48:38.480 --> 48:45.480]  not up here covering all this incredibly negative stuff just to bitch and complain and be a victim.
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.480]  I'm doing all this so you understand the real threat you're under because I believe you're
[48:49.480 --> 48:53.480]  like me. You're not going to put up with it. You're going to mobilize. You're going to speak
[48:53.480 --> 48:57.480]  out against it. You're going to pray against it. You're going to say no to it. And all of
[48:57.480 --> 49:03.480]  us together will defeat it because many hands make very, very light work. I believe in you.
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.480]  The globalists have bet against you. They bet against me, but now they're not as arrogant as
[49:07.480 --> 49:13.480]  they used to be. They're scared. And just like that, populism and pro-human nationalism
[49:13.480 --> 49:20.480]  is exploding all across the world and humanity is on the march. And the globalist empire
[49:20.480 --> 49:27.480]  is more and more on the run. So as negative as it is to see world government, the UN and
[49:27.480 --> 49:33.480]  global tracking apps and lockdowns and forced inoculations, this is their revolution. This
[49:33.480 --> 49:42.480]  is what they've been preparing for decades. And it's the fact that we've been exposing it
[49:42.480 --> 49:50.480]  for decades. And it's now happening just like we said is incredible. So we've got a leg up
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.480]  on it. We've got a head start on it. I can't tell you, it's not about bragging. It's about
[49:55.480 --> 49:59.480]  you realizing the success that we've all had together. Info wars is just one focal point
[49:59.480 --> 50:06.480]  of all this. Not just Tucker Carlson, not just Sean Hannity, not just Rush Limbaugh, not
[50:06.480 --> 50:13.480]  just Joe Rogan, who have massively influenced all those people. I'm not going to talk about
[50:13.480 --> 50:25.480]  private conversations, but I just recently got phone calls from extremely prominent liberals,
[50:25.480 --> 50:31.480]  completely freaked out saying, I thought you were crazy. It's happening exactly as you
[50:31.480 --> 50:37.480]  said. Are you aware? You said this in 2007. Here's the clip. And I'm like, I remember saying
[50:37.480 --> 50:43.480]  that. Yeah, these people are saying, how the hell do you know all this? And I explained
[50:43.480 --> 50:50.480]  to them, well, did you know it was in Carol Quickley's book 1968? Or did you know it was
[50:50.480 --> 50:59.480]  in the Brzezinski book 1974? Or did you know it was I mean, it's all that's what I see.
[50:59.480 --> 51:06.480]  See, I only tell this almost every show, different variants of the same story. There's different
[51:06.480 --> 51:12.480]  developments. Because it's everything. Do you understand that I did not figure all of
[51:12.480 --> 51:18.480]  this out? The globalists have a plan. They have a program. They tell you what they're
[51:18.480 --> 51:24.480]  going to do. And we know what they're going to do. World government forced inoculations
[51:24.480 --> 51:32.480]  with antibodies that attack proteins associated with fast growing cells. There's only a couple
[51:32.480 --> 51:42.480]  things grow fast in the body. Would you like me to list them for you? Embryonic tissue grows
[51:42.480 --> 51:57.480]  fastest. Placentus, uterine walls each month. And then what else grows fast? Intestinal
[51:57.480 --> 52:08.480]  walls. What else grows fast? Your hair, your skin. But what else grows fast? It could be
[52:08.480 --> 52:16.480]  your bones. It could be your skin. It could be your tongue. It could be your blood. It
[52:16.480 --> 52:27.480]  could be your brain. It's got a name. It's called cuckuck cuck cuck cancer. Bigger than
[52:27.480 --> 52:35.480]  Dallas. And when all Wolfgang Woodard and all the big, even top scientists who've got
[52:35.480 --> 52:40.480]  holes, the medical system's actually got all these nurses and scientists and doctors
[52:40.480 --> 52:44.480]  coming out valiantly fighting. And it's all the top ones. I mean, my God, it's the former
[52:44.480 --> 52:49.480]  head of Pfizer. It's the former. They're like, this is insane. Don't you dare take this.
[52:49.480 --> 52:54.480]  This will turn your immune system off or turn it up or kill you. My God, it'll attack every
[52:54.480 --> 53:03.480]  fast growing cell in your body. It'll eat your baby alive. And that's what I'm telling
[53:03.480 --> 53:08.480]  you. This is like, don't drink cyanide. It'll kill you. You want me to explain the science
[53:08.480 --> 53:19.480]  to you? It's not even hard. It's open and shut that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines
[53:19.480 --> 53:26.480]  and the Australian one mRNA are literally going in and reprogramming your cells to release
[53:26.480 --> 53:34.480]  an antibody against a protein that is mainly found in the placenta and a woman's uterus.
[53:34.480 --> 53:44.480]  This thing is meant to eat women's uteruses. Just like Gardasil, they caught them that
[53:44.480 --> 53:49.480]  they announces an emergency. They trick Rick Perry, not even a bad guy, not a scientist.
[53:49.480 --> 53:53.480]  They go, oh, let's protect young girls from cancer, sir. We give them this shot. They don't
[53:53.480 --> 53:58.480]  care anymore. It covered four papillomaviruses. There's thousands. Didn't save anybody. A few
[53:58.480 --> 54:04.480]  thousand people, 4,000 die a year of papillomaviruses. That's a tiny number. But in the studies, they
[54:04.480 --> 54:10.480]  couldn't get it approved by the FDA until a governor announces it's an emergency or a
[54:10.480 --> 54:15.480]  president. Reagan was a great guy. They said, sir, we got stuff that he announced an emergency.
[54:15.480 --> 54:19.480]  That's how they got liability protection for all these vaccines. Reagan wasn't bad. He
[54:19.480 --> 54:27.480]  was a scientist. So the candidate Rick Perry, Merck did, and they said, we got a shot of
[54:27.480 --> 54:33.480]  cure cancer for women. He said, well, damn right, I'll say that's ordered. What they didn't
[54:33.480 --> 54:40.480]  tell him is they couldn't get the Gardasil shot for a decade approved in India, Japan,
[54:40.480 --> 54:51.480]  Russia, Europe or the US because it was attacking women's ovaries. Because for whatever reason,
[54:51.480 --> 55:00.480]  that fast growing virus and the proteins it releases just so happens to look like an egg
[55:00.480 --> 55:07.480]  on a polyp growing off of an ovary. That's all an ovary does. It gets a little bloop. And boy,
[55:07.480 --> 55:15.480]  that's when the girls get excited, the women get excited. The woman goes into ovulation,
[55:15.480 --> 55:23.480]  kicks off that egg and mama's ready to get in the sack. But at the exact moment that happens,
[55:23.480 --> 55:29.480]  you've now got a vaccine that attacks that protein release and it swarms into that ovary
[55:29.480 --> 55:36.480]  and it eats it up. And you don't just usually get each egg eaten. It starts chewing into
[55:36.480 --> 55:45.480]  the ovary itself. And now you've got a big old problem. So Gardasil goes after your ovaries.
[55:45.480 --> 55:57.480]  These new mRNA vaccines go after your uterus bigger than Dallas. And these globalists,
[55:57.480 --> 56:02.480]  like they've got a gun to their head. My wife this morning at breakfast, she's a smart lady,
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.480]  she goes, you know, it's like it's aliens. Why would the establishment do this? It's
[56:07.480 --> 56:10.480]  going to hurt so many people. They're going to get in trouble. And I was reading you're
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.480]  right about the Gardasil attack on the ovary. And I said, honey, they are, they do have
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.480]  a gun to their head. I don't know who's running it. I've not seen little green men. I don't
[56:18.480 --> 56:26.480]  even, all I know is what they're doing is violent. It's crazy. It's insane. And it's out of
[56:26.480 --> 56:31.480]  control. But then you can argue, well, there are too many people. So do you want your daughter
[56:31.480 --> 56:36.480]  sterilized? And by the way, that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are five different
[56:36.480 --> 56:44.480]  autoimmune responses that we know of in this vaccine based off the virus. So we only
[56:44.480 --> 56:50.480]  identified a few things that does. This is just crazy. Man, I tell you. And by the way,
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.480]  this isn't Alex Jones up here telling you about science or medicine. I'm reading what's in
[56:54.480 --> 56:59.480]  the medical reports. I've shot the reports. I've covered it. And George Soros, who served
[56:59.480 --> 57:05.480]  Nazis as a young man, spends all his time trying to shut us up because in his world with
[57:05.480 --> 57:09.480]  Satan, the more people he hurts, the more people he names, the more he sterilizes, that
[57:09.480 --> 57:16.480]  gets him credits in hell, as best I can tell. Yeah, you in vaccines. And Kenya uses sterilized
[57:16.480 --> 57:21.480]  women. That was where they had a hormone to the tetanus shot. It's not that vaccines are
[57:21.480 --> 57:27.480]  bad. It's what they add to them. Just ask black folks about Tuskegee. All right, we're
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.480]  going to start the next hour. Robert Barnes about is martial law real? Is Trump planning
[57:32.480 --> 57:36.480]  martial law? What does that mean? Can Trump overturn this fraudulent election? Well, we're
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.480]  going to talk to a fellow that's been traveling the country behind the scenes has got the inside
[57:40.480 --> 57:48.480]  scoop and baseball in our number two on this Sunday night transmission. Stay with us.
[57:48.480 --> 57:58.480]  The globalists and their minions want to play God. Chuckie Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack
[57:58.480 --> 58:03.480]  Obama. You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[58:03.480 --> 58:11.480]  Why do they love death? Because they hate themselves. They project their own disgust with their soul
[58:11.480 --> 58:17.480]  onto us. And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is
[58:17.480 --> 58:21.480]  that's why they hate info wars. We believe in humanity. We think you're beautiful. We
[58:21.480 --> 58:26.480]  think you're amazing. Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.480]  that God gave you. Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here. It's now upon
[58:31.480 --> 58:35.480]  us. I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever.
[58:35.480 --> 58:39.480]  When the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth, we know you're going to override
[58:39.480 --> 58:42.480]  these globalists. We know you're going to defeat them. I just want to salute you all for your
[58:42.480 --> 58:47.480]  action, everything you've already done because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.480]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the
[58:55.480 --> 59:00.480]  establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully
[59:00.480 --> 59:06.480]  taking office for a second term, Ontario 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder
[59:06.480 --> 59:10.480]  than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut
[59:10.480 --> 59:14.480]  down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to U.S. So it's
[59:14.480 --> 59:19.480]  impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic
[59:19.480 --> 59:23.480]  war. We are being consolidated. We are being taken over. The Democrats aren't mismanaging
[59:23.480 --> 59:28.480]  their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population
[59:28.480 --> 59:33.480]  and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[59:33.480 --> 59:38.480]  and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is. Klaus Schwab
[59:38.480 --> 59:43.480]  and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your business
[59:43.480 --> 59:48.480]  is only a 25 percent for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is
[59:48.480 --> 1:00:17.480]  a master plan. Say no. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:24.480]  Look, once you understand this has all been scripted out, welcome back to the Alex Jones
[1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:28.480]  show. You understand the whole game plan. I've been saying this for 10 months. That once
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:34.480]  they roll out the COVID hysteria, once they roll out the COVID fear, they are going to
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:39.480]  then say there's new deadly versions of it when it becomes apparent that it's basically an
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:43.480]  overblown hoax. Try to scare you back into submission. And I said as soon as Trump calls
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:48.480]  for a march on DC, which he's now done January 6th, they'll announce, oh, there's a super
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:53.480]  deadly strain to stop the air traffic, stop everything. This is a foreign multinational
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:58.480]  takeover. Ali Alexander just tweeted this. Notice how the new mutation of a deadlier
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:05.480]  COVID-19 coincides with trying to install Joe Biden at a virtual inauguration since no one
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:10.480]  would show his dark winter plan to lock us all down and stop the steel protests spreading
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:18.480]  worldwide. We are at war with the great reset. Wow. So people are really starting to get it.
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:26.480]  Let's go to a clip I mentioned earlier of Bill Gates saying six, seven months ago that
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:31.480]  700,000 people will get sick from the COVID shot. Notice now they say, oh, no one gets
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:35.480]  sick. Everybody's got to take it. Even though they're halting the shot in England for many
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:40.480]  people and here in the U.S. because this is such a dangerous vaccine, then why are they
[1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:44.480]  trying to push it? What's the real agenda? Robert Barnes will give us his expert take
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:49.480]  on that and so much more coming up next segment. But here's Bill Gates. Here we clearly need
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:56.480]  a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that. And
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:02.480]  doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:14.480]  effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that's way more 700,000 people who will suffer
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:22.480]  from that. So really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, pregnant,
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:30.480]  male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities, it's very, very hard and that actual decision
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:36.480]  is, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world. Governments will have to
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:43.480]  be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:49.480]  be decided on. And that's Dr. Bill Gates, our lord, our king, our master, our commander.
[1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:54.480]  We'll talk about politics. We'll talk about martial law. We'll talk about Trump for a
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:57.480]  couple segments with Barnes and we'll get into where he really is an expert, the numbers,
[1:02:57.480 --> 1:03:02.480]  the facts, the covered lockdown, where this tyranny is going as the world really now super
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:08.480]  awakens to what's happening. I think super awakens is the term, but here is the latest
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:35.480]  bat signal that Trump just fired, fight for Trump.
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:57.480]  Let's talk about the people of America, let's talk about the man next door.
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:01.480]  I think that I've had enough of you
[1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:03.480]  I've gone down like this
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.480]  Stand down for the people of London
[1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:27.480]  Stand down for the men next to you
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:31.480]  I think that I've had enough of you
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:57.480]  I've gone down like this
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.480]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses
[1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:04.480]  They want control, they want domesticated slaves
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:07.480]  That's the process that is taking place right now
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:09.480]  And when you shop at the big box stores
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:11.480]  And when you shop with Amazon
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:14.480]  Remember that they are creating monopolies
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:17.480]  And they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:19.480]  Abortion, world government, all of it
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:21.480]  If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:23.480]  But if you'll shop at info wars
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:25.480]  Where we have thousands of products
[1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:27.480]  Right here in America, with our warehouses
[1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:29.480]  And our crew, it's incredible
[1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:31.480]  And it changes the whole world
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:33.480]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the info lord
[1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.480]  If you want to stop the globalist
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:37.480]  At infowarstore.com
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:39.480]  Until others do their shopping at infowarstore.com
[1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:41.480]  We have amazing products
[1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.480]  We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:45.480]  If you order by the 18th
[1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:47.480]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support
[1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:49.480]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do
[1:05:49.480 --> 1:05:51.480]  And where you spend your money
[1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:55.480]  At infowarstore.com
[1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:31.480]  All right, incredibly serious time to be alive
[1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.480]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:37.480]  I was in Georgia, had a chance to talk to him
[1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:39.480]  When he was there behind the scenes
[1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:41.480]  Working on trying to prove the election fraud
[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:43.480]  He said listen, the voting machine stuff
[1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:45.480]  Has some real issues, but it's overblown
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:47.480]  The other issues are red herrings
[1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:51.480]  Everything is the signatures under state law
[1:06:51.480 --> 1:06:53.480]  Being ignored
[1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:55.480]  And now Trump has come out
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:57.480]  Now relegated the president to online radio shows
[1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:59.480]  With Giuliani
[1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:01.480]  We are very close
[1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:03.480]  President Trump discusses ongoing efforts
[1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:05.480]  To turn election around
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:07.480]  With Dr. Maria Ryan and Giuliani
[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:09.480]  Here it is
[1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:11.480]  I love you
[1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:13.480]  Thank you both
[1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:15.480]  And Merry Christmas
[1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:17.480]  To you guys
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:19.480]  And we're getting closer and closer
[1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:21.480]  And I hope you let everybody know
[1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:23.480]  We're actually very close
[1:07:23.480 --> 1:07:25.480]  The fake news will not tell you that
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:27.480]  They don't want to talk about it
[1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.480]  They're trying to suppress it
[1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:31.480]  We don't have freedom of the press at all
[1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:33.480]  It's suppressed news
[1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:35.480]  It's a terrible thing that's happened
[1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:37.480]  In our country in the last
[1:07:37.480 --> 1:07:39.480]  It's been going on for a long time ago
[1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:41.480]  But it's gotten to a point
[1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:43.480]  It's just a terrible thing
[1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:45.480]  And we got to bring that back
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:47.480]  Because the press is so
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:49.480]  It's so suppressed
[1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:51.480]  It's so dishonest
[1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:53.480]  I don't even call it fake news anymore
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:55.480]  I call it corrupt news
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:57.480]  So just thank you very much
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:07:59.480]  Your great patriots both of you
[1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:01.480]  And I hear your show is a big success
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:03.480]  Well, Merry Christmas
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.480]  To everybody
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:07.480]  Merry Christmas Mr. President
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:09.480]  So there goes the president
[1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:11.480]  And he's still on Fox
[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:13.480]  Robert Barnes joins us
[1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:15.480]  During the internet kill switch
[1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:17.480]  During the shutdown of America
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:19.480]  During lockdown too
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:21.480]  What would you call this current state
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:23.480]  Of the world's constitutional lawyer
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:25.480]  And it's somebody that's working
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:27.480]  With folks behind the scenes
[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:29.480]  Trying to overturn this fraudulent takeover
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.480]  And then let's get to the latest numbers
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:33.480]  The facts, is there a path
[1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.480]  Peacefully, constitutionally
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:37.480]  The stopping, the CHICOM operative
[1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:39.480]  Joe Biden being installed
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:41.480]  To a certain degree it's a constitutional crisis
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:43.480]  Of a kind because it's critical that
[1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:45.480]  There are some people who want
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:47.480]  The Trump supporters
[1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:49.480]  To resort to a remedy
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:51.480]  That is not the constitution
[1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:53.480]  And as the president made clear
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.480]  Last night, that's not his path
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.480]  He is pursuing solely and wholly
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:08:59.480]  A constitutional path because the
[1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:01.480]  Problem with any
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:03.480]  Enforcement issue with the constitution
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:05.480]  The solution is always more
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:07.480]  Constitutional democracy, not less
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:09.480]  And that's the president's path as well
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:11.480]  And that requires he's still going
[1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:13.480]  Through the courts, there's three cases
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:15.480]  That are now just out of Pennsylvania
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:17.480]  Up before the Supreme Court this weekend
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:19.480]  There are more going, I don't think the Supreme Court
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:21.480]  Will provide any remedy for him
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:23.480]  But he's going to fully exhaust
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:25.480]  All options and opportunities in that respect
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:27.480]  There's also election contests
[1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:29.480]  From Georgia, Arizona, Nevada pending
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:31.480]  Before various courts, cases out of
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:33.480]  Michigan and Wisconsin also pending
[1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:35.480]  And going towards the U.S. Supreme Court
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:37.480]  Let me stop you, if he's not going to probably
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:39.480]  Get remedy there because Roberts reportedly
[1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:41.480]  Is scared hiding under his desk from
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:43.480]  Black Lives Matter
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:45.480]  Then instead, we always want
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:47.480]  More of a republic, more freedom
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:49.480]  But if the chai comms and the globalists take over
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:51.480]  I mean, that's certainly less
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:53.480]  Freedom, why do we allow a foreign takeover?
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:55.480]  I don't think the concern is
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:57.480]  There's always risks of foreign influence
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:09:59.480]  And we've always had foreign influence
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:01.480]  But the remedy has always got to be
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:03.480]  More constitutional democracy
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:05.480]  And that may mean other forms of action
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:07.480]  So I think the president's goal is
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.480]  Exhaust the judicial action
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.480]  Show that he pursued it to the best
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:13.480]  Degree he could, and if the courts didn't
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:15.480]  Provide any relief or remedy
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:17.480]  Then that puts the burden on Congress
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:19.480]  And that's where the Senate
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:21.480]  And the House, there's
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:23.480]  Explain that to people, that he's already
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.480]  Got a bunch of House and Senate members
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:27.480]  Ready to have the hearings, ready to block the electors
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:29.480]  That's where the real fight is
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:31.480]  Exactly, the Constitution calls for Congress
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:33.480]  To certify the electors
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:35.480]  And until Congress certifies the electors
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:37.480]  There's been no actual electoral college vote
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:39.480]  There's no vote until that
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:41.480]  Certification occurs, constitutionally
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:43.480]  So then what do you make?
[1:10:43.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  We'll walk all through this next segment
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:47.480]  As you're the expert on this, but I like Flynn
[1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:49.480]  I like Powell all of them
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:51.480]  But they're at the White House, and this info
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:53.480]  Immediately leaks
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:55.480]  What do you think Flynn's up to with all this
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.480]  Martial law talk?
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:10:59.480]  I think that Trump was never going to go down
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:01.480]  That was what his, that's what people who wanted
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:03.480]  To hurt him wanted him to do
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:05.480]  That's the people that wanted him, it's a part of a
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:07.480]  Disinformation campaign, and it comes out of the
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  QAnon world, and unfortunately
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:11.480]  The general, Sidney Powell, Lynn Wood
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:13.480]  Got caught up in that world, and that's
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:15.480]  Why, here's a core problem
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:17.480]  Aside from the fact that it's not legal
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:19.480]  Martial law is not legal in the United States
[1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:21.480]  That was determined the next part day, Milligan in 1866
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:23.480]  When Abraham Lincoln did it, it was determined
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:25.480]  To be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:27.480]  So martial law has never been constitutional
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:29.480]  In the United States, unless the entire country
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:31.480]  Was a battlefield with no civil institutions
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:33.480]  Able to even function, that's the constitutional
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:35.480]  Standard, but the, I think
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:37.480]  The president has never wanted to go down this path
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:39.480]  His critics have invited it, welcomed it
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  And wanted it because they wanted it to discredit
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:43.480]  Him, discredit his supporters
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:45.480]  And give them a pretext
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:47.480]  To put people on watch lists, and even engage
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:49.480]  In mass arrests, because it's a crime
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.480]  For the military to get involved in elections
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:53.480]  They passed, we passed that law back in
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:55.480]  After the 1876 compromise
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:57.480]  Sure, so what does the president do
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.480]  When he's met with a justice department
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:01.480]  Won't do its job, and foreign multinationals
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.480]  Working through blue cities and states
[1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:05.480]  With their own form of COVID lockdown
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:07.480]  Which is martial law, how does the president counter
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.480]  This regional martial law we're under?
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:13.480]  Two things, massive, first massive public pressure
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:15.480]  On the Senate and the House to do their job
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:17.480]  So their job is to hold hearings
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:19.480]  On whether or not these electors were properly
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:21.480]  Qualified, whether or not as Matt Gates
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:23.480]  Congressman Gates said today
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:25.480]  In my state, where the, and this was what
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:27.480]  We've been talking about for the last week
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:29.480]  That what they should do, now Congressman Gates
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:31.480]  Is saying he will lead the charge to do
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:33.480]  Which is any state that cannot show
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:35.480]  That it had an honest transparent election
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  Cannot have their electors qualified
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:39.480]  For the electoral college vote
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.480]  And if enough electors are disqualified
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:43.480]  Then the constitution requires
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.480]  The House to vote by state delegation
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:47.480]  Okay, so here's the deal
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:49.480]  I'm gonna give you the floor of the next three segments
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:51.480]  The next 45 minutes, because I know you're super smart
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:53.480]  And I respect you, I try to study this
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:55.480]  And I defer to your knowledge because
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:57.480]  You're almost always right, very rarely are you wrong
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:12:59.480]  So so now you've really got my attention
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:01.480]  Because that's why, let's make the rest
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:03.480]  Of the show then about the real constitutional
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.480]  Path to victory here and what dirty tricks
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:07.480]  They might pull when we come back because you just said it
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:09.480]  We now have Gates of Florida
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:11.480]  We have all these senators, we have other House
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:15.480]  Members doing what Nancy Pelosi tried
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:19.480]  Four years ago to have the electors not seat
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:21.480]  But there was no support so it didn't happen
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:23.480]  This looks like one of the biggest movements
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:25.480]  I've ever seen except maybe in the 1870s
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:27.480]  To actually have this happen
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:29.480]  It looks like we've got a perfect storm
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:31.480]  And so what's critical is more evidence
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:33.480]  Of this to come out, so let's just
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:35.480]  Let's get to that next segment Barnes
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:37.480]  First, let's go to what you told me in Georgia
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.480]  A month ago when you warned me
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:41.480]  You said, don't go down the Dominion Road
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:43.480]  Don't go down this road
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:45.480]  The President wants us to look at the signatures
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:47.480]  How you knew that, I know how
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:49.480]  But if you want to say it, go ahead and say it
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:51.480]  And then why that's so important
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:53.480]  And what's happening now in Georgia with the signatures
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:55.480]  Sure, so I went to Georgia at the
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:57.480]  Specific personal request of the President
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:59.480]  And his focus was on the signatures
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.480]  Because it was clear that they didn't need
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:04.480]  To use the machines to steal this election
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.480]  Because they could just do it the old fashioned way
[1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:08.480]  Which is to have a bunch of people who are not
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.480]  Qualified to vote, vote, a bunch of people
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:12.480]  Cast ballots in an illegal manner
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:14.480]  And then to have the count of that ballot done
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:16.480]  In an unlawful manner without proper monitoring
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:19.480]  Because and that's why they won't publish the ballots
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:21.480]  Because people will see the problems with the ballots
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:23.480]  Themselves and that's why they wouldn't allow
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.480]  A signature match audit to occur
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.480]  Because they know the signature matches won't match
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:29.480]  And there's more illicit ballots
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:31.480]  Than there is a margin of victory
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.480]  And under the Constitution when that happens
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:36.480]  The remedies you go to voting by state delegation
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:38.480]  And that favors the President
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:40.480]  So that's why when I was down in Georgia right away
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:42.480]  It was clear that all the state officials were happy
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.480]  To do a hand recount and they weren't worried
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:46.480]  About the machines at all, that whatever capacity
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:48.480]  The machines might have to manipulate elections
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:51.480]  That's not what happened in this context
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:53.480]  And they wanted the focus to be there
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:55.480]  Because they knew that people would go down a path
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:57.480]  That they wouldn't be able to prove
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:14:59.480]  In some cases a lot of the Q-based sources
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:01.480]  And you told me almost a month ago that Trump was on this path
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:03.480]  He's now publicly saying that
[1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:07.480]  So is the Georgia signature event
[1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:10.480]  Is this a good recount now?
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:12.480]  It's at least a step forward
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:14.480]  The major step forward is the first state to do
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:16.480]  A statewide signature match recount
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:18.480]  There's still arguments about whether they'll allow
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:20.480]  Meaningful monitoring of it to occur
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:23.480]  So there's still issues with it
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:26.480]  But it's at least a step in the right direction
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:28.480]  And when they did it in Arizona
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:30.480]  11% of the signatures did not match
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:32.480]  They only did a small spot check
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:34.480]  And they did a whole state he would clearly have won
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:36.480]  It was funny how it was all against Trump
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:38.480]  Absolutely, and that story got buried
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:40.480]  Because everybody's focused on the machines
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:42.480]  So the president's goal is
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:44.480]  I've got to say it, you called it early
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:46.480]  You said it's diverting from the signatures
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:48.480]  It's diverting, you've been damn right
[1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:50.480]  So let's come back to you to have the floor
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:52.480]  And just walk through every section of this
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:54.480]  In the next 45 minutes
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:16:21.480]  Tom Pappert takes over

[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:28.480]  Or with super mail vitality
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:30.480]  In the true alpha mail path
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:32.480]  Alpha power can help boost performance
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:35.480]  Help maintain normal testosterone levels
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:37.480]  Support healthy cholesterol and more

[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:41.480]  To the peak of your optimal health

[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:47.480]  Show the world what a true alpha mail looks like today
[1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:48.480]  With alpha power
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:56.480]  Head to infowarstore.com today
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.480]  All officially written about in hundreds of books
[1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:22.480]  By Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:23.480]  All the rest of them
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:25.480]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:27.480]  And only gets worse
[1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:29.480]  Like being fed into a wood chipper
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:30.480]  Or a meat grinder
[1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:32.480]  Until you reject it all
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:34.480]  And the rejection starts with
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:36.480]  Realizing it's spiritual battle
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:37.480]  Good versus evil
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:39.480]  And stopping abortion
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:41.480]  We must start valuing human life again
[1:17:41.480 --> 1:17:44.480]  We must start saying that we are not expendable
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:46.480]  That we are not disposable
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:48.480]  That we are essential
[1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:49.480]  Until we do that
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:51.480]  We are all slaves
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:53.480]  We must stand up and declare
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:55.480]  Our basic God-given human rights now
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:00.480]  The post-industrial world
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:02.480]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:05.480]  Signed onto at the Rio de Janeiro
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:07.480]  Agenda 21 conference
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:09.480]  Back in 1992
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:12.480]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030
[1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:14.480]  Which is a post-industrial world
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:16.480]  While Schwab with the Davos Group
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:18.480]  Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada
[1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:19.480]  They're all on record saying
[1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:22.480]  The great reset is Agenda 2030
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:24.480]  Well, you might want to find out
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:26.480]  What Agenda 2030 is
[1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:28.480]  It is the destruction of society
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:29.480]  As we know it
[1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:31.480]  It is making the population poor
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:33.480]  By designs we can be controlled
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:35.480]  With a medical technocracy
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:37.480]  Over you and your family
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.480]  They're destroying civilization
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:42.480]  Rebuild it in their dystopic image
[1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:44.480]  We are fighting this
[1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:46.480]  At infowars.com and newswars.com
[1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:48.480]  We are fighting for a pro-human future
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:50.480]  And we need you to get the facts
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:52.480]  To research and share with others
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:53.480]  And join the fight

[1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.480]  At infowars.com
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:18:58.480]  Introducing
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:18:59.480]  InfoWars Life
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:01.480]  Pure turmeric extract
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:04.480]  This is taken under the tongue
[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:06.480]  It is pure turmeric
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:08.480]  It goes together very well
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:10.480]  With our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:12.480]  That is taken as a powdered capsule
[1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:15.480]  And absorbed in the stomach and intestines
[1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:17.480]  This is absorbed under the tongue
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:18.480]  Into the bloodstream
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:19.480]  And then the remaining
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:21.480]  Also is then absorbed by the stomach
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:23.480]  So it's more of an intense delivery system
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.480]  The two formulas are different
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:27.480]  But both are concentrated
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:29.480]  And our first product got rave reviews
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:31.480]  We've now been testing this out for several months
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:33.480]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:34.480]  Some like bodies better
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:36.480]  For me, they're both amazing
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.480]  For their anti-inflammatory action
[1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:40.480]  It's so much more and they fund the InfoWars
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:43.480]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract
[1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:45.480]  Exclusively at infowars.com today
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:47.480]  An additional 25% off
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:49.480]  This is a 360 win
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:51.480]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:53.480]  For all of our bodies
[1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:55.480]  For inflammation and so much more

[1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:27.480]  If you are receiving this transmission
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:30.480]  You are the resistance
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:33.480]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios
[1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:36.480]  It's Alex Jones
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:39.480]  You know, I've discovered the secret to leadership
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:42.480]  It's actually researching history
[1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:45.480]  Standing for something and then picking a side
[1:20:45.480 --> 1:20:48.480]  And so many people I know
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:49.480]  Whether they be generals
[1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:50.480]  Whether they be politicians
[1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:53.480]  They really just are putting their finger to the wind
[1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:56.480]  And like seeing which side they're on today
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:57.480]  Not me, I'm for America
[1:20:57.480 --> 1:20:58.480]  I'm for God
[1:20:58.480 --> 1:20:59.480]  I'm for children
[1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:00.480]  I'm for families
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:02.480]  Because I love it and I believe in it
[1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:04.480]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is our guest here
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:06.480]  He's kicking major butt
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:08.480]  And man, did he call this thing
[1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:09.480]  And I'm glad he said it
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:10.480]  Because I talked to the White House
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:12.480]  And I talked to the State Department
[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:15.480]  And I talked to other president obviously
[1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:16.480]  And they said, oh, Barnes is great
[1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:18.480]  Because Barnes told me, yeah, I'm working for the president
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:19.480]  I don't say anything
[1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:20.480]  I'm going around the country
[1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:22.480]  And the president's really wants the signatures
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:23.480]  He thinks this is a red herring
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:25.480]  And all that's been born out now
[1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:27.480]  So Barnes doesn't toot his horn
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:29.480]  But since the enemy already knows about it
[1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:31.480]  Why not just go ahead and get it out there
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:33.480]  So Barnes, let's hit this small piece
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:34.480]  And I'll turn things over to you
[1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:35.480]  To cover the waterfront here
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:37.480]  And the time we have left
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:38.480]  Ahead of the next live show
[1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:39.480]  Coming up with Tom Papert
[1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:42.480]  Sitting in for a short tonight on Sunday Live
[1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:44.480]  And you're welcome to come back this week
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:45.480]  And call us for a couple hours
[1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:46.480]  Whenever you want during the weekday show
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:47.480]  I'm taking off this week
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:48.480]  Just to get some rest
[1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:49.480]  I have to do it to unplug
[1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:50.480]  But we'd love to have you
[1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:51.480]  Call us, you pick a day this week
[1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:53.480]  Two hours come and do it tomorrow
[1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:54.480]  Tuesday, Wednesday
[1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:57.480]  But what about Trump saying march on D.C.
[1:21:57.480 --> 1:21:59.480]  And how important it is
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:01.480]  Peacefully on the 6th
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:02.480]  That's a big deal to have him
[1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:04.480]  Call on us to march on the day
[1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:05.480]  That Congress is going to try to
[1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:07.480]  Seek those electors
[1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:09.480]  Exactly, the president's goal and objective
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:11.480]  Is to show the senate and congress
[1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:14.480]  How much power he still wields
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:16.480]  And to make it clear to them
[1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:17.480]  In a demonstrable form
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:19.480]  That this isn't just grass
[1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:21.480]  You know, astroturf
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:23.480]  This isn't just some bot operation
[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:24.480]  On social media
[1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:26.480]  His goal is not anything with
[1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:27.480]  That's why people stay away from
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:28.480]  The militia law stuff
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:29.480]  And all that
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:30.480]  That's a red herring and a rabbit hole
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:32.480]  Meant to distract and detour people
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:34.480]  What the president wants
[1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:37.480]  Is constitutional remedy and popular will
[1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:39.480]  And to show and remind the congress
[1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:41.480]  That he is the legitimately elected president
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:43.480]  That his voters support that
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:44.480]  And that his voters are willing
[1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:46.480]  To pour into D.C. to make sure
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:48.480]  The constitutional process takes up
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:49.480]  Because it's the duty of
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:51.480]  It's the constitutional oath
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:53.480]  And obligation of congress to only
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:55.480]  Seat electors that are
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:57.480]  Constitutionally elected in a manner
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:22:58.480]  And you're going to get into that in a moment
[1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:00.480]  But the president's calling on us
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:02.480]  To march on D.C.
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:03.480]  This is the big one
[1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:05.480]  I hope you'll be there, Bob
[1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:07.480]  Everybody needs to be there
[1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:09.480]  Absolutely, it's January 6th
[1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:11.480]  Everybody be there to remind congress
[1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:13.480]  What their duties are to show up
[1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:16.480]  To support the president in a lawful
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.480]  Democratic protest and to remind people
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:20.480]  That the popular will will be heard
[1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:22.480]  One way, shape, or form
[1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:23.480]  So this is the big one
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:24.480]  And I think we should be there the 5th too
[1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:25.480]  Don't you agree?
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:27.480]  I think the 6th is almost too late
[1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:29.480]  I'm going to be there on the 5th
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:31.480]  Yeah, I agree with that
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:32.480]  I think the 5th and the 6th are good
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:34.480]  To make sure everybody sees
[1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:36.480]  That the president's army of
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:38.480]  Voters and volunteers are going to
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:40.480]  Continue to support him through the
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:41.480]  Democratic process
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:43.480]  And that no matter what happens
[1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:45.480]  In congress, they're going to be active
[1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:46.480]  After that
[1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:47.480]  These senators are going to face
[1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:49.480]  Potential primary contest in just two years
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.480]  If they don't stand up for the president
[1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:53.480]  Absolutely, so you've got the floor now
[1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:55.480]  Get into the path of victory with the
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.480]  Electors and all the other information
[1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:00.480]  Absolutely, so when we set up our
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:02.480]  Government, we recognized that we could
[1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:04.480]  Have a contested presidential election
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:06.480]  So the remedy was a two-step process
[1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:08.480]  The first is that the House and the
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:10.480]  Senate meet and decide whether the
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:11.480]  Electors were properly
[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:13.480]  Constitutionally elected
[1:24:13.480 --> 1:24:15.480]  And so the, and if they determined
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:17.480]  That there's not a majority of electors
[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:19.480]  That were constitutionally elected
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:21.480]  Then the 12th amendment comes into play
[1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:23.480]  Which was passed after the 1800
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:25.480]  Sort of debacle that took place
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:27.480]  Which was that the House
[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:29.480]  Votes by state delegation
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:31.480]  The president has a large edge in that
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:33.480]  The number of people who support him
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:35.480]  Wait in the states and the House delegation
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:37.480]  Exceeds the Democrats
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.480]  And exceeds Biden by a substantial margin
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:41.480]  So all the president needs is the House
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:43.480]  And the Senate to vote on whether or not
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:45.480]  These electors were qualified
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:47.480]  And to allow evidence to be presented
[1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:49.480]  An argument to be presented for that
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:51.480]  There's a lot more evidence of an
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:53.480]  Unconstitutional election than there
[1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:55.480]  Whatever was evidence of a constitutional
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:57.480]  Impeachment and they were willing to put
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:24:59.480]  A week aside for that
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:01.480]  And so here we have at least seven
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:03.480]  Different states that are in contest
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:05.480]  And dispute, they're supposed to take
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:07.480]  Two hours a piece, the House and the
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:09.480]  Senate to debate each one
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:11.480]  Of the House, one member of the Senate
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:13.480]  In writing, submit an objection to the
[1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:15.480]  President of the Senate, who's the Vice President
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:17.480]  Of the United States
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:19.480]  Now the Vice President does also have a potential
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:21.480]  Role, but it's unlikely he will assert it
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:23.480]  Too aggressively, but he can say an objection
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:25.480]  Has been made and the House and the Senate
[1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:27.480]  Have to vote on it and they should be able
[1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:29.480]  And they have two hours to hear argument
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:31.480]  Or evidence on it and they should allow
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:33.480]  That to take place, allow the constitutional
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:35.480]  Process to go forward and
[1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:37.480]  So by doing so, that affords the opportunity
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:39.480]  If the Senate and the House
[1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:41.480]  Sustaining the objection to the
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:43.480]  Elector, then those electors get thrown out
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:45.480]  And they can do it state by state
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:47.480]  By state by state, and he doesn't need all
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:49.480]  Seven states electors thrown out
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:51.480]  So you're saying we're being distracted with
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:53.480]  Martial law talk, we have a constitutional remedy
[1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:55.480]  And Pelosi tried this play four years ago
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:57.480]  They got no purchase, this already has
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:25:59.480]  Senate and House members ready to go with it
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:01.480]  Absolutely, and that's why Mitch McConnell
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:03.480]  Was trying to sabotage and ambush this
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:05.480]  Because he knows this is the most effective
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:07.480]  Remedy for the president, this is the constitutional
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:09.480]  Remedy, this is the little d-democratic
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:11.480]  Remedy, because it's the House members
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:13.480]  And senators that the voters
[1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:15.480]  Voted in this term that will be
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:17.480]  Hearing this, so that's why it's
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:19.480]  And that's why the president is very concerned
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:21.480]  With the Georgia vote, he needs both of those
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:23.480]  Senators and one of them came out
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:25.480]  Yesterday and said he will also
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:27.480]  Vote to object to electors
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:29.480]  If he is re-elected
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:31.480]  That is gigantic, because you called for that Friday
[1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:33.480]  Explain that, this is all
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:35.480]  Key, key legal parlance
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:37.480]  Correct, so Senator Perdue
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:39.480]  Is who's running for re-election
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.480]  In Georgia, in the Senate
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:43.480]  Yesterday confirmed that he will vote
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:45.480]  He will object to the electors
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:47.480]  Being certified from any state
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:49.480]  That did not have a constitutionally clean election
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:51.480]  And right now, that includes
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:53.480]  At least seven states
[1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:55.480]  And critically the big three
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:57.480]  Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:26:59.480]  But also Michigan, Pennsylvania
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:01.480]  And Nevada, and there's also some question
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:03.480]  In a suit filed in New Mexico
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:05.480]  Where electors of course have already
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:07.480]  Been sent from these states
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:09.480]  Through the Trump electors met
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:11.480]  And voted to send their electors to the
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:13.480]  President of the Senate as well
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:15.480]  So that he could assert his remedy in that regard
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.480]  So let me ask you this, what do we do
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:19.480]  To make sure this happens, what can we do
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:21.480]  March on D.C. the 6th, the 5th
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:23.480]  I think the 5th and 6th just everybody converge
[1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:25.480]  Folks, I've never, people always say march on D.C.
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:27.480]  This is it, if people don't get on a plane
[1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.480]  On a bus, on a train, if you don't
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:31.480]  Get there, then kiss your ass goodbye
[1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:33.480]  Yeah, the key is
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:35.480]  The Congress
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:37.480]  Has to see an unprecedented
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:39.480]  Massive will of people
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:41.480]  If they saw 10 million people
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:43.480]  They'll overturn this fraudstone election
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:45.480]  Because even Roberts is, quote, scared
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.480]  Of black lives matter, that's a paper tiger
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:49.480]  That'll represent black people, that's Lord Soros
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:51.480]  They need to see 10 million multi-racial
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:53.480]  Americans, 10 million Americans
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:55.480]  Would overturn the fraud, wouldn't it
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:57.480]  Absolutely, that's why
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:27:59.480]  The video you showed at the beginning of this
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:01.480]  Is the reason why the president put that out there
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:03.480]  It was, look, massive marches
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:05.480]  Democratic peaceful constitutional marches
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:07.480]  Supporting the constitutional remedy
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:09.480]  By a multi-racial group, multi-ethnic group
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:11.480]  Of people from all across the world
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:13.480]  And that's what he needs on Washington
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:15.480]  He needs the biggest show
[1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:17.480]  Of his supporters in history
[1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:19.480]  Showing demanding that they exercise
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:21.480]  Their constitutional duties and constitutional
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:23.480]  Obligations, and that's all anybody's asking for
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:25.480]  Stay there, this is so epic
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:27.480]  It's literally in our hands
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:29.480]  Yes, we're being blocked off by big tech
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:31.480]  Yes, they're censoring us, but we have all these radio stations
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:33.480]  Listeners, if you come to DC
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:35.480]  10 million of you, we win
[1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:37.480]  But it's literally up to us
[1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:39.480]  Ha ha, Barnes is not lying
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:41.480]  This is a big deal, Trump has said
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:43.480]  Save America, fight for the future
[1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:45.480]  Of the planet, come to DC
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  We'll play that little clip when we come back
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:49.480]  On the other side, for TV viewers
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:51.480]  It's powerful, radio listeners, it's okay
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:53.480]  The videos at infowars.com
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:55.480]  Twitter, Trump Save America
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:57.480]  Video
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:28:59.480]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition
[1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:01.480]  Of terrorism
[1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:03.480]  Other dictionaries have similar ones
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:05.480]  Terrorism is the threat
[1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.480]  Of force, or actually carrying out force
[1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:09.480]  For a political or
[1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:11.480]  Financial reason
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:13.480]  It's basically sharing the hell out of people
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:15.480]  Until you submit to them
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:17.480]  That's exactly what all this overblown
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:19.480]  COVID-19 garbage is
[1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:21.480]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:23.480]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:25.480]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:27.480]  They told us that
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:29.480]  Two and a half million people would be dead
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:31.480]  Just eight months ago
[1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:33.480]  Within three months, okay
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:35.480]  It's a quarter million if you count
[1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:37.480]  All of the people that died of other things
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:39.480]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:41.480]  These are real numbers, these are real facts
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:43.480]  This is the chicken little event
[1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:45.480]  We all run our houses, never come out
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:47.480]  And are taught we're not essential
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:49.480]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet
[1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:51.480]  You could stand up against it
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.480]  This is slavery
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:55.480]  It is not something you could put up with
[1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.480]  And survive
[1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.480]  The year 2021
[1:29:59.480 --> 1:30:01.480]  Is almost here
[1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:03.480]  And so we're launching our New Year's

[1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:49.480]  And I am committed to you to fight against
[1:30:49.480 --> 1:30:51.480]  The Globalist harder than ever
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:53.480]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight
[1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:55.480]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it
[1:30:57.480 --> 1:30:59.480]  The Globalists are taking control
[1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:01.480]  Of the entire human genome
[1:31:01.480 --> 1:31:03.480]  They are forcing mutations
[1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:05.480]  This is forced evolution
[1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:07.480]  Or de-evolution
[1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:09.480]  When you look at all the major research
[1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:11.480]  All the major programs are carrying out
[1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:13.480]  They are not to produce
[1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:15.480]  People that are smarter or folks that live longer
[1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:17.480]  Or are more moral
[1:31:17.480 --> 1:31:19.480]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity
[1:31:19.480 --> 1:31:21.480]  Now we see some propaganda like
[1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:23.480]  Communist China cracking
[1:31:23.480 --> 1:31:25.480]  Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines
[1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:27.480]  To make our soldiers Superman
[1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:29.480]  That's a way to make it sexy that
[1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:31.480]  Hey, we're experimenting on our troops
[1:31:31.480 --> 1:31:33.480]  We'll send things with that into our troops
[1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:35.480]  And thousands and thousands of died
[1:31:35.480 --> 1:31:37.480]  Each time they tried a new experimental vaccine
[1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:39.480]  I've talked to high level folks
[1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:41.480]  Inside the federal government
[1:31:41.480 --> 1:31:43.480]  They say Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people
[1:31:43.480 --> 1:31:45.480]  It's for a greater good
[1:31:45.480 --> 1:31:47.480]  But that's not even true
[1:31:47.480 --> 1:31:49.480]  And it violates the Geneva Convention
[1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:51.480]  The Nuremberg Code, federal state law
[1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:53.480]  This is violence being carried out against us
[1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:55.480]  And we have a right to resist it
[1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:57.480]  With any means necessary
[1:31:57.480 --> 1:31:59.480]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:01.480]  Is this the guy that called in
[1:32:01.480 --> 1:32:03.480]  About living defense?
[1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:05.480]  Yes sir, yes sir
[1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:07.480]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday
[1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:09.480]  When I heard you got that fresh shipment
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:11.480]  Of living defense in from Utah
[1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:13.480]  I said, man, I gotta get on that show
[1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:15.480]  And give him an update
[1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:17.480]  I said, if I ever get a chance
[1:32:17.480 --> 1:32:19.480]  To be on Alex Jones show
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:21.480]  I'm gonna tell the world about
[1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:23.480]  Living defense and what it did for me personally
[1:32:23.480 --> 1:32:25.480]  Now look, I'm 64 years old
[1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:27.480]  Going on 20
[1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:29.480]  Thanks to this info store
[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:31.480]  Product and by the way, I bought
[1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:33.480]  $800 worth the other night
[1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:35.480]  So I'm doing what I can brother
[1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:37.480]  So what my contention is
[1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:39.480]  Why don't we start this new year all
[1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:41.480]  Right with everybody getting
[1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:43.480]  Couple bottles of living defense
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:45.480]  Now you gotta follow that up with the
[1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:47.480]  Micro ZX, I learned that
[1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:49.480]  So it's like God working is so amazing
[1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:51.480]  We didn't know, we didn't screen
[1:32:51.480 --> 1:32:53.480]  Your call, we had no idea
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:55.480]  And I go to you a year later
[1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:57.480]  And you're here telling people about living defense
[1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.480]  Living defense, living defense
[1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:09.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:31.480]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes
[1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:33.480]  Is our guest
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:35.480]  I've been asking a lot of questions
[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:37.480]  He's been moving really quick
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:39.480]  But you heard him, he's been
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:41.480]  Quietly working for Trump
[1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:43.480]  Out there
[1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:45.480]  Across the country
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:47.480]  What are Trump's real changes
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:49.480]  And what are Trump's real changes
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:51.480]  And what are Trump's real changes
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:53.480]  And what are Trump's real changes
[1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:55.480]  And what are Trump's real changes
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:57.480]  And what are Trump's real changes
[1:33:57.480 --> 1:33:59.480]  And what are Trump's real changes
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.480]  What can we do
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:03.480]  What are the other major players
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:05.480]  What's the inside baseball
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:07.480]  On the Bidens and their Chycom connections
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:09.480]  I know you've got incredible knowledge
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:11.480]  Across a wide spectrum, one of the smartest people I know
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:13.480]  One of the most informed I know
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:15.480]  And the next segment we'll get into the vaccine
[1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:17.480]  Global lockdown too and how to fight that
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:19.480]  Robert Barnes
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:21.480]  So you go back, history tells the tale
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:23.480]  I mean you like to read and review history
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:25.480]  Alex, it's the same thing
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:27.480]  It's a normal controversy
[1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:29.480]  We had disputed electors sent from multiple states
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:31.480]  Some were sent by the official body
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:33.480]  That said the Republican one
[1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:35.480]  Some were sent unofficially
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:37.480]  Saying the Democrat one
[1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:39.480]  You had a split Congress
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:41.480]  You had Republicans control the Senate
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:43.480]  You had Democrats control the House
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:45.480]  And ultimately what happened
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:47.480]  Is through extended months of negotiation
[1:34:47.480 --> 1:34:49.480]  Because there was such a popular outpouring
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:51.480]  That in that case
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:53.480]  The Republican Rutherford B. Hayes
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:55.480]  They said had not legitimately won
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:57.480]  That in fact Samuel Tilden
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:34:59.480]  The Democrat they said had won
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:01.480]  That the mass outpouring forced Congress
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.480]  To deal with it and they would end up debating it
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:05.480]  For months, in fact back then
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:07.480]  Inauguration did not happen until
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:09.480]  March and they didn't have
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:11.480]  The final vote until 48 hours before
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:13.480]  Inauguration day
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:15.480]  So we know what this and in that context
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:17.480]  Ultimately an agreement was reached
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:19.480]  That allowed the Republican
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:21.480]  To get the presidency but the Democrats
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:23.480]  To get a whole bunch of other things
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:25.480]  Which included the withdrawal of troops from the South
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:27.480]  Which, you know, re-scripted
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:29.480]  The history of the country for the next 90 years
[1:35:29.480 --> 1:35:31.480]  So the reality is that
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:33.480]  That remedy shows that
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:35.480]  If Congress asserts its constitutional duties
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:37.480]  And obligations
[1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:39.480]  Then the president has a
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:41.480]  Clear fighting chance because both the facts
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:43.480]  And the law support him
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:45.480]  If you look at the facts, the facts are that
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:47.480]  There are three things that matter in an election
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:49.480]  Did the people who are qualified
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:51.480]  To vote, were they the only ones to vote
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:53.480]  Were the votes cast
[1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:55.480]  In a constitutional manner
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:57.480]  And third was the count
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:59.480]  Of the vote done in a constitutional
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.480]  Legal manner
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:03.480]  Here in all of the contested states
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:05.480]  Georgia, Arizona, Nevada
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:07.480]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:09.480]  And even to a certain degree
[1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:11.480]  New Mexico, there was
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:13.480]  Either votes who
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:15.480]  In fact, in all of them there were votes
[1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:17.480]  People who cast votes who were not qualified to vote
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:19.480]  In some cases because they were not citizens
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:21.480]  In some cases because they were too young
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:23.480]  In some cases because
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:25.480]  They claimed to be living in a mailbox
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:27.480]  In some cases because they
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:29.480]  Voted in another jurisdiction
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:31.480]  In some cases because they were registered
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:33.480]  To vote in another jurisdiction
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:35.480]  In some cases because they had already moved out of the state
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:37.480]  More than 30 days prior to the election
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:39.480]  So we have a bunch of people who are not
[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:41.480]  Qualified to vote, and of course
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:43.480]  Last but not least, there were plenty
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:45.480]  Of dead people who voted in these key states
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:47.480]  As the research showed from both Matt
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:49.480]  Brainerd and Richard Barris
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:51.480]  Of People's Pundit Daily
[1:36:51.480 --> 1:36:53.480]  The second component is
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:55.480]  Were there votes cast that were not cast
[1:36:55.480 --> 1:36:57.480]  In a constitutional manner
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.480]  What does that mean constitutional manner?
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:01.480]  Well, when it's the presidency
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:03.480]  The rules for the election have to be
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:05.480]  Only the rules set by the state
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:07.480]  Legislatures
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:09.480]  Under the electors clause, the state
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:11.480]  Legislatures exclusively determine
[1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:13.480]  In control how the presidential
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:15.480]  Vote takes place
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:17.480]  Isn't that the big enchilada
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:19.480]  That none of these states passed laws
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:21.480]  Just governors agree with democrats
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:23.480]  To accept these fraudulent ballots
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.480]  Absolutely, in fact it was the big problem
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:27.480]  Democrats had, how were they going to
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:29.480]  Steal the election when all the
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:31.480]  Legislatures in every single one of these states
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:33.480]  Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:35.480]  In all of those states
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:37.480]  They did not control the legislature
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.480]  And what they decided to do is
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:41.480]  Well, we're just going to ignore the legislature
[1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:43.480]  Consent decrees
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:45.480]  Exactly, they use law fair
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:47.480]  Selective law fair
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:49.480]  And people ask the lawyers the legislature
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:51.480]  They don't even know an agreement's being made
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:53.480]  Absolutely, the legislature wasn't
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:55.480]  Even a party, and by the way
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:57.480]  The way those rules are supposed to work
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:37:59.480]  Having been part of those lawsuits before
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:01.480]  You have to get the legislature to pass legislation
[1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:03.480]  I mean, I brought a big suit in California
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.480]  A bunch of counties, the rule was clear
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:07.480]  The only way that it could
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:09.480]  Constitutionally go through is the legislature
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:11.480]  Had to agree to the terms of the settlement
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:13.480]  And pass it as legislation
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:15.480]  But they don't, so it's a giant fraudulent
[1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:17.480]  I mean, here's the example
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:19.480]  You got to have the deed of your house to sell it
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:21.480]  It's like some group meets separate
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:23.480]  And just agrees that they own your house
[1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:25.480]  Absolutely
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:27.480]  The parties to the contract were the states
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:29.480]  And the agreement was, we all agree
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:31.480]  Only the state legislatures can pick the president
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:33.480]  And if somebody violates that
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:35.480]  Professor Dershowitz was on a
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.480]  Live show last night
[1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:39.480]  Saying that clearly you would have standing
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:41.480]  To bring a claim if the rules were reversed
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:43.480]  So why is the Supreme Court not doing it?
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:45.480]  I mean, do you think the story out of
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:47.480]  Texas legislature is true that
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:49.480]  Roberts was screaming at people and scared?
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:51.480]  That particular story is not likely to be true
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:53.480]  Because the Supreme Court's not meeting
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:55.480]  They're all working from home
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:57.480]  And so when they said they were in chambers
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:38:59.480]  I knew that story wasn't likely to be accurate
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:01.480]  But I think thematically
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:03.480]  There's truth to the story
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:05.480]  In the sense that people have interpreted
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:07.480]  Roberts in this way
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:09.480]  But I think the bigger problem was
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:11.480]  Mitch McConnell in the Republican establishment
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:13.480]  That was the other story to all of this
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.480]  You know, the Godfather line
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:17.480]  Who was Barzini all along
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:19.480]  There was no doubt that
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:21.480]  He has really showed his ass
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:23.480]  Excuse my French, I mean McConnell
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.480]  Has really screwed the poach here
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:27.480]  Why do you think he did that? Because his wife
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:29.480]  Is from the Chinese companies?
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:31.480]  Because he's an establishment guy
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:33.480]  He likes it when he can run the show
[1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:35.480]  Mitch McConnell sincerely believes
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:37.480]  He would have a docile person in the White House
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.480]  And control the House and the Senate
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:41.480]  But for Trump
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:43.480]  He lives in a fantasy world
[1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:45.480]  But this is the world that McConnell lives in
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:47.480]  And so he's disconnected from the political reality
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:49.480]  He thinks that there would
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:51.480]  So that's why
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:53.480]  And that's why he thinks Trump is still a hurdle
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:55.480]  And Trump is still a hindrance
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:57.480]  So for these guys it's all about their personal power
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:39:59.480]  And on America and our future and freedom
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:01.480]  It's about I'm big, I'm in charge
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:03.480]  So many Republicans
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:05.480]  Even McCarthy, you see on TV
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:07.480]  He looks like he's hired a kite right now
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:09.480]  Yes, I mean, there's no doubt about it
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:11.480]  They're all thrilled, I mean
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:13.480]  They think Biden is easy to work with
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:15.480]  Because Biden's been, you know, a go-along corrupt body
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.480]  Well, we want somebody not easy to work with
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:19.480]  To save the country
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:21.480]  Correct, exactly
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:23.480]  Someone who cares more about the country's interest
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:25.480]  Than any lobbying interest, than any corporate interest
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:27.480]  Than any country club interest
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:29.480]  Mitch McConnell would love the Republican Party
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:31.480]  What Trump always says, he says
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:33.480]  If I want the money, they give me 10 times Democrats
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:35.480]  They want me to sell you out
[1:40:35.480 --> 1:40:37.480]  He basically hasn't
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:39.480]  And that's why they're still pissed
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:41.480]  Exactly, he kept his word
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:43.480]  First president to keep his word in a long time
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:45.480]  He kept his word on trade, kept his word on war
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:47.480]  Kept his word on trying to bring people back home
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:49.480]  They're also waging war on him
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:51.480]  Because they don't want him to pardon Julian Assange
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:53.480]  They don't want him to pardon Edward Snowden
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:40:55.480]  That's why you're seeing what I'm saying
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:57.480]  We have two minutes to break, what would you do right now
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:40:59.480]  President, what should he do
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:01.480]  Resolute deaths, Americans at war
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.480]  Chai comms, enemies with him
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:05.480]  Should we rally the troops, not just put a tweet out
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:07.480]  Come to D.C. the sixth, we need to hear him
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:09.480]  Every night calling on 10 million to come to D.C.
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:11.480]  Absolutely
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:13.480]  And I think he should start to reach out directly to the country
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:15.480]  The reality is he can use his own periscope
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:17.480]  His own Twitter feed, his own social media
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:19.480]  His own YouTube, however he wants
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:21.480]  And I think that he should start to reach out
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:23.480]  Directly to them
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:25.480]  And just lay this out for folks
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:27.480]  We know that the election was stolen
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:29.480]  He did that good speech about a week and a half ago
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:31.480]  That was really well done
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:33.480]  What pressure on Congress to not accept these fake electors
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:35.480]  And accept ours
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:37.480]  He called on the people to take action
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:39.480]  It would be incredible
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:41.480]  Absolutely, and I think he should do it
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.480]  I think he should start to do it every day
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:45.480]  I think he should pardon Julian Assange and Ed Snowden
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:47.480]  To send a message to the deep state
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:49.480]  I think he should do it on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:51.480]  I think it's perfectly timed
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.480]  And then right after that he should start building
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:55.480]  New Washington D.C.
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:57.480]  For a constitutional democratic remedy
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:41:59.480]  For the Constitution to be upheld and affirmed
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:01.480]  By Congress doing its duty
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:03.480]  And fulfilling its obligation
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:05.480]  And just making
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:07.480]  At least allow a hearing, at least allow a presentation
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:09.480]  Of evidence to be done
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:11.480]  At least create a congressional record
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:13.480]  And force them to vote
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:15.480]  So that if it turns out there's people that are traders
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:17.480]  At least we know who they are
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:19.480]  And we can primary them in the future
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:21.480]  And build a Trumpism for the next four years
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:23.480]  That's always Trump
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:25.480]  Plan for the worst, hope for the best
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:27.480]  Well, Trump does have nine lives
[1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:29.480]  And always has a trick up his sleeve
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:31.480]  And so I expect to see some real movement
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:33.480]  Look at all these Chinese companies on the stock market
[1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:35.480]  On a ban list
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.480]  What else is coming?
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:39.480]  So let's talk about the six, the big rally coming up
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:41.480]  Let's talk about what else we can do
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:43.480]  What we expect from Trump with Barnes
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:45.480]  And a little bit on the lockdown too
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:47.480]  And the globalism and COVID
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:49.480]  On the final segment
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:51.480]  With Owen Schreuer is Tom Pappert tonight
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:53.480]  And he's got a special guest
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:43:22.480]  Joining him from the defensive intelligence agency
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:24.480]  We're bringing in the same amount of money
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:26.480]  We brought in last December
[1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:28.480]  Right now, this is our most important month
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:30.480]  To be able to fund ourselves in the next year
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:32.480]  And I understand the economy is shut down
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:34.480]  I understand there's not as much money as there used to be
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:36.480]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:38.480]  But info wars really need your support
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:40.480]  You just buy great items
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.480]  Do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:44.480]  With huge sales, amazing products
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:46.480]  And then you know you're funding the info war
[1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:48.480]  And not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:50.480]  And the globalists that are openly trying
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:52.480]  Small businesses continue to fund
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:54.480]  The Second American Revolution
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:56.480]  While getting great products at the same time
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:43:58.480]  At infowarstore.com. Thank you
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:00.480]  Fox has betrayed President Trump
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:02.480]  As I predicted they would
[1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:04.480]  They've always been part of the establishment
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:06.480]  And it's only going to get worse
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:08.480]  If they're able to keep Trump from
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:10.480]  Rightfully taking office for a second term
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:12.480]  On the 20th, the system is going to drop
[1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:14.480]  The hammer harder than ever
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:16.480]  On this republic they are going to explode gas prices
[1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:18.480]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:20.480]  They're going to cut off the energy source
[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:22.480]  To the U.S. So it's impossible
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:24.480]  For factories to move back here
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:26.480]  This is economic domination
[1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:28.480]  This is economic war
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:30.480]  We're being consolidated, we're being taken over
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:32.480]  The democrats aren't mismanaging
[1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:34.480]  Their blue cities and states
[1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:36.480]  They're consolidating power and control
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:38.480]  To bankrupt the population and bring them
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:40.480]  Absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:42.480]  Of all the infrastructure and property
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:44.480]  This gives a monopolistic takeover
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:46.480]  That's what the great reset is
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:48.480]  And these other criminals admit it
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:50.480]  That's what social distancing is
[1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:52.480]  So your business is only 25%
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:54.480]  For several more years, no small businesses
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:56.480]  Will be there. This is a master plan
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:18.480]  Say no.
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:28.480]  Well brother, we put more in this
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:30.480]  Than any other long term high quality
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:32.480]  Energy powder there is
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:34.480]  So this was designed on one of the top guys
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:36.480]  In the country, he didn't want his name on it
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:38.480]  Because obviously the political issues
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:40.480]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:42.480]  Just for the design of it
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:44.480]  And we believe it is the best, strongest
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:46.480]  But healthiest energy out there
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:48.480]  And you're saying that it's made your life better
[1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:50.480]  So that means a lot to me, thank you
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:52.480]  Thank you.
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:56.480]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:24.480]  Thank you.
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:54.480]  We must stand up and declare
[1:46:54.480 --> 1:47:20.480]  Basic God-given human rights now.
[1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:22.480]  Well, we are the tip and the spear
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:24.480]  We have the power to do everything
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:26.480]  I'm very honored to be here
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:28.480]  And it is you the listeners and viewers
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:30.480]  That keep us like gravity
[1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:32.480]  In the universe, in position
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:34.480]  So everything I owe to you
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:36.480]  And God that influenced you to support us
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:38.480]  To the end of the day, I thank God
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:40.480]  But God works through you
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:42.480]  All right, Barnes, you could talk
[1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:44.480]  For five hours about the lockdown
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:46.480]  About the COVID
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:48.480]  You were on with us 11 months ago
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:50.480]  And this all started saying
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.480]  The mRNA vaccine isn't a vaccine
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:54.480]  This is genetic takeover
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:56.480]  And now it's here
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:47:58.480]  What do you make of this?
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:00.480]  What can we do?
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:02.480]  Where do you think it's going?
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:04.480]  So two things, one, they're clearly
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:06.480]  I've been hearing a lot of inquiries
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  For potential clients
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:10.480]  That governments are going to start
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:12.480]  Mandating it as a condition of employment
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:14.480]  Employers are going to start
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:16.480]  Mandating it as a condition of employment
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:18.480]  Airlines conditionate
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:20.480]  The EOC just came out as you know
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:22.480]  And said your employer can
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:24.480]  Make you take something that genetically
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:26.480]  Re-engineers your body
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:28.480]  That's like an employer saying
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:30.480]  You have to have sex with the boss
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:32.480]  That's his semen, that's gross
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:34.480]  That's potentially harmful
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:36.480]  What about Bill Gates' mRNA
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:38.480]  Injected into my body? That's beyond rape
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:40.480]  Not only that, I mean
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:42.480]  My hometown in Chattanooga, a nurse took it
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:44.480]  And fainted a little bit long there
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:46.480]  Just by a few minutes afterwards
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:48.480]  I'm going to be taking the vaccines now
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:50.480]  Into people having allergic and other reactions to it
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:52.480]  And folks remember this is a rushed emergency
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:54.480]  Vaccine
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:56.480]  Which is just a drug, they call it a vaccine
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:48:58.480]  I don't mean to interrupt you, I'm trying to be gross
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:00.480]  I don't want to be raped
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:02.480]  I don't want my daughters raped
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:04.480]  I'm saying it's an mRNA
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:06.480]  That, like semen
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:08.480]  Programs an egg
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:10.480]  It's the only thing you can program as an egg
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:12.480]  But an mRNA
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:14.480]  Can program every cell in the body
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:16.480]  Literally something that reprograms me
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:18.480]  Like I'm an egg and it's semen
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:20.480]  This is super creepy, I'm talking about
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:22.480]  Science here Bob, this is freaking me out
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:24.480]  Well it reminds me
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:26.480]  Of forced sterilization in eugenics
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:28.480]  I mean it's a manipulation
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:30.480]  Of the body to try to change
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:32.480]  The species
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:34.480]  As a species
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:36.480]  And not only that
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:38.480]  We've never had a successful coronavirus vaccine
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:40.480]  We've never really had a consistently successful flu vaccine
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:42.480]  And the last time we rushed a vaccine
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:44.480]  Led to the disaster
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:46.480]  Of 1976
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:48.480]  Where people ended up, or a lot more people
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:50.480]  Ended up getting hurt and harmed
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:52.480]  By the vaccine, by the drug
[1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:54.480]  Because that's what it is, it's just a drug
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:56.480]  With a nice label on it, vaccine
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:49:58.480]  With the, then
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:00.480]  Actually were harmed by the virus
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:02.480]  So the, but what I'm doing
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:04.480]  Is I'm going to be working with Robert Kennedy Jr
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.480]  To coordinate a legal
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:08.480]  And political reform attack
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:10.480]  On these forced vaccines
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:12.480]  At every level, and there's, there may be
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:14.480]  HIPAA lawsuits we can bring
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:16.480]  To challenge whether they can really inquire
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:18.480]  Into your medical records as a condition of employment
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:20.480]  We're going to be looking into whether or not
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:22.480]  Some of it violates anti-disability
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:24.480]  Discrimination laws
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:26.480]  Because that aspects for certain people
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:28.480]  That are allergic or have other potential
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:30.480]  Risk reactions to it, that could include
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.480]  A psychological reaction to it
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:34.480]  In my view, so I think that they're discriminating
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:36.480]  Totally agreeable, let's just go back here
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:38.480]  The British government, once they did one week
[1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:40.480]  Problem, so many convulsions
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:42.480]  They said kids shouldn't take it
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:44.480]  Pregnant women shouldn't take it
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:46.480]  If you have an allergic background don't take it
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:48.480]  The idea that everybody's got to take this is insane
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:50.480]  Completely, and not only that
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:52.480]  Doesn't even make sense on its own terms
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:54.480]  In other words, first of all this is a virus
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:56.480]  That's not very risky, this is not smallpox
[1:50:56.480 --> 1:50:58.480]  This is not, this is not polio
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:00.480]  This is a virus that poses very little risk
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:02.480]  To 90% of the population
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:04.480]  Has a 99% plus success
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:06.480]  I agree, so what is the larger fear
[1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:08.480]  Mongering about, what is this big crazy push?
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:10.480]  Well this is what we talked about from the very beginning
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:12.480]  That this whole campaign was about
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:14.480]  Inducing such a state of fear
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:16.480]  And despair that people would beg
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:18.480]  For a vaccine backed by Bill Gates
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:20.480]  Because this is part of Gates's
[1:51:20.480 --> 1:51:22.480]  Longer term broader agenda
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:24.480]  So it's just all about they have the power
[1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:26.480]  To put in us what they want when they want
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:28.480]  And they don't care if there's damage
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:30.480]  They just want us to give up
[1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:32.480]  And if they can control your body
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:34.480]  And invade your body and put any chemical
[1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:36.480]  They want in your body as a condition
[1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:38.480]  Of employment or simple transportation
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:40.480]  Or simple education
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:42.480]  Then they can do anything else, there's no limits
[1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:44.480]  I mean once they broach
[1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:46.480]  Once they cross that Rubicon
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:48.480]  Then that's the last Rubicon that protects
[1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:50.480]  Individuality from the control
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:52.480]  And because it was announced as an emergency
[1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:54.480]  By the government, something Trump shouldn't have done
[1:51:54.480 --> 1:51:56.480]  Now they feel like they have liability protection
[1:51:56.480 --> 1:51:58.480]  Who cares how many people are damaged
[1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:00.480]  Absolutely, and this is why it was worldwide
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.480]  This is why it continued even after
[1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:04.480]  They thought Biden won
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:06.480]  This is why it was done throughout the entire world
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:08.480]  This was Bill Gates
[1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:10.480]  Co-opting the public health authorities
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:12.480]  Into his goal and agenda, and I'm sure he couldn't
[1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:14.480]  Be more thrilled right now
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:16.480]  This is clearly his objective
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:18.480]  But as you put up with that video earlier
[1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:20.480]  There's a reason why Gates was saying
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:22.480]  That everybody was going to have to be indemnified
[1:52:22.480 --> 1:52:24.480]  Because he knows it's going to cause a bunch of harm
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:26.480]  He knows it's going to kill people
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:28.480]  He knows it's going to cause more harm to the virus
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:30.480]  Let's go back to the right thing
[1:52:30.480 --> 1:52:32.480]  The vaccine gives you a broken
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:34.480]  Failed bacteria or virus
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:36.480]  And then you learn how to beat it
[1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:38.480]  It can have its own problem
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:40.480]  It can be contaminated
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:42.480]  They can trojan horse it, it's still got a bad history
[1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:44.480]  But this mRNA is a nanotech
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:46.480]  That programs your cells
[1:52:46.480 --> 1:52:48.480]  To create
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:50.480]  An antibody to a basic protein
[1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:52.480]  And then they, I mean
[1:52:52.480 --> 1:52:54.480]  This is just like, this is such a bold power grab
[1:52:56.480 --> 1:52:58.480]  Oh yeah, and then you combine Andrew Yang
[1:52:58.480 --> 1:53:00.480]  Thinking about some way to certify this
[1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:02.480]  And it sounds very much like the quantum tattoo
[1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:04.480]  That Bill Gates has designed
[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:06.480]  That's designed to put a chip in you
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:08.480]  To see what vaccines you've had
[1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:10.480]  And haven't had, that can release
[1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:12.480]  That has remote control capabilities
[1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:14.480]  As he himself bragged about its possibility
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:16.480]  Why do you need remote control capabilities
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:18.480]  For yourself, for something that's inside you?
[1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:20.480]  Well, our team was asking
[1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:22.480]  Where did Andrew Yang get this idea?
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:24.480]  Well, how about not Adolf Hitler
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:26.480]  But Gigi Ping, Gigi Ping says
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:28.480]  Global ID, global app, global control
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:32.480]  Absolutely, I mean this is very much the Chinese model
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:34.480]  Just as the Chinese have co-opted Big Tech
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:36.480]  To pursue their social credit model
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:38.480]  Effectively in the way Big Tech
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:40.480]  Censorship and suppression works
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:42.480]  Is this is the model, I mean they were the ones
[1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:44.480]  Who gave us the whole model, they had the virus
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:46.480]  They were the ones who helped spread the virus
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:48.480]  By the way, they responded to it
[1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:50.480]  And then they likely manufactured the virus
[1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:52.480]  And then they manufactured the lockdown response
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:54.480]  And then they were pushing this vaccine answer
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:53:56.480]  So this is a Chinese model
[1:53:56.480 --> 1:53:58.480]  That we've never adopted before
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:00.480]  We've never done this in response to a flu virus before
[1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:02.480]  We've never rushed a vaccine as the solution
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:04.480]  Aside from 1976
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:06.480]  Which was such a disaster
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:08.480]  We promised never to repeat that again
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:10.480]  And yet here we are repeating that again
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:12.480]  And for a far less dangerous virus
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.480]  Than that virus had the
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:16.480]  Inflatality problem
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:18.480]  And again, you're a lawyer but I can look at this
[1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:20.480]  This has bad reactions hundreds of times
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:22.480]  It's like they don't care
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:24.480]  Why do they want to do this, why don't
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:26.480]  It doesn't even protect us, like you said
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:28.480]  It's not even very dangerous, the COVID
[1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:30.480]  It's just a giant power grab
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:32.480]  Two things, one, Bill Gates now has a green light
[1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:34.480]  For any and every vaccine he ever wants to do
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:36.480]  And he wants to vaccinate the world
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:38.480]  And control the world through vaccines
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:40.480]  And he admits that, this is no, you know
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:42.480]  This isn't news
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:44.480]  And then the second, he's just achieved it at a record level
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:46.480]  That's why he spent all that money to co-opt
[1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:48.480]  Every public health authority in the entire world
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:50.480]  I mean, Ray, he donates as much money
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:52.480]  As the United States does to the World Health Organization
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:54.480]  The tied number one donor
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:56.480]  To the World Health Organization
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:58.480]  And this is why, to achieve
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:55:00.480]  And obtain this objective that's been decades in the making
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:02.480]  And then the second part is
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:04.480]  It's at a degree of social control
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.480]  That dictatorial politicians and tyrannical politicians
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:08.480]  Couldn't even imagine getting
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:10.480]  Even in the worst crisis of war
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:12.480]  The worst crisis of terrorism
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:14.480]  The worst crisis of crime
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:16.480]  They were never able to attain and achieve the degree they
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:18.480]  So where, you know, cops are busy
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:20.480]  Pulling people off of skating rinks in Canada
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:22.480]  And arresting them
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:24.480]  And threatening to taze them
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:26.480]  I mean, that's how insane this is
[1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:28.480]  People ask, what's the point? Why did the Soviets attack?
[1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:30.480]  Why did the Nazis attack people?
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:32.480]  Because it's their will
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:34.480]  If they want to dominate
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:36.480]  They want control, it's rape
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:38.480]  They are raping us
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:40.480]  It doesn't matter if the science says it's bad
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:42.480]  It doesn't matter if it doesn't protect us
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:44.480]  They want that power over our bodies
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:46.480]  This is big government, big corporations
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:48.480]  That are perverts that are getting off
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:50.480]  On this giant sick event
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:52.480]  And they get to control people's bodies
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:54.480]  At any mass level
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:56.480]  And once you do that, you have complete control over a person
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:55:58.480]  And you're just rape them with this stuff
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:00.480]  You track them, you control them
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:02.480]  You control where they go
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:04.480]  Of how much abuse you allow them to engage in
[1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:06.480]  This is like
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:08.480]  It the clown part five or something
[1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:12.480]  And you condition them to accept various things
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:14.480]  In their body for these purposes
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:16.480]  You're doing this to protect grandma
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:18.480]  You're doing this to protect kids
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:20.480]  And you then get liability protection
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:22.480]  Trump's biggest failure is going along with this
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:24.480]  He needs to come out against it
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:26.480]  He came out against the mass
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:28.480]  He came out against the lockdowns
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:30.480]  He thinks the vaccine is his biggest achievement
[1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:32.480]  I think this is Trump's Achilles heel in closing
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:34.480]  Yeah, I think it was
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:36.480]  I think it was another place where his advisors betrayed him
[1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:38.480]  Told him, hey, if you take this path, you'll get reelected
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:40.480]  Clearly that was not the correct advice
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:42.480]  He would have been better off had he never pursued
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:44.480]  Or gone along with this
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:46.480]  If he had never gone along with the lockdowns
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:48.480]  He wins outside of the margin of fraud
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:50.480]  If he had not gone along with Bill Gates' agenda
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:52.480]  He wins outside the margin of fraud
[1:56:52.480 --> 1:56:54.480]  If he would have created that vaccination committee
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.480]  Paneled by Robert Kennedy
[1:56:56.480 --> 1:56:58.480]  He would have won outside the margin of fraud
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:00.480]  But unfortunately he got ambushed
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:02.480]  By his own advisors
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:04.480]  You're going to be co-hosting Owen Troyer
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:06.480]  On Tuesday, Robert Barnes
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:08.480]  Find him on Twitter, Barnes Law right there
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:10.480]  Thank you so much, incredible job, sir
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:12.480]  Hey, happy to be here, Alex
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:14.480]  Wow, powerful hour
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:16.480]  That was amazing
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:18.480]  All right, Tom Papert takes over
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:20.480]  For two hours straight
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:22.480]  Normally Owen Troyer does it, but he's hosting tomorrow
[1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:24.480]  I'll be hosting at 8 a.m.
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:26.480]  The new show
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:28.480]  American Journal with a bunch of your phone calls
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:30.480]  And then Owen's going to host my show
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:32.480]  Because I've got a bunch of work to do around here
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:34.480]  A busy elf
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:36.480]  Infowars.com
[1:57:36.480 --> 1:57:38.480]  Newswars.com
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:40.480]  You just got the inside scoop
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:42.480]  One of the main lawyers advising the president
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:58:10.480]  He went ahead to admit it that on air
[1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:12.480]  Admit that they're doing it for power
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:14.480]  And control
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:16.480]  And that they're not even worried about COVID-19
[1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:18.480]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:20.480]  Think about how insane that is
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:22.480]  Owen, big tech's got to track you
[1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:24.480]  They've got to trace you, they've got to control you
[1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:26.480]  You've got to have absolutely your house
[1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:28.480]  Why, you've got to have secret police come
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:30.480]  Disappear you because
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:32.480]  My God, this thing has 110 to 1% chance
[1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:34.480]  Of killing you, give your ability
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:36.480]  To cancer or heart attack
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:38.480]  This is their takeover
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:40.480]  Imagine on America's death certificate
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:42.480]  Killed by the fear of the common cold
[1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:44.480]  Yeah, that's fair monitoring
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:59:10.480]  That's my control
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:36.480]  Take a look at this
[1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:41.680]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
